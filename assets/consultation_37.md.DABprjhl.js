We describe our experience with creating and developing an ongoing Community Stakeholder Committee to guide lung health research for disease prevention and healthcare improvement. This committee is central to the integrated knowledge translation approach of Legacy for Airway Health, which is dedicated to preventing and improving care for lung diseases. Patient engagement in research (PEIR) aims to improve the relevance, quality, and implementation of research activities. Meaningful patient and community engagement in research remains challenging to implement. The committee was established in October 2019, just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and quickly adapted from in-person to virtual engagement activities. This change led to an increased focus on relationship-building and mutual support alongside other research and training activities. We conducted a baseline evaluation survey after one year (October 2020) using a modified version of the Patient Engagement in Research Scale (PEIRS-22). While individual scores suggested varied levels of meaningful engagement within the committee, overall results indicated strong personal relationships and a sense of feeling valued and respected, as well as a desire for increased opportunities to contribute to research within the program. Overall, this experience offers lessons learned about the importance of spending time and effort to build relationships, particularly in a virtual context, and shows that meaningful engagement can be done even when personal contact is limited. These efforts are illustrated in successful grant applications, research involvement, and stronger personal relationships.","output":"Better together: Launching and nurturing a Community Stakeholder Committee to enhance care and research for asthma and COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic in March 2020. After confirming the first case, the Ethiopian government has been working a lot to prevent transmission. Most of the reported cases were identified from traveling abroad. Effective prevention and control practices depend on awareness and compliance among the population at all levels. The main objective of this study is to determine the knowledge level and its association with sources of information towards COVID-19 and its prevention techniques in the Gedeo Zone of Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: There are 10 knowledge questions regarding COVID-19 and its prevention techniques. The maximum knowledge score for each question was 1 and the minimum 0, where 0 was scored for incorrect and 1 for correct answers. The overall knowledge score ranges from 0 to 10, where a score of 0-5 as poor knowledge and a score from 6-10 as good knowledge. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. The adjusted odds ratio with their 95% CI was used to show the strength of association. p Value < .05 was used to declare a statistically significant association. RESULTS: Among 1170 study participants, 58.1% of the study participants were male. Protestant constitutes 50.6% of the study participants in religion. Regarding knowledge level, 60.5% have good knowledge about COVID-19 and its prevention techniques. Concerning sources of information about COVID-19 and its prevention; internet, family/peer, religious and health workers contributes less <20% whereas telecommunication and television/Radio contributes the largest 56.1% and 85.8% as a source of information respectively. Internet as a source of information AOR: 1.99 (CI: 1.05-3.78, p = .034), information from health worker AOR: 2.324 (CI: 1.228-4.397, p = .010) and information from television or radio AOR: 2.737 (CI: 1.471-5.092, p = .001) has been significantly associated with good knowledge with p value < .05. CONCLUSION: Sources of information had a significant association on the level of knowledge. Residents who had internet, television/radio, and health workers as their information sources had better knowledge regarding COVID-19 and its prevention. Based on this, we recommend increasing internet access, television and radio service, and public health education by trained health workers for effective approaches to fight COVID-19.","output":"Knowledge of COVID-19 and its prevention among residents of the Gedeo zone, South Ethiopia.

One such choice is whether to colocate activities, services, or personnel. Prior research, including in healthcare, has reported that colocation yields benefits. However, these benefits may need to be balanced with higher costs of colocation (e.g., due to operational constraints). Thus, it is critical to understand not only whether colocation makes a difference but also under what circumstances it is most beneficial, and the mechanisms through which those benefits are realized. We consider colocation in the context of healthcare services, and ask: Does colocation of mental and physical health resources improve patient outcomes? This colocation is important, as primary care serves as a gateway to address mental health concerns and referrals to specialists. We next study colocation's relationship with two important operational variables: continuity of care (CoC) with a provider, and patient severity. Finally, we examine the mediating role of patients' no-shows and medication adherence in the colocation-outcomes relationship. As America's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration offers us an excellent setting to study these questions. We analyze over 300,000 patients C over an eleven-year period C who suffer from diabetes, a chronic condition, and show evidence of mental illness. We use an empirical approach to quantify the relationship between colocation and four key outcomes attributable to mental illness: hospitalizations, length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmissions, and suicidal behavior. We find that colocation is associated with improvement in outcomes. For example, a one standard deviation increase in the mean colocation measure is related to a 2.4% decrease in LOS C equivalent to an annual savings of approximately $1.5 million, on average, just for our cohort. In addition, we find that colocation and CoC are substitutes, in that colocation benefits patients whose care is fragmented. Further, we find that colocation offers greater benefits to patients whose mental health conditions are more severe. Finally, our analysis reveals that colocation improves outcomes (partially) through a reduction in the no-show rate and an increase in medication adherence. Our findings are validated by extensive robustness checks and sensitivity analyses. Our study has implications for both the theory and practice of healthcare operations. Theoretically, we advance the location literature, establish its connection with the continuity literature, and highlight key moderators and mediators in the colocation-outcomes relationship. Practically, our work offers insights into how to design an operationally efficient system and, in settings with limited resources, where to target colocation. Our study is particularly timely as it may help address the growing mental health crisis in America and around the world, further exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"How and in What Ways Does Colocation of Services Matter?

Here, we report a stepwise protocol for an RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for rapid and naked-eye molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. The test employs a unique dual-prong approach that integrates nucleic acid (NA) amplification and plasmonic sensing for point-of-care detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a sample-to-assay response time of <1 h. The RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test utilizes plasmonic gold nanoparticles capped with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a colorimetric reporter to detect the amplified nucleic acid from the COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. The ASOs are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, and binding of the ASOs to their target sequence results in the aggregation of the plasmonic gold nanoparticles. This highly specific agglomeration step leads to a change in the plasmonic response of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, when tested using clinical samples, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be >98.4%, >96.6% and 100%, respectively, with a detection limit of 10 copies/L. The test can easily be adapted to diagnose other viral infections with a simple modification of the ASOs and primer sequences. It also provides a low-cost, rapid approach requiring minimal instrumentation that can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at point-of-care settings in resource-poor situations. The colorimetric readout of the test can even be monitored using a handheld optical reader to obtain a quantitative response. Therefore, we anticipate that this protocol will be widely useful for the development of biosensors for the molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.","output":"RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for point-of-care clinical diagnosis of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neuroendocrine hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) is an interstitial lung disease (ILD) of unknown etiology, which develops in infancy and manifests as persistent tachypnea Objective of the research: to summarize results of observations of patients with NEHI, including during the pandemic of a new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) Materials and methods: clinical and follow-up observation, laboratory and instrumental examination, including lung biopsy, 52 children with NEHI aged from 21 days to 10 years Results: NEHI more often affects boys in the first 6 months of life;can be diagnosed on the basis of pediatric ILD-syndrome detection;specific CT signs, lung biopsy It is characterized by undulating course with increased respiratory failurec aused by acute respiratory viral infections, COVID-19;half of the patients need oxygen therapy","output":"Issues of diagnosis and management of patients with neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of opioid drugs and related overdose deaths, which rose to epidemic proportions over the past decade, have been exacerbated by the COVID pandemic, a time of great uncertainty and isolation.

We expected fear of aging-related diseases and fear of loneliness in old age to be related to lower ideal life expectancies. We expected fear of death to be related to higher ideal life expectancies.

We furthermore found significant interactions among the fears, indicating that individuals fearing diseases or loneliness but being unafraid of death opted for the shortest lives. Our results indicate that fears regarding life in very old age might be associated with the wish to avoid this age period; the fear of death was however associated with the wish for particularly long lives, and thus, with distancing oneself from the dreaded event of death.

An online questionnaire was sent on 31 April 2020. Blood samples from 20% sample of patients were drawn for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were divided based on autoimmune (AI) diagnosis. Prevalence of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab and by serology (seroprevalence) was compared to national data. Risk factors for infection of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed. RESULTS: The study group included 1204 patients, 74.5% had an AI diagnosis. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.16% in the rheumatologic patient population and 0.22% in the AI group, which was not different from prevalence in Israel on 4 May 2020 (0.18%, P = 0.912 and P = 0.759 respectively).

Therefore, according to treatment guidelines, two thirds of all individuals with depression are insufficiently treated. In the past, the subjective perspective of people who (do not) make use of mental health services has been neglected. Factors related to the use of health services are described in Andersens Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (ABM). The aim of this study is to supplement operationalizations of subjectively perceived and evaluated individual characteristics in the ABM and to evaluate whether the supplemented model can better explain mental health services use in individuals with depression than established operationalizations. METHODS: A representative telephone study with two measurement points will be conducted. In an explanatory mixed-methods design, qualitative interviews will be added to further interpret the quantitative data. A nationwide sample scoring 5 or more on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be recruited and interviewed via telephone at T0 and 12 months later (T1). Data on established and subjective characteristics as well as mental health service use will be collected. At T1, conducting a diagnostic interview (Composite International Diagnostic Interview, DIA-X-12/M-CIDI) enables the recording of 12-month diagnoses according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Ideally, n = 768 datasets will be available and analyzed descriptively by means of regression analysis. Up to n = 32 persons who use or do not use depression-specific health services incongruent with their objective or subjective needs will be interviewed (face-to-face) to better explain their behavior. In addition, theories of non-need-based mental health service use are developed within the framework of the grounded theory-based analysis of the qualitative interviews. DISCUSSION: The study intends to contribute to the theoretical foundation of health services research and to specify the characteristics described in the ABM. Thus, after completion of the study, a further sophisticated and empirically tested model will be available to explain mental health services.

Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019C2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019C2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk perception. We find that the 2019C2020 ILI season is smaller and decreases earlier than expected based on prior influenza seasons, and that the increase in COVID-19 risk perception is associated with this decrease. Additionally, we find that a 5% average reduction in transmission is sufficient to reproduce the observed flu dynamics. We propose that precautionary behaviors driven by COVID-19 risk perception or increased isolation driven by undetected COVID-19 spread dampened the influenza season. We suggest that when surveillance for a novel pathogen is limited, surveillance streams of co-circulating infections may provide a signal.","output":"Assessing the interactions between COVID-19 and influenza in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination has recently been reported to health authorities in the United States and other countries.

Although the number of cases reported have been small in comparison with the large number of people vaccinated, myocarditis may be a rare adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccination that is now only becoming apparent due to the widespread use of the vaccine. In this article, we present a case of a 20-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. He had received the BNT162b2 vaccine two days prior to his presentation to the ED. The patient had an elevated troponin at 89 ng/L which increased on repeat examination. His electrocardiogram showed diffuse concave ST segment elevations and a later MRI confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis. The patient had a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 approximately two months prior to the onset of his symptoms, but since he had fully recovered before the time of his presentation to the ED, it is unlikely that the infection caused the myocarditis.

METHODS: Test data for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 from national surveillance systems between 20 January 2020 and 25 April 2020 were used to estimate influenza infection on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A test-negative design was used to assess the odds of SARS-CoV-2 in those who tested positive for influenza compared with those who tested negative. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 was also assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: The risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 58% lower among influenza-positive cases and patients with a coinfection had a risk of death of 5.92 (95% confidence interval: 3.21C10.91) times greater than among those with neither influenza nor SARS-CoV-2.

Our comprehensive methodology incorporates the effect of false negative and positive rates to accurately determine not only the efficiency of pooling but also it's accuracy. Under various plausible scenarios, we show that this approach significantly reduces the cost of testing and also reduces the effective false positive rate of tests when compared to a strategy of testing every individual of a population.

Identification of the cellular response mechanisms to viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 may shed light on progress of the disease, indicate potential drug targets, and make design of new test methods possible. In this study, we analysed transcriptomic response of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) to SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the response to H1N1 infection. Comparison of transcriptome of NHBE cells 24 hours after mock-infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated that most genes that respond to infection were upregulated (320 genes) rather than being downregulated (115 genes).While upregulated genes were enriched in signalling pathways related to virus response, downregulated genes are related to kidney development. We mapped the upregulated genes on KEGG pathways to identify the mechanisms that mediate the response. We identified canonical NFB, TNF and IL-17 pathways to be significantly upregulated and to converge to NFB pathway via positive feedback loops. Although virus entry protein ACE2 has low expression in NHBE cells, pathogen response pathways are strongly activated within 24 hours of infection. Our results also indicate that immune response system is activated at the early stage of the infection and orchestrated by a crosstalk of signalling pathways. Finally, we compared transcriptomic SARS-CoV-2 response to H1N1 response in NHBE cells to elucidate the virus specificity of the response and virus specific extracellular proteins expressed by NHBE cells.","output":"Transcriptional response of signalling pathways to SARS-CoV-2 infection in normal human bronchial epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aims at identifying the perceptions of using blended learning during COVID 19 Pandemic in Jordan as reported by secondary school teachers in Jordan It also aims at investigating the possible significant differences in those perceptions attributed to gender and school type (government schools, private schools) A quantitative method was adopted in which a questionnaire was used to collect the data from (161) science teachers (92 females and 69 male teachers) working at secondary schools at Karak governorate The questionnaire has been distributed to 147 science teachers from public schools and 14 teachers from private schools The results of this study revealed medium degree of using blended learning among the participants It also showed no statistically significant differences attributed to the gender variable and the type of school ? 2020 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi","output":"Using blended learning during COVID-19: The perceptions of school teachers in Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Individuals aged 70+ were most threatened by COVID-19 and most targeted by shielding recommendations.

In recent times, data fusion in the healthcare sector becomes a challenging issue, and it needs to be resolved. At the same time, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the injury of blood vessels on the brain cells, which is mainly liable for stroke. X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans are widely applied for locating the haemorrhage position and size. Since manual segmentation of the CT scans by planimetry by the use of radiologists is a time-consuming process, deep learning (DL) is used to attain effective ICH diagnosis performance. This paper presents an automated intracerebral haemorrhage diagnosis using fusion-based deep learning with swarm intelligence (AICH-FDLSI) algorithm. The AICH-FDLSI model operates on four major stages namely preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. To begin with, the input image is preprocessed using the median filtering (MF) technique to remove the noise present in the image. Next, the seagull optimization algorithm (SOA) with Otsu multilevel thresholding is employed for image segmentation. In addition, the fusion-based feature extraction model using the Capsule Network (CapsNet) and EfficientNet is applied to extract a useful set of features. Moreover, deer hunting optimization (DHO) algorithm is utilized for the hyperparameter optimization of the CapsNet and DenseNet models. Finally, a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) is applied as a classification technique to identify the different classes of ICH.

For first year students, it is an introduction to clinical nuclear medicine which helps them better understand the profession as well as consolidate their learning to date. At The University of Newcastle, Australia part of the clinical placement course includes radiopharmacy laboratory sessions in a simulated environment to develop necessary skills and confidence. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, restrictions were put in place that meant that clinical placements for first year students were cancelled and time in the radiopharmacy laboratory was reduced from two hours to one hour per session. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a clinical alternative portfolio in lieu of clinical placement was effective in increasing the students' knowledge and skills in nuclear medicine practice and if specifically developed instructional videos for preparation of the radiopharmacy laboratories compensated for the reduced time. METHODS: A paper-based survey was given to the 50 students enrolled in the first-year professional practice course. This survey containing 56 questions consisted of both open questions and closed Likert-scale questions about the changes to the radiopharmacy laboratories and the clinical alternative portfolio in two separate sections. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed on the resulting data. RESULTS: There was a 94% response rate to the survey. The majority of students watched the preparatory radiopharmacy videos at least once and strongly agreeing that each video adequately prepared them for the associated lab session. Just over half (51%) of the students though the reduced time in the lab was sufficient to complete the required tasks.

This function was fitted to reported data on the percent positivity of symptomatic COVID-19 patients using NP testing. We then simulated a routine testing program with different NP and saliva testing frequencies to determine case detection percentages during the infectious period, as well as the presymptomatic stage. RESULTS: Routine biweekly NP testing, once every 2 weeks, identified an average of 90.7% (SD, 0.18) of cases during the infectious period and 19.7% (SD, 0.98) during the presymptomatic stage. With a weekly NP testing frequency, the corresponding case detection percentages were 95.9% (SD, 0.18) and 32.9% (SD, 1.23), respectively.

We estimated a total SIR of 7.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8%-8.8%), SAR of 6.6% (95% CI, 5.7%-7.5%), and symptomatic infection ratio of 86.9% (95%CI, 83.9%-89.9%) with a disease series interval of 5.84 (95%CI, 4.92-6.94) days. Household contacts had a higher risk of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, and transmission was driven between index cases and second-generation cases, with little transmission occurring in second-to-later-generation cases (SIR, 12.4% vs. 3.6%). The symptomatic infection ratio was not significantly different in terms of infection time, generation, type of contact, and index cases. Conclusions Our results suggest a higher risk of infection among household contacts. Transmissibility decreased with generations during the intervention. Pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 varied among territories, but didnt change over time. Strict isolation and medical observation measures should be implemented.","output":"Transmissibility and Pathogenicity of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Secondary Attack Rate and Asymptomatic Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are available in various formats, detecting different viral target proteins and antibody subclasses The specificity and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are known to vary and very few studies have addressed the performance of these tests in COVID-19 patient groups at different time points We here compared the sensitivity and specificity of seven commercial (SNIBE, Epitope, Euroimmun, Roche, Abbott, DiaSorin, Biosensor) and two in-house LIPS assays (LIPS N and LIPS S-RBD) IgG/total Ab tests in serum samples from 97 COVID-19 patients and 100 controls, and correlated the results with the patients clinical data and the time-point the test was performed We found a remarkable variation in the sensitivity of antibody tests with the following performance: LIPS N (91 8%), Epitope (85 6%), Abbott and in-house LIPS S-RBD (both 84 5%), Roche (83 5%), Euroimmun (82 5%), DiaSorin (81 4%), SNIBE (70 1%), and Biosensor (64 9%) The overall agreement between the tests was between 71C95%, whereas the specificity of all tests was within 98C100% The correlation with patients clinical symptoms score ranged from strongest in LIPS N ( = 0 41;p&lt;0 001) to nonsignificant in LIPS S-RBD Furthermore, the time of testing since symptom onset had an impact on the sensitivity of some tests Our study highlights the importance to consider clinical symptoms, time of testing, and using more than one viral antigen in SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing Our results suggest that some antibody tests are more sensitive for the detection of antibodies in early stage and asymptomatic patients, which may explain the contradictory results of previous studies and should be taken into consideration in clinical practice and epidemiological studies","output":"Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response in PCR positive patients: Comparison of nine tests in relation to clinical data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genome of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been sequenced at an unprecedented scale leading to a tremendous amount of viral genome sequencing data. To assist in tracing infection pathways and design preventive strategies, a deep understanding of the viral genetic diversity landscape is needed. We present here a set of genomic surveillance tools from population genetics which can be used to better understand the evolution of this virus in humans. To illustrate the utility of this toolbox, we detail an in depth analysis of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed 329,854 high-quality consensus sequences published in the GISAID database during the pre-vaccination phase. We demonstrate that, compared to standard phylogenetic approaches, haplotype networks can be computed efficiently on much larger datasets. This approach enables real-time lineage identification, a clear description of the relationship between variants of concern, and efficient detection of recurrent mutations. Furthermore, time series change of Tajima's D by haplotype provides a powerful metric of lineage expansion. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) highlights key steps in variant emergence and facilitates the visualization of genomic variation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 diversity. The computational framework presented here is simple to implement and insightful for real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and could be applied to any pathogen that threatens the health of populations of humans and other organisms.","output":"Population Genomics Approaches for Genetic Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Lineages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Best known as licorice, Glycyrrhiza Linn., a genus of herbaceous perennial legume, has been used as a traditional herbal medicine in Asia and a flavoring agent for tobacco and food industry in Europe and America.

The overall stability, however, was provided by RefFinder, a comprehensive ranking system integrating inputs from all four algorithms. In G. uralensis, the most stable reference genes under osmotic stress, salt stress, ABA treatment, and MeJA treatment were TIF1, DNAJ, CS, and ABCC2 for leaves and DNAJ, DREB, CAC, and CAC for roots, respectively. In comparison, the top ranked genes were TUB, CAC, UBC2, and RAN for leaves and TIF1, ABCC2, CAC, and UBC2 for roots, respectively, under stress and hormonal treatments in G. inflata.

Hourly air quality data, based on concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), and meteorological conditions (atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) of the nine cities studied were obtained from Saudi Arabian General Authority of Meteorology and Environmental Protection (GAMEP) for the period between January 2019 to May 2020. Significant variation (p<0.05) was recorded for the five atmospheric pollutants across the cities before and during the lockdown with lower concentrations during the lockdown except for the concentration of O3 in Tabuk, Al Qasim, and Haql. This can be as a result of NO and O3 reaction, causing the inability of effective O3 depletion. The percentage change in concentration for CO (33.60%) and SO2 (44.16%) was higher in Jeddah and PM10 (91.12%) at Riyadh, while NO2 (44.35%) and O3 (18.98%) was highest in Makkah.

An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided.

We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3) or cathepsin G (CG), serine proteases that co-localize with HNPs in azurophil granules, are proHNP1 activating convertases. Folded proHNP1 was converted to mature HNP1 by both NE and PR3, but CG generated an HNP1 variant with an N-terminal dipeptide extension.

Emergent correlations of vitamin D insufficiency with coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, alongside empirical and clinical evidence of immunoregulation by vitamin D in other pulmonary diseases, have prompted proposals of vitamin D supplementation to curb the COVID-19 public health toll. In this review paper, we engage an immunological lens to discuss potential mechanisms by which vitamin D signals might regulate respiratory disease severity in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections, vis a vis other pulmonary infections. It is proposed that vitamin D signals temper lung inflammatory cascades during SARS-CoV2 infection, and insufficiency of vitamin D causes increased inflammatory cytokine storm, thus leading to exacerbated respiratory disease. Additionally, analogous to studies of reduced cancer incidence, the dosage of vitamin D compounds administered to patients near the upper limit of safety may serve to maximize immune health benefits and mitigate inflammation and disease severity in SARS-CoV2 infections. We further deliberate on the importance of statistically powered clinical correlative and interventional studies, and the need for in-depth basic research into vitamin D-dependent host determinants of respiratory disease severity.","output":"Role of vitamin D in regulating COVID-19 severity-An immunological perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: There is an increasing clinical interest in the adoption of small single-lead wearable ECG sensors for continuous cardiac monitoring. The purpose of this work is to assess ECG signal quality of such devices compared to gold standard 12-lead ECG. METHODS: The ECG signal from a 1-lead patch was systematically compared to the 12-lead ECG device in thirty subjects to establish its diagnostic accuracy in terms of clinically relevant signal morphology, wave representation, fiducial markers and interval and wave duration. One minute ECG segments with good signal quality was selected for analysis and the features of ECG were manually annotated for comparative assessment. RESULTS: The patch showed closest similarity based on correlation and normalized root-mean-square error to the standard ECG leads I, II, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] . P-wave and QRS complexes in the patch showed sensitivity (Se) and positive predictive value (PPV) of at least 99.8% compared to lead II. T-wave representation showed Se and PPV of at least 99.9% compared to lead [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] . Mean errors for onset and offset of the ECG waves, wave durations, and ECG intervals were within 2 samples based on 125Hz patch ECG sampling frequency. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the diagnostic capability with similar morphological representation and reasonable timing accuracy of ECG signal from a patch sensor compared to 12-lead ECG. The advantages and limitations of small bipolar single-lead wearable patch sensor compared to 12-lead ECG are discussed in the context of relevant differences in ECG signal for clinical applications.","output":"ECG Signal Quality Assessments of a Small Bipolar Single-Lead Wearable Patch Sensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In 2009, a novel influenza vaccine was distributed worldwide to combat the H1N1 influenza swine flu pandemic. However, antibodies induced by the vaccine display differences in their specificity and cross-reactivity dependent on pre-existing immunity. Here, we present a computational model that can capture the effect of pre-existing immunity on influenza vaccine responses. The model predicts the region of the virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein targeted by antibodies after vaccination as well as the level of cross-reactivity induced by the vaccine. We tested our model by simulating a scenario similar to the 2009 pandemic vaccine and compared the results to antibody binding data obtained from human subjects vaccinated with the monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. RESULTS: We found that both specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibodies induced by the 2009 H1N1 influenza HA protein were affected by the viral strain the individual was originally exposed. Specifically, the level of antigenic relatedness between the original exposure HA antigen and the 2009 HA protein affected antigenic-site immunodominance. Moreover, antibody cross-reactivity was increased when the individuals pre-existing immunity was specific to an HA protein antigenically distinct from the 2009 pandemic strain. Comparison of simulation data with antibody binding data from human serum samples demonstrated qualitative and quantitative similarities between the model and real-life immune responses to the 2009 vaccine. CONCLUSION: We provide a novel method to evaluate expected outcomes in antibody specificity and cross-reactivity after influenza vaccination in individuals with different influenza HA antigen exposure histories. The model produced similar outcomes as what has been previously reported in humans after receiving the 2009 influenza pandemic vaccine. Our results suggest that differences in cross-reactivity after influenza vaccination should be expected in individuals with different exposure histories.","output":"Implementing sequence-based antigenic distance calculation into immunological shape space model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We can maximize the impact of scientific conferences by uploading all conference presentations, posters, and abstracts to highly trafficked public repositories for each content type.

It is uncertain whether such was also true for COVID-19. This study hence investigated prevalence of IV behavior/intention prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated cognitive factors. Methods A self-administered, online, and anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among 6,922 university students of five provinces in China during November 1C28, 2020 (response rate: 72.3%). Results Of all the participants, 35.1% self-reported behavioral intention of IV (next 12 months), while 62.9% reported an increased intention of IV due to COVID-19. However, only 4.7% and 2.9% had taken up IV during the 12-month period prior to the outbreak (1/2019C12/2019) and during the COVID-19 outbreak (1C11/2020), respectively. Adjusted for the background factors, the multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that in general the COVID-19 related perceptions (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and perceived chance of having another wave of COVID-19 outbreak) were significantly and positively associated the IV behavior (during the COVID-19 outbreak) and intention of IV uptake in the next 12 months. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced actual behavior and intention of IV uptake among university students during the pandemic. Efforts are warranted to reduce the intention-behavior gap of IV uptake; modification of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity regarding COVID-19 may help. Future longitudinal and intervention studies are needed to confirm the findings of this study and explore other factors affecting IV uptake during the COVID-19 period.","output":"Prevalence and factors of influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic among university students in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic and the lockdown policies enacted to mitigate it have had profound effects on the labour market.

Surprisingly, dialysis patients have shown superior seroconversion rates after vaccination compared to KTRs. Therefore, we investigated peripheral blood B cell (BC) composition before and after kidney transplantation (KT) and aimed to screen the BC compartment to explain impaired antibody generation. Methods A total of 105 patients were recruited, and multicolor flow cytometric phenotyping of peripheral venous blood BC subpopulations was performed before and 1 year after KT. Complete follow-up was available for 71 individuals. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were collected retrospectively and were available for 40 subjects, who had received two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). Results Overall, relative BC frequencies within lymphocytes decreased, and their absolute counts trended in the same direction 1 year after KT as compared to CKD G5 patients. Frequencies and absolute numbers of na?ve BCs remained stable. Frequencies of double negative BCs, a heterogeneous subpopulation of antigen experienced BCs lacking CD27 expression, were increased after KT, yet their absolute counts were similar at both time points. Transitional BCs (TrBCs) and plasmablasts were significantly reduced after KT in absolute and relative terms. Memory BCs were affected differently since class-switched and IgM-only subsets decreased after KT, but unswitched and IgD-only memory BCs remained unchanged. CD86+ and CD5+ expression on BCs was downregulated after KT. Correlational analysis revealed that TrBCs were the only subset to correlate with titer levels after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Responders showed higher TrBCs, both absolute and relative, than non-responders. Conclusion Together, after 1 year, KTRs showed persistent and profound compositional changes within the BC compartment. Low TrBCs, 1 year after KT, may account for the low serological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in KTRs compared to dialysis patients. Our findings need confirmation in further studies as they may guide vaccination strategies.","output":"B Cell Composition Is Altered After Kidney Transplantation and Transitional B Cells Correlate With SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive progress and initial response to chemotherapy but rapid development of relapse. circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may provide an opportunity for dynamic monitoring of treatment response and disease progression. Methods: Patients aged 18 years and older with pathologically confirmed and previously untreated SCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1, and measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 were enrolled. All participants received 4-6 courses of chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide). Serial blood samples were collected before chemotherapy initiation, after two treatment cycles, at the end of treatment and on disease progression. CTCs and circulating tumor epithelial cells (CTECs) levels were analyzed using subtraction enrichment technique. The expression of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition maker vimentin and stem cell marker CD44 on CTCs and CTECs were also evaluated by immunostaining FISH. Associations of CTCs, CTECs and their subpopulations with clinical factors and prognosis were determined. Results: Thirty-three patients were enrolled between November 2018 and January 2020. The median age of the patients was 63 years (range 43-69). 24 (72.7%) were males. Sequential samples were available from 30 and 26 patients before chemotherapy initiation and after two treatment cycles, respectively. Blood samples of all the former three time points were collected from only 14 patients because of the epidemic of COVID-19. At baseline, CTCs were detected in 29 (96.7%) patients, and CTECs were less detected (22, 66.7%). Both vimentin and CD44 positive CTCs were detected in only 8 participants at all detecting points. Interestingly, there is an increasing tendency of the CTCs level after two chemotherapy cycles, although the differences in the absolute number and detection incidence of CTCs and CTECs before and after treatment were not statistically significant (table). Almost all of the CTCs or CTECs were demonstrated to be aneuploid through chromosome 8 centromere probe (CEP8) analysis. Unfortunately, neither the absolute number nor variance of CTCs/CTECs seem to be able to predict chemotherapy response according to our current data.

While much of the climate change and migration discourse is invested in quantitative predictions and debates about whether migration is adaptive or maladaptive, less attention has been paid to the voices of the people moving in the context of climate change with a focus on their health and wellbeing. This qualitative research aims to amplify the voices of migrants themselves to add nuance to dominant migration narratives and to shed light on the real-life challenges migrants face in meeting their health needs in the context of climate change. Methods: We conducted 58 semi-structured in-depth interviews with migrants purposefully selected for having moved from rural Bhola, southern Bangladesh to an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis under the philosophical underpinnings of phenomenology. Coding was conducted using NVivo Pro 12. Findings: We identified two overarching themes in the thematic analysis: Firstly, we identified the theme A risk exchange: Exchanging climate change and health risks at origin and destination. Rather than describing a net positive or net negative outcome in terms of migration in the context of climate change, migrants described an exchange of hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities at origin with those at destination, which challenged their capacity to adapt. This theme included several sub-themesincome and employment factors, changing food environment, shelter and water sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) conditions, and social capital. The second overarching theme was A changing health and healthcare environment. This theme also included several sub-themeschanging physical and mental health status and a changing healthcare environment encompassing quality of care and barriers to accessing healthcare. Migrants described physical and mental health concerns and connected these experiences with their new environment. These two overarching themes were prevalent across the dataset, although each participant experienced and expressed them uniquely. Conclusion: Migrants who move in the context of climate change face a range of diverse health risks at the origin, en route, and at the destination. Migrating individuals, households, and communities undertake a risk exchange when they decide to move, which has diverse positive and negative consequences for their health and wellbeing. Along with changing health determinants is a changing healthcare environment where migrants face different choices, barriers, and quality of care. A more migrant-centric perspective as described in this paper could strengthen migration, climate, and health governance.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven surgical charts of cataract patients who underwent phacoemulsification with IOL insertion between June 2018 and October 2020 were reviewed. There were 113 cases operated on under halogen-illuminated microscope (Carl Zeiss OPMI LUMERA S7(?)) and 114 cases operated on under light-emitting diode (LED)-illuminated microscope (Leica PROVEO 8(?)). All cases were operated on by the same surgeon (S.T.). The difference in operative time and ultrasound time between two groups was compared by independent samples t-test. The proportion of cases with 3-months BCVA that was better than 20/30 and the proportion of cases with intraoperative complications from the operation between two groups were compared by Pearsons Chi-squared test. RESULTS: The mean ultrasound time was 121.2953.60 seconds in halogen group and 123.9861.53 seconds in LED group. The mean difference was ?2.698.44 seconds which was not statistically significant (95% CI, ?19.35 to 13.97; p=0.573). The mean operative time was 19.834.77 minutes in the halogen group and 17.203.02 minutes in the LED group. The mean difference was 2.630.53 minutes (95% CI, 1.59 to 3.67; p < 0.001). The cases with BCVA better than 20/30 was 93.69% in halogen group and 95.49% in LED group. The proportion of cases with intraoperative complications was 3.53% in halogen group and 2.63% in LED group. The difference of both proportions was not statistically significant (p=0.553 and p=0.692, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study shows statistically significant operative time reduction with LED microscope.

The spike (S) proteins of CoVs are surface glycoproteins that facilitate viral entry into host cells via attachment to their respective cellular receptors. The S protein is believed to be a major immunogenic component of CoVs and a target for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and most candidate vaccines. Development of a safe and convenient assay is thus urgently needed to determine the prevalence of CoVs nAbs in the population, to study immune response in infected individuals, and to aid in vaccines and viral entry inhibitor evaluation. While live virus-based neutralization assays are used as gold standard serological methods to detect and measure nAbs, handling of highly pathogenic live CoVs requires strict bio-containment conditions in biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratories. On the other hand, use of replication-incompetent pseudoviruses bearing CoVs S proteins could represent a safe and useful method to detect nAbs in serum samples under biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) conditions.

Applications are limited by lack of training of users, difficulty maintaining ultrasound competencies, access to equipment for optimal imaging, and limitations in quality control. Such barriers exist in low-resource, underserved health care settings. Objective The aim was to explore the use of POCUS in under-resourced health care settings, such as rural and remote locations in Australia and other countries. Key variables include health outcomes, quality of care, service availability, examinations types performed, equipment used, who performs the examinations, and the ultrasound training received. Methods Literature was identified via CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science, plus grey literature. Recommended guidelines were followed, and only research-based articles were included, with searches limited to English language and 2010-present. Results After screening, 23 articles were reviewed. No studies had low risk of bias and, overall, the quality was poor and only two studies used random sampling. The majority were from developing countries, with only one performed in Australia. Echocardiographic screening in schools was common. Others included emergency department (ED) patients, abdominal aorta screening, obstetric scans, and intensive care unit (ICU) management. Operators included ED doctors, medical students, nurses, community healthcare workers and general practitioners, who received limited training in protocol-driven scanning, often monitored by experts. In comparison to clinical assessment, standard ultrasound or other imaging, accuracy was of the order of 70-95%, depending on the condition, with high efficacy in improving patient care. Conclusion Lack of studies of POCUS in Australia and other developed countries suggests a need for further research. Current evidence supports use of limited ultrasound using portable machines in locations with limited access to diagnostic ultrasound performed by sonographers, which has the potential to improve health outcomes in under-resourced communities in Australia and elsewhere.","output":"Potential for Use of Portable Ultrasound Devices in Rural and Remote Settings in Australia and Other Developed Countries: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are difficult to diagnose and to treat and, despite several available antifungal drugs, cause high mortality rates. In the past decades, the incidence of IFIs has continuously increased. More recently, SARS-CoV-2-associated lethal IFIs have been reported worldwide in critically ill patients. Combating IFIs requires a more profound understanding of fungal pathogenicity to facilitate the development of novel antifungal strategies. Animal models are indispensable for studying fungal infections and to develop new antifungals. However, using mammalian animal models faces various hurdles including ethical issues and high costs, which makes large-scale infection experiments extremely challenging. To overcome these limitations, we optimized an invertebrate model and introduced a simple calcofluor white (CW) staining protocol to macroscopically and microscopically monitor disease progression in silkworms (Bombyx mori) infected with the human pathogenic filamentous fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Lichtheimia corymbifera. This advanced silkworm A. fumigatus infection model could validate knockout mutants with either attenuated, strongly attenuated or unchanged virulence. Finally, CW staining allowed us to efficiently visualize antifungal treatment outcomes in infected silkworms. Conclusively, we here present a powerful animal model combined with a straightforward staining protocol to expedite large-scale in vivo research of fungal pathogenicity and to investigate novel antifungal candidates.","output":"Direct Visualization of Fungal Burden in Filamentous Fungus-Infected Silkworms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation characteristics, timings, and surgical decisions for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). METHODS: A historical cohort including all patients who presented to the Surgical Retina Section at Centro Hospitalar Universitrio do Porto (CHUPorto), over a 2-year period, was recruited and divided into 2 groups: pre-COVID and COVID groups. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was recorded as starting on March 18, 2020, the same day the first pandemic-related lockdown came to effect in Portugal. RESULTS: This study enrolled 449 eyes of 443 patients: 272 in the pre-COVID group and 177 in the COVID one. Of the patients, 63.6% were male, and the mean  SD age was 63.0  13.2 years (range 13C92 years). Of the eyes, 55.5% (n = 151) presented with macular detachment in the pre-COVID group compared with 66.9% (n = 119) in the COVID group (odds ratio [OR] 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09C3.86; p = 0.016). The time from symptom onset to hospital admission (p = 0.021) and from admission to surgery (p < 0.001) was longer in the COVID era.

However, the reported prevalence of anxiety symptoms and disorders among eye disease patients vary across studies. Thus, this study aims to clarify the estimated prevalence of anxiety symptoms and disorders among ophthalmic disease patients. METHODS: Relevant studies on the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and disorders among eye disease patients were collected through international databases, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A random-effects model was used to determine the pooled prevalence of anxiety symptoms and disorders among ophthalmic disease patients. RESULTS: The 95 included studies yielded a pooled prevalence of 31.2% patients with anxiety symptoms and 19.0% with anxiety disorders among subjects with ophthalmic disease. Pediatric patients were more anxious (58.6%) than adults (29%). Anxiety symptoms were most prevalent in uveitis (53.5%), followed by dry eye disease (DED, 37.2%), retinitis pigmentosa (RP, 36.5%), diabetic retinopathy (DR, 31.3%), glaucoma (30.7%), myopia (24.7%), age-related macular degeneration (AMD, 21.6%), and cataract (21.2%) patients. Anxiety disorders were most prevalent in thyroid eye disease (TED, 28.9%), followed by glaucoma (22.2%) and DED (11.4%). When compared with healthy controls, there was a twofold increase on the prevalence of anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.912, 95% CI 1.463C2.5, p < 0.001) and anxiety disorders (OR = 2.281, 95% CI 1.168C4.454, p = 0.016).

METHODS From June, 2003 to October, 2009, 56 patients with gastric GIST who underwent laparoscopic gastric resection were retrospectively reviewed, and their surgical procedure, perioperative outcomes, pathology, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS All patients underwent laparoscopic gastric resection successfully, including 33 laparoscopic wedge resections, 19 laparoscopic transgastric tumor-everting resections, 3 laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomies, and 1 laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic resection. The operative approaches performed were mostly based on the tumor location. No conversions were observed. The mean operative duration was 90 minutes (30 to 210 min), blood loss was 55 mL (5 to 180 mL), time for passage of flatus was 2 days (1 to 11 d), and the postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (3 to 13 d). The resection margin was microscopic negative. After 21.5 months (6 to 76 mo) of follow-up, there was no operative recurrence and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic gastric resection for selective cases of gastric GISTs is safe, feasible, and effective. Laparoscopic wedge resection procedure is the first choice for most GISTs located in fundus and anterior wall, laparoscopic transgastric tumor-everting resection procedure can be used in cases with the tumor located in esophagogastric junction area and in posterior wall of the stomach as well.

Here, we studied GfCoV diversity and evaluated its phenotypic consequences. Over the period of 2014 to 2016, affected guinea fowl flocks were sampled in France, and avian coronavirus presence was confirmed by PCR on intestinal content and immunohistochemistry of intestinal tissue. Sequencing revealed 89% amino acid identity between the viral attachment protein S1 of GfCoV/2014 and that of the previously identified GfCoV/2011. To study the receptor interactions as a determinant for tropism and pathogenicity, recombinant S1 proteins were produced and analyzed by glycan and tissue arrays. Glycan array analysis revealed that, in addition to the previously elucidated biantennary di-N-acetyllactosamine (diLacNAc) receptor, viral attachment S1 proteins from GfCoV/2014 and GfCoV/2011 can bind to glycans capped with alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids. Interestingly, recombinant GfCoV/2014 S1 has an increased affinity for these glycans compared to that of GfCoV/2011 S1, which was in agreement with the increased avidity of GfCoV/2014 S1 for gastrointestinal tract tissues. Enzymatic removal of receptors from tissues before application of spike proteins confirmed the specificity of S1 tissue binding. Overall, we demonstrate that diversity in GfCoV S1 proteins results in differences in glycan and tissue binding properties.

Identification of the genetic variants associated with chronic sputum production in a disease agnostic sample could improve understanding of its causes and identify new molecular targets for treatment. Methods We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic sputum production in UK Biobank. Signals meeting genome-wide significance (P<5x10-8) were fine-mapped and putative causal genes identified by gene expression analysis. GWAS of respiratory traits were interrogated to identify whether the signals were driven by existing respiratory disease amongst the cases and variants were further investigated for wider pleiotropic effects using phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). Findings From a GWAS of 9,714 cases and 48,471 controls, we identified six novel genome-wide significant signals for chronic sputum production including the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) locus, chromosome 11 mucin locus (containing MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC5B) and the FUT2 locus. The mucin locus signal had previously been reported for association with moderate-to-severe asthma. The HLA signal was fine-mapped to an amino-acid change of threonine to arginine (frequency 36.8%) in HLA-DRB1 (HLA-DRB1*03:147). The signal near FUT2 was associated with expression of several genes including FUT2, for which the direction of effect was tissue dependent. Our PheWAS identified a wide range of associations.

Many test systems for detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 contain NP or its fragments as antigen. The sensitivity and specificity of such test systems differ significantly, which can be explained by variations in the antigenic properties of NP caused by differences in the methods of its cultivation, isolation and purification. We investigated this effect for the Escherichia coli-derived SARS-CoV-2 NP, obtained from the cytoplasm in the soluble form. We hypothesized that co-purified nucleic acids that form a strong complex with NP might negatively affect NPs antigenic properties. Therefore, we have established the NP purification method, which completely eliminates the RNA in the NP preparation. Two stages of RNA removal were used: treatment of the crude lysate of E. coli with RNase A and subsequent selective RNA elution with 2 M NaCl solution. The resulting NP without RNA has a significantly better signal-to-noise ratio when used as an ELISA antigen and tested with a control panel of serum samples with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; therefore, it is preferable for in vitro diagnostic use. The same increase of the signal-to-noise ratio was detected for the free N-terminal domain of the NP.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between changes in temperature, humidity, rainfall, and SARS-CoV-2 contagion. Five ecologically and climatically distinct regions were considered-Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, and Gilgit-Baltistan. Method: Data on daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from government officials, while meteorological information was collected from Pakistan Meteorological Department.. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20 and the Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between the meteorological factors and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Result: Positive correlation of COVID-19 incidence was observed with all the temperature ranges (maximum, minimum and average) and negative correlation was seen with humidity, DTR and rainfall. COVID-19 deaths were positively associated with temperature and were negatively associated only with humidity. Linear regression showed that for every unit increase in humidity, there was a -3.345 daily significant decrease in COVID-19 cases, while in Karachi for every unit increase in humidity, there remained a 10.104 daily significant increase in cases. In Gilgit-Baltistan, for every unit increase in average temperature and rainfall respectively, significant increases of 0.534 and 1.286 in daily cases were found.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Can we develop and validate a web-based risk prediction model for identification of patients who may develop severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or death? METHODS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 415 patients admitted to a large urban academic medical center and community hospitals. Covariates included demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. The independent association of predictors with severe COVID-19 was determined using multivariable logistic regression. A derivation cohort (n=311, 75%) was used to develop the prediction models. The models were tested by a validation cohort (n=104, 25%). RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 54-77) and the majority were male (55%) and non-White (65.8%). The 14-day severe COVID-19 rate was 39.3%; 31.7% required ICU, 24.6% mechanical ventilation, and 21.2% died. Machine learning algorithms and clinical judgment were used to improve model performance and clinical utility, resulting in the selection of eight predictors: age, sex, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, troponin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase. The discriminative ability was excellent for both the severe COVID-19 (training area under the curve [AUC]=0.82, validation AUC=0.82) and mortality (training AUC= 0.85, validation AUC=0.81) models.

Based on available data for the SARS-CoV-1 virus, we suggest how CoV-2 localization of RNA transcripts in mitochondria hijacks the host cell's mitochondrial function to viral advantage. Besides viral RNA transcripts, RNA also localizes to mitochondria. SARS-CoV-2 may manipulate mitochondrial function indirectly, first by ACE2 regulation of mitochondrial function, and once it enters the host cell, open-reading frames (ORFs) such as ORF-9b can directly manipulate mitochondrial function to evade host cell immunity and facilitate virus replication and COVID-19 disease. Manipulations of host mitochondria by viral ORFs can release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytoplasm and activate mtDNA-induced inflammasome and suppress innate and adaptive immunity. We argue that a decline in ACE2 function in aged individuals, coupled with the age-associated decline in mitochondrial functions resulting in chronic metabolic disorders like diabetes or cancer, may make the host more vulnerable to infection and health complications to mortality. These observations suggest that distinct localization of viral RNA and proteins in mitochondria must play essential roles in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying virus communication with host mitochondria may provide critical insights into COVID-19 pathologies.

The C-terminal region of the Lys49-PLA2s is important for these effects; however, the amino acid residues that determine hyperalgesia and edema are unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize the structural determinants for the Lys49-PLA2-induced nociception and inflammation. Methods Scanning alanine mutagenesis in the active-site and C-terminal regions of BthTx-I has been used to study the structural determinants of toxin activities. The R118A mutant was employed as this substitution decreases PLA2 myotoxicity. In addition, K115A and K116A mutants - which contribute to decrease cytotoxicity - and the K122A mutant - which decreases both myotoxicity and cytotoxicity - were also used. The H48Q mutant - which does not interfere with membrane damage or myotoxic activity - was used to evaluate if the PLA2 catalytic site is relevant for the non-catalytic PLA2-induced pain and inflammation. Wistar male rats received intraplantar injections with mutant PLA2. Subsequently, hyperalgesia and edema were evaluated by the paw pressure test and by a plethysmometer. Native and recombinant BthTx-I were used as controls. Results Native and recombinant BthTx-I induced hyperalgesia and edema, which peaked at 2 h. The R118A mutant did not induce nociception or edema. The mutations K115A and K116A abolished hyperalgesia without interfering with edema. Finally, the K122A mutant did not induce hyperalgesia and presented a decreased inflammatory response. Conclusions The results obtained with the BthTx-I mutants suggest, for the first time, that there are distinct residues responsible for the hyperalgesia and edema induced by BthTx-I. In addition, we also showed that cytolytic activity is essential for the hyperalgesic effect but not for edematogenic activity, corroborating previous data showing that edema and hyperalgesia can occur in a non-dependent manner.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between 20 February - 4 March 2020 via an online survey with 285 students from one faculty of medicine in Turkey. Ethical approval was obtained from Bahcesehir University Clinical Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: Among participants, 59% were female and 70% were Turkish citizen. Mostly, students were getting updates from media (70%) and the following source was WHO (18%). Of all participants, 60% correctly stated that SARS-CoV-2 has lower mortality rate than SARS and MERS. The most used protections were hand-sanitizers, avoiding close contacts with Asians and using masks in crowded areas (respectively 67%, 30%, 29%). On the scale 1 to 10 (1: strongly trust, 10: strongly do not trust); median for WHO's information process was 7, WHO's outbreak management was 6, Turkish Ministry of Health's (TMH) information process was 5 and TMH's outbreak management was 5.

Thus far, available interferon-alpha (IFN)-based therapies have shown unsatisfactory cure rates, and alternative therapeutic molecules are still required. However, their development has been hampered because accessible cell models supporting relevant HBV replication and appropriate antiviral activity are lacking. Strategies that reverse epigenetic alterations offer a unique opportunity for cell reprogramming, which is valuable for restoring altered cellular functions in human cell lines. This work aimed to investigate the feasibility of converting HepG2 cells that stably overexpress the HBV entry receptor (sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, NTCP) toward IFN-responsive cells using epigenetic reprogramming. Herein, we showed that an epigenetic regimen with non-cytotoxic doses of the demethylating compound 5-azacytidine restored the anti-HBV action of IFN in epigenetically reprogrammed HepG2-NTCP-C4 cells, named REP-HepG2-NTCP cells. Thus, a significant inhibition in HBV DNA levels was measured in REP-HepG2-NTCP cells after IFN treatment. This inhibitory effect was associated with the enhancement of IFN-mediated induction of critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which was limited in non-reprogrammed cells. In particular, our data indicated that re-expression of 2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) and interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) was the result of an epigenetically driven unmasking of these genes in reprogrammed cells. At last, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the IFN analog CDM-3008 in REP-HepG2-NTCP cells and demonstrated the efficiency of this chemical compound in triggering ISG induction and HBV inhibition. In summary, this study shows that epigenetic reprogramming promotes the IFN response in HBV-infected cells and is potentially attractive for cell-based experimental screening of IFN-like compounds.","output":"Epigenetic reprogramming promotes the antiviral action of IFN in HBV-infected cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"REST[ES] is the first Canadian human taphonomic facility (HTF) dedicated to research and training relating to human decomposition in a northern temperate climate.

Therefore, we compared a favored surgical intervention with the most effective conservative treatment regarding anthropometry and nutritional status. METHODS Fifty-four obese patients were included who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, n = 27) or a 52-week multidisciplinary intervention program (MIP, n = 27) for weight loss. Body weight, body composition assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and serum protein levels were measured before and within 12 months after intervention. RESULTS After 1 year of observation, excess weight loss was more pronounced following LSG (65 %) compared to MIP (38 %, p < 0.001). In both groups, body fat was clearly reduced, but a higher reduction occurred in the LSG group. However, protein status deteriorated particularly in the LSG group. Within 1 year, body cell mass declined from 37.1 to 26.9 kg in the LSG group, but only from 35.7 to 32.2 kg in the MIP group.

Therefore, mitigating strategies could be key to reducing mouthdrying and maximising the benefits from such products. Currently, few studies have successfully mitigated whey protein derived mouthdrying and this paper aims to investigate different strategies to reduce mouthdrying effects. Accordingly, a series of experiments were carried out with a trained sensory panel (n = 11). Two different whey protein food matrices were tested: (a) whey protein beverages (WPB) varying in lactose (0.05C12.4% w/v) and fat (0.9C7.2% w/v) levels and (b) whey protein fortified snacks: cupcakes with differing whey protein concentrate (WPC) powders (standard and heat-stable) and scones with varying fat content (with and without cream topping). Overall results suggested the tested strategies had limited significant effects on whey protein derived mouthdrying. Increasing lactose (9.4% w/v) in WPBs and fat levels (via cream topping) on scones significantly suppressed mouthdrying. However, all other tested strategies (increasing fat in WPBs and heat-stable WPC in cupcakes) had no significant effect on suppressing perceived mouthdrying.

Epidemiologists predicted that the SARS\\\\Cov 2 pandemic would not be able to be brought under control until a majority of the worlds population had been inoculated with safe and effective vaccines. A world\\\\wide effort to expedite vaccine development was successful. Previous research for vaccines to prevent SARS and MERS, also coronaviruses, was vital to this success. Nanotechnology was essential to this vaccine development. Key elements are presented here to better understand the relationship between nanomedicine and the COVID\\\\19 vaccine development. METHODS: NLM PubMed searches for COVID\\\\19 vaccines, nanotechnology and nanomedicine were done. There were 6911 articles screened, 235 of which were deemed appropriate to this subject and utilized here, together with two landmark nanomedicine texts used to expand understanding of the basic science of nanotechnology. RESULTS: SARS\\\\Cov 2, caused by the COVID\\\\19 virus, was first recognized in China in December of 2019 and was declared as a pandemic in March of 2020. The RNA sequence was identified in January of 2020. Within 4 months of the viral genome being released, over 259 vaccines had been in development. The World Health Organization (WHO) anticipated a vaccine with a 50\\\\80% efficacy to be developed within 1\\\\2 years. Ahead of schedule, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the emergency authorization approval for two mRNA vaccines within 11 months time. Nanotechnology was the key to the success of these rapidly developed, safe and effective vaccines. A brief review of pertinent basic science principles of nanomedicine are presented. The development of COVID vaccines is reviewed. Future considerations are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Control of the COVID\\\\19 SARS\\\\Cov2 pandemic benefitted from nanomedicine principles used to develop highly effective, yet very safe and relatively inexpensive vaccines.

Mobility plays a central role in this dilemma because the movement of people enables both economic activity and virus spread. We use mobility data in the form of counts of travelers between regions, to extend the often-used SEIR models to include mobility between regions. We quantify the trade-off between mobility and infection spread in terms of a single parameter, to be chosen by policy makers, and propose strategies for restricting mobility so that the restrictions are minimal while the infection spread is effectively limited. We consider restrictions where the country is divided into regions, and study scenarios where mobility is allowed within these regions, and disallowed between them. We propose heuristic methods to approximate optimal choices for these regions. We evaluate the obtained restrictions based on our trade-off. The results show that our methods are especially effective when the infections are highly concentrated, e.g., around a few municipalities, as resulting from superspreading events that play an important role in the spread of COVID-19.

Motivated by this evidence, we build a structural model to explore the possibility that recessions cause persistent increases in inequality; that is, that the cycle drives the trend. The model features skill-biased technical change, which implies a trend decline in low-skill wages relative to the value of non-market activities. With this adverse trend in the background, recessions imply a potential double-whammy for low skilled men. This group is disproportionately likely to experience unemployment, which further reduces skills and potential earnings via a scarring effect. As unemployed low skilled men give up job search, recessions generate surges in non-participation.

Data about transradial access for flow diversion are limited. We share our early experience with transradial access for flow diversion in a relatively large case series. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent Pipeline embolization device (Medtronic) deployment via transradial access were included in the study, irrespective of location and laterality of the intracranial aneurysm. The cases were performed between July 2016 and October 2019. Demographics, aneurysm characteristics, and procedure-related details (including catheter systems used) were recorded and statistically evaluated. RESULTS Thirty-five transradial flow diversion procedures were attempted in 32 patients, of which 33 procedures were successful. In two cases involving left common carotid artery and internal carotid artery access, guide catheter herniation into the aortic arch led to abandonment of transradial access in favor of transfemoral access. The most common aneurysm locations in the transradial access procedures were the posterior communicating artery (n = 7), ophthalmic artery (n = 7), and superior hypophyseal artery (n = 7). Most transradial access procedures (66.7%) were performed using a biaxial catheter system. 6-French Benchmark (Penumbra) and Phenom 27 (Medtronic) were the most commonly utilized guide- and microcatheters, respectively. One patient had intraprocedural subarachnoid hemorrhage. No access-site complications occurred.

These increased demands coupled with the lack of preparedness for their new roles lead to a high risk for caregivers developing depressive symptoms and other negative outcomes. Follow-up home support and problem-solving interventions with caregivers are crucial for maintaining stroke survivors in their homes. Problem-solving interventions are effective but are underused in practice because they require large amounts of staff time to implement and are difficult for caregivers logistically. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test a problem-solving intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered over the telephone during the patients transitional care period (time when the stroke survivor is discharged to home) followed by 8 asynchronous online sessions. METHODS: The design is a two-arm parallel randomized clinical trial with repeated measures. We will enroll 240 caregivers from eight Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. Participants randomized into the intervention arm receive a modified problem-solving intervention that uses telephone and web-based support and training with interactive modules, fact sheets, and tools on the previously developed and nationally available Resources and Education for Stroke Caregivers Understanding and Empowerment Caregiver website. In the usual care group, no changes are made in the information, discharge planning, or care the patients who have had a stroke normally receive, and caregivers have access to existing VA resources (eg, caregiver support line, self-help materials). The primary outcome is a change in caregiver depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Secondary outcomes include changes in stroke caregivers burden, knowledge, positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy, perceived stress, health-related quality of life, and satisfaction with care and changes in stroke survivors functional abilities and health care use. The team will also determine the budgetary impact, facilitators, barriers, and best practices for implementing the intervention. Throughout all phases of the study, we will collaborate with members of an advisory panel. RESULTS: Study enrollment began in June 2015 and is ongoing. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known study to test a transitional care and messaging center intervention combined with technology to decrease caregiver depressive symptoms and to improve the recovery of stroke survivors. If successful, findings will support an evidence-based model that can be transported into clinical practice to improve the quality of caregiving post stroke.

INTERVENTION: Ad26.ZIKV.001, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector encoding ZIKV M-Env, administered in 1- or 2-dose regimens of 5  1010 or 1  1011 viral particles (vp), or placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Local and systemic adverse events; neutralization titers by microneutralization assay (MN50) and T-cell responses by interferon-?3 enzyme-linked immunospot and intracellular cytokine staining; and protectivity of vaccine-induced antibodies in a subset of participants through transfer in an exploratory mouse ZIKV challenge model. RESULTS: All regimens were well tolerated, with no safety concerns identified. In both 2-dose regimens, ZIKV neutralizing titers peaked 14 days after the second vaccination, with geometric mean MN50 titers (GMTs) of 1065.6 (95% CI, 494.9 to 2294.5) for 5  1010 vp and 956.6 (595.8 to 1535.8) for 1  1011 vp. Titers persisted for at least 1 year at a GMT of 68.7 (CI, 26.4-178.9) for 5  1010 vp and 87.0 (CI, 29.3 to 258.6) for 1  1011 vp. A 1-dose regimen of 1  1011 vp Ad26.ZIKV.001 induced seroconversion in all participants 56 days after the first vaccination (GMT, 103.4 [CI, 52.7 to 202.9]), with titers persisting for at least 1 year (GMT, 90.2 [CI, 38.4 to 212.2]). Env-specific cellular responses were induced. Protection against ZIKV challenge was observed after antibody transfer from participants into mice, and MN50 titers correlated with protection in this model. LIMITATION: The study was conducted in a nonendemic area, so it did not assess safety and immunogenicity in a flavivirus-exposed population. CONCLUSION: The safety and immunogenicity profile makes Ad26.ZIKV.001 a promising candidate for further development if the need reemerges.

However, the role of hormone therapy as a prognostic factor of suicide risk is largely unknown. OBJECTIVES To examine associations between menopausal hormone therapy, suicide attempts, and suicide among midlife and older women Veterans. RESEARCH DESIGN In this longitudinal analysis of national Veterans Health Administration data from women Veterans aged 50 years and above, we used Fine-Gray proportional hazards models to examine associations between menopausal hormone therapy (prescribed in 2012-2013) and incident suicide attempts and suicide (index date-2016). MEASURES Menopausal hormone therapy and psychoactive medications from pharmacy records; suicide attempts and suicide from national suicide data repositories; demographic variables, medical and psychiatric diagnoses, and substance use disorders from electronic medical record data and International Classification Diagnoses-9-CM codes. RESULTS In this national sample of 291,709 women Veterans (mean age 60.47, SD 9.81), 6% were prescribed menopausal hormone therapy at baseline. Over an average of 4.5 years, 2673 had an incident suicide attempt (93%) or death by suicide (7%). Adjusting for age, race, and medical diagnoses, menopausal hormone therapy was associated with increased risk of suicide attempt (hazard ratio 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-1.64) and over 2-fold increased risk of death by suicide (hazard ratio 2.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-3.87). Associations with death by suicide remained significant after accounting for psychiatric comorbidity and psychoactive medications.

A viral infection alone was indicated in 37 (19%), a bacterial infection alone in 30 (15%) and a mixed viral-bacterial infection in 32 (16%) patients. Thus, 46% of the 69 patients with viral infection and 52% of the 62 patients with bacterial infection had a mixed viral and bacterial aetiology. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was identified in 52 patients andStreptococcus pneumoniae in 41 patients. The next common agents in order were non-classifiedHaemophilus influenzae (17 cases), adenoviruses (10 cases) andChlamydia species (8 cases). The diagnosis of an RSV infection was based on detecting viral antigen in nasopharyngeal secretions in 79% of the cases. Pneumococcal infections were in most cases identified by antibody assays; in 39% they were indicated by demonstrating pneumococcal antigen in acute phase serum. An alveolar infiltrate was present in 53 (27%) and an interstitial infiltrate in 108 (55%) of the 195 patients. The remaining 34 patients had probable pneumonia. C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and total white blood cell count were elevated in 25%, 40% and 36% of the patients, respectively, CRP was more often elevated in patients with bacterial infection alone than in those with viral or mixed viral-bacterial infections. No other correlation was seen between the radiological or laboratory findings and serologically identified viral, bacterial or mixed viralbacterial infections. By using a comprehensive serological panel, the causative agent could be found in over 50% of patients with pneumonia. We conclude that RSV and pneumococcus are the two most common organisms causing pneumonia in children. Our results suggest that mixed viral-bacterial aetiology is common in lower respiratory tract infections affecting children.","output":"Aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia in children treated in hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The invasion ecology principles illustrated in many ecosystems have not yet been explored in the context of fomite transmission. We hypothesized that invaders in fomite transmission are trackable, are neutrally distributed between hands and environmental surfaces, and exhibit a proximity effect. To test this hypothesis, a surrogate invader, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, was spread by a root carrier in an office housing more than 20 participants undertaking normal activities, and the microbiotas on skin and environmental surfaces were analyzed before and after invasion. First, we found that the invader was trackable. Its identity and emission source could be determined using microbial-interaction networks, and the root carrier could be identified using a rank analysis. Without prior information, L. bulgaricus could be identified as the invader emitted from a source that exclusively contained the invader, and the probable root carrier could be located. In addition to the single-taxon invasion by L. bulgaricus, multiple-taxon invasion was observed, as genera from sputum/saliva exhibited co-occurrence relationships on skin and environmental surfaces. Second, the invader had a below-neutral distribution in a neutral community model, suggesting that hands accrued heavier invader contamination than environmental surfaces. Third, a proximity effect was observed on a surface touch network. Invader contamination on surfaces decreased with increasing geodesic distance from the hands of the carrier, indicating that the carrier's touching behaviors were the main driver of fomite transmission. Taken together, these results demonstrate the invasion ecology principles in fomite transmission and provide a general basis for the management of ecological fomite transmission. IMPORTANCE Fomite transmission contributes to the spread of many infectious diseases. However, pathogens in fomite transmission typically are either investigated individually without considering the context of native microbiotas or investigated in a nondiscriminatory way from the dispersal of microbiotas. In this study, we adopted an invasion ecology framework in which we considered pathogens as invaders, the surface environment as an ecosystem, and human behaviors as the driver of microbial dispersal. With this approach, we assessed the ability of quantitative ecological theories to track and forecast pathogen movements in fomite transmission. By uncovering the relationships between the invader and native microbiotas and between human behaviors and invader/microbiota dispersal, we demonstrated that fomite transmission follows idiosyncratic invasion ecology principles. Our findings suggest that attempts to manage fomite transmission for public health purposes should focus on the microbial communities and anthropogenic factors involved, in addition to the pathogens.","output":"Fomite Transmission Follows Invasion Ecology Principles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 pandemic continues to unfold, the number of heart transplants completed in the United States has been declining steadily.

It is unclear whether and to what extent patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases are willing and in a position to deal with the new media, such as video consultation. METHODS: In the middle of the pandemic in May 2020 outpatients were surveyed using a standardized questionnaire in order to document their possibilities and willingness to participate in a video consultation. The treating physicians were asked whether carrying out a video consultation was considered to be a possible and meaningful option. RESULTS: Overall, 232 patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases were surveyed (64.7% female, average age 54.0a? 15.2 years), seropositive (na?= 58) and seronegative (na?= 51) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA, na?= 77) including axial SpA (axSpA) and psoriatic arthropathy (PsA) as well as collagenosis and vasculitis (CoV, na?= 46). The mean duration of disease was 5.5a? 8.2 years, whereby in 75 patients (32.3%) it was the first diagnosis. The mean disease activity (0-10, subjective patient self-estimation) was 4.7a? 2.5. Overall, 176 patients were basically aware of the possibility to carry out video consultations (75.9%) and 166 considered that they were technically capable to participate (71.6%) but only 131 were principally willing to participate (56.5%). Logistic regression analyses showed that the willingness to participate in video consultations decreased with increasing age (?a?= 0.28, pa?= 0.01). According to the medical estimation video consultations were thought to be principally possible for 161 patients for technical reasons (69.4%) and for 127 for medical reasons (54.7%); however, a video consultation within the framework of treatment was only considered to be meaningful by the physician for 76 patients (32.8%). CONCLUSION: Not all patients can or want to participate in video consultations and the willingness declines with increasing age. The estimation of the meaningfulness of video consultations by physicians was also limited to approximately one third of the patients surveyed.

This paper seeks to ascertain whether (and how) the COVID-19 pandemic might disrupt or reinforce existing patterns of doctor emigration. METHOD: This paper draws on qualitative interviews with 31 hospital doctors in Ireland, undertaken in June-July 2020. As the researchers were subject to a government mandated work-from-home order at that time, they utilised Twitter&#8482; to contact potential respondents (snowball sampling); and conducted interviews via Zoom&#8482; or telephone. FINDINGS: Two cohorts of doctors were identified; COVID Returners (N = 12) and COVID Would-be Emigrants (N = 19). COVID Returners are Irish-trained emigrant doctors who returned to Ireland in March 2020, just as global travel ground to a halt. They returned to be closer to home and in response to a pandemic-related recruitment call issued by the Irish government. COVID Would-be Emigrants are hospital doctors considering emigration. Some had experienced pandemic-related disruptions to their emigration plans as a result of travel restrictions and border closures. However, most of the drivers of emigration mentioned by respondents related to underlying problems in the Irish health system rather than to the pandemic, i.e. a culture of medical emigration, poor working conditions and the limited availability of posts in the Irish health system. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This paper illustrates how the pandemic intensified and reinforced, rather than radically altered, the dynamics of doctor emigration from Ireland. Ireland must begin to prioritise doctor retention and return by developing a coherent policy response to the underlying drivers of doctor emigration.","output":"COVID-19 and doctor emigration: the case of Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has, to date, led to over 13.6 million infections and nearly 600,000 deaths.

The identified epitopes, each one of nine amino acids, have high sequence similarity to the equivalent epitopes of SARS-CoV virus, which are known to elicit an effective T cell response in vitro. Moreover, we give a structural explanation for the binding of SARS-CoV-2-epitopes to MHC molecules.

The penetrance of this variant in the antigen experienced human population can be explained in part by the relatively low levels of plasma neutralizing activity against Omicron in people who were infected or vaccinated with the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain4C7. The 3rd mRNA vaccine dose produces an initial increase in circulating anti-Omicron neutralizing antibodies, but titers remain 10-20-fold lower than against Wuhan-Hu-1 and are, in many cases, insufficient to prevent infection7. Despite the reduced protection from infection, individuals that received 3 doses of an mRNA vaccine were highly protected from the more serious consequences of infection8. Here we examine the memory B cell repertoire in a longitudinal cohort of individuals receiving 3 mRNA vaccine doses9,10. We find that the 3rd dose is accompanied by an increase in, and evolution of, anti-receptor binding domain specific memory B cells. The increase is due to expansion of memory B cell clones that were present after the 2nd vaccine dose as well as the emergence of new clones. The antibodies encoded by these cells showed significantly increased potency and breadth when compared to antibodies obtained after the 2nd vaccine dose. Notably, the increase in potency was especially evident among newly developing clones of memory cells that differed from the persisting clones in targeting more conserved regions of the RBD. Overall, more than 50% of the analyzed neutralizing antibodies in the memory compartment obtained from individuals receiving a 3rd mRNA vaccine dose neutralized Omicron. Thus, individuals receiving 3 doses of an mRNA vaccine encoding Wuhan-Hu-1, have a diverse memory B cell repertoire that can respond rapidly and produce antibodies capable of clearing even diversified variants such as Omicron. These data help explain why a 3rd dose of an mRNA vaccine that was not specifically designed to protect against variants is effective against variant-induced serious disease.","output":"Increased Potency and Breadth of SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies After a Third mRNA Vaccine Dose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article provides an overview of biosecurity measures that apply to all potential pathogens in the horse exemplified by the control and management of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (an emergent disease), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (a zoonotoc disease), and strangles in horses, an ancient disease that remains a scourge of susceptible Equidae.

Methods: : This was a cross-sectional survey in which we inquired about the Mexican population's behavior and preventive measures. In total, 4004 subjects from the general population responded to the survey. The survey comprised a questionnaire that included demographic data, housing conditions, daily coexistence with people, use of preventive measures, confidence in the Mexican health-care sector, acceptance of medical procedures, and knowledge of COVID-19. Results: : Participants' mean age was 30  13.7 years, and 43.8% of participants reported at least one comorbidity. Almost 99% of the participants mentioned knowing the symptoms of COVID-19.

RESULTS: Among 46 441 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 29 040 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.2 [17.8] years; 13 059 [45.0%] women and 15713 [54.1%] men; 6797 Black patients [23.4%], 5325 Hispanic patients [18.3%], and 16 507 White patients [57.8%]) met inclusion criteria. A total of 5069 patients (17.5%) with metabolic syndrome were compared with 23 971 control patients (82.5%) without metabolic syndrome. In adjusted analyses, metabolic syndrome was associated with increased risk of ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.32 [95% CI, 1.14-1.53]), invasive mechanical ventilation (aOR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.28-1.65]), ARDS (aOR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.12-1.66]), and mortality (aOR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.08-1.31]) and prolonged hospital LOS (median [IQR], 8.0 [4.2-15.8] days vs 6.8 [3.4-13.0] days; P < .001) and ICU LOS (median [IQR], 7.0 [2.8-15.0] days vs 6.4 [2.7-13.0] days; P < .001). Each additional metabolic syndrome criterion was associated with increased risk of ARDS in an additive fashion (1 criterion: 1147 patients with ARDS [10.4%]; P = .83; 2 criteria: 1191 patients with ARDS [15.3%]; P < .001; 3 criteria: 817 patients with ARDS [19.3%]; P < .001; 4 criteria: 203 patients with ARDS [24.3%]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that metabolic syndrome was associated with increased risks of ARDS and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The association with ARDS was cumulative for each metabolic syndrome criteria present.","output":"Metabolic Syndrome and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parenting quality is associated with child cognitive and executive functions (EF), which are important predictors of social and academic development. However, children vary in their susceptibility to parenting behaviors, and the neurobiological underpinnings of this susceptibility are poorly understood. In a prospective longitudinal study, we examined whether neonatal total brain volume (TBV) and subregions of interest (i.e., hippocampus (HC) and anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG)) moderate the association between maternal sensitivity and cognitive/EF development across early childhood. Neonates underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Their cognitive performance and EF was characterized at 2.0  0.1 years (N = 53) and at 4.9  0.8 years (N = 36) of age. Maternal sensitivity was coded based on observation of a standardized play situation at 6-mo postpartum. Neonatal TBV moderated the association between maternal sensitivity and 2-year working memory as well as all 5-year cognitive outcomes, suggesting that the positive association between maternal sensitivity and child cognition was observed only among children with large or average but not small TBV as neonates. Similar patterns were observed for TBV-corrected HC and ACG volumes. The findings suggest that larger neonatal TBV, HC and ACG may underlie susceptibility to the environment and affect the degree to which parenting quality shapes long-term cognitive development.","output":"Neonatal brain volume as a marker of differential susceptibility to parenting quality and its association with neurodevelopment across early childhood."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mesoporous crystalline niobium oxide with tunable pore sizes was synthesized via sol-gel based inverse micelle method.

Methods This prospective and cross-sectional study included 360 low-risk singleton pregnancies between 20 and 36 + 6 weeks of gestation. MAPSE, TAPSE, and SAPSE were measured by M-mode in real time in an apical or basal four-chamber view through placing the cursor at the atrioventricular junction, marked by the valve rings at the tricuspid, mitral, and basal septum, respectively. A regression analysis was done to determine the appropriate polynomial equation model for both measurements and standard deviation (SD) values in relation to gestational age (GA). The intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and limits of agreement (LoA). Results There was a significant positive correlation between MAPSE (r=0.705, p<0.0001), TAPSE (r=0.804, p<0.0001), and SAPSE (r=0.690, p<0.0001) and GA.

Children with COVID-19 differ from adults in that they are less often and less severely affected. Additional precautions required in the management of children address their increased radiosensitivity, need for accompanying carers, and methods for dealing with children in a mixed adult-paediatric institution. In this guidance document, our aim is to define a pragmatic strategy for imaging children with an emphasis on proven or suspected COVID-19 cases. Children suspected of COVID-19 should not be imaged routinely. Imaging should be performed only when expected to alter patient management, depending on symptoms, preexisting conditions and clinical evolution. In order to prevent disease transmission, it is important to manage the inpatient caseload effectively by triaging children and carers outside the hospital, re-scheduling nonurgent elective procedures and managing symptomatic children and carers as COVID-19 positive until proven otherwise. Within the imaging department one should consider conducting portable examinations with COVID-19 machines or arranging dedicated COVID-19 paediatric imaging sessions and performing routine nasopharyngeal swab testing before imaging under general anaesthesia. Finally, regular personal hygiene, appropriate usage of personal protective equipment, awareness of which procedures are considered aerosol generating and information on how to best disinfect imaging machinery after examinations should be highlighted to all staff members.

METHODS: A case-control study in 32 individuals with RA, 28 with SLE, and 29 in the control group (CG). The questionnaire SF-36 (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36) was used to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and OHIP-14 (Oral Health Impact Profile-14) was used to evaluate the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). The severity of xerostomia was evaluated by the Xerostomia Inventory (XI). In the clinical examination, decayed (D-T), missing(M-T), and filled teeth (F-T) (DMF-T), periodontal status, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), unstimulated whole salivary flow rate (UWSFR), and stimulated whole salivary flow rate (SWSFR) were also assessed. Data were analyzed by Student's t tests, chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and Spearman's correlation. RESULTS: Individuals with RA had a higher caries index (D-T/p = 0.004) and more frequent periodontal disease (PI/p = 0.017). In the SLE group, there was a significant lower salivary flow (SFR/p = 0.016, SFMS/p = 0.004) and severe xerostomia (p = 0.002). The impact of ORHQoL in individuals with RA occurred due to oral candidiasis, halitosis, and xerostomia, compromising the HRQoL. Overall, OHRQoL and HRQoL were more compromised in individuals with SLE, with xerostomia being the main oral problem. CONCLUSION: Individuals with RA and SLE present oral diseases with negative impact on their QoL.

The energy service providers are affected by several events such as weather, volatility, and special events. As such, the prediction of these events and having a time window for taking preventive measures are crucial for service providers. Electrical load forecasting can be modeled as a time series prediction problem. One solution is to capture spatial correlations, spatial-temporal relations, and time-dependency of such temporal networks in the time series. Previously, different machine learning methods have been used for time series prediction tasks; however, there is still a need for new research to improve the performance of short-term load forecasting models. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning model to predict electric load consumption using Dual-Stage Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Networks in which the attention mechanism is used in both encoder and decoder stages. The encoder attention layer identifies important features from the input vector, whereas the decoder attention layer is used to overcome the limitations of using a fixed context vector and provides a much longer memory capacity. The proposed model improves the performance for short-term load forecasting (STLF) in terms of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) scores. To evaluate the predictive performance of the proposed model, the UCI household electric power consumption (HEPC) dataset has been used during the experiments.

HMB can give rise to iron deficiency (ID) and, in severe cases, iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). AIM: To review current guidelines for the management of HMB, with regards to screening for anemia, measuring iron levels, and treating ID/IDA with iron replacement therapy and non-iron-based treatments. METHODS: The literature was searched for English-language guidelines relating to HMB published between 2010 and 2020, using the PubMed database, web searching, and retrieval of clinical guidelines from professional societies. RESULTS: Overall, 55 guidelines mostly originating from North America and Europe were identified and screened. Twenty-two were included in this review, with the majority (16/22) focusing on guidance to screen women with HMB for anemia. The guidance varied with respect to identifying symptoms, the criteria for testing, and diagnostic hemoglobin levels for ID/IDA. There was inconsistency concerning screening for ID, with 11/22 guidelines providing no recommendations for measurement of iron levels and four contrasting guidelines explicitly advising against initial assessment of iron levels. In terms of treatment, 8/22 guidelines provided guidance on iron therapy, with oral iron administration generally recommended as first-line treatment for ID and/or IDA. Four guidelines recommended intravenous iron administration for severe anemia, in non-responders, or before surgery. Three guidelines provided hemoglobin thresholds for choosing between oral or intravenous iron treatment. Four guidelines discussed the use of transfusion for severe IDA. CONCLUSION: Many of the guidelines for managing HMB recognize the importance of treating anemia, but there is a lack of consensus in relation to screening for ID and use of iron therapy. Consequently, ID/IDA associated with HMB is likely to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. A consensus guidance, covering all aspects of screening and management of ID/IDA in women with HMB, is needed to optimize health outcomes in these patients.","output":"A Review of Clinical Guidelines on the Management of Iron Deficiency and Iron-Deficiency Anemia in Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polyphenols are a large family of more than 10,000 naturally occurring compounds, which exert countless pharmacological, biological and physiological benefits for human health including several chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases.

A positive result using Tru\\\\cut biopsy (TCB) and fine\\\\needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has high diagnostic specificity, but information about the capacity of these techniques to correctly identify cats with FIP lesions is not available. Objectives: The diagnostic sensitivity of TCB and FNAB for detecting liver and kidney histologic lesions caused by FIP was evaluated. Methods: TCB and FNAB specimens collected mainly at necropsy from 25 cats with FIP were analyzed. Diagnostic sensitivity was calculated on the basis of the number of false\\\\negative and true\\\\positive specimens, compared with the number of organs bearing histologic lesions of FIP. Results: Diagnostic sensitivity was higher for hepatic TCB (64%) and FNAB (82%) than for renal (39% and 42%, respectively) procedures.

Combined analysis of TCB and FNAB specimens collected from the same organ increased the diagnostic sensitivity for liver (86%) and kidney (48%). The sensitivity of immunohistochemical/cytochemical analysis was low (11C38% depending on the technique), probably due to variable distribution of feline coronavirus in the lesions.

Two thousand and one hundred sequences representing the seven clades of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 were included. Patterns of genetic diversifications and nucleotide evolutionary rate were estimated for the spike genomic region. The haplotype networks showed a star shape, where multiple haplotypes with few nucleotide differences diverge from a common ancestor. Four hundred seventy\\\\nine different haplotypes were defined in the seven analyzed clades. The main haplotype, named Hap\\\\1, was the most frequent for clades G (54%), GH (54%), and GR (56%) and a different haplotype (named Hap\\\\252) was the most important for clades L (63.3%), O (39.7%), S (51.7%), and V (70%).

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a pragmatic, qualitative descriptive study for which we conducted semistructured interviews with 11 young people with T1DM aged 12C16 years and 10 of their parents who attended an outpatient diabetes service in Canberra, Australia. Thematic analysis was conducted in accordance with the methods outlined by Braun and Clarke. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: feeling vulnerable, new ways of accessing care and trust in the interdisciplinary diabetes healthcare team. Participants believed having T1DM made them more vulnerable to poor outcomes if they contracted COVID-19, resulting in avoidance of face-to-face care. Telephone consultations offered a convenient and contact-free way to undertake 3-monthly reviews. The greatest difference between telephone and face-to-face consultations was not having access to the whole interdisciplinary diabetes support team at one appointment, physical examination and haemoglobin A1c testing during telehealth consultations. Participants trusted that clinicians would arrange face-to-face meetings if required. Some felt a video option might be better than telephone, reflecting in part the need for more training in communication skills for remote consultations. CONCLUSION: Young people with T1DM and their parents require collaborative care and contact with multiple healthcare professionals to facilitate self-management and glycaemic control.

Bioaccessible and non-bioaccessible metal(loid) concentrations in coarse and fine PM from personal samplers were determined by ICP-MS after extraction/digestion. Metal(loid) concentration in biomarkers was measured after alkaline dilution (whole blood) and acid digestion (fingernails and scalp hair) by ICP-MS as well. Results were discussed in terms of exposure, considering the distance to the main Mn source, and sex. In terms of exposure, significant differences were found for Mn in all the studied fractions of PM, As in whole blood, Mn and Cu in scalp hair and Mn and Pb in fingernails, with all concentrations being higher for those living closer to the Mn source, with the exception of Cu in scalp hair. Furthermore, the analysis of the correlation between Mn levels in the studied biomarkers and the wind-weighted distance to the main source of Mn allows us to conclude that scalp hair and mainly fingernails are appropriate biomarkers of long-term airborne Mn exposure. This was also confirmed by the significant positive correlations between scalp hair Mn and bioaccessible Mn in coarse and fine fractions, and between fingernails Mn and all PM fractions.

Households in particular represent a close-contact environment with high probability of transmission between persons of different ages and with different roles in society. METHODS: Complete households with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive case in the Netherlands (March-May 2020) were included. At least three home visits were performed during 4-6 week of follow-up, collecting naso- and oropharyngeal swabs, oral fluid, feces and blood samples for molecular and serological analyses of all household members. Symptoms were recorded from two weeks before the first visit through to the final visit. Infection secondary attack rates (SAR) were estimated with logistic regression. A transmission model was used to assess transmission routes in the household. RESULTS: A total of 55 households with 187 household contacts were included. In 17 households no transmission took place, and in 11 households all persons were infected. Estimated infection SARs were high, ranging from 35% (95%CI: 24%-46%) in children to 51% (95%CI: 39%-63%) in adults. Estimated transmission rates in the household were high, with reduced susceptibility of children compared to adolescents and adults (0.67; 95%CI: 0.40-1.1). CONCLUSION: Estimated infection SARs were higher than reported in earlier household studies, presumably owing to our dense sampling protocol. Children were shown to be less susceptible than adults, but the estimated infection SAR in children was still high.

However, due to the low density of protons and many airCtissue junctions, its application in the lung is limited. Thus, X?ray-based methods are often used here (with the well-known disadvantages of ionizing radiation). OBJECTIVES: In this review, we discuss pulmonary MRI with hyperpolarized xenon-129 (Xe-MRI). Xe-MRI provides unique valuable insights into lung microstructure and function, including gas exchange with red blood cellsparameters not accessible by any standard clinical methods. METHODS: By magnetic labelling, i.e. hyperpolarization, the signal from xenon-129 is amplified by up to 100,000 times. In this process, electrons from rubidium are first polarized to 100% using laser light and then transferred to xenon by collisions. Then the hyperpolarized gas is brought to the patient in a bag and inhaled shortly before the MRI scan. RESULTS: Using special programming (sequences) of the MRI, the ventilation, microstructure, or gas exchange of the lungs, can be displayed in 3D. This allows, for example, quantitative visualization of ventilation defects, alveolar size, tissue gas uptake and gas transfer to the blood.

Valid data was extracted to make forest and sensitivity analysis plots using Review Manager 5.4 and Stata software. Hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate the relationship between different expression of EWSAT1 and patients' prognosis and clinicopathological features. RESULTS: 7 studies were screened for this review, including 550 samples.

Silver has served as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial since ancient times but suffers from major challenges such as moderate antimicrobial activity, nonspecific toxicity, and difficulty to be visualized in situ. Here, we propose a new photoactive silver nanoagent that relies on a photosensitizer-triggered cascade reaction to liberate Ag(+) on bacterial surfaces exclusively, allowing the precise killing of MDR bacteria. Additionally, the AgNP core acts as a backgroundless surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate for imaging the distribution of the nanoagents on bacterial surfaces and monitoring their metabolic dynamics in the infection sites. Methods: In this strategy, the photoactive antibacterial AgNP was decorated with photosensitizers (Chlorin e6, Ce6) and Raman reporter (4-Mercaptobenzonitrile, 4-MB) to provide new opportunities for clinically monitoring and fighting MDR bacterial infections. Upon 655 nm laser activation, the Ce6 molecules produce ROS efficiently, triggering the rapid release of Ag(+) from the AgNP core to kill bacteria. Poly[4-O-(-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucopyranose] (GP) was introduced as bacteria-specific targeting ligands. SERS spectra of the prepared GP-Ce6/MB-AgNPs were recorded after injecting for 0.5, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h to track the dynamic metabolism of the nanoagents and thus guiding the antibacterial therapy. Results: This new antimicrobial strategy exerts a dramatically enhanced antibacterial activity. The in vitro antibacterial efficiencies of this non-antibiotic technique were up to 99.6% against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 98.8% against Escherichia coli (EC), while the in vivo antibacterial efficiencies for MRSA- and Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA)-infected mice models were 96.8% and 93.6%, respectively. Besides, backgroundless SERS signal intensity of the wound declined to the level of normal tissue until 24 h, indicating that the nanoagents had been completely metabolized from the infected area. Conclusion: Given the backgroundless monitoring ability, high antibacterial efficacy, and low toxicity, the photoactive cascading agents would hold great potential for MDR-bacterial detection and elimination in diverse clinical settings.","output":"Photoactive Silver Nanoagents for Backgroundless Monitoring and Precision Killing of Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the present study was to evaluate of serum metal levels in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity, and to investigate the independent association between serum metal profile and markers of lung damage.

Forty-four healthy subjects of the respective age were involved in the current study as the control group. Serum metal levels were evaluated using inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry. Examination of COVID-19 patients demonstrated that heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, C-reactive protein levels, as well as lung damage increased significantly with COVID-19 severity, whereas SpO(2) decreased gradually. Increasing COVID-19 severity was also associated with a significant gradual decrease in serum Ca, Fe, Se, Zn levels as compared to controls, whereas serum Cu and especially Cu/Zn ratio were elevated. No significant group differences in serum Mg and Mn levels were observed. Serum Ca, Fe, Se, Zn correlated positively with SpO(2), being inversely associated with fever, lung damage, and C-reactive protein concentrations. Opposite correlations were observed for Cu and Cu/Zn ratio. In regression models, serum Se levels were inversely associated with lung damage independently of other markers of disease severity, anthropometric, biochemical, and hemostatic parameters.

Such a process, called affective semiosis, represents an adaptive response to the emergency in the short-term. Second, we argue that this adaptive value provided by affective semiosis will be reduced when we have to deal with the process of managing the transition to the post-crisis and the governance of the medium and long-term impact of the crisis. Third, we suggest that, in order to manage the pandemic crisis on a longer temporal frame, affective semiosis has to be integrated with less generalized and more domain-specific ways of interpreting reality. To this end, semiotic capital (i.e., culturally-mediated symbolic resources) should be promoted in order to enable people to interiorize the supra-individual and collective dimension of life.

The aim of this rapid review is to describe the satisfaction, clinic productivity, clinical benefit, and costs associated with the virtual geriatric clinic model of care. METHODS: A rapid review of PubMed, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases was conducted up to April 2020. Two independent reviewers extracted the information. Four subdomains were focused on: satisfaction with the virtual geriatric clinic, clinic productivity, clinical benefit to patients, costs and any challenges associated with the virtual clinic process. RESULTS: Nine studies with 975 patients met our inclusion criteria. All were observational studies. Seven studies reported patients were satisfied with the virtual geriatric clinic model of care. Productivity outcomes included reports of cost-effectiveness, savings on transport, and improved waiting list metrics. Clinical benefits included successful polypharmacy reviews, and reductions in acute hospitalisation rates. Varying challenges were reported for both clinicians and patients in eight of the nine studies. Hearing impairments and difficulty with technology added to anxieties experienced by patients. Physicians missed the added value of a thorough physical examination and had concerns about confidentiality. CONCLUSION: Virtual geriatric clinics demonstrate evidence of productivity, benefit to patients, cost effectiveness and patient satisfaction with the treatment provided. In the current suboptimal pandemic climate, virtual geriatric clinics may allow Geriatricians to continue to provide an outpatient service, despite the encountered inherent challenges.","output":"Virtual geriatric clinics and the COVID-19 catalyst: a rapid review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The psychological effects of mass quarantine following the COVID-19 lockdown are likely to be significant. Emotional and behavioural responses to quarantine are related to a psychological state of anxiety. These and other emotions are normal and may even be adaptive. The exceptional circumstances of a national lockdown provide an opportunity to develop mental health literacy in the form of psychological first aid, to enable wider awareness of how individuals can contribute to listening and supporting others psychologically. This has potential implications for skilling clinicians and the public about responding to mental distress. As frontline health-care workers, general practitioners may themselves need to be recipients of psychological first aid and support as they deal with adverse consequences of the quarantine period.","output":"Psychological states of COVID-19 quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacteriophages are promising tools for the detection of fecal pollution in different environments, and particularly for viral pathogen risk assessment.

In the present work, the sigmoidal-Boltzmann mathematical model was applied to study the Covid-19 spread in 15 different countries. The cumulative number of infected persons I has been accurately fitted by the sigmoidal-Boltzmann equation (SBE), giving rise to different epidemiological parameters such as the pandemic peak tp, the maximum number of infected persons Imax, and the time of the epidemic stabilization t&#8734;. The time constant relative to the sigmoid &#916;t (called also the slope factor) was revealed to be the determining parameter which influences all the epidemiological parameters. Empirical laws between the different parameters allowed us to propose a modified sigmoidal-Boltzmann equation describing the spread of the pandemic. The expression of the spread speed Vp was further determined as a function of the sigmoid parameters. This made it possible to assess the maximum speed of spread of the virus Vpmax and to trace the speed profile in each country. In addition, for countries undergoing a second pandemic wave, the cumulative number of infected people I has been successfully adjusted by a double sigmoidal-Boltzmann equation (DSBE) allowing the comparison between the two waves. Finally, the comparison between the maximum virus spread of two waves Vp max 1 and Vp max 2 showed that the intensity of the second wave of Covid-19 is low compared to the first for all the countries studied.","output":"Mathematical model of Boltzmann's sigmoidal equation applicable to the spreading of the coronavirus (Covid-19) waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transcription factor NF-B is one of the central mediators of cellular signaling pathways. Under resting conditions, the canonical RelA-p50 (p65-p50) heterodimer NF-B remains sequestered in the cytoplasm in complex with its inhibitor IB. Signal-mediated activation of NF-B involves phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation of IB, and translocation of NF-B to the nucleus. It was recently shown that a long noncoding RNA (termed NKILA) can modulate the NF-B signaling circuit by interacting with the NF-B-IB complex in the cytoplasm. In the current study, we investigated the interaction of RNA sequences derived from NKILA with domains of NF-B and IB using NMR spectroscopy and native gel electrophoresis. Our results indicate that two RNA hairpin sequences interact with the DNA-binding domains of the Rel homology regions of RelA (p65) and p50 and that the same RNA sequences can affect the phosphorylation of the N-terminus of IB under low-salt conditions. We also observe that full-length RHR dimers (heterodimer of p65 and p50 and homodimer of p50) show a stronger interaction with the RNA hairpins than the individual domains of NF-B. All of the interactions we observe between fragments of NKILA and domains of NF-B are weak and nonspecific, consistent with the proposed function of the NKILA-NF-B-IB interaction in protecting the NFB-IB complex from aberrant activation of the NF-B signaling pathway.","output":"Interactions of a Long Noncoding RNA with Domains of NF-B and IB: Implications for the Inhibition of Non-Signal-Related Phosphorylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are lifesaving drugs, and inappropriate uses lead to the resistance that renders them ineffective. This study aims to understand knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) concerning antibiotic use and resistance among university students in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from January to April 2020 among students at Jahangirnagar University (JU), Bangladesh. Purposive sampling was conducted through an in-person interview using a structured questionnaire. Students from the faculties of biological sciences and non-biology background were included. The univariate ordinal regression technique was used to analyze the relationship between predictors and good knowledge about the antibiotics. A two-tailed p-value was calculated to determine statistical association. RESULTS: Out of 205 study participants, 92 and 113 responders were from biological science faculty and non-biology disciplines, respectively. Less than half of the students (42.4%) showed a good knowledge level (scores higher than 80%). Biology-background students possess better knowledge than non-biology students [odds ratio (OR) = 4.44, 95% confidence level (CL) (2.56, 7.70), p < 0.001]. A better attitude was noticed among all students. The self-medication rate was quite low, and more than 90% of students were found to consume antibiotics according to the physicians prescription. Lack of treatment adherence was recorded, and students admitted to stop-taking antibiotics when symptoms disappeared (48.67% biology and 36.26% non-biology). Multivariate regression analysis was unable to detect any significant association between self-medication and gender, student category or the level of knowledge about antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Students of biological science background possessed better knowledge indicating the importance of appropriate curriculum imparted in knowledge buildup. Introducing a short course about the risk and development of antibiotic resistance will grow the students awareness to avoid the resistance phenomenon.","output":"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of Antimicrobial Uses and Resistance Among Public University Students in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study evaluated patients' clinical state with the Diagnostic Interview for Psychoses (DIP), and assessed language and communication disturbances (LCD) with the RL-CC-SR in all participants (213 healthy controls (HC), 83 SZ patients, 31 SZ first-degree relatives). Data from the current sample of SZ (n=50), and HC (n=213) was analysed to calculate the relationships between LCD, social and clinical variables using descriptive statistics methods, T-test and Pearson's correlations (SPSS-26, 2019). RESULTS: The quotient scores (<6) and raw scores on all three CC-SR subscales demonstrated prominent LCD in SZ: (i) language structure (LS) (SZ:11.928.01, HC:7.545.91; p<0.001), (ii) pragmatic skills (PS) (SZ:11.3010.07, HC:8.717.39; p=0.040), (iii) social engagement (SE) (SZ:31.9411.76, HC:19.4210.35; p<0.001). In SZ, Pearson correlations of LS scores were significant for the DIP-items Odd Speech (p=0.033), and Social Engagement - Blunted Affect (p=0.042).

CONCLUSIONS: SZ patients are aware of their LCD at all levels of language structure, pragmatics, and nonverbal communication, but are unable to compensate. Disturbances of LS and PS in SZ patients relate to their poor social adjustment and functioning, and may prove to be associated with the primary negative symptoms domain of the disorder and its generally poor outcome.","output":"Use of the Communication Checklist - Self Report (Cc-Sr) in Schizophrenia: Language Impairments Correlate with Poor Premorbid Social Adjustment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is tightly regulated by messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences and structures in expressing two or more proteins with precise ratios from a single mRNA. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) between (Cy5)EF-G and (Cy3)tRNA(Lys), we studied the translational elongation dynamics of -1PRF in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene, which contains three frameshifting signals: a slippery sequence (A AAA AAG), a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and a downstream hairpin. The frameshift promoting signals mostly impair the EF-G-catalyzed translocation step of the two tRNA(Lys) and the slippery codons from the A- and P- sites. The hairpin acts as a road block slowing the translocation rate. The upstream SD sequence together with the hairpin promotes dissociation of futile EF-G and thus causes multiple EF-G driven translocation attempts. A slippery sequence also helps dissociation of the EF-G by providing alternative base-pairing options. These results indicate that frameshifting takes place during the repetitive ribosomal conformational changes associated with EF-G dissociation upon unsuccessful translocation attempts of the second slippage codon from the A- to the P- sites.","output":"EF-G catalyzed translocation dynamics in the presence of ribosomal frameshifting stimulatory signals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Real-time surveillance of search behavior on the Internet has achieved accessibility in measuring disease activity.

Time-series analyses with autoregressive integrated moving average models were conducted to fit and forecast the RSVs trends of each GI symptom before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Generalized additive models were used to quantify the effects of RSVs of GI symptoms on the incidence of COVID-19.

As such, community pharmacists can play a vital role in a country's response to various preventative and public health measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the essential nature of community pharmacy as a health service, community pharmacies are unlikely to shut down in any foreseeable lockdown scenario.

Upon reviewing the recommendations of 15 selected countries across five continents (Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America, and Africa) on social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in community pharmacies, we found inconsistencies in the recommended social distance to be practiced within the community pharmacies. There were also varying recommendations on the use of PPE by the pharmacy personnel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: SLE patients monitored by a single Italian centre were interviewed between February and July 2020. Patients were considered to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infections in case of 1) positive nasopharyngeal swab; 2) positive serology associated with COVID19 suggesting symptoms. The following data were also recorded: clinical symptoms, adoption of social distancing measures, disease activity and treatment discontinuation. RESULTS: 332 patients were enrolled in the study. Six patients (1.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the incidence being significantly higher in the subgroup of patients treated with biological Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (p = 0.005), while no difference was observed for other therapies, age at enrollment, disease duration, type of cumulative organ involvement or adoption of social isolation. The course of the disease was mild. Thirty-six patients (11.1%) discontinued at least part of their therapy during this time period, and 27 (8.1%) cases of disease flare were recorded. Correlation between flare and discontinuation of therapy was statistically significant (p<0.001). No significant increase of rate of flare in a subgroup of the same patients during 2020 was observed. CONCLUSION: Treatment discontinuation seems to be an important cause of disease flare.

METHODS: An online assessment that included demographic, clinical, and exposure information and a blood sample was collected from 20,614 participants out of ~43,000 total employees at Beaumont Health, which includes eight hospitals distributed across the Detroit metropolitan area in southeast Michigan. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined using the EUROIMMUN assay. RESULTS: A total of 1,818 (8.8%) participants were seropositive between April 13 and May 28, 2020. Among the seropositive individuals, 44% reported that they were asymptomatic during the month prior to blood collection. Healthcare roles such as phlebotomy, respiratory therapy, and nursing/nursing support exhibited significantly higher seropositivity. Among participants reporting direct exposure to a COVID-19 positive individual, those wearing an N95/PAPR mask had a significantly lower seropositivity rate (10.2%) compared to surgical/other masks (13.1%) or no mask (17.5%).

Thus, ventilation support (invasive or noninvasive), has become a common practice in respiratory treatment of COVID-19 patients. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation usually require sedation to alleviate anxiety, pain and discomfort.

Thus, selection of appropriate sedative medications during this period is of utmost importance.

In 81 healthy controls, total tremor intensity was higher for the preferred hand and depended on age. Ten patientstreated for Parkinson's disease showed substantially increased tremor intensity, especially within the low-frequency window. This pattern was also apparent in 14 patients with de novo Parkinson's disease whose overall tremor intensity was only mildly elevated.

In these models, the effect of climate and community behavior change on the reproductive number is modeled. A baseline scenario is also defined as letting the epidemic grow naturally, with no prevention/control interventions. Different levels of intervention are also defined based on the extent of population isolation. Outcomes of each scenario on the number of infected cases are computed. Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals.

METHODS: DIA-RAMADAN was a real-world, observational, international, non-comparative study. The global study population was divided into three regional subgroups, with data gathered at inclusion 6-8 weeks prior to Ramadan (V0), during Ramadan (4.5 weeks) and 4-6 weeks after Ramadan (V1). Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients reporting &#8805; 1 symptomatic hypoglycaemic events (HE), which were collected using a patient diary along with other adverse events. RESULTS: Patient numbers from the three regions were n = 564 (46.5%; Indian sub-continent), n = 354 (29.1%; Middle East) and n = 296 (24.4%; South-East Asia). Patient baseline characteristics, demographics, fasting habits and antidiabetic treatments varied between regions. There were similar proportions of symptomatic HE between regions, with no severe HE. Significant weight reductions were observed in all regions following Ramadan, along with reductions in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose. CONCLUSION: These real-world study data indicate that gliclazide MR is safe and effective for management of type 2 diabetes during Ramadan in all three regions studied as part of DIA-RAMADAN.

Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) has been applied to influenza vaccine acceptance, but there is a lack of research applying PMT to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Additionally, prior research has suggested that coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and demographic factors may play a role in attitudes towards the vaccine. This study aimed to predict COVID-19 vaccination intention using PMT, coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, and demographic factors. Furthermore, vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were compared in relation to their coronavirus conspiracy beliefs. METHODS: An online survey was administered to 382 (278 vaccinated, and 104 unvaccinated) individuals in the United Kingdom (77 males, 301 females, one non-binary/third gender, and three unstated). Respondents mean age was 43.78 (SD = 12.58). RESULTS: A hierarchical multiple linear regression was performed in three stages. Initially, four PMT constructs - severity, susceptibility, maladaptive response costs, and self-efficacy - emerged as significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intention. The final model accounted for 75% of the variance and retained two significant predictors from PMT - maladaptive response rewards and self-efficacy - alongside coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and age. An independent t-test established that unvaccinated individuals held greater coronavirus conspiracy beliefs than vaccinated ones. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions and campaigns addressing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance should employ strategies increasing individuals perceived severity of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility, and perceived ability to get vaccinated, while decreasing perceived rewards of not getting vaccinated. Additionally, coronavirus conspiracy beliefs should be addressed, as these appear to play a role for some vaccine-hesitant individuals.","output":"Predicting COVID-19 Vaccination Intention Using Protection Motivation Theory and Conspiracy Beliefs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM: The speed and scope of the upheaval that COVID-19 inflicted on medical education made innovation a necessity. While medical students wanted high-quality, consolidated educational resources on COVID-19, the medical school faculty who typically produced such resources were increasingly burdened with clinical, administrative, and personal commitments. However, students eager to contribute to the pandemic response were well-suited to create these instructional materials for their peers. APPROACH: In mid-March 2020, a group of students at Harvard Medical School came together to synthesize the key facts and collate the best existing educational materials about the COVID-19 pandemic into a unified learning resource. The materials were faculty reviewed and shared freely online. The curriculum now contains 8 modules that are updated regularly. Throughout this process, the student authors prioritized accessibility, iterative improvement, and effective pedagogy. OUTCOMES: To date, nearly 80,000 users from 132 countries have accessed the curriculum. It has been referenced or incorporated into courses at Harvard Medical School and more than 30 other medical schools across the country. About 40% of all users are from outside the United States, and the materials have been translated into 28 languages. This effort has spurred a number of other educational initiatives led by medical student groups in the United States and abroad. NEXT STEPS: As understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly changing, the student authors' immediate goal is to keep the curriculum up to date in the months to come. They plan to maintain existing partnerships with medical schools and student groups around the world while pursuing new opportunities to expand the curriculum's reach, provide education, and build community. Students and educators alike should leverage student-driven education efforts to benefit other learners both within and importantly beyond their institutions.","output":"Learning During and From a Crisis: The Student-Led Development of a COVID-19 Curriculum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An emerging area of research extends work on couple functioning and physical health to gut health, a critical marker of general health and known to diminish with age.

Participants were recruited from the community using a variety of methods including social media. Among 41 persons responding with interest across recruitment sources, 32 were contacted for screening. Inclusion criteria were: age 60+, marriage or cohabiting partnership, and English speaking/understanding. Exclusion criteria were a gastrointestinal disorder, receiving enteric nutrition, use of antibiotics (past month), cancer treatment (past 6 months), and a +COVID-19 diagnosis (past 2 months). Among 31 eligible couples, 30 consented. All 60 participants completed questionnaires and provided a stool sample using DNAgenoteks OMR-200 collection kit, chosen for its ease and because samples can be stored at room temperature for 60 days.

Rather than cooperate to contain and respond to a common threat, the world's leading powers-the United States and China-have increasingly blamed each other through wildly speculative theories about the origins of the virus. The World Health Organization sought to coordinate a global response, but it has been hamstrung and has come under attack. Given past cooperation between major powers to mobilize and eradicate smallpox and previous US leadership to fight HIV/AIDS and the 2014 West African Ebola crisis, the limited cooperation and lack of leadership are puzzling. What explains the anemic global response to date? This article draws from structural international relations theory to suggest a partial but somewhat dissatisfying answer. International organizations are inherently weak and now face opposition by major powers. The international system simultaneously incentivizes states to cooperate and address common threats, but it also encourages countries to take care of themselves, potentially at the expense of others. Which of these motives dominates cannot be explained by structural theory, thus requiring us to look to other factors such as the attributes of states and leaders themselves.","output":"Understanding the Anemic Global Response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the changing role of scientists, clinicians, ethicists, and educators in advocacy as they rapidly translate their findings to inform practice and policy.

The number of online shopping rocketed due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and movement control order (MCO) enforced by the Malaysian government. The current situation contributes to the volume of the parcel that needs to be delivered by delivery companies in Malaysia. The case of unattended parcel delivery, parcel lost, and failed delivery attempts had caused a lot of trouble to the household and the delivery company. It costs time and money because the household lost their valuable parcel, and the delivery company needs to reschedule the delivery. ParcelRestBox aims to overcome these issues by accepting parcels delivered without requiring the recipient to be present and send a delivery notification to the household to alert parcel delivered. This paper discusses on the design and the development of the ParcelRestBox prototype towards the actual development of this system. The ParcelRestBox development is significant to households or recipients, delivery companies, and property developers. ParcelRestBox consists of a ParcelRestBox device with NodeMCU V3 ESP8266 microcontroller, infrared sensor, and Android mobile application. The Mobile Application Development Life Cycle (MADLC) methodology is adopted as a guideline in the project development. The ParcelRestBox mobile application works as an interface for the recipient to interact with the ParcelRestBox device.

However, these efforts are typically reactive and symptom-focused and do not provide comprehensive, wrap-around, customized treatments that capture an individual's holistic mental health model as it unfolds over time. Recognizing that each individual is unique, we present the notion of Personalized Mental Health Navigation (MHN): a therapist-in-the-loop, cybernetic goal-based system that deploys a continuous cyclic loop of measurement, estimation, guidance, to steer the individual's mental health state towards a healthy zone. We outline the major components of MHN that is premised on the development of an individual's personal mental health state, holistically represented by a high-dimensional cover of multiple knowledge layers such as emotion, biological patterns, sociology, behavior, and cognition. We demonstrate the feasibility of the personalized MHN approach via a 12-month pilot case study for holistic stress management in college students and highlight an instance of a therapist-in-the-loop intervention using MHN for monitoring, estimating, and proactively addressing moderately severe depression over a sustained period of time.

Despite the fact that the majority of infected patients were managed in outpatient settings, little is known about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical comorbidity and the pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings. Materials and Methods: We performed an observational, retrospective analysis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings in Naples, Italy between 9 March and 1 May 2020. Data were sourced from the prospectively maintained Health Search (HS)/Thales database, shared by 128 primary care physicians (PCPs) in Naples, Italy. The clinical features and pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization and managed in outpatient settings have been described. Results: A total of 351 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (mean age 54  17 years; 193 males) with outpatient management were evaluated. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (35%). The distribution of cardiovascular comorbidities showed no gender-related differences. A total of 201 patients (57.3%) were treated with at least one experimental drug for COVID-19. Azithromycin, alone (42.78%) or in combination (27.44%), was the most widely used experimental anti-COVID drug in outpatient settings. Low Molecular Weight Heparin and Cortisone were prescribed in 24.87% and 19.4% of the study population, respectively.

At the same time, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic impact on financial markets all over the world and caused an increased level of uncertainty;the stock markets were no exception either. Most of the studies on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stock markets are based either on the analysis of a relatively short period (the beginning of pandemic) or a longer period, which, in turn, is very heterogeneous in terms of both the information available on the COVID-19 virus and the measures taken to contain the virus and address the consequences of the pandemic. However, it is very important to assess the impact not only at the beginning of the pandemic but also in the subsequent periods and to compare the nature of this impact;the studies of this type are still fragmentary. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stock markets of two of the most severely affected European countriesItaly and Spain. To reach the aim of the research OLS regression models, heteroscedasticity-corrected models, GARCH (1,1) models, and VAR-based impulse response functions are employed. The results reveal that the stock market reaction to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic differs depending on the country and period analyzed: OLS regression and heteroscedasticity-corrected models have not revealed the statistically significant impact of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, while impulse response functions demonstrated the non-zero primary response of analyzed markets to the COVID-19 shock, and GARCH models (in the case of Spain) confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic increased the volatility of stock market return. This research contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive impact assessment both during the whole pre-vaccination period of the pandemic and during different stages of this period.","output":"Stock Market Reactions during Different Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cases of Italy and Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most commonly injured ligament in the human body is an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

METHODS Patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy for stroke were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2011). Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the association of surgical timing with mortality, discharge to institutional care, and poor outcome (a composite end point including death, tracheostomy and gastrostomy, or discharge to institutional care). Covariates included patient demographics, comorbidities, year of admission, and hospital characteristics. However, standard stroke severity scales and infarct volume were not available. RESULTS Among 1301 admissions, 55.8% (n=726) underwent surgery within 48 hours. Teaching hospital admission was associated with earlier surgery (P=0.02). The timing of intervention was not associated with in-hospital mortality. However, when evaluated continuously, later surgery was associated with increased odds of discharge to institutional care (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.31, P=0.005) and of a poor outcome (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.23; P=0.02). When evaluated dichotomously, the odds of discharge to institutional care and of a poor outcome did not differ at 48 hours after hospital admission, but increased when surgery was pursued after 72 hours. Subgroup analyses found no association of surgical timing with outcomes among patients who had not sustained herniation. CONCLUSION s-In this nationwide analysis, early decompressive craniectomy was associated with superior outcomes.

We also evaluated psychiatric visits characteristics during a one-month period after the declaration of deconfinement, and we compared those characteristics to characteristics observed during the same month over the previous 4 years. RESULTS: The number of psychiatric visits to our emergency department during deconfinement was similar to the number observed in the same month of previous years. However, the proportion of psychiatric visits to our emergency department among all visits to the ED rose during deconfinement to a level never before observed. The mean proportion of psychiatric admissions to all ED admissions rose from 3.5% in past years to 5.3% during deconfinement (p = 0.013).

Standardised laboratory evaluations, and for those that met the published criteria, field testing in the Falcon-C19 research study and UK pilots were performed (UK COVID-19 testing centres, hospital, schools, armed forces). Findings: 4/64 LFDs so far have desirable performance characteristics (orient Gene, Deepblue, Abbott and Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test). All these LFDs have a viral antigen detection of >90% at 100,000 RNA copies/ml. 8951 Innova LFD tests were performed with a kit failure rate of 5.6% (502/8951, 95% CI: 5.1-6.1), false positive rate of 0.32% (22/6954, 95% CI: 0.20-0.48). Viral antigen detection/sensitivity across the sampling cohort when performed by laboratory scientists was 78.8% (156/198, 95% CI 72.4-84.3). Interpretation: Our results suggest LFDs have promising performance characteristics for mass population testing and can be used to identify infectious positive individuals. The Innova LFD shows good viral antigen detection/sensitivity with excellent specificity, although kit failure rates and the impact of training are potential issues.

It has recently been pointed out that they appear to play a part in recognition of virus and to have the capacity to perform direct action against viruses. This study aimed to seek for an association between eosinophils count < 10 /mm3 and mortality in an older adults suffering from COVID-19 hospitalized in a specific geriatric ward. Methods: : This observational retrospective study was conducted in a French geriatric ward from March 17 to April 18, 2020. All 118 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 over 70 yo in acute stay care were enrolled. Patients with a treatment or a condition which could interfere with eosinophil count were excluded. Results: : No statistical difference was found between surviving or deceased patient regarding age (mean age (SD): 87 years (7)) and sex (34% of males).

This review summarizes the available data on HPA axis impairment in GC-treated SARS-CoV-2 patients, focusing on the risk of adrenal insufficiency and on potential drug interactions during concomitant treatments. METHODS: Literature on the impact of GCs therapy on HPA axis and on the consequences of coadministration of GCs and other drugs in SARS-CoV-2 patients has been reviewed. RESULTS: GC treatment can cause symptoms of hypercortisolism, especially in patients with individual hypersensibility, or hypoadrenalism after drug withdrawal, due to hypothalamicCpituitaryCadrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with consequences in terms of increased morbidity and mortality risk. On the other hand, in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients cortisol secretion could be insufficient also due to critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI). In addition, in this clinical context, the co-administration of antiretroviral drugs and corticosteroids may trigger drugCdrug interaction and enhance the exposure to the latter ones, metabolized through the CYP450 CYP3A pathway, severely impacting on HPA axis.

METHODS: Patients who had stable pain and functional outcome scores over the preceding 2 years were enrolled in a local prospectively collected adult spinal deformity (ASD) database. A reanalysis of their SRS22, ODI and SF-36 data 14 days into confinement were compared to their last pre-confinement scores.

RESULTS: Cambodia had the highest male to female ratio (M:F) of 4.08:1, followed by Pakistan (M:F = 2.85:1) and Nepal (M:F = 2.69:1). We observed a positive correlation between GII and M:F ratio (Spearman's rho = 0.681, P-value <0.001) and a negative correlation between HAQI and M:F ratio (Spearman's rho = ?0.676, P-value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Countries with institutionalised gender disparities and poor healthcare access and quality tend to have higher M:F ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases; thus, highlighting underutilisation of testing services, influenced by multiple individuals, social and policy factors. Robust gender-based data are required to understand disparities throughout the continuum of care and to devise gender-responsive pandemic strategies.","output":"Contextualising gender intersectionality with the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues in several jurisdictions, causing substantial strain to health care systems The purpose of our study was to predict the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient outcomes and use of hospital resources in Ontario, Canada METHODS: We developed an individuallevel simulation to model the flow of patients with COVID-19 through the hospital system in Ontario We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory and hospital health care capacity Our outcomes included the number of patients who needed admission to the ward or to the intensive care unit (ICU) with or without the need for mechanical ventilation, number of days to resource depletion, number of patients awaiting resources and number of deaths RESULTS: We found that with effective early public health measures, hospital system resources would not be depleted For scenarios with late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, hospital resources would be depleted within 14-26 days, and in the worst case scenario, 13 321 patients would die while waiting for needed resources Resource depletion would be avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to increase ICU, ventilator and acute care hospital capacities INTERPRETATION: We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures, the Ontario hospital system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19 despite a rapid increase in capacity This lack of hospital resources would have led to an increase in mortality By slowing the spread of the disease using public health measures and by increasing hospital capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its hospitals","output":"Estimation of COVID-19-induced depletion of hospital resources in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the restructuring in-hospital systems of care at a Level -1 trauma center in India and to analyze an injury volume and patterns for future preparedness as well as to establish a specific injuries preventive measures during health emergencies like COVID-19. METHODS: Data was extracted from a prospectively managed trauma registry at level-1 trauma center in India. We have compared the data in lockdown period with the same days number from the pre-lockdown period. Patients were categorized according to age, gender, injury cause, injury place, injury severity, and injury outcome to compare the statistical analysis between two periods. RESULTS: Total emergency department (ED) trauma footfall decreased significantly by 73% during lockdown period. The injuries result increased significantly due to blunt forces. There was a significant decrease in the major injury of the patients percentage. The road traffic injuries (RTIs) in individuals were less than the reported falls number, which increased significantly during lockdown. The less number of patients significantly presented without receiving primary care. Majority of the patients had been transferred by using private cars, police vehicle, and two wheelers during lockdown; however, patients less number were transferred significantly by three wheelers as expected. The comparative analysis between quantitative data points shows significant differences in median Injury Severity Score (ISS) and length of stay during lockdown.

In this work, we present a structure-based study to identify potential covalent inhibitors containing a variety of chemical warheads. The targeted Asinex Focused Covalent (AFCL) library was screened based on different reaction types and potential covalent inhibitors were identified. In addition, we screened FDA-approved protease inhibitors to find candidates to be repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.

Fascial repair using a prosthetic mesh has been generally accepted as the best method of parastomal hernia repair. New studies suggest the use of a prophylactic mesh placement at the initial operation, but fear of wound infection and mesh removal is still high. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective review of patient records was performed of all patients with extra-peritoneal parastomal hernia repair using a prosthetic mesh between 1997 and 2006. The patient demographic data, enterostomy indication, therapy, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS In the 10-year study period, 16 parastomal hernia repairs using an extra-peritoneal prosthetic mesh in the onlay position were performed. In one patient, a mesh infection occurred, resulting in mesh removal (6.2%). The recurrence rate was 19% after a mean follow-up of 33 months. CONCLUSION Parastomal hernia repair using a prosthetic mesh is a safe and effective method, with the lowest recurrence rates and acceptably low infection rates.

Physical distancing policies, curfews, and a citywide lockdown were implemented in March and April 2020 resulting in sharp decreases in movement across the city. However, most people cannot afford to stay home completely (e.g., leaving daily to fetch water). If still employed, they may need to travel longer distances for work, potentially exposing them COVID-19 or contributing to its spread. We conducted a household survey across five urban slums to describe factors associated with mobility in the previous 24 h. A total of 1695 adults were interviewed, 63% female. Of these, most reported neighborhood mobility within their informal settlement (54%), 19% stayed home completely, and 27% reported long-distance mobility outside their informal settlement, mainly for work. In adjusted multinomial regression models, women were 58% more likely than men to stay home (relative risk ratio (RRR): 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 2.14) and women were 60% less likely than men to report citywide mobility (RRR: 0.40; 95% CI 0.31, 0.52). Individuals in the wealthiest quintile, particularly younger women, were most likely to not leave home at all. Those who reported citywide travel were less likely to have lost employment (RRR: 0.49; 95% CI 0.38, 0.65) and were less likely to avoid public transportation (RRR: 0.30; 95% CI 0.23, 0.39). Employment and job hunting were the main reasons for traveling outside of the slum; less than 20% report other reasons. Our findings suggest that slum residents who retain their employment are traveling larger distances across Nairobi, using public transportation, and are more likely to be male; this travel may put them at higher risk of COVID-19 infection but is necessary to maintain income. Steps to protect workers from COVID-19 both in the workplace and while in transit (including masks, hand sanitizer stations, and reduced capacity on public transportation) are critical as economic insecurity in the city increases due to COVID-19 mitigation measures. Workers must be able to commute and maintain employment to not be driven further into poverty. Additionally, to protect the majority of individuals who are only travelling locally within their settlement, mitigation measures such as making masks and handwashing stations accessible within informal settlements must also be implemented, with special attention to the burden placed on women.","output":"Mobility Patterns During COVID-19 Travel Restrictions in Nairobi Urban Informal Settlements: Who Is Leaving Home and Why"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development and evaluation of a one-step single-tube accelerated real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay is reported for rapid detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replicase gene.

Nurses have been facing a tremendous amount of fear and anxiety during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. General self-efficacy is considered one of the most influential factors that can modify the impact of anxiety on nurses' mental health. In this study, we aimed to determine the predictors of self-efficacy and anxiety among nurses during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey involving 368 nurses working in a tertiary care hospital. The General Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) were used for assessing self-efficacy and anxiety. The chi-square test followed by bivariate and multivariable regression analyses was performed to identify the determinants of self-efficacy and anxiety. Results The mean age of the nurses was 28.91 years (SD=3.68), with a mean working experience in the nursing field of 5.32 years (SD=2.48). The mean self-efficacy and anxiety scores were 32.19 (SD=4.53) and 3.82 (SD=2.87), respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that higher age (>30 years, p=.003), professional education acquired through a diploma course instead of a graduate degree (p<.001), and lack of training on handling COVID-19 patients (p=.003) were significant determinants of higher anxiety among nurses. Similarly, higher economic status (p=.001), sufficient COVID-19 training (p=.049), having family members tested positive for COVID-19 (p=.012), professional experience (5 years, p<0.001), and quarantine period (14 days, p=.002) were revealed to be independent determinants of a higher sense of self-efficacy among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Receiving adequate levels of training on COVID-19 plays a vital role in improving self-efficacy and reducing anxiety among nurses during the ongoing pandemic. Managing anxiety, increasing self-efficacy, and ensuring more exposure to COVID-19-related training may improve nurses' mental health and prepare them for fighting pandemics in a much better and more efficient manner.","output":"Promoting Mental Health of Nurses During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Will the Rapid Deployment of Nurses' Training Programs During COVID-19 Improve Self-Efficacy and Reduce Anxiety?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Determine non-invasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) outcomes for paediatric respiratory distress in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Pediatric critical care medical directors at The University of Texas Southwestern/Childrens Health System of Texas (UTSW/CHST) created a guideline for the resuscitation of COVID-19 patients. The simulation team used in situ simulation to demonstrate guideline feasibility and to create educational materials. METHODS: A UTSW/CHST guideline incorporated COVID-19-focused AHA and other national organizational recommendations to fit the institutional needs. A high-fidelity in situ simulation helped test the feasibility and optimize the UTSW/CHST guideline. We developed a novel form of rapid cycle deliberate practice (RCDP), expert-driven RCDP, in which all simulation participants are experts, to debrief the simulation. RESULTS: In situ simulation with expert-driven RCDP demonstrated guideline feasibility in the resuscitation of a COVID-19 patient while balancing the protection of HCW.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine optimal discriminatory viral load cutoffs. Viral load density distributions were plotted. RESULTS. The mean viral load was higher in cases than controls for 7 viruses. However, there was substantial overlap in viral load distribution of cases and controls for all viruses. ROC curves to determine the optimal viral load cutoff produced an area under the curve of <0.80 for all viruses, suggesting poor to fair discrimination between cases and controls. Fatal and very severe pneumonia cases did not have higher viral load than less severe cases for most viruses. CONCLUSIONS. Although we found higher viral loads among pneumonia cases than controls for some viruses, the utility in using viral load of URT specimens to define viral pneumonia was equivocal. Our analysis was limited by lack of a gold standard for viral pneumonia.","output":"Is Higher Viral Load in the Upper Respiratory Tract Associated With Severe Pneumonia?

Therefore, there is great concern about susceptibility to the outcome of COVID-19Cinfected patients with MM. This retrospective study describes the baseline characteristics and outcome data of COVID-19 infection in 650 patients with plasma cell disorders, collected by the International Myeloma Society to understand the initial challenges faced by myeloma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses were performed for hospitalized MM patients. Among hospitalized patients, the median age was 69 years, and nearly all patients (96%) had MM. Approximately 36% were recently diagnosed (2019-2020), and 54% of patients were receiving first-line therapy. Thirty-three percent of patients have died, with significant geographic variability, ranging from 27% to 57% of hospitalized patients. Univariate analysis identified age, International Staging System stage 3 (ISS3), high-risk disease, renal disease, suboptimal myeloma control (active or progressive disease), and 1 or more comorbidities as risk factors for higher rates of death. Neither history of transplant, including within a year of COVID-19 diagnosis, nor other anti-MM treatments were associated with outcomes. Multivariate analysis found that only age, high-risk MM, renal disease, and suboptimal MM control remained independent predictors of adverse outcome with COVID-19 infection. The management of MM in the era of COVID-19 requires careful consideration of patient- and disease-related factors to decrease the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, while not compromising disease control through appropriate MM treatment. This study provides initial data to develop recommendations for the management of MM patients with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Clinical features associated with COVID-19 outcome in multiple myeloma: first results from the International Myeloma Society data set"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic pointed out that the need to ensure emergent surgery in patients positive for infection is no longer hypothetical.

However, data are conflicting and cover only short time spans so far. Here, we investigate the medium-term and peri-lockdown-related changes of mental health outcomes in such patients in a longitudinal study. A cohort of 159 patients comprising all major mental disorders (ICD-10 F0-F9) were interviewed twice with the Goettingen psychosocial Burden and Symptom Inventory (Goe-BSI) to evaluate psychosocial burden, psychiatric symptoms and resilience at the end of the first (April/May 2020) and the second lockdown in Germany (November/December 2020). For the primary outcome psychosocial burden ratings also comprised retrospective pre-pandemic (early 2020) and very early states during the pandemic (March 2020). For all diagnostic groups, psychosocial burden varied significantly over time (p < 0.001) with an increase from the pre-pandemic to the initial phase (p < 0.001), followed by a steady decrease across both lockdowns, normalizing in November/December 2020. Female gender, high adjustment disorder symptom load at baseline and psychiatric comorbidities were risk factors for higher levels and an unfavorable course of psychosocial burden. Most psychiatric symptoms changed minimally, while resilience decreased over time (p = 0.044 and p = 0.037). The longitudinal course of psychosocial burden indicates an initial stress response, followed by a return to pre-pandemic levels even under recurrent lockdown conditions, mimicking symptoms of an adjustment disorder. Strategies for proactive, specific and continuous treatment have to address resilience capacities before their depletion in the pandemic aftermath, especially for patients with additional risk factors.

Besides the lungs it can also affect other organs like the heart or the liver. Whether there is a pancreatic manifestation as well is currently unclear. METHODS: and aims: We prospectively collected patient information of patients with Covid-19 associated ARDS in a registry (COvid Registry REChts der Isar intensive care Trial - CORRECT) and analyzed this patient cohort for signs of acute pancreatitis (e.g. lipase activity >3 times the upper limit). RESULTS: 12/38 (31.6%) patients with Covid-19 associated ARDS had a serum lipase activity >180 U/l. Median lipase activity was 422 U/l (186-1127). No patient showed typical findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging studies. On hemodynamic monitoring no patient had signs of intravascular fluid demand regarding MAP, GEDVI and therapy with vasopressors. To avoid worsening respiratory function no treatment with crystalloids was initiated. Lipasemia was not explained by gastroenteritis or renal insufficiency, occurred before as well as after viral clearance and 16.1  6.0 days after the first symptoms. No patient developed severe acute pancreatitis during the follow up period of 35.8  8.3 days. CONCLUSION: High lipasemia without typical signs of acute pancreatitis is a frequent finding in severe Covid-19 associated ARDS. Considering the markedly high levels of serum lipase activity, we think impaired microcirculation in severely ill patients can explain this finding rather than extra-pancreatic co-morbidities (UTN: DRKS00021612).","output":"High lipasemia is frequent in Covid-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of the anti-COVID-19 drug remdesivir has been realized via the coupling of the P-racemic phosphoryl chloride with protected nucleoside GS441524.

This study aims to evaluate the symptoms and outcome of medical staff from a tertiary hospital in Tehran, Iran. Materials and Methods: The diagnoses of 29 HCWs presenting COVID-19 symptoms were confirmed by molecular and imaging studies. Epidemiologic and disease-related data were collected via phone calls and filling a questionnaire and then analyzed descriptively. Results: Eighteen (62.1%) of the affected HCWs were males. The mean age of them was 41.86 years with a lower average (38.27) for females than males. Nurses comprised 41.4% of our population. Only 2 (6.9%) patients were admitted to the respiratory care unit (RCU) (), marked as critical patients. The most presented symptoms were fever (79.3%) and dyspnea (79.3%). Overall, 55.2% of them had a longer exposure time (more than a week), which was more frequent in men than women. Conclusion: Fever was the most prevalent symptom among the study group.

Digital Mental health Interventions (DMHIs) are a potential solution, but successful implementation depends on stakeholder acceptance. This study investigated the relevance of DMHIs from students' perspectives. METHODS: In 2020C2021, an online cross-sectional survey using mixed methods was conducted with 479 students at 23 colleges and universities. Respondents reported views and use of standard mental health services and DMHIs and rated the priority of various DMHIs to be offered through campus services. Qualitative data included open-ended responses. FINDINGS: Among respondents, 91% reported having experienced mental health problems, of which 91% reported barriers to receiving mental health services. Students highlighted therapy and counseling as desired and saw flexible access to services as important. With respect to DMHIs, respondents had the most experience with physical health apps (46%), mental health questionnaires (41%), and mental well-being apps (39%). Most were unaware of or had not used apps or self-help programs for mental health problems. Students were most likely to report the following DMHIs as high priorities: a crisis text line (76%), telehealth (66%), websites for connecting to services (62%), and text/messaging with counselors (62%). They considered a self-help program with coach support to be convenient but some also perceived such services to be possibly less effective than in-person therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Students welcome DMHIs on campus and indicate preference for mental health services that include human support.

The most definitive confirmation of this contention is that the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in general use, which elicit antibodies specific for the RBD, exhibit approximately 95% protective efficacy against COVID-19. A potential challenge to vaccine efficacy is the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants possessing multiple mutations affecting amino acid residues in the RBD. Of concern are variants that arose in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa. One of the variants, designated B.1.351, has shown a higher transmissibility due to greater affinity for the ACE-2 receptor and decreased neutralization by convalescent plasma, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, and post-vaccination plasma. Common to several of the variants is the N501Y mutation in the RBD, which may be responsible for at least part of the observed variant properties. To test this hypothesis, we measured the ability of the Y501 RBD to inhibit binding of the wild type RBD and full SP (S1 + S2) to the ACE-2 protein and a human monoclonal IgG antibody elicited to the wild type RBD, relative to the wild type RBD in two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). We found no significant difference in the IC50 of the two RBD species inhibition of ACE-2 binding, but unexpectedly found that the IC50 of the wild type RBD inhibition of antibody binding was nearly twice that of the Y501 RBD, reflecting a lower affinity. These results suggest that the individual N501Y mutation does not contribute to altered viral properties by itself, but may contribute to a collective conformational shift produced by multiple mutations.","output":"Relative Mutant N501Y SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD Inhibition of Anti-Spike Protein IgG and ACE-2 Binding to Spike Protein Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Educational supervisors (ESs) play a critical role in the training of Foundation doctors. Many hospital trusts do not currently offer formal mechanisms to ensure the quality of supervision is at a high standard. Our Trust wanted to empower trainees to offer objective feedback on the quality of the supervisors. METHODS We introduced a feedback form sent to all Foundation doctors at our Trust. The questionnaire was designed to identify whether ESs were meeting their responsibilities as defined by the Health Education England South West's Severn Deanery. We collected data throughout the academic year 2017-2018 (Year 1) as a pilot, before rolling out the definitive questionnaire with minor modifications from 2018 to 2019 (Year 2). RESULTS All respondents met with their supervisor within the first month of the placement and 90.7% of the trainees found it easy to meet with their supervisor. The Trust received generally very good feedback for all of its supervisors. Low numbers (4/120 trainees) reported supervisors not engaging with the exception reporting process. CONCLUSION Our Trust provides ESs of a high standard. The authors believe collecting feedback for ESs will achieve three things: 1) Drive up standards through increasing accountability of ESs receiving objective feedback. This will be of critical importance in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic and the changes to our work it has necessitated. 2) Empower trainees to make informed decisions about where they wish to train and under which supervisors. 3) Facilitate revalidation and appraisal for supervisors by collecting data from trainees on the quality of their supervision.","output":"Watching the watchmen: an evaluation of educational supervision in a busy district general hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID 19 pandemic has led to an increase in the number of patients in need of ventilation.

COVID-19 could be associated with worsening diabetes control and new diabetes diagnosis that could be linked to high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (coronavirus point of entry into the host) in the endocrine pancreas. A pre-existing gut microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) could contribute to COVID-19-related complications in patients with diabetes. The COVID-19 virus was found in fecal samples (~55%), persisted for about 5 weeks, and could be associated with diarrhea, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis. ACE2 expressed on enterocytes and colonocytes could serve as an alternative route for acquiring COVID-19. Experimental models proposed some probiotics, including Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. salivarius, as vectors for delivering or enhancing efficacy of anti-coronavirus vaccines. These Lactobacillus probiotics were also beneficial for diabetes. The potential mechanisms for interconnections between coronavirus, diabetes, and gut microbiota could be related to the immune system, ACE2 pathway, and metformin treatment. There were suggestions but no proof supporting probiotics benefits for COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that the host environment including the gut microbiota could play a role for COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. It is a challenge to the scientific community to investigate the beneficial potential of the gut microbiota for strengthening host defense against coronavirus in patients with diabetes.","output":"Considerations for Gut Microbiota and Probiotics in Patients with Diabetes Amidst the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid\\\\19 pandemic has emerged as one of the most disquieting worldwide public health emergencies of the 21st century and has thrown into sharp relief, among other factors, the dire need for robust forecasting techniques for disease detection, alleviation as well as prevention.

This multicenter, single-arm, phase II, exploratory study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with capecitabine and oxaliplatin as first-line treatment for unresectable RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC. METHODS: Patients aged 18C75 with RAS/BRAF wild-type unresectable mCRC, without prior systemic treatment, and ECOG performance status 1 were enrolled. Eligible patients received capecitabine (850 mg/m(2), p.o., bid, on day 1C14 every 21 days), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2), i.v., on day 1 every 21 days), and anlotinib (12 mg, p.o., qd, on days 1C14 every 21 days) as induction therapy. Following 6 cycles of therapy, patients who achieved response or stable disease received capecitabine and anlotinib as maintenance therapy until tumor progression. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST (version: 1.1), and the secondary endpoints were PFS, disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), and safety. RESULTS: Between November 2019 and February 2021, 31 patients were enrolled. One patient was excluded for refusing treatment. The primary endpoint of ORR was 76.7% (95% CI, 57.7C90.1) with 1 patient achieving a complete response and 22 patients partial response. DCR was 93.3% (95% CI, 77.9C99.2). At a median follow-up of 14.1 months (95% CI, 9.9C18.3), median PFS was 11.3 months (95% CI, 7.1C14.1), and DOR was 7.9 months (95% CI, 5.5C12.7). Twenty-five (83.3%) patients experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). No grade 5 TEAE was reported. The most common grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (>10%) were hypertension (15/30; 50%), neutrophil count decreased (8/30; 26.7%), and diarrhea (4/30; 13.3%). A total of 18 (60%) patients had TEAEs that resulted in dose reduction, interruptions, or delays.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of both strategies on severe trauma admissions and ICU capacity in Ile-de-France region (Paris Area). MAIN TEXT: We conducted a multicenter cohort-based observational study from 1(st)January 2017 to 31th December 2020, including all consecutive trauma patients admitted to the trauma centers of Ile-de-France region participating in the national registry (Traumabase?). Two periods were defined, the non-pandemic period (NPP) from 2017 to 2019, and the pandemic period (PP) concerning those admitted in 2020. The number of ICU beds released during 2020 pandemic period (overall period, SL and ML) was estimated by multiplying difference in trauma admissions by the median length of stay during the same week of pandemic period (ICU day-beds in 2020). A 15% yearly reduction of trauma patients was observed during the PP, associated with the release of 6422 ICU day-beds in 2020. During SL and ML, the observed decrease in trauma admission was respectively 49 and 39% compared with similar dates of the NPP. The number of beds released was 1531 days-beds in SL and 679 day-beds in ML. Those reductions respectively accounted for 4.5 and 6.0% of the overall ICU admission for COVID-19 in Ile-de-France. CONCLUSION: The lockdown strategies during pandemic resulted in a reduction of severe trauma admissions. In addition to the social distancing effect, lockdown strategies freed up an important number of ICU beds in trauma centers, available for severe COVID-19 patients.","output":"Effect of 2020 containment strategies on trauma workflow in Ile-de-France region: another benefit of lockdown?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Legal standards for HIV testing are evolving in an attempt to achieve an ethical equilibrium between the privacy rights of infected or potentially infected individuals and public health considerations that seek to limit the spread and severity of the disease through early recognition and treatment.

The objective of this trial was to analyse the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a multi-component intervention that combines psychological support and reduction of hospital-specific stressors on HRQoL, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, self-efficacy, and plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and -8 levels in CABG patients. METHODS This three-arm, randomized controlled, single-centre pilot trial assessed the Intervention for CABG to Optimize Patient Experience in 88 patients undergoing elective CABG. Standard medical care (SMC, n = 29) was compared with 2 intervention groups: (i) psychological interventions to optimize treatment expectations (IA group, n = 30) and (ii) multi-component intervention (IB group, n = 29) with psychological interventions plus an additional treatment package (light therapy, noise reduction, music, and if desired, 360 images delivered via virtual reality). RESULTS The implementation of psychological interventions in routine medical treatment was feasible (91.5% of participants completed all intervention sessions). Both interventions were associated with significantly shorter hospital stay compared to SMC (IA/IB 9.8/9.3 days vs SMC 12.5 days). Self-efficacy expectations at post-surgery were significantly higher compared to SMC both in the IA group (P = 0.011) and marginally in the IB group (P = 0.051). However, there were no treatment effects of the interventions on HRQoL and plasma levels of IL-6 or IL-8 after CABG. CONCLUSIONS A perioperative multi-component intervention may lead to shorter hospital stay and higher self-efficacy after CABG. Further studies are needed to determine its impact on HRQoL and inflammation.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) presumed to have jumped species from another mammal to humans. This virus has caused a rapidly spreading global pandemic. To date, over 300,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in England and over 40,000 patients have died. While progress has been achieved in managing this disease, the factors in addition to age that affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19 have not been clearly identified. Recent studies of COVID-19 in several countries identified links between air pollution and death rates. Here, we explored potential links between major fossil fuel-related air pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 mortality in England. We compared current SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths from public databases to both regional and subregional air pollution data monitored at multiple sites across England. After controlling for population density, age and median income, we show positive relationships between air pollutant concentrations, particularly nitrogen oxides, and COVID-19 mortality and infectivity. Using detailed UK Biobank data, we further show that PM(2.5) was a major contributor to COVID-19 cases in England, as an increase of 1 m(3) in the long-term average of PM(2.5) was associated with a 12% increase in COVID-19 cases. The relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 withstands variations in the temporal scale of assessments (single-year vs 5-year average) and remains significant after adjusting for socioeconomic, demographic and health-related variables. We conclude that a small increase in air pollution leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 infectivity and mortality rate in England.

METHODS: We conducted an online survey among neurosurgery residents in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand from May 22 to 31, 2020 using Google Forms. The 33-item questionnaire collected data on elective and emergency neurosurgical operations, ongoing learning activities, and health worker safety. RESULTS: A total of 298 of 470 neurosurgery residents completed the survey, equivalent to a 63% response rate. The decrease in elective neurosurgical operations in Indonesia and in the Philippines (median, 100% for both) was significantly greater compared with other countries (P < 0.001). For emergency operations, trainees in Indonesia and Malaysia had a significantly greater reduction in their caseload (median, 80% and 70%, respectively) compared with trainees in Singapore and Thailand (median, 20% and 50%, respectively; P < 0.001). Neurosurgery residents were most concerned about the decrease in their hands-on surgical experience, uncertainty in their career advancement, and occupational safety in the workplace. Most of the residents (n = 221, 74%) believed that the COVID-19 crisis will have a negative impact on their neurosurgical training overall.

Methods: A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins tested in Tongji hospital were retrospectively investigated. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and outcomes data were compared between mild-moderate group and died group. Further, a paired case-control study was conducted where each deceased case was matched to three mild-moderate patients of similar age. Findings: Among 116 subjects included, 101 mild-moderate patients survived and 15 cases died. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, while serum IgG levels increased over 8 weeks. Serum IgM levels were higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.024), but not IgG. Serum IgM levels were negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and albumin levels (r = -0.269, P = 0.003; r = -0.188, P = 0.043; and r = -0.198, P = 0.033, resp.).

A Cox proportional hazard model was used to derive adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between asthma and COVID-19 hospital admission and ICU admission or death, stratified by markers of history of an asthma attack defined by either oral corticosteroid prescription (prednisolone, prednisone, and dexamethasone) in the 2 years before March 1, 2020, or hospitalisation for asthma before March 1, 2020.

FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2020, and July 27, 2021, 561 279 (127%) of 4 421 663 adults in Scotland had clinician-diagnosed-and-recorded-asthma. Among adults with asthma, 39 253 (70%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, of whom 4828 (123%) were admitted to hospital for COVID-19 (among them, an estimated 600 [124%] might have been due to nosocomial infections). Adults with asthma were found to be at an increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admission (adjusted HR 127, 95% CI 123C132) compared with those without asthma. When using oral corticosteroid prescribing in the preceding 2 years as a marker for history of an asthma attack, the adjusted HR was 154 (95% CI 146C161) for those with three or more prescribed courses of oral corticosteroids, 137 (126C148) for those with two prescribed courses, 130 (123C137) for those with one prescribed course, and 115 (111C121) for those without any courses, compared with those aged 18 years or older without asthma. Adults with asthma were found to be at an increased risk of COVID-19 ICU admission or death compared with those without asthma (adjusted HR 113, 95 % CI 105C122). The adjusted HR was 144 (95% CI 131C158) for those with three or more prescribed courses of oral corticosteroids, 127 (109C148) for those with two prescribed courses, 104 (093C116) for those with one prescribed course, and 106 (097C117) for those without any course, compared with adults without asthma. INTERPRETATION: Adults with asthma who have required two or more courses of oral corticosteroids in the previous 2 years or a hospital admission for asthma before March 1, 2020, are at increased risk of both COVID-19 hospitalisation and ICU admission or death. Patients with a recent asthma attack should be considered a priority group for booster COVID-19 vaccines.

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19 classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images. Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then, in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), AUC, precision and F1-score achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95%, 96.35%, 93.10% and 93.07%, respectively.

Although INI resistance pathways are well-defined for HIV-1, the mutations that emerge in HIV-2 in response to INIs are incompletely characterized. METHODS We performed systematic searches of GenBank and the HIV-2 drug resistance literature to identify treatment-associated mutations for phenotypic evaluation. We then constructed a library of 95 mutants of HIV-2ROD9 that contained single or multiple amino acid changes in the integrase protein. Each variant was tested for susceptibility to raltegravir and dolutegravir using a single-cycle indicator cell assay. RESULTS We observed extensive cross-resistance between raltegravir and dolutegravir in HIV-2ROD9. HIV-2-specific integrase mutations Q91R, E92A, A153G, and H157Q/S, which have not been previously characterized, significantly increased the EC50 for raltegravir when introduced into one or more mutational backgrounds; mutations E92A/Q, T97A, and G140A/S conferred similar enhancements of dolutegravir resistance. HIV-2ROD9 variants encoding G118R alone, or insertions of residues SREGK or SREGR at position 231, were resistant to both INIs. CONCLUSIONS Our analysis demonstrates the contributions of novel INI-associated mutations to raltegravir and dolutegravir resistance in HIV-2.

METHODS: Undergraduate students (N = 34) participated in a 4-week mindfulness curriculum embedded within a college course, while a control group (N = 35) taking a different course did not. Notably, the intervention coincided with the start of a state-wide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Despite the additional external stress, there was a significant main effect and a significant interaction between the intervention and time for state mindfulness, (the treatment group experienced increased state mindfulness). There was a significant main effect (higher for the control group) on coronavirus worry and a significant interaction between the intervention and time for perceived stress, with the treatment/control group experiencing decreased/increased stress over time. There was also a significant interaction between the intervention and time for sleep problems with the intervention group experiencing declines in sleep problems over time and also being more likely to experience optimal amounts of sleep over time.

METHODS: We performed a Google TrendsTM search for \\"Coronavirus\\" and compared Relative Search Volumes (RSV) indices to the number of reported COVID-19 cases by the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) using time-lag correlation analysis. RESULTS: Worldwide public interest in Coronavirus reached its first peak end of January when numbers of newly infected patients started to increase exponentially in China. The worldwide Google TrendsTM index reached its peak on the 12th of March 2020 at a time when numbers of infected patients started to increase in Europe and COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. At this time the general interest in China but also the Republic of Korea has already been significantly decreased as compared to end of January. Correlations between RSV indices and number of new COVID-19 cases were observed across all investigated countries with highest correlations observed with a time lag of -11.5 days, i.e. highest interest in coronavirus observed 11.5 days before the peak of newly infected cases. This pattern was very consistent across European countries but also holds true for the US. In Brazil and Australia, highest correlations were observed with a time lag of -7 days. In Egypt the highest correlation is given with a time lag of 0, potentially indicating that in this country, numbers of newly infected patients will increase exponentially within the course of April.

Currently, most efforts on supporting the uptake of digital mental health tools remain fragmented across organizations and geography. There is a critical need to synthesize these efforts in order to provide a coordinated strategy of supporting the adoption of digital mental health tools. OBJECTIVE: The specific aim of this project is to develop a web-based resource document to support the engagement of mental health providers and patients in the use of digital mental health tools. METHODS: The web-based resource was developed using a multimethod approach. A grey literature review was conducted in 2019 to identify relevant toolkits that are available in the public domain. This was supplemented with an environmental scan where individuals with expertise in the development, acquisition, implementation, and evaluation of digital mental health tools were invited to contribute additional tools or documents not identified in the grey literature search. An engagement workshop was held with stakeholders to explore how the resource document should be developed and delivered. These findings were collectively used to develop the final iteration of the resource document. RESULTS: Based on a gray literature review and environmental scan with 27 experts, 25 resources were identified and included in the resource guide. These resources were developed for patients and providers by organizations from 5 countries. An engagement workshop was held with 14 stakeholders, and barriers related to cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and accessibility of the toolkit were identified. The final iteration of the resource document was developed by the research team using findings from the gray literature review, environmental scan, and engagement workshop. The contents of the 45-page resource guide are directed at mental health care providers, administrators, and patients (inclusive of families and caregivers). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a multimethod approach led to the development of a resource guide that builds on existing evidence on digital mental health tools and was co-designed with stakeholders and end-users. The resource guide is now publicly available online for free and is being promoted through digital health and mental health websites. Future work should explore how this document can be integrated into clinical care delivery and pathways.","output":"Development of a Resource Guide to Support the Engagement of Mental Health Providers and Patients With Digital Health Tools: Multimethod Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic affects all the aspects of modern society worldwide, especially in the power sector. Measures of flexibility enhancement are regarded as solutions to guarantee reliable and flexible electricity supply in such an emergency. This study aims at investigating the impact of flexibility enhancement measures (electricity storage and flexible demand) in different situations of the preliminary COVID-19 pandemic. Case studies in different regions (Denmark, the Netherlands, and the Sichuan province of China) are conducted and assessed using the hourly simulation tool EnergyPLAN. These regions own different electricity supply mix and level of renewable electricity. It is found that the flexible demand measure within one day or one week can hardly eliminate the electricity imbalance caused by either the pandemic or the increasing renewable electricity. The monthly flexible demand is effective for balancing, but its potential in these regions is not enough. However, electricity storage measure enhances the electricity balance even during the most extreme situation of the pandemic. From the economic perspective, electricity storage measure leads to an increase of up to 15% in total system costs, while flexible demand measure has a negligible effect on costs. This study serves as the first step to understand the performance of flexibility enhancement measures in the power sector under the shock of a pandemic.","output":"Flexibility enhancement measures under the COVID-19 pandemic C a preliminary comparative analysis in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sichuan of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited tools for orienting interventions in surveillance, control, and clinical care, the current article aims to identify areas with greater vulnerability to severe cases of the disease in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a city characterized by huge social and spatial heterogeneity. In order to identify these areas, the authors prepared an index of vulnerability to severe cases of COVID-19 based on the construction, weighting, and integration of three levels of information: mean number of residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older (both per census tract) and neighborhood tuberculosis incidence rate in the year 2018. The data on residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older were obtained from the 2010 Population Census, and data on tuberculosis incidence were taken from the Brazilian Information System for Notificable Diseases (SINAN). Weighting of the indicators comprising the index used analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the levels of information were integrated via weighted linear combination with map algebra. Spatialization of the index of vulnerability to severe COVID-19 in the city of Rio de Janeiro reveals the existence of more vulnerable areas in different parts of the city's territory, reflecting its urban complexity. The areas with greatest vulnerability are located in the North and West Zones of the city and in poor neighborhoods nested within upper-income parts of the South and West Zones.

While laboratory-developed testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of diagnostic testing for this virus, the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories are dependent on commercially available SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays. In contrast to assays approved or cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for in vitro diagnostic use, assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids have emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA. Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with the EUA classification, and thus, assay verification can be daunting. Further compounding anxiety for laboratories are major issues with the supply chain that are dramatically affecting the availability of test reagents and requiring laboratories to implement multiple commercial EUA tests.

Although businesses tried to seamlessly continue business using video conferencing, research on how productivity has changed during the pandemic has been mixed. To better understand how productivity has been impacted during the pandemic, despite decades of research prior to the pandemic demonstrating the effectiveness of WFH, we conducted three quantitative and qualitative studies with workers from April 2020 to April 2021. Workers who reported video conferencing feeling like a forced interaction also reported dramatic levels of low subjective productivity through increased feelings of video conferencing anxiety (Studies 1C3). Qualitative reports of why workers felt forced to video conference identified feeling pressured by employers to use video and meetings being used as surveillance (Study 1b). However, some workers reported positive experiences while video conferencing, which was related to greater subjective productivity (Study 2). For workers who had video conference and face\\\\to\\\\face meetings, video conference meetings feeling like a forced interaction was still associated with lower subjective productivity through increased feelings of anxiety (even when controlling for face\\\\to\\\\face meetings feeling like a forced interaction;Study 3).

To further characterize acid-base disturbance and subclinical metabolic acidosis in this population, we examined prospective associations of body mass index (BMI) with elevated anion gap and whether anion gap values in obesity associate with low bicarbonate. Methods: Data from adult outpatients (n=94,448) in the Bronx, New York were collected from 2010 to 2018. Mixed effects models and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations of BMI with elevated anion gap and anion gap metabolic acidosis and of baseline anion gap with incident low bicarbonate and anion gap metabolic acidosis. Anion gap was defined using traditional and albumin-corrected calculations. Results: Greater BMI was associated with higher anion gap over time and with progressively greater risk of developing an elevated anion gap (hazard ratio [HR] for body mass index [BMI]40 kg/m2 versus 18 to <25 kg/m2, 1.32; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.23 to 1.42 for traditional and HR for BMI40 kg/m2 versus 18 to <25 kg/m2, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.63 to 1.85 for corrected).

However, analysis of all statistical values indicates that the online STEM camp can produce a larger positive influence on STEM field perceptions and the FTF camp can produce a larger positive influence on STEM career perceptions.Research limitations/implicationsThis suggests that STEM camps, both online and in-person, can improve students' perceptions of the STEM fields and of STEM careers. Implications from this study indicate that modifications of informal learning environments should be based on the type of learning environment.Originality/valueThis manuscript discusses the development and impact of an online STEM camp to accommodate for the sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the inability to hold an in-person STEM camp.

To inform strategies to mitigate the spread of infectious disease, it is thus necessary to understand the humidity-dependent phase changes associated with the particles in which pathogens are suspended. Here, we study phase changes of levitated aerosols and droplets composed of model respiratory compounds (salt and protein) and growth media (organicCinorganic mixtures commonly used in studies of pathogen survival) with decreasing relative humidity (RH). Efflorescence was suppressed in many particle compositions and thus unlikely to fully account for the humidity-dependent survival of viruses. Rather, we identify organic-based, semisolid phase states that form under equilibrium conditions at intermediate RH (45 to 80%). A higher-protein content causes particles to exist in a semisolid state under a wider range of RH conditions. Diffusion and, thus, disinfection kinetics are expected to be inhibited in these semisolid states. These observations suggest that organic-based, semisolid states are an important consideration to account for the recovery of virus viability at low RH observed in previous studies. We propose a mechanism in which the semisolid phase shields pathogens from inactivation by hindering the diffusion of solutes. This suggests that the exogenous lifetime of pathogens will depend, in part, on the organic composition of the carrier respiratory particle and thus its origin in the respiratory tract. Furthermore, this work highlights the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneities and time-dependent changes in the properties of aerosols and droplets undergoing evaporation in studies of pathogen viability.","output":"Evidence for a semisolid phase state of aerosols and droplets relevant to the airborne and surface survival of pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines (NICE) recommend CT coronary angiography (CTCA) as first line investigation in patients (pts) with suspected stable angina We report our early experience with CTCA, impact on pt assessment and resource utilisation Method: A retrospective review of all pts referred for CTCA in Hauora Tairwhiti from 1/11/18 until 31/1/ 20 Results: A total of 158 pts underwent CTCA with the indication in over 2/3rds non acute chest discomfort or exertional breathless Mean age 59 years (29-77years) 58% male, 46% NZ Mori 18% (28/158) were diabetic, 67% (107/158) hypertension 27% % (43/158) current or ex-smokers Mean LDL cholesterol was 2 6 mmol/l with 53% (83/158) on lipid lowering therapy Treadmill testing was performed in 26% (41/158), 59% (24/41) post CTCA stress echo in 16% (25/158) with the majority, 76% (19/25) performed post CTCA A 47% reduction in outpatient treadmill testing was noted from 2018 to 2019 (153 v 81) No difference was seen in stress echo (114 v 114) Limited CTCA image interpretation was available in 6 pts A Calcium score of 0 was noted in 41 pts and was predictive of the absence of atherosclerosis in all but 1 63% (99/158) had atherosclerosis with 14% (22/158) considered to have at least 1 stenosis &gt; 50% and 8% (12/158) a focal stenosis &lt; 50% Following CTCA 6% (9/158) were waitlisted for invasive angiography Conclusions: CTCA has impacted positively on the assessment of chest pain in Hauora Tairwhiti with availability also influencing utility and timing of stress testing modalities","output":"Time to be NICE New Zealand?

Quality of healthcare service and patient satisfaction has been affected by the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It induced uncertainness and shortage of medical supplies due to a limited global movement. Therefore, this study aimed to assess patient satisfaction and associated factors among chronic patients who had a follow-up in North Shoa healthcare facilities. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was used to select 410 study participants through a systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected by a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire, entered into Epi Info version 7, and transported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify the factors associated with satisfaction. The odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was computed, and p-value <0.05 was considered statistical significance in the multivariable model. RESULTS: The overall level of patient satisfaction was 44.6%. The presence of sign and direction indicators (AOR=3.26, 95% CI=1.1, 9.92), obtaining some ordered drugs (AOR=3.7, 95% CI=1.1, 12.54), getting alcohol for hand cleaning (AOR=2.66, 95% CI=1.1,6.65), obtaining sanitizer for hand cleaning (AOR=4.45, 95% CI=1.72,11.52), and maintaining social distancing (AOR=2.63, 95% CI=1.21, 5.70) were factors associated with patients satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The level of patient satisfaction was very low during a COVID-19 pandemic. The presence of sign and direction indicators, availability of drugs, social distancing, availability of alcohol, and sanitizer were factors associated with patient satisfaction. The intervention targeted at increasing patient satisfaction and improving the quality of service during COVID-19 through maintaining social distancing and availing alcohol or sanitizers is necessary.","output":"Patient Satisfaction and Associated Factors During COVID-19 Pandemic in North Shoa Health Care Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infection accompanied by pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has affected millions of people globally. To date, there are no highly efficient therapies for this infection. Probiotic bacteria can interact with the gut microbiome to strengthen the immune system, enhance immune responses, and induce appropriate immune signaling pathways. Several probiotics have been confirmed to reduce the duration of bacterial or viral infections. Immune fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections can be reinforced. In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in fighting viral infections. Thus, probiotics have emerged as suitable candidates for controlling these infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, any approach with the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic reactions could potentially be useful. Here, we summarize findings regarding the effectiveness of various probiotics for preventing virus-induced respiratory infectious diseases, especially those that could be employed for COVID-19 patients.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional, multicentre study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medical staff of 60 hospitals were selected from 145 designated medical institutions located in the epidemic area where the patients with COVID-19 were treated in China. RESULTS: In total, 1761 respondents wore N95 respirators (use alone 20.8%; combination use 79.2%), and the prevalence of DRPI was 59.2% (95% CI 56.93 to 61.53). A daily wearing time of >4 hours (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.35), wearing a N95 respirator in combination with goggles both with the presence of sweating (OR 13.40, 95% CI 7.34 to 23.16) and without the presence of sweating (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.14) and wearing only a N95 respirator with the presence of sweating (OR 9.60, 95% CI 7.00 to 13.16) were associated with DRPI. A correspondence analysis indicated that if there was no sweating, regardless of whether the N95 respirator was worn by itself or in combination with goggles, single-site DRPI mainly occurred on the nose bridge, cheek and auricle. If there was sweating present, regardless of whether the N95 was worn by itself or in combination with goggles, multiple DRPI sites occurred more often on the face. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of DRPI among medical staff caused by N95 respirators was very high, which was mainly associated with a longer daily wearing time and interaction with sweating.

Higher expectations of customers for speed, convenience, and sustainability have underlined the importance of reliable last-mile providers. This study aims to evaluate some key LMD companies in Vietnam regarding their sustainability performance. For this evaluation, the present research proposes a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) based framework combining the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and the fuzzy weighted aggregated sum product assessment (FWASPAS), and triangular fuzzy numbers are applied to express the linguistic evaluation statements of experts. FAHP was utilized for the determination of criteria weights, then based on the most impactful criteria, FWASPAS was used to prioritize the companies. Delivery time, order fulfillment, decarbonization, convenience of payment, and real-time tracking systems have been ranked as the most impactful criteria in the LMD sector. The robustness of the proposed model was tested by conducting a sensitivity analysis. The results reach common rankings, in which Grab Express is the best performing company in the LMD landscape. The obtained results can be utilized as a guideline for the LMD managers and decision-makers to take in-depth consideration on their businesses under broader aspects to win customers and compete with other competitors.

Our study sought to explore patient perceptions of the influence of SDOH on their COVID-19 infection experience and COVID-19 transmission within their communities. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study of patients in a North Carolina health care systems registry who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 2020 through February 2021. All patients addresses across six counties served were geo-referenced and analyzed by Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify population-dense outbreaks of COVID-19 (hotspots). Spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed to identify census area clusters of white, Black and Hispanic populations, based on the 2019 American Community Survey dataset. Patients were identified by a randomized computer-generated sampling method. Patients participated in semi-structured phone interviews in English or Spanish based on patient preference by trained bilingual researchers. Each interview was evaluated using a combination of deductive and inductive content analysis to determine prevalent themes related to COVID-19 knowledge and diagnosis, disease experience, and the impact of SDOH. Results: The 10 patients interviewed from our COVID-19 hotspots were of equal distribution by sex, and predominantly Black (70%), ages 22-70 years (IQR 45-62 years), and presented to the ED for evaluation (70%). The respondents were more frequently publicly insured (50% medicaid/medicare;vs 30% uninsured;vs 20% private). The interviews demonstrated themes surrounding the experience and impact of COVID-19. The perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 and knowledge of how to prevent infection varied greatly and could be in part explained by SDOH such as their occupation and living conditions. The experiences of COVID-19 testing, diagnosis, isolation and treatment were most influenced by the timing of infection in relation to the study period. Earlier in the pandemic, the knowledge of isolation requirements and available support systems seemed to have negatively impacted the ability to isolate and follow public health guidance, as well as the support mechanisms provided by employers during this period. Communication of infection status once diagnosed varied greatly, with some voicing feelings of shame, and others advocating for sharing of infection experiences to change community behaviors. Suggestions for how to improve the COVID-19 response included improving communication and enforcing public health guidelines, including raising awareness for vulnerable populations. Conclusion: Further exploration of important themes and related SDOH that influenced how the participants experienced the COVID-19 pandemic will be necessary to decrease the negative impacts of SDOH in communities that are high-risk for COVID-19 spread.","output":"30EMF COVID-19 Infection Experiences and Social Determinants of Health in North Carolina: A Qualitative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nation is on a mission to a?flatten the curve a?

Google Scholar was also searched for the related resources within the time limit of 2020. All the found articles were reviewed based on the PRISMA flow diagram. Qualitative studies, case reports, editorials, letters, and other non-original studies were excluded from this systematic analysis. Results Initial search yielded 434 records. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, we selected 74 articles; finally, 8 articles were depicted to be investigated and read in full text. The obtained results showed an increase in the width and volume of the olfactory cleft (OC), complete or partial destruction of OC, and complete occlusion of OC in COVID-19 patients. Deformation and degeneration as well as a subtle asymmetry were evident in the OBs. Computed tomography (CT), meganetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) were used to detect the outcomes of anosmia in these studies. Conclusions The changes in OC are greater than those in OB in patients with COVID-19, mainly due to the inflammatory and immune responses in OC.

Analysis of the literature data showed that SARS-CoV-2 damages cells, like other viruses, but does not lead to their mutations. There are no changes in DNA, there is only misregulation of repression and expression of the genome, a perversion of signaling intercellular interactions that disrupt the mechanisms of differentiation and specialization of cells. The need of viruses to multiply in cambial cells of tissues contributes to the induction of their proliferation and the lack of specialization. Thus, the available information on the cytopathic effects caused by viruses in cells infected with COVID-19 does not yet provide information on the malignant effect of SARS-CoV-2.

These results underscore a membrane fusion mechanism that could be triggered by ERp57, allowing a thiol/disulfide exchange reaction to occur and regulate isomerization of a critical CSD, which ultimately leads to the exposition of the fusion peptide.","output":"A fusion peptide in preS1 and the human protein disulfide isomerase ERp57 are involved in hepatitis B virus membrane fusion process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To gain knowledge about the role of young children attending daycare in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, a random sample of children (n=84) aged between 6 and 30 months attending daycare in Belgium was studied shortly after the start of the epidemic (February 29th ) and before the lockdown (March 18th ) by performing in-house SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR.

In this study the machine learning (ML)-guided linear regression model has been used to address the different types of COVID-19 related issues. The linear regression model has been fitted into the dataset to deal with the total number of positive cases, and the number of recoveries for different states in India such as Maharashtra, West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi and Assam. From the current analysis of COVID-19 data it has been observed that trend of per day number of infection follows linearly and then increases exponentially.

The use of compartment models can be a worthwhile and attractive approach to address this problem. The present study proposes a model compartmentalized by sex and age groups that allows for more complete information on the evolution of the CoViD-19 pandemic in Italy. Material and methods Italian public data on CoViD-19 were pre-treated with a 7-day moving average filter to reduce noise. A time-varying susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model distributed by age and sex groups was then proposed. Recovered and infected individuals distributed by groups were reconstructed through the SIRD model, which was also used to simulate and identify optimal scenarios of pandemic containment by vaccination. The simulation started from realistic initial conditions based on the SIRD model parameters, estimated from filtered and reconstructed Italian data, at different pandemic times and phases. The following three objective functions, accounting for total infections, total deaths, and total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, were minimized by optimizing the percentages of vaccinated individuals in five different age groups. Results The developed SIRD model clearly highlighted those pandemic phases in which younger people, who had more contacts and lower mortality, infected older people, characterized by a significantly higher mortality, especially in males. Optimizing vaccination strategies yielded different results depending on the cost function used. As expected, to reduce total deaths, the suggested strategy was to vaccinate the older age groups, whatever the baseline scenario. In contrast, for QALYs lost and total infections, the optimal vaccine solutions strongly depended on the initial pandemic conditions: during phases of high virus diffusion, the model suggested to vaccinate mainly younger groups with a higher contact rate. Conclusion Because of the poor quality and insufficient availability of stratified public pandemic data, ad hoc information filtering and reconstruction procedures proved essential. The time-varying SIRD model, stratified by age and sex groups, provided insights and additional information on the dynamics of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, also supporting decision making for containment strategies such as vaccination.","output":"A compartment modelling approach to reconstruct and analyze gender and age-grouped CoViD-19 Italian data for decision-making strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Substantial concern exists regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use behaviors. This is especially true for subpopulations like young men who have sex with men and young transgender women (YMSM-YTW) who report higher rates of substance use. This study examines changes in prevalence and frequency of marijuana and non-marijuana drug use among YMSM-YTW following the onset of the pandemic. METHOD Data for this analysis (n = 458 participants, 1356 observations) come from an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of YMSM-YTW. A series of Bayesian multilevel models were used to examine change in prevalence and frequency of use for marijuana and non-marijuana drugs. RESULTS Results indicated no systematic change in prevalence or frequency of marijuana use. However, a decrease in non-marijuana drug use was observed (OR = 0.60, 95 % CrI: [0.37, 0.94]) following the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, a small increase in the frequency of non-marijuana drug use was observed (OR = 1.79, 95 % CrI: [1.02, 3.21]) among individuals who used these substances. CONCLUSIONS These findings concur with a small number of studies identifying a decrease in drug use prevalence but increase in frequency among those who continue to use drugs. Despite the protective effect of lower drug use prevalence, higher frequency of use may lead to additional negative health outcomes of drug use, particularly among groups facing multiple health challenges such as YMSM-YTW.

Asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 from nursing facility staff and residents is a major accelerator of infection. Facility-wide point-prevalence testing is an emerging strategy in disease mitigation. Because time is not available to await the results of randomized controlled trials before implementing strategies in this high-risk setting, an expert Delphi panel composed of experienced long-term care medicine professionals has now met to provide testing guidance for SARS-Coronavirus-2 to NFs. After many email and telephone discussions, the panel responded to a questionnaire that included six different scenarios, based on varying availability of Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing and personal protective equipment (PPE). The panel endorsed facility-wide testing of staff and residents without dissent when diagnostic RT-PCR was available. While the panel recognized the limitations of RT-PCR testing, it strongly recommended this testing for both staff and residents in NFs that were either COVID-19 naive or had limited outbreaks. There was also consensus on testing residents with atypical symptoms in a scenario of limited testing capability. The panel favored testing every 1 to 2 weeks if testing was readily available, reducing the frequency to every month as community prevalence declined or as the collection of additional data further informed clinical critical thinking and decision-making. The panel recognized that frequent testing would have consequences in terms of potential staff shortages due to quarantine after positive tests and increased PPE use. However, the panel felt that not testing would allow new clusters of infection to form. The resulting high mortality rate would outweigh the potential negative consequences of testing. The panel also recognized the pandemic as a rapidly evolving crisis, and that new science and increasing experience might require an updating of its recommendations. The panel hopes that its recommendations will be of value to the long-term care industry and to policy makers as we work together to manage through this challenging and stressful time.","output":"Editorial: Diagnostic Testing for SARS-Coronavirus-2 in the Nursing Facility: Recommendations of a Delphi Panel of Long-Term Care Clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: To provide pharmacy residents perspective on how the department of pharmacy at a large academic medical center prepared and managed the surge in admissions of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to describe how residents were trained for intensive care unit (ICU) staffing, and to provide recommendations on how residency programs nationally could navigate a second wave of COVID-19 admissions or other disaster response situations. SUMMARY: The majority of postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) pharmacy residents at the institution were trained for ICU staffing and deployed throughout the hospital to ICU units converted to dedicated COVID-19 ICUs to assist in patient care. The training process included live videoconference lectures about relevant ICU topics and on-site experiences with critical care clinical pharmacists. Based on their experience in training for and participating in ICU care of patients with COVID-19, the pharmacy residents recommend considering additional cross-training of residents, integration of additional clinical education, creation of opportunities for resident involvement in telehealth, advancement of residents roles in emergency responses, building robust mental health services, and continued advocacy for the advancement of pharmacists and pharmacy residents scope of practice. CONCLUSION: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the institution to reevaluate the allocation of resources, and the department of pharmacy elected to deploy PGY1 pharmacy residents with previous ICU experience to assist in caring for an ICU patient census that had doubled. This experience will be valuable in preparing for another potential wave of COVID-19 cases and a surge in admissions of other groups of patients who deferred care due to the pandemic.","output":"Rising to the challenge: Pharmacy residents on the frontlines during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: In December 2019, the first cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were found in Wuhan (China).

The aim of this study was to determine whether video-laryngoscopes equipped with a ventilation feature can produce effective ventilation. METHODS An intubation mannequin with its trachea connected to a model lung with compliance 50 (normal compliance: C50) and 20 mL/cm H2O (low compliance: C20) was used. Ventilation was established via a ventilation catheter (inner diameter 3.5 mm, 50 cm length) extending to the tip of the video-laryngoscope blade. Three different views of the vocal cords (grade 1, vocal cords fully visualized; grade 2, partial vocal cord visualization; grade 3, only epiglottis visualized) were tested. Ventilation was provided by jet ventilator (Jet). The Jet was operated at 10, 15, and 20 psi (Jet10, Jet15, and Jet20). Effective tidal volume (V(T)) was defined as a V(T) greater than anatomical dead space (150 mL).

We establish a two-hit mouse model to study the effect of maternal influenza A virus infection (first hit) on vulnerability of offspring to heterologous infections (second hit) in later life. Offspring born to influenza A virus infected mothers are stunted in growth and more vulnerable to heterologous infections (influenza B virus and MRSA) than those born to PBS- or poly(I:C)-treated mothers. Enhanced vulnerability to infection in neonates is associated with reduced haematopoetic development and immune responses. In particular, alveolar macrophages of offspring exposed to maternal influenza have reduced capacity to clear second hit pathogens. This impaired pathogen clearance is partially reversed by adoptive transfer of alveolar macrophages from healthy offspring born to uninfected dams. These findings suggest that maternal influenza infection may impair immune ontogeny and increase susceptibility to early life infections of offspring.","output":"Offspring born to influenza A virus infected pregnant mice have increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections in early life."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this article is to provide a brief report on how the Indonesian population has experienced the COVID-19 pandemic in the first 2 months since the establishment of COVID-19 Rapid Response Task Force on March 13.

However, the risk of these coexisting medical conditions in severe and non-severe cases has not been systematically reported. PURPOSE The present study aimed to estimate the association of chronic comorbidities in severe and non-severe cases. METHODS A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Full-text Database (CQVIP) from the inception dates to April 1, 2020, to identify cohort studies assessing comorbidity and risk of adverse outcome. Either a fixed- or random-effects model was used to calculate the overall combined risk estimates. RESULTS A total of 22 studies involving 3286 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Overall, compared with the patients with non-severe cases, the pooled odds ratios (ORs) of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases in patients with severe cases were 2.79 (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 1.66-4.69), 1.64 (95% CI: 2.30-1.08), 1.79 (95% CI: 1.08-2.96), 3.92 (95% CI: 2.45-6.28), and 1.98 (95% CI: 1.26-3.12), respectively.

In this new dimension of air, and proceeding from the ideas of the Presocratics and Gaston Bachelard, I consider the possibility of revisiting the logic of the elements, which has been supplanted in culture by atomistic rationality and metaphysical abstractions. In the elements, movement and transformation prevail over essence, cause, and purpose. I hold that the elements have no essence and manifest themselves only through clashing and mixing with other elements. Thus, during epidemics, the element of air comes into contact with the element of community. I contend that material manifestations of non-individual \\"common sense\\" (sensus communis) may be found at this intersection.

Many serological tests have been developed to track down virus infection in community via identification of antibodies against SARS-CoV2 virus. However, the tests vary in sensitivity, specificity, complexity, and speed. Here, I developed a simple, one-step, quick test to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV2 N (scN) nucleocapsid protein via direct visualization of antigen-antibody reaction. A total of 40 serum samples of SARS-CoV2 patients were purchased from RayBiotech. A total of 50 pre-pandemic human serum samples from San Diego Blood Bank were used as negative controls. After performing the one-step quick test of these 90 serum samples, I found that 39 samples are positive for anti-scN antibodies. All of the 39 positives are from the 40 SARS-CoV2 patients, suggesting that the one-step test is more sensitive than the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), the most widely used rapid antibody test. None of the 50 pre-pandemic samples is positive for anti-scN antibodies, indicating that the one-step test has an excellent specificity. The one-step test takes only ~5 min to detect the antibodies; and 1 ml of Escherichia coli culture can produce reagent proteins sufficient for thousands of the tests. Since the one-step test does not need a secondary antibody, it can be used as a universal test for anti-scN antibodies across different mammalian species to track down both human infection and the animal reservoir of SARS-CoV2 virus.","output":"A novel one-step quick assay for detection of SARS-COV2 antibodies across mammalian species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 became a pandemic affecting more than 200 countries and territories.

In this field, neutralizing antibodies are heavily studied because they reflect the level of infection and individuals' immune status, which are essential when considering resumption of work, flight travel, and border entry control. More importantly, it also allows evaluating the antiviral vaccine efficacy as vaccines are still known for being the ultimate intervention method to inhibit the rapid spread of virulent infectious diseases. In this Review, we first introduce the host immune response after the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the latest results using conventional immunoassays. Next, as an enabling platform for detection with sufficient sensitivity while saving analysis time and sample size, the progress of microfluidic-based immunoassays is discussed and compared based on surface modification, microfluidic kinetics, signal output, signal amplification, sample matrix, and the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Based on the overall comparison, this Review concludes by proposing the future integration of visual quantitative signals on microfluidic devices as a more suitable approach for general use and large-scale surveillance.","output":"Microfluidic immunoassay for detection of serological antibodies: A potential tool for rapid evaluation of immunity against SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As of August 2021, every region of the world has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 196,000,000 cases worldwide.

The aim of this study was to analyze the profile of exhaled breath volatile metabolites (BVM) and gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy volunteers after a single ingestion of maltodextrin (placebo) versus chitin-glucan (CG), an insoluble DF previously shown to be fermented into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) by the human microbiota in vitro. Maltodextrin (4.5 g at day 0) or CG (4.5 g at day 2) were added to a standardized breakfast in fasting healthy volunteers (n = 15). BVM were measured using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) throughout the day. A single ingestion of 4.5 g CG did not induce significant gastrointestinal discomfort. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of breath highlighted that 13 MS-fragments (among 408 obtained from ionizations of breath) discriminated CG versus maltodextrin acute intake in the posprandial state. The targeted analysis revealed that CG increased exhaled butyrate and 5 other BVM C including the microbial metabolites 2,3-butanedione and 3-hydroxybutanone C with a peak observed 6 h after CG intake. Correlation analyses with fecal microbiota (Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing) spotlighted Mitsuokella as a potential genus responsible for the presence of butyric acid, triethylamine and 3-hydroxybutanone in the breath. In conclusion, measuring BMV in the breath reveals the microbial signature of the fermentation of DF after a single ingestion.

To deepen our understanding of the underlying social dynamics, we develop a mathematical model describing cooperation and conflict in a society composed of multiple factions engaged in economic and political interactions. Our model predicts that growing economic and political inequality tends to lead to the collapse of cooperation between factions that were initially seeking to cooperate. Certain mechanisms can delay this process, including the decoupling of political and economic power through rule of law and allegiance to the state or dominant faction. Counterintuitively, anti-conformity (a social norm for independent action) can also stabilize society, by preventing initial defections from cooperation from cascading through society. However, the availability of certain material resources that can be acquired by the state without cooperation with other factions has the opposite effect. We test several of these predictions using a multivariate statistical analysis of data covering 75 countries worldwide.

Its titer in the circulation increases in association with immune suppression, such as in HIV-infected individuals. We evaluated if the TTV titer in saliva from HIV-positive individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) was related to the circulating CD4+ T lymphocyte concentration and the HIV titer. METHODS: Saliva was collected from 276 asymptomatic individuals undergoing ART, and an additional 48 individuals positive for AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma (AIDS-KS). The salivary TTV titer was measured by gene amplification analysis. The circulating CD4+ T lymphocyte and HIV levels were obtained by chart review. RESULTS: TTV was detectable in saliva from 80% of the asymptomatic subjects and 87% of those with AIDS-KS. In the asymptomatic group the median log(10) TTV titer/ml was 3.3 in 200 males vs. 2.4 in 76 females (p < 0.0001). TTV titer/ml was 3.7 when HIV was acquired by intravenous drug usage, 3.2 when by sexual acquisition and 2.4 when blood transfusion acquired. The salivary TTV titer was inversely correlated with the circulating CD4+ T lymphocyte level (p < 0.0001) and positively correlated with the circulating HIV concentration (p = 0.0005). The median salivary TTV titer and circulating HIV titer were higher, and the CD4+ count was lower, in individuals positive for AIDS-KS than in the asymptomatic subjects (p < 0.0001).

We aim to understand the frequency, timing, and outcomes associated with organ failure as defined by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for adult inpatients before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 17,722 unique patients age 18 years and their 20,675 admissions to 3 hospitals within the Montefiore Health System from 1 February 2020 through 31 May 2020 was constructed from the electronic health record. The cohort was stratified into two groups based on admission date with the cutoff being on or after 17 March 2020, when the confirmed index case of SARS-CoV-2 was admitted. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were computed every 2 hours for each patient starting at admission using an automated SOFA calculator to produce a SOFA score composed of cardiovascular, coagulation, liver, renal, and respiratory components. The neurologic component was not computed due to sparsity of Glasgow Coma Scale data captured electronically. Results: A total of 1,789,930 SOFA scores were computed for the 20,675 admissions. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 occurred more during the pandemic (87.6% vs. 1.7%), with 48.4% of pandemic admissions testing positive. There was a significant increase in ICU admissions, usage of invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and mortality during the pandemic as compared to before (Table 1). Renal failure was the most common organ failure on presentation for both periods, but the most common organ failure during hospitalization was respiratory, which increased 53% during the pandemic. The burden of organ failure was higher during the pandemic, with a significant increase in multiorgan failure as indicated by the number of patients with maximum SOFA scores  6 as compared to before the pandemic. Conclusions: Before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, respiratory and renal systems were the most common organ systems to fail. There was a marked increase in the burden of multiorgan failure during the pandemic leading to increased ICU admissions, invasive mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and mortality.","output":"Epidemiology of organ failure before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In November 2020, the federal government of Ethiopia invaded its northern region of Tigray, in collusion with the Government of Eritrea and ethnic Amhara militias.

Though US hospitals face intensifying pressure to lower their cost, including proposals to extend Medicare payment rates to all admissions, the transferability of Indian hospitals cost advantages to US peers remains unclear. Methods Using time-driven activity-based costing methods, we estimate the average cost of personnel and space for an elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery at two American hospitals and one Indian hospital (NH). All three hospitals are Joint Commission accredited and have reputations for use of modern performance management methods. Our case study applies several analytic steps to distinguish transferable from non-transferable sources of NHs cost savings. Results After removing non-transferable sources of efficiency, NHs residual cost advantage primarily rests on shifting tasks to less-credentialed and/or less-experienced personnel who are supervised by highly-skilled personnel when perceived risk of complications is low. NHs high annual CABG volume facilitates such supervised work downshifting. The study is subject to limitations inherent in case studies, does not account for the younger age of NHs patients, or capture savings attributable to NHs negligible frequency of re-admission or post-acute care facility placement. Conclusions Most transferable bases for a modern Indian hospitals cost advantage would require more flexible American states hospital and health professional licensing regulations, greater family participation in inpatient care, and stronger support by hospital executives and clinicians for substantially lowering the cost of care via regionalization of complex surgeries and weekend use of costly operating rooms.","output":"Are Cost Advantages from a Modern Indian Hospital Transferable to the US?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plasmon-tunable tip pyramids (PTTPs) are reproducible and efficient nanoantennas for tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS).

To this end, we examine 143 proteomic datasets, leading us to the realization that 20S proteasome subunits are present in at least 25 different body fluids. Our analysis also indicates that while 19S subunits exist in some of those fluids, the dominant proteasome activator in these compartments is the PA28/ complex. We also elaborate on the positive correlations that have been identified in plasma and extracellular vesicles, between 20S proteasome and activity levels to disease severity and treatment efficacy, suggesting the involvement of this understudied complex in pathophysiology.

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a commonly performed cancer procedure, where variation in UPV represents a gap in care for prostate cancer patients. Here, we systematically synthesize the rates, reasons, predictors, and interventions for UPV after RP, to inform evidence-based quality improvement (QI) initiatives. METHODS A systematic review was performed for studies from 2000-2020 using keywords: \\"readmission,\\" \\"emergency room/department,\\" \\"unplanned visit,\\" and \\"prostatectomy.\\" Studies that focused on UPV following RP and that reported rates, reasons, predictors, or interventions, were included. Data was extracted via a standardized form. Meta-analysis was completed. RESULTS Sixty studies, with 406 107 RP patients, were eligible; 16 028 UPV events (~5%) were analyzed from 317 050 RP patients. UPV rates after RP varied between studies (ER visit range 6-24%; re-admissions range 0-56%). The 30-day and 90-day ER visit rates were 12% and 14%, respectively; the 30-day and 90-day re-admission rates were 4% and 9%, respectively. A total of 55% of all re-admissions after RP are directly due to postoperative genitourinary (GU)-related complications such as strictures, obstructions, fistula, bladder-related, incontinence, urine leak, renal problems, and other unspecified urinary complications. The next most common readmission reasons were anastomosis-related, infection-related, cardiovascular/pulmonary events, and wound-related issues. Thirty-four percent of all ER visits after RP are directly due to urine-related issues such as retention, urinoma, obstruction, leak, and catheter problems. The next most common ER visit reasons were abdominal/gastrointestinal issues, infection-related, venous thromboembolic events, and wound-related issues. Predictors for increased re-admission included: open RP, lymph node dissection, Charlson comorbidity index2, low surgeon/hospital case volume, and socioeconomic determinants of health. Of the 10 interventions evaluated, a 3.4% average reduction in UPV rate was observed, highlighting an approximate two-fold decrease. Meta-analysis demonstrated a significant benefit of interventions over controls with odds ratio 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.46-0.84). Interventions that used multidisciplinary, nurse-centered, programs, with patient self-care/empowerment were more beneficial than algorithmic patient care pathways and preoperative patient education. CONCLUSIONS Twenty years of international, retrospective, experience suggests UPV after RP are often related to GU complications, infection- or wound-related factors. QI interventions to reduce UPV should target these factors. While many re-admissions after RP appear to be unavoidable, ER visits have more opportunity for volume reduction by QI. The interventions evaluated herein have potential to reduce UPV after RP.","output":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of unplanned hospital visits and re-admissions following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic alters many aspects of everyday life that we have grown accustomed to.

First, the Deep Fusion concept was refined by formulating the architecture as one, coherently backpropagated model (Coherent Fusion) to improve binding-affinity prediction accuracy. Secondly, the model was trained using a distributed, genetic hyper-parameter optimization. Finally, a scalable, high-throughput screening capability was developed to maximize the number of ligands evaluated and expedite the path to experimental evaluation. In this work, we present both the methods developed for machine learning-based high-throughput screening and results from using our computational pipeline to find SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.","output":"High-Throughput Virtual Screening of Small Molecule Inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Protein Targets with Deep Fusion Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resilience has been documented as an essential component in managing stress. However, understanding how undergraduate students with different sociodemographic characteristics perceive resilience remains understudied. This study aimed to explore how undergraduate students in one university define and build resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students perception and preferences for receiving resilience training were additionally solicited. A descriptive qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted. Twenty-seven students were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide via Skype instant messaging. The thematic analysis generated five themes: resilience as enduring and withstanding; the building blocks of resilience; resilience: learning or earning; pedagogical considerations for resilience training; and a blended platform for resilience training. Participants described resilience as an enduring and withstanding trait essential for university students. Resilience can be built from intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors that enhanced resilience included desire to succeed and motivation. Extrinsic factors were relational in nature, and friends, family, teachers, and religion were found to boost resilience. Students had several recommendations in designing resilience training, and they recommended the use of a blended platform. Further, students suggested the use of videos, narratives from resilient individuals, and using reflective practice as a pedagogy in resilience training. Future resilience training should consist of personal and interpersonal factors and should be introduced early during the academic term of students university life. As the COVID-19 pandemic compounds an already challenging academic climate, this study lends it findings to expand the resilience literature and develop future resilience training.","output":"Generation Z undergraduate students resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The objetive of these study is to know the characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with uveitis associated with Systemic Autoimmune Disease (SAD) through telematic survey.

Schistosoma japonicum, a zoonotic parasite with a wide range of mammalian hosts, is one of the major pathogens of this disease. Although numerous studies on schistosomiasis japonica have been performed using laboratory animal models, systematic comparative analysis of whole-genome expression profiles in parasites from different laboratory animals and nature mammalian hosts is lacking to date. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adult schistosomes were obtained from laboratory animals BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, New Zealand white rabbits and the natural host, water buffaloes. The gene expression profiles of schistosomes from these animals were obtained and compared by genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray analysis. The results revealed that the gene expression profiles of schistosomes from different laboratory animals and buffaloes were highly consistent (r>0.98) genome-wide. Meanwhile, a total of 450 genes were identified to be differentially expressed in schistosomes which can be clustered into six groups. Pathway analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, amino acid, energy, nucleotide and lipid metabolism. We also identified a group of 1,540 abundantly and stably expressed gene products in adult worms, including a panel of 179 Schistosoma- or Platyhelminthes-specific genes that may be essential for parasitism and may be regarded as novel potential anti-parasite intervention targets for future research. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a comprehensive database of gene expression profiles of schistosomes derived from different laboratory animals and water buffaloes. An expanded number of genes potentially affecting the development of schistosomes in different animals were identified. These findings lay the foundation for schistosomiasis research in different laboratory animals and natural hosts at the transcriptional level and provide a valuable resource for screening anti-schistosomal intervention targets.","output":"Comparative Analysis of Transcriptional Profiles of Adult Schistosoma japonicum from Different Laboratory Animals and the Natural Host, Water Buffalo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To review the relevance of sialic acid as a tumour marker in oral cancer.

More specifically, COVID-19 has changed the way we approach patient and family member interactions. DISCUSSION: Concern for nosocomial spread of this infection has resulted in strict visitation restrictions that have left many patients to face this illness, make difficult decisions, and even die, alone in the hospital. To meet the needs of COVID patients, services such as Emergency Medicine and Palliative Care have responded rapidly by adopting novel ways of practicing medicine. We describe the use of telepalliative medicine (TM) implemented in an emergency department (ED) setting to allow family members the ability to interact with their loved ones during critical illness, and even during the end of life. Use of this technology has helped facilitate goals of care discussions, in addition to providing contact and closure for both patients and their loved ones.

METHODS: The most efficient pool size was determined to be five specimens using a web-based application. From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 L from one SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 L each) for a total volume of 250 L. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12 pools. RESULTS: All 25 pools were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that 2 pools were positive followed by identification of 2 individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions.

Pathogenesis of viral infection, co-morbidities, medical treatments, and psychosocial factors may contribute to COVID-19 related neuropsychological and psychiatric sequelae. This systematic review aims to synthesize available literature on psychiatric and cognitive characteristics of community-dwelling survivors of COVID-19 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Thirty-three studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria for review. Emerging findings link COVID-19 to cognitive deficits, particularly attention, executive function, and memory. Psychiatric symptoms occur at high rates in COVID-19 survivors, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disruption, and to a lesser extent posttraumatic stress. Symptoms appear to endure, and severity of acute illness is not directly predictive of severity of cognitive or mental health issues. The course of cognitive and psychiatric sequelae is limited by lack of longitudinal data at this time. Although heterogeneity of study design and sociocultural differences limit definitive conclusions, emerging risk factors for psychiatric symptoms include female sex, perceived stigma related to COVID-19, infection of a family member, social isolation, and prior psychiatry history. SUMMARY: The extant literature elucidates treatment targets for cognitive and psychosocial interventions. Research using longitudinal, prospective study designs is needed to characterize cognitive and psychiatric functioning of COVID-19 survivors over the course of illness and across illness severity. Emphasis on delineating the unique contributions of premorbid functioning, viral infection, co-morbidities, treatments, and psychosocial factors to cognitive and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 is warranted.","output":"A systematic review of neuropsychological and psychiatric sequalae of COVID-19: implications for treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, lateral flow assays (LFAs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen have been proposed as a complementary option to the more costly and time consuming reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We assessed five commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antigen detecting LFAs (ASSUT EUROPE (Rome, Italy), Besthree (Taizhou, China), Encode (Zhuhai, China), Fortress (Antrim UK), and Hughes Medical (Buckinghamshire, UK), using samples collected from hospitalised individuals with COVID-19 and compared these results against established RT-PCR assays with the aim of estimating test performance characteristics. We performed a diagnostic accuracy study of the five LFAs on 110 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 and 75 COVID-19 negative control participants. Assay evaluation was performed using a modified version of each manufacturers protocol allowing for parallel testing of a single sample on multiple assays. Additional variables were studied including infection acquisition, oxygenation requirements at time of swabbing, and patient outcomes. The 110 patients were 48% (53) female, with mean age 67 years (range 26C100 years), and 77% (85) cases were community onset SARS-CoV-2. Across the five assays, sensitivity ranged from 64 (95% CI 53C73) to 76% (95% CI 65C85); Fortress performed best with sensitivity of 76% (95% CI 65C85). Specificity was high across all assays with 4/5 LFAs achieving 100%. LFA sensitivity was not dependant on RT-PCR cycle thresholds. SARS-CoV-2 antigen detecting LFAs may complement RT-PCR testing to facilitate early diagnosis and provide community testing strategies for identification of patients with COVID-19, however we find suboptimal test performance characteristics across a range of commercially available manufacturers, below WHO and MHRA pre-set sensitivity performance thresholds.

METHOD: Fourteen HD patients were studied including 9 confirmed COVID19 infection and 5 healthy controls. Predialysis and postdialysis blood samples were compared to study alterations on immune status. We identified cytoKines by Luminex (CCL2, CXCL10, IL1Ra, IL10, IL12p70, TNF, IL17Ra, IL6, IL7) and adaptive lymphocyte subsets (CD4/CD8 na?ve, CD4/CD8 MC, CD4/CD8 MP, CD19, CD56). Monocyte subsets (CD14+CD16-, CD14+CD16+, CD14-CD16+) were detected from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as immune activation (CD11b, HLA-DR, CD86) and migration factors (CCR2, CCR5). The supernatant of isolated CD14+ cells after 4-hour stimulation with LPS where analysed by Luminex to measure cytokines (CCL2, CXCL10, GM-CSF, IL10, IL12p70, IL17Ra, IL6, IL7, TNF). RESULTS: Patients with COVID19 presented predialysis: (1) higher plasmatic levels of IL12p70, TNF e IL7, (2) lymphopenia and neutrophilia, (3) higher percentage of intermediate monocytes and lower of non-classical, (4) lower membrane expression of CCR2, HLA-DR y CD86 over Cd14+ cells, and (5) higher production of CCL2, GM-CSF, IL10, IL12p70 y IL17Ra by LPS stimulated monocytes compared with patients without COVID19. When analysed the fold-change between pre and postdialysis values, patients with COVID19 infection present a: (a) higher plasmatic levels of IL6, IL1Ra, CCL2 e CXCL10, (b) reductions of total lymphocites, (c) higher membrane expression of CCR2, CD33 y CD86 on CD14+ cells, and (d) higher production of TNF, GM-CSF, IL10, IL17, IL6 e IL7 by LPS stimulated monocytes compared with patients without COVID19.

INTRODUCTION: The length, level and variation of immune responses to infection with SARS-CoV-2 or following anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination remains unclear, optimal (re)vaccination protocols remain debated. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the magnitude of humoral immune responses, their over-time changes, the frequency of (re)infections and the association with demographic and clinical parameters in Hungarian healthcare workers. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study in two groups of healthcare workers of a public, county-level teaching hospital. Cohort 1: The anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels of 42 workers (female: 100%) were followed up over 8 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection (June 2020-February 2021). The change in humoral immune response and its associations with age, existing chronic conditions, blood type and severity of symptoms were investigated. Cohort 2: The anti-spike-RBD protein IgG levels of 49 workers (female: 73%) with no prior COVID-19 infection were monitored over 8 months (December 2020-August 2021) following immunisation with two doses of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech). Analyses included median analysis, linear regression, ANCOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and Skilling-Mack tests. RESULTS: Cohort 1: IgG levels were on average the highest among those in illness severity category 4, the median time of IgG level reduction below the positive test cut-off was 6 months. Cohort 2: The IgG levels increased 25-fold between the first and second immunisations, but decreased to 6% of the peak level after 210 days. They showed an overall negative association with older age and male sex. The suspected levels of (re)infections were 17% and 14% within the infected and the immunised cohorts, respectively, all symptomless. Those affected all worked on high-risk wards. CONCLUSION: Both the infected and the immunised cohorts showed significantly declining IgG protections beyond 6 months. The average observed rate of (re)infections was 15%, all asymptomatic. Our findings are confirmative of the effectiveness of vaccination to prevent illness, the importance of booster vaccination due to declining humoral immune protection beyond 6 months, and the potential value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG monitoring.

A considerable proportion of HCWs was traumatized during the COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, the institutions should screen out and pay close attention to HCWs who tend to use negative coping (e.g., withdrawal thinking, distraction and blaming others) and arrange work scientifically to avoid overfatigue and PTSS amid the public health crisis.","output":"Posttraumatic stress symptoms among health care workers during the COVID-19 epidemic: The roles of negative coping and fatigue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between subclinical cardiac dysfunction and aerobic exercise capacity (peak VO2) in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), a group at high risk of developing heart failure. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Cross-sectional study. We prospectively enrolled a multiethnic cohort of asymptomatic adults with T2D and no history, signs, or symptoms of cardiovascular disease. Age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched control subjects were recruited for comparison. Participants underwent bioanthropometric profiling, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance with adenosine stress perfusion imaging. Multivariable linear regression analysis was undertaken to identify independent associations between measures of cardiovascular structure and function and peak VO2.

However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined three independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cigs led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-related genes. Specifically, chemokines including CCL20 and CXCL8 are upregulated in smokers, and CCL5 and CCR1 are upregulated in flavor/nicotine-containing e-cig users. We also found genes implicated in inflammasomes, such as CXCL1, CXCL2, NOD2, and ASC, to be upregulated in smokers and these e-cig users. Vaping flavor and nicotine-less e-cigs, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to COVID-19.","output":"Tobacco, but Not Nicotine and Flavor-Less Electronic Cigarettes, Induces ACE2 and Immune Dysregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Containing the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge due to high horizontal transmissivity and asymptomatic carriage rates. Lateral flow device (LFD) immunoassays were introduced in late 2020 to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals rapidly. While LFD technologies have been used for over 60 years, their widespread use as a public health tool during a pandemic is unprecedented. By the end of 2020, data from studies into the efficacy of the LFDs emerged and showed these point-of-care devices to have very high specificity (ability to identify true negatives) but inadequate sensitivity with high false-negative rates. The low sensitivity (<50%) shown in several studies is a critical public health concern, as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers may wrongly be assumed to be noninfectious, posing a significant risk of further spread in the community. Here, we show that the direct visual readout of SARS-CoV-2 LFDs is an inadequate approach to discriminate a potentially infective viral concentration in a biosample. We quantified significant immobilized antigenCantibody-labeled conjugate complexes within the LFDs visually scored as negative using high-sensitivity synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging. Correlating quantitative X-ray fluorescence measurements and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) determined numbers of viral copies, we identified that negatively scored samples could contain up to 100 PFU (equivalent here to 10 000 RNA copies/test). The study demonstrates where the shortcomings arise in many of the current direct-readout SARS-CoV-2 LFDs, namely, being a deficiency in the readout as opposed to the potential level of detection of the test, which is orders of magnitude higher. The present findings are of importance both to public health monitoring during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to the rapid refinement of these tools for immediate and future applications.","output":"More than the Eye Can See: Shedding New Light on SARS-CoV-2 Lateral Flow Device-Based Immunoassays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A hospital-associated outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was reported.

Contacts were defined as HCWs who worked in the patients room or with the patients body fluids. Serum samples from all contacts were collected within 14 days of last contact and one month later. Paired sera were tested for detection of MERS\\\\CoV antibodies by using an indirect ELISA. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (88.4 %) of 43 identified contacts consented to enroll. The mean (SD) age was 38.1 (11.1) years, and 79 % were females. The median (IQR) cumulative duration of work of HCWs in the patients room was 35 (20C165) minutes.

A reverse genetics system of PRRSV North American prototype VR-2332 was developed to explore the importance of different regions of nsp2 for viral replication. A series of mutants with in-frame deletions in the nsp2 coding region were engineered, and infectious viruses were subsequently recovered from transfected cells and further characterized. The results demonstrated that the cysteine protease domain (PL2), the PL2 downstream flanking sequence (amino acids [aa] 181 to 323), and the putative transmembrane domain were critical for replication. In contrast, the segment of nsp2 preceding the PL2 domain (aa 13 to 35) was dispensable for viral replication, and the nsp2 middle hypervariable region (aa 324 to 813) tolerated 100-aa or 200-aa deletions but could not be removed as a whole; the largest deletion was about 400 aa (nsp2Delta324-726).

The large size, distinctive neck anatomy, and supply of the brain parenchyma by the outflow tract pose technical challenges in treatment. The aim of this study was to discuss the endovascular treatment results and illustrate the dynamic nature of serpentine aneurysms. Spontaneous transformation of saccular and fusiform aneurysms into serpentine morphology, along with a case of serpentine-into-fusiform aneurysm transformation during follow-up, is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis from 3 institutions revealed 15 patients with serpentine aneurysms who underwent diagnostic evaluation and endovascular treatment. Nine of the 15 patients underwent endovascular occlusion of the parent vessel with detachable balloon or coils. Six of the 15 patients underwent aneurysm and parent artery occlusion with coiling. RESULTS In 11 patients, improvement or resolution of symptoms was achieved by an endovascular approach without any treatment-related morbidity. Morbidity related to treatment in the immediate postoperative period was seen in 3 patients, with resolution of the deficits at long-term follow-up in 2 patients and persistence of a mild deficit in 1 patient. Endovascular treatment failed to achieve resolution of symptoms in a case with a basilar tip aneurysm treated by aneurysm coiling.

Economic adversity and implicit bias during clinical encounters may lead to physiological responses that place Black women at higher risk for adverse birth outcomes. The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) further exacerbated this risk, as safety protocols increased social isolation in clinical settings, thereby limiting opportunities to advocate for unbiased care. Twitter, 1 of the most popular social networking sites, has been used to study a variety of issues of public interest, including health care. This study considers whether posts on Twitter accurately reflect public discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic and are being used in infodemiology studies by public health experts. Objective This study aims to assess the feasibility of Twitter for identifying public discourse related to social determinants of health and advocacy that influence maternal health among Black women across the United States and to examine trends in sentiment between 2019 and 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Tweets were collected from March 1 to July 13, 2020, from 21 organizations and influencers and from 4 hashtags that focused on Black maternal health. Additionally, tweets from the same organizations and hashtags were collected from the year prior, from March 1 to July 13, 2019. Twint, a Python programming library, was used for data collection and analysis. We gathered the text of approximately 17,000 tweets, as well as all publicly available metadata. Topic modeling and k-means clustering were used to analyze the tweets. Results A variety of trends were observed when comparing the 2020 data set to the 2019 data set from the same period. The percentages listed for each topic are probabilities of that topic occurring in our corpus. In our topic models, tweets on reproductive justice, maternal mortality crises, and patient care increased by 67.46% in 2020 versus 2019. Topics on community, advocacy, and health equity increased by over 30% in 2020 versus 2019. In contrast, tweet topics that decreased in 2020 versus 2019 were as follows: tweets on Medicaid and medical coverage decreased by 27.73%, and discussions about creating space for Black women decreased by just under 30%. Conclusions The results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic may have spurred an increased focus on advocating for improved reproductive health and maternal health outcomes among Black women in the United States. Further analyses are needed to capture a longer time frame that encompasses more of the pandemic, as well as more diverse voices to confirm the robustness of the findings.

This study aims to assess cognitive status and longitudinal decline at 6 months post-infection in elderly patients recovered from COVID-19.Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 1013 COVID-19 inpatients aged over 60 years who were discharged from three COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhan, China, from February 10 to March 13, 2020. In total, 262 uninfected living spouses of COVID-19 patients were selected as controls. Subjects were examined for their current cognitive status using a Chinese version of the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status-40 (TICS-40) and longitudinal cognitive decline using an Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Cognitive assessments were performed 6 months after patient discharge.Findings: COVID-19 patients had significantly lower TICS-40 scores (patients: 29.736.13;controls: 30.745.95, p=0.016) and higher IQCODE scores (patients: 3.400.81;controls: 3.150.39, p<0.001) than the controls.

Many of these tasks, e.g., carrying a cup of coffee, require manipulating objects with complex dynamics. Thus, the absence of somatosensory information regarding the interaction with virtual objects during robot-aided training might be limiting the potential benefits of robotic training on motor (re)learning. We hypothesize that providing somatosensory information through the haptic rendering of virtual environments might enhance motor learning and skill transfer. Furthermore, the inclusion of haptic rendering might increase the task realism, enhancing participants agency and motivation. Providing arm weight support during training might also enhance learning by limiting participants fatigue. METHODS: We conducted a study with 40 healthy participants to evaluate how haptic rendering and arm weight support affect motor learning and skill transfer of a dynamic task. The task consisted of inverting a virtual pendulum whose dynamics were haptically rendered on an exoskeleton robot designed for upper limb neurorehabilitation. Participants trained with or without haptic rendering and with or without weight support. Participants task performance, movement strategy, effort, motivation, and agency were evaluated during baseline, short- and long-term retention. We also evaluated if the skills acquired during training transferred to a similar task with a shorter pendulum. RESULTS: We found that haptic rendering significantly increases participants movement variability during training and the ability to synchronize their movements with the pendulum, which is correlated with better performance. Weight support also enhances participants movement variability during training and reduces participants physical effort. Importantly, we found that training with haptic rendering enhances motor learning and skill transfer, while training with weight support hampers learning compared to training without weight support. We did not observe any significant differences between training modalities regarding agency and motivation during training and retention tests. CONCLUSION: Haptic rendering is a promising tool to boost robot-aided motor learning and skill transfer to tasks with similar dynamics. However, further work is needed to find how to simultaneously provide robotic assistance and haptic rendering without hampering motor learning, especially in brain-injured patients.

METHODS A retrospective study of 90 consecutive rAAAs from November 2007 to June 2015 was conducted. Multivariable regression models were produced to determine blood products associated with 30-day morbidity and mortality post-rAAA. RESULTS The overall mortality was 14.6%. At multivariable analyses, transfusion with FFP (>3 units) was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 11.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-96.72, P = .027).

Here, the effect of the probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the pig faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets, which received either the probiotic bacterium or not. RESULTS: From 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial, DNA and RNA virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled Next Generation Sequencing resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. In average, 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses. The percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest (55C77%) in the samples of the youngest piglets and lowest (8C10%) in the samples of the sows. In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22C44% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows. The dominating mammalian viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets (kobuvirus), 54 day-old piglets (boca-, dependo- and pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus [PigSCV]) and the sows (PigSCV, circovirus and circovirus-like viruses CB-A and RW-A). In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample, was generally higher for the sows as compared to the piglets. No consistent differences in the virome composition could be identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the control group.

Methods: Seventy nine hospitalized COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study and provided blood samples in which platelet reactivity in response to stimulation with ADP and TRAP-6 was determined using flow cytometry. Clinical outcomes included thrombotic events, and all-cause mortality. Results: The incidence of TE in this study was 28% and all-cause mortality 16%. Patients that developed a TE were younger than patients that did not develop a TE [median age of 55 vs. 70 years; adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.96 per 1 year of age, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92C1.00; p = 0.041].

The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic illustrates this at a global level. The sudden increased demand on delivery systems puts unique pressures on pre-established care pathways. These extraordinary times require efficient tools for smart governance and resource allocation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an innovative web-based solution addressing the seemingly insurmountable challenges of triaging, monitoring, and delivering nonhospital services unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An adaptable crisis management digital platform was envisioned and designed with the goal of improving the system's response on the basis of the literature; an existing shared health record platform; and discussions between health care providers, decision makers, academia, and the private sector in response to the COVID 19 epidemic. RESULTS: The Crisis Management Platform was developed and offered to health authorities in Ontario on a nonprofit basis. It has the capability to dramatically streamline patient intake, triage, monitoring, referral, and delivery of nonhospital services. It decentralizes the provision of services (by moving them online) and centralizes data gathering and analysis, maximizing the use of existing human resources, facilitating evidence-based decision making, and minimizing the risk to both users and providers. It has unlimited scale-up possibilities (only constrained by human health risk resource availability) with minimal marginal cost.

METHODS Between 2009 and 2011, 53 patients underwent total laparoscopic radical hysterectomies. They were categorized into groups A, B, and C based on the status of preserved pelvic nerve networks: complete preservation of the pelvic nerve plexus (group A, 27 cases); partial preservation (group B, 13 cases); and complete sacrifice (group C, 13 cases). To evaluate bladder function, urodynamic studies were conducted preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS No significant difference in sensory function was found between groups A and B. However, the sensory function of group C was significantly lower than that of the other groups. Group A had significantly better motor function than groups B and C. No significant difference in motor function was found between groups B and C.

This also appears to hold for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evidence from China and Europe has suggested that mortality from COVID-19 infection is higher in men than women, but evidence from US populations is lacking. Utilizing data from a large healthcare provider, we determined if males, as compared to females have a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and if among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, male sex is independently associated with COVID-19 severity and poor in-hospital outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). Data were extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR). A total of 96,473 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens via Polymerized Chain Reaction (PCR) tests were included. For hospital-based analyses, all patients admitted during the same time-period were included. Of the 96,473 patients tested, 14,992 (15.6%) tested positive, of whom 4,785 (31.9%) were hospitalized and 452 (9.5%) died. Among all patients tested, men were significantly older. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity among all tested individuals was 15.5%, and was higher in males as compared to females 17.0% vs. 14.6% [OR 1.20]. This sex difference held after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, insurance type, median income, BMI, smoking and 17 comorbidities included in Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [aOR 1.39]. A higher proportion of males (vs. females) experienced pulmonary (ARDS, hypoxic respiratory failure) and extra-pulmonary (acute renal injury) complications during their hospital course. After adjustment, length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality were significantly higher in males as compared to females. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of a large US cohort, males were more likely to test positive for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients, males were more likely to have complications, require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and had higher mortality than females, independent of age. Sex disparities in COVID-19 vulnerability are present, and emphasize the importance of examining sex-disaggregated data to improve our understanding of the biological processes involved to potentially tailor treatment and risk stratify patients.","output":"Sex differences in susceptibility, severity, and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019: Cross-sectional analysis from a diverse US metropolitan area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has spread rapidly in China and around the world. Published studies have revealed that some patients with COVID-19 had abnormal liver function in laboratory tests. However, the results were inconsistent and the analysis of epidemiological data stratified by the severity of COVID-19 was not available in previous meta-analyses. Furthermore, these meta-analyses were suspected of overestimating the incidence of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 because some studies considered transaminase elevation as liver injury, which might partially result from cardiac and muscle injury. This systematic review aims to enrol published literatures related to COVID-19 without language restriction, analyse the data based on the severity of the COVID-19 and explore the impact of varied definitions of liver injury on the incidence of liver injury. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We have conducted a preliminary search on PubMed and Excerpta Medica Database on 13 April 2020, for the studies published after December 2019 on the prevalence of acute liver injury and hypertransaminemia in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers will independently screen studies, extract data and assess the risk of bias. We will estimate the pooled incidence of hypertransaminemia and acute liver injury in patients with COVID-19 by using the random-effects model. The I2 test will be used to identify the extent of heterogeneity. Publication bias will be assessed by funnel plot and performing the Begg's and Egger's test if adequate studies are available. We will perform a risk of bias assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklist.

The discovery of late health effects in adulthood prompted investigation of the medical aspects of irradiation in childhood and led to the establishment of strict protocols for the use of X-ray irradiation. These studies ignored alopecia, which affects some individuals who underwent irradiation for scalp ringworm as children. This study examined the impact of alopecia due to irradiation for scalp ringworm on the health and psychosocial status of affected women. METHODS: We analysed a random sample of 130 medical files of women recognised by Israel's state committees as suffering from permanent hair loss as a result of scalp ringworm irradiation in childhood. The coded medical data included demographic variables, self-reported mental health conditions, self-reported physical health conditions, self-reported social conditions, and spousal relationship. RESULTS: Compared with the general population of women in Israel, research participants reported significantly higher rates of depression, anti-depressant and/or anti-anxiety drug use, psychotherapy or psychiatric hospitalisation, attempted suicide, migraines, cancer, and divorce. Many described humiliating social experiences due to their appearance, both in childhood and adulthood, that led them to curtail their social interactions. The participants also reported that alopecia negatively affected their spousal relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Life with hair loss from scalp ringworm irradiation in childhood has a negative impact on women's health status and psychosocial state. Health policy-makers must broaden their approach to women who underwent scalp ringworm irradiation by addressing the effects of their hair loss in addition to the effects of the radiation treatment per se. This may be achieved by guiding physicians who provide medical services to these women to take into account the psychosocial and health risks related to hair loss in their diagnosis and treatment as well as by creating a cadre of specially trained mental health professionals who can address their unique psychosocial needs. They must also consider including the specialized mental health services tailored for these women's unique needs in the Healthcare Basket.","output":"Hair loss due to scalp ringworm irradiation in childhood: health and psychosocial risks for women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACTwWe use the urban political ecology perspective to explore how communities of homo religiosus (re)configure politics of COVID-19 in India and Pakistan.

There is an interest in how outdoor recreation professionals perceived outdoor recreation by the public during the pandemic and whether professionals could identify specific implications from the Covid-19/outdoor recreation experience. Climate adaptation literature supports the idea that current global challenge coupled with projections for ongoing challenge requires a pro-active approach; this turn to climate adaptation for potential consideration or guidance is based on characteristics that the Covid-19 pandemic shares with climate change. Outdoor recreational professionals' review of a recent public survey and subsequent semi-structured interviews with this group were conducted to obtain outdoor recreation professionals' detailed perceptions on survey outcomes. Results show that the professionals confirm a rapid and significant increase in outdoor recreation participation. Further, professionals identified critical trends in the increase of new or inexperienced outdoor recreation participants. A positive and proactive list of implications emerged as themes of the interviews. A review and synthesis of the themes support the national goals for outdoor recreation in Sweden. Further, results indicate a current opportunity for outdoor recreation to address concerns for diminishing nature experience and support connectedness to nature.

Among the potential 72 antivirals tested herein that were previously proposed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, only 18% had in vitro antiviral activity. Moreover, only eight families had an IC50 below 25 M or 102 IU/mL. These include chloroquine derivatives and remdesivir, along with plitidepsin, cathepsin inhibitors, nelfinavir mesylate hydrate, interferon 2-alpha, interferon-gamma, fenofibrate and camostat. Plitidepsin was the only clinically approved drug displaying nanomolar efficacy. Four of these families, including novel cathepsin inhibitors, blocked viral entry in a cell-type specific manner. Since the most effective antivirals usually combine therapies that tackle the virus at different steps of infection, we also assessed several drug combinations. Although no particular synergy was found, inhibitory combinations did not reduce their antiviral activity. Thus, these combinations could decrease the potential emergence of resistant viruses. Antivirals prioritized herein identify novel compounds and their mode of action, while independently replicating the activity of a reduced proportion of drugs which are mostly approved for clinical use.

Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the role of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD. METHODS: We collected inflamed and uninflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing data, and microarrays from tissue pre/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed. RESULTS: In inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas colonic ACE2 was higher in inflamed colon of CD/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression. Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2 regulation in responders. CONCLUSION: Intestinal inflammation alters SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors in the intestine, with opposing dysregulations in ileum and colon. HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene, seems an important upstream regulator of ACE2 in ileum, whereas interferon signaling might dominate in colon.","output":"Intestinal receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in inflamed IBD tissue seems downregulated by HNF4A in ileum and upregulated by interferon regulating factors in colon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Laparoscopic gastric wedge resection is a standard treatment for removing gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs). So far, however, there have been few reports of single-incision laparoscopic intragastric wedge resection. Our aim was to describe this procedure and our experience with it. METHODS From January 2010 to December 2013, a total of 21 consecutive patients with gastric SMTs underwent single-incision intragastric resection at our institution. Their clinicopathologic data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The patients consisted of nine men and 12 women with a mean age of 51.9  12.9 years (22-69 years). Their mean body mass index was 22.6  2.0 kg/m(2). Mean tumor size was 2.4  0.7 cm, with the following anatomic distribution: esophagogastric junction in three patients, fundus in twelve, upper body in three, and lower body in two.

A recent study of cardiac surgery patients suggests that physical frailty is a risk factor for both complications. We sought to examine the relationship between preoperative frailty and postoperative delirium and preoperative frailty and POCD after major noncardiac surgery. METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of patients >65 years old having major elective noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were preexisting dementia, inability to consent, cardiac, intracranial, or emergency surgery. Preoperative frailty was determined using the FRAIL scale, a simple questionnaire that categorizes patients as robust, prefrail, or frail. Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) twice daily, starting in the recovery room until hospital discharge. All patients were assessed with neuropsychological tests (California Verbal Learning Test II, Trail Making Test, subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Logical Memory Story A, Immediate and Delayed Recall, Animal and Vegetable verbal fluency, Boston Naming Test, and the Mini-Mental Status Examination) before surgery and at 3 months afterward. RESULTS A total of 178 patients met inclusion criteria; 167 underwent major surgery and 150 were available for follow-up 3 months after surgery. The median age was 70 years old. Thirty-one patients (18.6%) tested as frail, and 72 (43.1%) prefrail before surgery. After adjustment for baseline cognitive score, age, education, surgery duration, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, type of surgery, and sex, patients who tested frail or prefrail had an estimated 2.7 times the odds of delirium (97.5% confidence interval, 1.0-7.3) when compared to patients who were robust. There was no significant difference between the proportion of POCD between patients who tested as frail, prefrail, or robust.

Motivated by this notion, a real-time crowd monitoring and management system for social distance classification is proposed in this research paper. In the proposed system, people are segregated from the background using the YOLO v4 object detection technique, and then the detected people are tracked by bounding boxes using the Deepsort technique. This system significantly helps in COVID-19 prevention by social distance detection and classification in public places using surveillance images and videos captured by the cameras installed in these places. The performance of this system has been assessed using mean average precision (mAP) and frames per second (FPS) metrics.

Research regarding longer-term effects in this group is limited. We aimed to assess impacts of COVID-19 and predictors of persistent symptoms, in people with asthma. METHODS: Using data from an online UK-wide survey of 4500 people with asthma (median age 50C59 years, 81% female), conducted in October 2020, we undertook a mixed methods analysis of the characteristics and experience of those reporting having had COVID-19. RESULTS: The COVID-19 group (n=471, 10.5%) reported increased inhaler use and worse asthma management, compared with those not reporting COVID-19, but did not differ by gender, ethnicity or household income. Among the COVID-19 group, 56.1% reported having long COVID, 20.2% were unsure. Those with long COVID were more likely than those without long COVID to describe: their breathing as worse or much worse after their initial illness (73.7% vs 34.8%, p<0.001), increased inhaler use (67.8% vs 34.8%, p<0.001) and worse or much worse asthma management (59.6% vs 25.6%, p<0.001). Having long COVID was not associated with age, gender, ethnicity, UK nation or household income. Analysis of free text survey responses identified three key themes: (1) variable COVID-19 severity, duration and recovery; (2) symptom overlap and interaction between COVID-19 and asthma; (3) barriers to accessing healthcare.

The novelty and lack of a definitive treatment protocol for the virus and the acute respiratory distress syndrome it produces has resulted in patients being placed on artificial ventilation and most often never recovering therefrom. Very little is known about the pathophysiology of the virus and the biological mechanisms in which it disrupts to bring about the now identified wide array of clinical features which are not solely isolated to the respiratory tract. It is now an established fact however, that one of the major pathways implicated and on which often results in the death and or severe complications in COVID-19 patients is the cytokine storm. The use of new drugs to combat such a cytokine storm is thus important considering the current global COVID-19 situation so as to stop the further progression of the disease in patients and decrease both morbidity and mortality by crippling a major mechanism which hastens death in the hosts. It is, therefore, vital that a systematic analysis and review of the various therapeutic agents are undertaken to select the best drug for the treatment of patients with cytokine storm. This research aims to relate the best therapeutic regimens currently available precisely and concisely to physicians so as to ensure the best possible treatment modality is selected for each patient.

The rationale behind the use of these drugs being to suppress the immune system and thus decrease the detrimental cytokine cascade induced in severely ill COVID-19 patients will be instrumental in the treatment and prevention of severe complication. It is vital for the various drugs under trial and implemented in emergency use to be compared and studied so as to best select the drug which can be incorporated into a treatment regimen which is both effective and has diminished adverse effects.","output":"Pharmacotherapy of Cytokine Release Syndrome in Severe COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have raised the possibility of reproductive and developmental changes in miniature swine chronically exposed to a strong 60\\\\Hz electric field.

SARS-CoV-2 displays a great deal of homology with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which all display similar components which may serve as targets, namely the Spike (S) protein, the main protease (M(Pro)) which is a chymotrypsin-like protease (CL(Pro)) and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp).

The 3 UTRs of BCoV and MHV have been previously shown to be interchangeable. Here, a reporter-containing BCoV DI RNA was shown to be replicated by all five BCoV-like helper viruses and by MHV-H2 (a human cell-adapted MHV strain), a representative of the MHV-like subgroup, demonstrating group 2 common 5 and 3 replication signaling elements. BCoV DI RNA, furthermore, acquired the leader of HCoV-OC43 by leader switching, demonstrating for the first time in vivo recombination between animal and human coronavirus molecules. These results indicate that common replication signaling elements exist among group 2 coronaviruses despite a two-cluster pattern within the group and imply there could exist a high potential for recombination among group members.","output":"Common RNA replication signals exist among group 2 coronaviruses: evidence for in vivo recombination between animal and human coronavius molecules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential threat to wildlife resources in Africa. In this review, using Tanzania as a case, we examine the impacts and risks that wildlife sectors in Africa are facing or are likely to face as a result of this pandemic. We recognize loss of revenues from tourism as a major impact that could negatively influence the management of wildlife species and habitats. Loss of tourism revenues reduces capacity of the conservation agencies to fund conservation operations and support the benefit sharing schemes. Furthermore, it undermines the efficacy of conservation to compete with alternative economic activities which are ecologically damaging. Increased unemployment and household poverty due to closure of businesses may exacerbate wildlife crime and unsustainable activities. Additionally, contributions from donor-funding organizations and development partners cannot be guaranteed as revenues may be diverted to support other sectors including health. In order to address and minimize the impacts and reduce the risks to the wildlife sector, the following policy measures are recommended: ensure adequate budget for conservation;develop a crisis management plan;reconsider protocols for conducting wildlife trade;develop a comprehensive tourism recovery plan;promote scientific studies focusing on zoonoses and adopt a One-Health Approach as a matter of urgency in dealing with COVID-19 and future pandemics. ?

Their longstanding history of urbanisation and familiarity with people makes them an excellent target for studies of the effects of urban living and cognition.

To investigate these questions further, behavioural responses to human cues in a food-related context are investigated and presented in a systematic ethogram, which identifies three distinct markers of attention. Those behaviours C head turns, approaches, and the angular body position relative to the experimenter C differ significantly between control and food conditions, showing that attention towards humans in a food-related context is upregulated and this is reflected in the gulls behaviour. In food condition trials, head turns occur more often and gulls face towards the experimenter (90) with occasional approaches that are never seen in control conditions. Acoustic and behavioural human food-like cues alone were insufficient to elicit a response similar to that seen in presence of a real food item, indicating that gulls specifically pay attention to humans in foraging contexts. The results show situation-dependent attentional modulation in gulls, highlight knowledge gaps about how Herring gulls might identify food objects and provide an ethogram description of attentive behaviours that can be used in further study of attentional modulation in gulls.","output":"An Ethogram Identifies Behavioural Markers of Attention to Humans in European Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The actions of homesteaders and rustlers in Johnson County led members of the Wyoming Stock Grower's Association to embark on an ill-advised secret invasion of Buffalo where they planned to eliminate all opposition-real or imagined Some of these changes will undoubtedly remain after the pandemic subsides because the cost savings and efficiencies will continue to provide benefits [ ]investors in open range cattle ranches deluded themselves in their fruitless quest for the \\"sure thing\\" investment Year after year, whether it's open range cattle ranching, stock market ploys or Bernie Madoff Ponzi schemes, the small stationary world of \\"the sure thing\\" continues to plague investors","output":"Wild West Finance: The Johnson County Range War (Part 3)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Lung Cancer TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 receptor monoclonal antibody, increases survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It causes less toxicity than traditional chemotherapy, however it can induce autoimmune adverse events including pneumonitis and colitis. There have been a limited number of case reports chronicling myositis with respiratory distress as an adverse effect of pembrolizumab. We present a case of a patient with NSCLC being treated with pembrolizumab, which induced respiratory failure secondary to myositis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old man with metastatic NSCLC status post right upper lobectomy on carboplatin/paclitaxel/pembrolizumab started 10/26/20, with recent hepatitis diagnosed one week prior to admission and identified as secondary to pembrolizumab, on treatment with prednisone (1 mg/kg), presented with proximal weakness and progressive exertional dyspnea over the last three weeks. Vital signs were remarkable for tachypnea and tachycardia. Physical exam showed 2/5 proximal muscle strength in upper and lower extremities, absent deep tendon reflexes, and no skin rash. Labs revealed CK 1567, LDH 889, SARS-CoV2 PCR negative. CT pulmonary arteries was negative for acute lung processes. The patient required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for respiratory distress. Treatment was initiated with pyridostigmine (60mg QID PO) and pulsed glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 1 g daily). He remained NIPPV dependent so pyridostigmine was increased to 90mg QID PO and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) 85 g QD was added for refractory respiratory failure and muscle weakness. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies, ANA, anti SSA/SSB, anti-Jo1 were negative. Lumbar puncture was performed with normal opening pressure, CSF cell count, and chemistry. The clinical diagnosis was myositis attributed to pembrolizumab. The patient responded to a week of continued IVIG (30 g QD for 5 more days) and tapering steroids, with improvement in proximal muscle strength and was weaned off NIPPV. DISCUSSION: Pembrolizumab works as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which may cause an autoimmune effect. One study identified 5 patients with pembrolizumab induced myositis. Our patient, presented with proximal muscle weakness and respiratory distress requiring NIPPV, two months after starting pembrolizumab. His respiratory distress was not due to lung disease. Autoimmune workup was negative. He underwent a lumbar puncture which ruled out Guillain-Barre syndrome. He was diagnosed with pembrolizumab induced myositis. A limitation in our case was that a biopsy never confirmed the diagnosis as he responded to pulsed steroids and IVIG. In other cases, the myositis has been treated by plasma exchange or immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab can induce potentially fatal myositis. It is crucial that clinicians are aware of this so prompt treatment can be initiated. REFERENCE #1: Claus J, Van Den Bergh A, Verbeek S, Wauters E, Nackaerts K.

This study analyzes the prevalence of residual symptoms and quality of life (QoL) after COVID-19. Methods An anonymous online survey was administrated in Pakistan from November 2020 to April 2021 in COVID-19 survivors. The questionnaire used the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) to assess mental and physical QoL. Multivariate linear regression was used to explore factors associated with mental and physical QoL scores. Results A total of 331 COVID-19 survivors participated in our survey. Around 42.0% of the cohort reported within 1C3 months of diagnosis of COVID-19. The common residual symptoms were body aches (39.9%), low mood (32.6%), and cough (30.2%). Better physical QoL was associated with being male (adjusted beta: 3.328) and having no residual symptoms (6.955). However, suffering from nausea/vomiting during initial COVID-19 infection (?4.026), being admitted to the ICU during COVID-19 infection (?9.164), and suffering from residual body aches (?5.209) and low mood (?2.959) was associated with poorer QoL. Better mental QoL was associated with being asymptomatic during initial COVID-19 infection (6.149) and post-COVID (6.685), while experiencing low mood post-COVID was associated with poorer mental QoL (?8.253 [-10.914, ?5.592]). Conclusion Despite presumed recovery from COVID-19, patients still face a wide range of residual symptoms months after initial infection, which contributes towards poorer QoL.

The aims of this study were 1) to describe the psychological distress and stressors experienced by high school athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic and to elucidate the relationships between them and 2) to determine the relationship between psychological distress and social support. Methods: Participants of this cross-sectional study were recruited from public high schools in East Japan. We conducted either an online or paper-based questionnaire survey from July 12 to 31, 2020, and used data collected from 3017 high school student athletes (valid response rate: 88.7%) for the analyses. We evaluated psychological distress (K6 []10), stressors to athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic (SAC-19), and perceived social support from others. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for developing psychological distress. Results: Among the participants, 764 (25.3%) experienced psychological distress. Among the five factors extracted from the SAC-19, self-restraint requests (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04), pressure from the surrounding environment (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.12-1.18), and difficulties in maintaining athletic activities (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.12-1.21) increased the risk of psychological distress.

We conducted stakeholder interviews and in-person observations to map outpatient clinic flow and measure resource utilization of four key steps: check-in, vitals collection and rooming, clinician encounter, and check-out. Finally, we calculated the resource cost for each step using representative salary information to calculate total visit cost. Results Video visits did not systematically reduce the amount of time clinicians spent with patients. Mean [standard deviation (SD)] visit costs were as follows: traditional clinic visits, $26.84 ($10.13); physician-led video visits, $27.26 ($9.69); and physician assistant-led video visits, $9.86 ($2.76). There was no significant difference in the total cost associated with physician-led traditional clinic visits and video visits (P=0.89). However, physician assistant-led video visits were significantly lower cost than physician-led video visits (P<0.001). Conclusions Using physician-led video visits does not reduce the cost of outpatient surgical visits when compared to traditional clinic visits.

However, there are also well-documented cases of spontaneous cancer regression, the causative mechanisms of which are not understood. It is known that inflammation is a negative pathophysiological process that may support the development of cancer, but it is also believed that the immune system as well as oxidative stress play important roles in prevention of cancer development and defense against tumor progression. Hence, in animal models spontaneous regression of cancer could be mediated by rapid inflammatory response of granulocytes, acting against cancer mostly as innate immune response. In addition, the administration of granulocytes at the site of solid tumors can lead to tumor regression or can slow down tumor growth and extend the overall survival of animals. In both cases, similar to the radiotherapy, surgery and various chemotherapies, oxidative stress occurs generating lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE).

The purpose of this study is to examine the role of digital infrastructure in supporting compliance with travel restrictions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have issued stay-at-home orders and curtailed a variety of economic activities. As countries have adopted aggressive policies to limit the spread of COVID-19, varying levels of national infrastructure to provide internet access have limited some nations ability to reduce travel requirements. As national policies struggle to address public health issues, location analytics enabled by big data provide unique insights regarding the efficacy of digital infrastructure. These insights can provide valuable tools to public health officials and regulators in understanding how health recommendations are implemented within an economy.

Enzymatic attachment of complex oligosaccharides to proteins (glycosylation) is highly responsive to numerous (patho)physiological conditions and ageing, which is perhaps best exemplified on IgG. The prospect of immune age reduction, by reverting induced glycosylation changes through metabolic intervention, opens many possibilities. Herein, we have investigated whether weight loss interventions affect inflammation- and ageing-related glycosylation alterations, in a longitudinal cohort of bariatric-surgery patients. To support potential findings, BMI-related glycosylation changes were monitored in a longitudinal TwinsUK cohort. Methods IgG and plasma N-glycans were chromatographically profiled in 37 obese patients, subjected to low-calorie diet and then to bariatric surgery, across multiple timepoints. Similarly, plasma glycome was analysed in 1,680 TwinsUK participants and longitudinally monitored during a 20-year follow-up. Findings Low-calorie diet induced marked increase in low branched and significant decrease in highly branched, more complex plasma N-glycans - the change opposite to the one typically observed in inflammatory conditions. Bariatric surgery resulted in extensive, gradual alterations in IgG glycome, that accompanied progressive weight loss during one year follow-up. We observed significant increase in digalactosylated and sialylated, and substantial decrease in agalactosylated and core fucosylated IgG glycans. In general, such IgG glycan profile is associated with a younger biological age and reflects enhanced anti-inflammatory IgG potential. The TwinsUK cohort replicated weight loss-associated agalactosylation decrease and digalactosylation increase, estimated through BMI decrease over a 20-year period. Interpretation Altogether, these findings highlight that weight loss substantially affects both plasma and IgG N-glycosylation, resulting in improved biological and immune age.","output":"Extensive weight loss can reduce immune age by altering IgG N-glycosylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lockdown restrictions that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic have reshaped the way people live, work, and interact with each other.

Our results showed that HCQ did not have a significant effect on primary outcomes due to COVID-19 infection when compared to controls after adjusting for confounders (OR 1.43 95% CI 0.85 to 2.37, P value=0.17). Co-administration of azithromycin had no effect on primary outcomes (OR 2.7 95% CI 0.82 to 8.85 P value =0.10). HCQ was found to be associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia (OR 10.9 95% CI 1.72 - 69.49, P value =0.011) and diarrhea(OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.5, P value =0.003), but not QT prolongation(OR=1.92, 95% CI 0.95-3.9, P value =0.06) or cardiac arrhythmia.(OR=1.06, 95% CI 0.55-2.05, P value =0.85). Conclusion Our results showed no significant beneficial effect of using hydroxychloroquine on the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the risk of hypoglycemia due to hydroxychloroquine would possess a significant risk for out of hospital use.","output":"The efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in COVID19 patients : a multicenter national retrospective cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hokkaido was the first Japanese prefecture to be affected by COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Japanese government has been publishing the information of each individual who was tested positive for the virus. Method: The current study analyzed the 1269 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed in Hokkaido in order to examine sex-based differences in symptomology and infectiveness, as well as the status of reinfections and the viral transmission networks. Results: The majority of asymptomatic patients were females and older. Females were 1.3-fold more likely to be asymptomatic (p <0.001) while a decade of difference in age increased the likelihood of being asymptomatic by 1% (p <0.001). The data contained information up to quaternary viral transmission. The transmission network revealed that, although asymptomatic patients are more likely to transmit the virus, the individuals infected by asymptomatic cases are likely to be asymptomatic (p <0.001). Four distinct co-occurrences of symptoms were observed, including (i) fever/fatigue, (ii) pharyngitis/rhinitis, (iii) ageusia/anosmia, and (iv) nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. The presences of diarrhea (p = 0.05) as well as nausea/vomiting (p <0.001) were predictive of developing dyspnea, i.e., severe disease. About 1% of the patients experienced reinfection.

One difficulty in deriving these quantities is that they must be computed on a model-by-model basis, since it is typically impractical to obtain general reproduction number expressions applicable to a family of related models, especially if these are of different dimensions. For example, this is typically the case for SIR-type infectious disease models derived using the linear chain trick (LCT). Here we show how to find general reproduction number expressions for such models families (which vary in their number of state variables) using the next generation operator approach in conjunction with the generalized linear chain trick (GLCT). We further show how the GLCT enables modelers to draw insights from these results by leveraging theory and intuition from continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) and their absorption time distributions (i.e., phase-type probability distributions). To do this, we first review the GLCT and other connections between mean-field ODE model assumptions, CTMCs, and phase-type distributions. We then apply this technique to find reproduction numbers for two sets of models: a family of generalized SEIRS models of arbitrary finite dimension, and a generalized family of finite dimensional predator-prey (Rosenzweig-MacArthur type) models. These results highlight the utility of the GLCT for the derivation and analysis of mean field ODE models, especially when used in conjunction with theory from CTMCs and their associated phase-type distributions.","output":"Finding Reproduction Numbers for Epidemic Models&Predator-Prey Models of Arbitrary Finite Dimension Using The Generalized Linear Chain Trick"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Entity summarization is the problem of computing an optimal compact summary for an entity by selecting a size-constrained subset of triples from RDF data.

As there is an increase of infections in the male population, concerns have emerged about the potential impact of COVID-19 on male reproductive organs and male fertility. Therefore, this study systematically investigates the current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 impact on male reproduction and pregnancy outcomes, discussing them in light of the evidence published on other coronaviruses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 24 original articles were included for the analysis, investigating the effects of the infection on semen parameters, male reproductive hormones, and pregnancy outcomes. Further, a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis was conducted based on the available evidence linking the virus with male reproduction and conception. RESULTS: Although there is limited data, viral mRNA has been identified in semen of infected men, with some evidence of altered seminal parameters. Low testosterone and dihydrotestosterone with raised luteinizing hormone has been reported as well as preterm delivery in pregnant women; however, data regarding vertical transmission remains contradictory and inconclusive.

The aim of this study was to assess the ways in which such documents, dealing with antiviral therapy, were developed in the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic and assess if recommendations were supported by evidence.MethodsWe performed the search for guidelines or similar documents, published before the results of any randomized controlled trials of COVID-19 treatment were available, that considered antiviral therapies and contained a recommendations for clinicians. The quality of the guidelines was assessed using the AGREE II-Global Rating Scale Instrument and series of dichotomous criteria based on the domain 3 of the AGREE II tool. We analyzed variables associated with the presence of recommendations, including strong ones, for antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2. Results The analysis included 40 publications, of which we classified 17 as clinical practice guidelines and 23 C as guidance or statements. The median of quality of documents assessed with the AGREE II-GRS tool (overall quality assessment on a scale ranging from 1-7) was 2.0 (IQR 1.5C2.5). Most documents did not fulfill the rigour of guideline development quality criteria. The AGREE II-GRS scores did not differ significantly across the type of the document, issuing institution and the mode of publication. Overall, 62.5% of documents provided recommendations for the use of antiviral medications despite apparent lack of sufficient evidence supporting such treatments. Documents that contained recommendations supporting antiviral drug use tended to be of lower quality than those without such recommendations. Of the included documents, 75% were not updated within the 2 months after the publication of the first randomized controlled trial on COVID-19 antiviral therapy. ConclusionsMost guidelines or guidance documents published during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic were of poor quality, contained recommendations for the use of antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite only very low quality of evidence available, and were not updated on a regular basis.

Patients with cancer represent a vulnerable population in this pandemic, with data suggesting a higher risk for severe events and unfavorable outcomes. Timely identification of COVID-19 in patients with cancer has been thwarted by the limited availability of outpatient testing for SARS-CoV-2. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in the identification of COVID-19 pneumonia, with radiologic hallmarks including bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation. Patients with cancer undergoing radiation therapy (RT) commonly have daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) obtained for image-guided RT, and such imaging frequently includes the chest. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the CBCT scans of an initially asymptomatic patient undergoing image-guided RT for breast cancer who developed COVID-19 symptoms during the second week of RT. Lung windows of daily CBCT scans were reviewed with diagnostic radiology to survey for changes consistent with COVID-19. Diagnostic CT scans at the time of recovery were obtained and compared with the CBCTs. Results: Five consecutive CBCT scans were retrospectively reviewed. Bilateral, peripheral GGOs were noted on the fourth and fifth CBCT scans in the 2 days before symptom onset. CBCT on the day of RT resumption demonstrated substantial worsening of the GGO compared with scans obtained during the asymptomatic phase. Diagnostic CTs demonstrated bilateral, peripheral GGOs and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, findings suggesting COVID-19 pneumonitis. Repeat diagnostic CT 3 days later showed improved pulmonary findings, and the patient resumed RT without incident. Conclusions: Familiarity with typical CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonitis may allow for early detection in cancer patients undergoing CBCT for RT treatment. Prompt review of the lung windows is recommended to identify such changes, with the hope that presymptomatic diagnosis leads to expedited patient management, improved outcomes, and a reduction of inadvertent COVID-19 dissemination.","output":"Covert COVID-19: Cone Beam Computed Tomography Lung Changes in an Asymptomatic Patient Receiving Radiation Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has caused global mental health impacts, and healthcare workers (HCWs) face an increased risk of exposure to the disease when compared to the general population. This study aimed to assess factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs six months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs at a tertiary hospital, in Lebanon between June and July 2020. The survey included data on demographics, exposure to COVID-19, preparedness to COVID-19 outbreak, risk perceptions of COVID-19, and mental health dimensions. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to understand the association among these variables. One hundred and ninety-three of 1,600 Lebanese HCWs participated. More than 80% reported high preparedness levels towards the COVID-19 outbreak, 69% believed that their job was putting them at risk, and 70% altruistically accepted these risks. Anxiety and depression symptomatology were present in 24% and 23% of HCWs; who were more likely to feel more stress at work (83% vs 60%; p = 0.004; 82% vs 61%; p = 0.01, respectively), feel afraid of falling ill (72% vs 55%; p = 0.03; 77% vs 54%; p = 0.01, respectively), fear death (21% vs 7%; p = 0.01; 25% vs 6%; p &#8804; 0.001, respectively), and believed that people avoided their families (39% vs 21%; p = 0.01; 35% vs 65%; p = 0.02, respectively). HCWs who reported signs of depression were less likely to altruistically accept the risks of caring for COVID-19 patients, compared to those who did not (57% vs 74%; p = 0.03).

Higher values of lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin and ferritin on patient admission appear to be a strong predictive factor of the patient's status progressing into requiring ICU attention.","output":"Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the COVID-19 disease in adult patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reopening of child-care programs during COVID-19 demanded comprehensive preventive measures. Research to date has overlooked this reopening process as well as early childhood professionals (ECPs) implementation efforts and resulting changes in their work practices and well-being. As a result, this study sought insights into (1) the practical implementation of measures, (2) perceptions and evaluations of measures, (3) changes in work characteristics, and (4) its impact on well-being. Qualitative interviews were conducted with German child-care managers (N = 27) between June and August 2020. The semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and content-analyzed using MAXQDA. ECPs, through a combination of high effort and engagement, ensured the feasibility of most preventive measures. This included practices which were perceived to be unreasonable or ones which were stricter than practices required for the public. This exacerbated the critical work characteristics (e.g., high workload, overtime, and multitasking) from pre-pandemic scenarios and led to new work demands (e.g., changes in work content and social interactions). ECPs maintained intensive work demands and consequently suffered from broad strain outcomes (e.g., worry, exhaustion, anger, fear of infection, and reduced psychological sense of community). This study highlights the adverse psychosocial work environment of ECPs despite the necessity of ensuring health and safety at work.","output":"The Impact of the Implementation of Preventive Measures Due to COVID-19 on Work Design and Early Childhood Professionals Well-BeingA Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High susceptibility has limited the role of the climate in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to date. However, understanding a possible future effect of climate, as susceptibility declines and the northern-hemisphere winter approaches, is an important open question. Here we use an epidemiological model, constrained by observations, to assess the sensitivity of future SARS-CoV-2 disease trajectories to local climate conditions. We find this sensitivity depends on both the susceptibility of the population and the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical controls (NPIs) in reducing transmission. Assuming high susceptibility, more stringent NPIs may be required to minimize outbreak risk in the winter months. Our results imply a role for meteorological forecasts in projecting outbreak severity, however, reducing uncertainty in epidemiological parameters will likely have a greater impact on generating accurate predictions and reflects the strong leverage of NPIs on future outbreak severity.","output":"Assessing the influence of climate on future wintertime SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Macrolides are a large group of antibiotics characterised by the presence of a macro-lactone ring of variable size. The prototype of macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin was first produced by Streptomyces and associated species more than half a century ago; other related drugs were developed. These drugs have been shown to have several pharmacological properties: in addition to their antibiotic activity, they possess some anti-inflammatory properties and have been also considered against non-bacterial infections. In this review, we analysed the available clinical evidences regarding the potential anti-viral activity of macrolides, by focusing on erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. Overall, there is no significant evidences so far that macrolides might have a direct benefit on most of viral infections considered in this review (RSV, Influenza, coronaviruses, Ebola and Zika viruses). However, their clinical benefit cannot be ruled out without further and focused clinical studies. Macrolides may improve the clinical course of viral respiratory infections somehow, at least through indirect mechanisms relying on some and variable anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory effects, in addition to their well-known antibacterial activity.","output":"Clinical evidences on the antiviral properties of macrolide antibiotics in the COVID-19 era and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been responsible for the death of over 400,000 people with a continuous rise in prevalence and mortality globally. Identifying hospitalized patients at high mortality risk is critical for triage and health-care resource management regionally, nationally, and globally. We present a retrospective analysis of predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Electronic health records (EHR) of patients admitted between March 1 and April 18, 2020 to St. Lukes University Hospital with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 were reviewed for medical co-morbidities and initial biochemical/inflammatory markers. Survivors vs non-survivors were compared using  (2) test, Students t-test, and Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify candidate variables for multivariate analysis, which were then included in stepwise backward logistic regression. Statistical analyses were done on SPSS v26 software (IBM, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Clinical characteristics, biochemical abnormalities and results of univariate regression in our cohort of 560 patients are noted in table 1. Multivariate regression revealed age, congestive heart failure (CHF), and creatinine 1.5 mg/dl as significant predictors of mortality while race (Caucasian), vascular disease, lymphopenia, and elevated ferritin approached significance (Table 2).

[Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We present one of the largest cohorts to date of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Age, CHF, and renal disease were significant independent predictors of mortality. Though several inflammatory markers (d-dimer, CRP, procalcitonin) initially predicted mortality, they failed in multivariate analysis, questioning their role in risk-stratifying COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Interestingly, IL-6 used in those severely ill patients to assess candidacy for IL-6 inhibitor therapy (Tocilizumab) failed to predict mortality in our study. Our analysis was limited due to its retrospective nature and unfortunately large amounts of data were missing for some variables (ESR, BNP, IL-6 levels). The missing data was due to rapidly evolving institutional protocols early during the pandemic, leading to non-uniform assessment of these markers.

METHOD Participants (n = 43) were school-aged children who were randomly assigned to RFP-C or a waitlist control group. Symptoms of ODD and explicit emotion regulation capacities were assessed at baseline, end of waitlist, and end of treatment. Multilevel modeling was used to account for patient and therapist factors in outcomes. RESULTS At the end of treatment, parents reported significant reductions in children's ODD symptoms on the primary outcome measure. There were no observed changes in explicit emotion regulation. Reliable change index scores indicated that 79.4% of children were recovered or improved after 10 weeks of treatment. There were no identifiable patient or therapist effects. Treatment adherence and completion was high. CONCLUSION This study is the first randomized controlled trial of a manualized psychodynamic intervention for children with ODD. Participants demonstrated significant reductions in symptoms of ODD after 10 weeks of treatment. Further investigation is needed to compare RFP-C relative to active treatment, assess changes in implicit emotion, and to determine long-term maintenance of symptom improvement.Clinical trial registration information: Evaluation of Regulation Focused Psychotherapy for Children (RFP-C); https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03594253.","output":"Randomized controlled trial of Regulation Focused Psychotherapy for children: A manualized psychodynamic treatment for externalizing behaviors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Minimum Pricing for Alcohol (MPA) was enacted in Wales on March 2(nd) 2020. During the legislative process (i.e. consultation and parliamentary discussion), concern was expressed about the possibility of some drinkers switching to using other substances in response to any rise in the cost of alcohol. This paper reports on findings from a study which explored these pre-implementation concerns and how the policy was shaped. METHOD: The research involved surveys (n=193) and interviews (n=87) with drinkers (predominantly harmful or treatment seeking) and providers of services. Survey responses were detailed, thus when combined with the interviews, provided a wealth of qualitative data, which are drawn upon in this paper. RESULTS: The findings highlight an expectation that most drinkers would respond to the new policy with adaptations of their coping mechanisms to maintain alcohol use at pre-legislative levels. This was either by switching alcohol products and adjusting their lifestyle to maintain an affordable drinking habit or developing new behaviours to manage additional costs. A small group of those with previous experience of drug use were identified as likely to switch from using alcohol to some other substances. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the legislation being implemented awareness of the detail of the policy was found to be low, and the perceptions of increased potential harm for certain groups, including switching, were linked to concern about a lack of treatment capacity.","output":"Adapting existing behaviour: Perceptions of substance switching and implementation of minimum pricing for alcohol in Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We estimate the number of secondary Covid-19 infections caused by potentially infectious students returning from university to private homes with other occupants.

The total number of secondary cases for all returning students is dependent on the virus prevalence within the student population at the time of their departure from campus back home. Correspondingly, we provide results for prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 15%, which is based on observed minimum and maximum estimates from Cardiff University's asymptomatic testing service.

Due to the communicable nature of the disease, it is difficult to investigate the causal reason for the epidemics spread sufficiently. This study comprehensively investigates the causal relationship between spread of COVID-19 and mobility level on a multi time-scale and its influencing factors, by using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the causal decomposition approach. Linear regression analysis is used to investigate the significance and importance of the influential factors on the intrastate and interstate causal strength. The results of an EEMD analysis indicate that the mid-term and long-term domain portrays the macroscopic component of the states mobility level and COVID-19 cases, which represents overall intrinsic characteristics. In particular, the mobility level is highly associated with the long-term variations of COVID-19 cases rather than short-term variations. Intrastate causality analysis identifies the significant effects of median age and political orientation on the causal strength at specific time-scale, and some of them cannot be identified from the existing method. Interstate causality results show the negative association with the interstate distance and the positive one with the airline traffics in the long-term domain. Clustering analysis confirms that the states with the higher the gross domestic product and the more politically democratic tend to more adhere to social distancing. The findings of this study can provide practical implications to the policymakers that whether the social distancing policies are effectively working or not should be monitored by long-term trends of COVID-19 cases rather than short-term.","output":"Multi-scale causality analysis between COVID-19 cases and mobility using ensemble empirical mode decomposition and causal decomposition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monodispersed magnesium ferrite nanoparticles with enhanced magnetic properties were successfully fabricated by a simple solvothermal method without employing any templates, complex apparatus or techniques.

Inhalable nanocarriers offer the possibility of actively targeting anti-tuberculosis drugs to the lungs, especially to alveolar macrophages (cellular reservoirs of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Our strategy was based on the development of a mannose-decorated micellar nanoformulation based in Soluplus(?) to co-encapsulate rifampicin and curcumin. The former is one of the most effective anti-tuberculosis first-line drugs, while curcumin has demonstrated potential anti-mycobacterial properties. Mannose-coated rifampicin (10 mg/mL)Ccurcumin (5 mg/mL)-loaded polymeric micelles (10% w/v) demonstrated excellent colloidal properties with micellar size ~108  1 nm after freeze-drying, and they remain stable under dilution in simulated interstitial lung fluid. Drug-loaded polymeric micelles were suitable for drug delivery to the deep lung with lung accumulation, according to the in vitro nebulization studies and the in vivo biodistribution assays of radiolabeled (99mTc) polymeric micelles, respectively. Hence, the nanoformulation did not exhibit hemolytic potential. Interestingly, the addition of mannose significantly improved (5.2-fold) the microbicidal efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv of the drug-co-loaded systems in comparison with their counterpart mannose-free polymeric micelles.

Large-scale testing is therefore crucial, but is facing several challenges including shortage of sample collection tools and of molecular biological reagents, and the need for safe electronic communication of medical reports. We present the successful establishment of a holistic SARS-CoV-2 testing platform that covers proband registration, sample collection and shipment, sample testing, and report issuing. The RT-PCR-based virus detection, being central to the platform, was extensively validated: sensitivity and specificity were defined as 96.8% and 100%, respectively; intra-run and inter-run precision were <3%. A novel type of sample swab and an in-house-developed RNA extraction system were shown to perform as good as commercially available products. The resulting flexibility guarantees independence from the current bottlenecks in SARS-CoV-2 testing. Based on our technology, we offered testing at local, national, and global levels.

Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has several advantages over other imaging and detection techniques. Numerous works have been reported on COVID-19 detection from a smaller set of original X-ray images. However, the effect of image enhancement and lung segmentation of a large dataset in COVID-19 detection was not reported in the literature. We have compiled a large X-ray dataset (COVQU) consisting of 18,479 CXR images with 8851 normal, 6012 non-COVID lung infections, and 3616 COVID-19 CXR images and their corresponding ground truth lung masks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest public COVID positive database and the lung masks. Five different image enhancement techniques: histogram equalization (HE), contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), image complement, gamma correction, and balance contrast enhancement technique (BCET) were used to investigate the effect of image enhancement techniques on COVID-19 detection. A novel U-Net model was proposed and compared with the standard U-Net model for lung segmentation. Six different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and ChexNet) and a shallow CNN model were investigated on the plain and segmented lung CXR images. The novel U-Net model showed an accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice coefficient of 98.63%, 94.3%, and 96.94%, respectively for lung segmentation. The gamma correction-based enhancement technique outperforms other techniques in detecting COVID-19 from the plain and the segmented lung CXR images. Classification performance from plain CXR images is slightly better than the segmented lung CXR images; however, the reliability of network performance is significantly improved for the segmented lung images, which was observed using the visualization technique. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and specificity were 95.11%, 94.55%, 94.56%, 94.53%, and 95.59% respectively for the segmented lung images.

There have been several studies that address the implication of drinking animal milk and/or infant formula on children's health and development when breast feeding is not offered during the first year of life. Vast improvements have been made in infant formula design, which may increase its benefits compared with animal's milk. The objective of this review is therefore to synthesise the most recent evidence on the effects of the consumption of animal milk compared with infant formula in non-breastfed or mixed breastfed infants aged 6-11 months. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that assessed the effect of animal milk compared with formula or mixed-fed (breastmilk and formula) on infants aged 6-11 months. The primary outcomes of interest include anaemia, gastrointestinal blood loss, weight for age, height for age and weight for height. We will include randomised and non-randomised studies with a control group. We will use the Cochrane risk of bias tools to assess the risk of bias.

India's multipronged response included nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) like intensive case-based surveillance, expanding testing capacity, social distancing, health promotion, and progressive travel restrictions leading to a complete halt of international and domestic movements (lockdown). Objectives: We studied the impact of NPI on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India and estimated the minimum level of herd immunity required to halt it. Methods: We plotted time distribution, estimated basic (R0) and time-dependent effective (Rt) reproduction numbers using software R, and calculated doubling time, the growth rate for confirmed cases from January 30 to May 4, 2020. Herd immunity was estimated using the latest Rtvalue. Results: Time distribution showed a propagated epidemic with subexponential growth. Average growth rate, 21% in the beginning, reduced to 6% after an extended lockdown (May 3). Based on early transmission dynamics, R0was 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.79-3.07). Early, unmitigated Rt= 2.51 (95% CI = 2.05-3.14) (March 15) reduced to 1.28 (95% CI = 1.22-1.32) and was 1.83 (95% CI = 1.71-1.93) at the end of lockdown Phase 1 (April 14) and 2 (May 3), respectively. Similarly, average early doubling time (4.3 days) (standard deviation [SD] = 1.86) increased to 5.4 days (SD = 1.03) and 10.9 days (SD = 2.19). Estimated minimum 621 million recoveries are required to halt COVID-19 spread if Rtremains below 2. Conclusion: India's early response, especially stringent lockdown, has slowed COVID-19 epidemic. Increased testing, intensive case-based surveillance and containment efforts, modulated movement restrictions while protecting the vulnerable population, and continuous monitoring of transmission dynamics should be a way forward in the absence of effective treatment, vaccine, and undetermined postinfection immunity.","output":"Impact of nonpharmacological interventions on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Maternal anemia is a well-recognized global health problem; however, there remain questions on specific hemoglobin thresholds that predict health risk or protection for mother and child. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the associations of maternal hemoglobin concentrations with a range of maternal and infant health outcomes, accounting for timing of measurement (preconception, first, second and third trimesters), etiology of anemia and cut-off category. Methods Our search strategy identified 7,677 articles. Screening and article selection was conducted using Covidence systematic review software to organize search results from PubMed and Cochrane Review. The systematic review included 272 studies and the meta-analysis included 102 studies. Results Low maternal hemoglobin (< 110 g/L) was associated with poor birth outcomes (low birth weight, OR (95%CI): 1.43 (1.31-1.55); preterm birth, 1.35 (1.25-1.46); small-for-gestational age, 1.08 (1.00-1.18); stillbirth, 1.43 (1.05-1.95); perinatal mortality, 1.73 (1.32-2.26); and neonatal mortality, 1.49 (1.19-1.87); and adverse maternal outcomes (post-partum hemorrhage, 2.17 (1.51-3.10); preeclampsia, 1.84 (1.31-2.59); and blood-transfusion, 6.57 (3.59-12.00). High maternal hemoglobin (> 130 g/L) was associated with increased odds of small-for-gestational age, 1.22 (1.08-1.37); stillbirth, 1.88 (1.21-2.91); preeclampsia, 1.48 (1.10-2.01); and gestational diabetes, 2.02 (1.63-2.50). Relationships varied by timing of measurement and cut-off category; limited data were available on anemia etiology. There were insufficient data for other maternal outcomes and long-term child health outcomes. Conclusions Current data are insufficient for determining if revisions to current hemoglobin cut-offs are required. Pooled high-quality individual-level data analyses as well as prospective cohort studies that measure hemoglobin throughout pregnancy would be valuable to inform the re-evaluation of hemoglobin cut-offs.

As part of a wider nutritional clinical review program across England, this specific pilot focused on proactive nutritional reviews within 1 rural practice, to explore how exacerbation of illness for patients with long-term conditions may be prevented and quality of life improved through the avoidance of malnutrition; identified through the timely delivery of holistic clinical assessments; and managed with nutritional interventions that patients actively engage with. These objectives were of particular significance in 2020 due to the challenges posed by Covid-19 in the delivery of healthcare. Within the pilot activity, a selection of patients at the practice were identified based on predetermined criteria. The intervention was delivered remotely by a clinical pharmacist. Two methods of communication with patients were explored during the pilotinitially communicating by letter, and latterly by telephone call. From a registered patient population of 6138, 59 of these patients were flagged to the practice for assessment as required and 102 patients were prioritized for remote assessment. Following a notes review, 60 patients were contacted via telephone with no action for 39 patients; 16 patients agreeing to a food-first approach; and 5 patients prescribed ONS. Results from the pilot and wider program activity demonstrate that patients willingly engaged in a proactive approach to remote assessments when using appropriate communication channels. It has also demonstrated that through guidelines adherence resulting in more appropriate prescribing, there are significant cost savings to be made through the implementation of remote nutritional assessments in primary care.

Indeed, and in order to avoid any kind of contamination, it was recommended by international health authorities to adopt a policy of physical distance. This policy has had an impact on consumer behavior and on the way in which consumers make a purchase. Thus, some consumers, fearing the risk of being contaminated, have begun to prefer online purchases and consequently the use of electronic payments (E-payments). This study aims to analyze the intention to adopt E-payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. It suggests the effect of perceived risk, perceived security, trust, social distancing, and Internet experience on the behavioral intent to adopt E-payments in Morocco during the pandemic. The proposed research model was developed by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to explain and predict consumers intentions to adopt these e-services. This study stands out for its originality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, new variables such as COVID-19 perceived risk and social distancing with multiple impacts on consumer purchasing behavior are included in the model. It thus enriches the existing literature on E-payments adoption models, especially since there is no similar research on the Moroccan market. In addition, the conceptual model proposed in this study can provide important guidance to firms wishing to define appropriate strategies to promote the use of electronic payments. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Factors Influencing E-payment Adoption.

METHODS: We looked at CQC ratings of the Shelford group of trusts and 10 trusts with maximum number of deaths in the time period from the first wave till 23rd January 2021. We then looked at each of the 5 domains: safe, effective, caring, responsive, and well led, to see if they were in any way indicative of the number of deaths in that trust. RESULTS: Among the 19 trusts studied (one trust featured in both groups) only 1 had an overall outstanding rating; 10 were rated good, 8 required improvement. None were rated inadequate in any of the domains, 16 /19 were rated good in effective domain which means there care, treatment and support achieves good outcomes. In safe domain 13/ the 19 were rated as requires improvement which means that a patient may not be protected from avoidable harm. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is no respecter of the CQC ratings, even if the trust was rated as well led and had good ratings in all other domains it could still have the highest mortality figures from COVID in the UK.

This study aims to identify the clinical and demographic factors influencing the time taken for viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 to determine the optimal isolation period. METHODS: This two-center retrospective observational cohort study was conducted between March 1 and June 31, 2020. Patients with COVID-19, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, were included. Data were extracted from medical records. The positive duration, which was defined as the period from the day of symptom onset to the negative conversion day, was assessed using a generalized linear model. RESULTS: We included 63 patients. The mean positive duration was 20 days. The positive duration was significantly shorter for patients younger than 30 years of age and those between 30 and 60 years of age than for patients older than 60 years of age. We observed a more scattered distribution of the positive duration in older patients than in younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients who recovered from COVID-19 took less time to clear SARS-CoV-2 than older patients; thus, a classification of the isolation periods based on age could be considered. A uniform viral clearance period for older patients may be difficult to determine because of biases such as underlying medical conditions.

We describe and compare testing for SARS-CoV-2, test positivity and hospital admission, receipt of intensive care and mortality rates related to COVID-19 for people with a recent history of homelessness versus community-dwelling people as of July 31, 2020. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, between Jan. 23 and July 31, 2020, using linked health administrative data among people who either had a recent history of homelessness or were dwelling in the community. People were included if they were eligible for provincial health care coverage and not living in an institutionalized facility on Jan. 23, 2020. We examined testing for SARS-CoV-2, test positivity and complication outcomes of COVID-19 (hospital admission, admission to intensive care and death) within 21 days of a positive test result. Extended multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) in 3 time periods: preshutdown (Jan. 23-Mar. 13), peak (Mar. 14-June 16) and reopening (June 17-July 31). RESULTS: People with a recent history of homelessness (n = 29 407) were more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 in all 3 periods compared with community-dwelling people (n = 14 494 301) (preshutdown adjusted HR 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-2.11; peak adjusted HR 2.95, 95% CI 2.88-3.03; reopening adjusted HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.39-1.51). They were also more likely to have a positive test result (peak adjusted HR 3.66, 95% CI 3.22-4.16; reopening adjusted HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.15-2.71). In the peak period, people with a recent history of homelessness were over 20 times more likely to be admitted to hospital for COVID-19 (adjusted HR 20.35, 95% CI 16.23-25.53), over 10 times more likely to require intensive care for COVID-19 (adjusted HR 10.20, 95% CI 5.81-17.93) and over 5 times more likely to die within 21 days of their first positive test result (adjusted HR 5.73, 95% CI 3.01-10.91). INTERPRETATION: In Ontario, people with a recent history of homelessness were significantly more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, to have a positive test result, to be admitted to hospital for COVID-19, to receive intensive care for COVID-19 and to die of COVID-19 compared with community-dwelling people.

The correlation of D-dimer with these findings is also studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of hospital-based records of 168 COVID-19 patients was done. Data including D-dimer, routine investigations, DIC, and SIC scorings (all within 3 days of admission) were collected and correlated with the outcomes. The study was conducted in a tertiary care center catering to North India's population. RESULTS: Higher DIC score (1.59  1.18 vs 0.96  1.18), SIC score (1.60  0.89 vs 0.63  0.99), and D-dimer titers (1321.33  1627.89 vs 58366  777.71 ng/mL) were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 disease (p <0.05). DIC score and SIC score 1, and D-dimer 1315 ng/mL for severe disease; DIC score 1, SIC score 2, and D-dimer 600 ng/mL for pulmonary embolism (PE); and DIC score and SIC score 1, and D-dimer level 990 ng/mL for mortality were the respective cutoff values we found from our study.

Hysteroscopy is the most commonly reported approach for the revision of cesarean scar defects (CSDs).

As a result of our analyses, the laparoscopic approach increases uterine wall thickness when compared with the hysteroscopic approach, and both surgical techniques seem to be effective for the resolution of gynecologic symptoms. Hysteroscopic treatment most likely corrects the scar defect but does not strengthen the uterine wall; thus, the potential risk of dehiscence or rupture in subsequent pregnancies does not seem to be improved. Because large uterine defects are known risk factors for scar dehiscence, the repair of the defect to reinforce the myometrial endurance seems to be an appropriate method of treatment.","output":"Should Cesarean Scar Defect Be Treated Laparoscopically?

Case Report A 51-year-old man with arterial hypertension and a history of repaired complex congenital heart disease, which required a heart transplant [HT] in 2019. He had a high risk CMV missmatch (D+/R-). Routine HT follow up tests after the first year were normal, with neither signs of rejection nor allograft vascular disease. His immunosuppressive treatment consisted in Tacrolimus 5 mg once a day, Mycophelonate 500 mg twice a day, and Prednisone 5 mg a day. 77 weeks after his heart transplant, two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were inoculated separated by 28 days. After 4 days of the second dose, he developed fever, diarrhea, and general malaise. The physical findings were abdominal pain, slight hepatomegaly and several painful gum lesions. Laboratory tests showed severe lymphopenia;and elevated C-reactive protein. CMV by polymerase chain reaction was tested positive with 228.356 copies/ml. The decision was to admit him and to initiate intravenous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice a day and to reduce the immunosuppressive treatment. He completed a course of 15 days with ganciclovir, and then continued with valganciclovir 900 mg twice a day. Early after ganciclovir start, clinical manifestations gradually disappeared. Due to persistent lymphopenia, mycophenolate was switched to everolimus. After 60 days of antiviral treatment, CMV loading was below detection range (Image 1). Summary The probability of favoring CMV replicability after mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has not been yet described.

Since neutralizing antibodies are a correlate of protection, we developed a lateral flow assay (LFA) that measures levels of neutralizing antibodies from a drop of blood. The LFA is based on the principle that neutralizing antibodies block binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). METHODS: The ability of the LFA was assessed to correctly measure neutralization of sera, plasma or whole blood from patients with COVID-19 using SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assays. We also determined if the LFA distinguished patients with seasonal respiratory viruses from patients with COVID-19. To demonstrate the usefulness of the LFA, we tested previously infected and non-infected COVID-19 vaccine recipients at baseline and after first and second vaccine doses. RESULTS: The LFA compared favorably with SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assays with an area under the ROC curve of 98%. Sera obtained from patients with seasonal coronaviruses did not show neutralizing activity in the LFA. After a single mRNA vaccine dose, 87% of previously infected individuals demonstrated high levels of neutralizing antibodies. However, if individuals were not previously infected only 24% demonstrated high levels of neutralizing antibodies after one vaccine dose. A second dose boosted neutralizing antibody levels just 8% higher in previously infected individuals, but over 63% higher in non-infected individuals.

METHODS We investigated the relationship between PE and symptoms of several forms of psychopathology in two separate observational samples: a sample of 110 children (5 and 6 years old) and a sample of 210 children (8 and 9 years old) drawn from a longitudinal study. In each sample, regression models based on psychiatric symptoms or diagnoses were used to assess the specificity of PE associations while accounting for cooccurring symptoms or comorbidities. RESULTS Although bivariate associations emerged between PE and multiple forms of psychopathology, multivariate analyses revealed these associations were driven by a strong and specific association between PE and symptoms of OCD in both samples. Moreover, PE among 8- and 9-year-olds in the longitudinal study predicted emergence of additional later psychopathology, specifically attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that PE, an easily identifiable clinical presentation, is also a specific marker for obsessive-compulsive symptomatology in school-age children and may impart risk for ADHD later in childhood.","output":"Picky Eating in Childhood: Associations With Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The objective of our study was to determine whether the SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers transmit the virus to their hand-expressed colostrum.

A colostrum sample was obtained from the mothers by manual self-extraction. To collect the samples, the mothers wore surgical masks, washed their hands with an 85% alcohol-based gel, and washed their breast with gauze that was saturated with soap and water. Results: We obtained seven colostrum samples from different mothers in the first hours postdelivery. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any of the colostrum samples obtained in our study. Conclusion: In our study, breast milk was not a source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of consecutive patients with renal oncocytoma on active surveillance reviewed at the Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer at Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (2012 to 2019). Comparison between groups was tested using the Mann-Whitney U and the Chi-square tests. A mixed-effects model with a random intercept for patient was used to study the longitudinal association between tumour size and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS: Longitudinal data from 98 patients with 101 lesions was analysed. Most patients were male (68.3%), median age was 69 years (IQR 13). The median follow-up was 29 months (IQR 26). Most lesions were small renal masses, 24% measured over 4 cm. Over half (64.4%) grew at a median rate of 2 mm per year (IQR 4). No association was observed between tumour size and eGFR over time (p=0.871). Nine lesions (8.9%) were subsequently treated. Two deaths were reported, neither were related to the diagnosis of renal oncocytoma. CONCLUSION: Natural history data from the largest active surveillance cohort of renal oncocytomas to date show that renal function does not seem to be negatively impacted by growing oncocytomas, and confirms clinical outcomes are excellent after a median follow up of over 2 years.

Large household transmission studies in the early stages of the pandemic in Asia reported secondary attack rates ranging from 5 to 30%. AIM: We aimed to investigate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in household and community settings in the UK. METHODS: A prospective case-ascertained study design based on the World Health Organization FFX protocol was undertaken in the UK following the detection of the first case in late January 2020. Household contacts of cases were followed using enhanced surveillance forms to establish whether they developed symptoms of COVID-19, became confirmed cases and their outcomes. We estimated household secondary attack rates (SAR), serial intervals and individual and household basic reproduction numbers. The incubation period was estimated using known point source exposures that resulted in secondary cases. RESULTS: We included 233 households with two or more people with 472 contacts. The overall household SAR was 37% (95% CI: 31C43%) with a mean serial interval of 4.67 days, an R(0) of 1.85 and a household reproduction number of 2.33. SAR were lower in larger households and highest when the primary case was younger than 18 years. We estimated a mean incubation period of around 4.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of COVID-19 household transmission were high in the UK for ages above and under 18 years, emphasising the need for preventative measures in this setting.

This modification generates an N-terminal threonine nucleophile that is used to hydrolyze the pantetheinyl moiety of its natural substrate. We determined the crystal structure of autoactivated ThnT to 1.8 ? through X-ray crystallography. Comparison to a mutationally inactivated precursor structure revealed several large conformational rearrangements near the active site. To probe the relevance of these transitions, we designed a pantetheine-like chloromethyl ketone (CMK) inactivator and co-crystallized it with ThnT. Although this class of inhibitor has been in use for several decades, the mode of inactivation had not been determined for an enzyme that uses an N-terminal nucleophile. The co-crystal structure revealed the CMK bound to the N-terminal nucleophile of ThnT through an ether linkage and analysis suggests inactivation through a direct displacement mechanism. More importantly, this inactivated complex shows three regions of ThnT that are critical to the formation of the substrate binding pocket undergo rearrangement upon autoproteolysis. Comparison of ThnT with other autoproteolytic enzymes of disparate evolutionary lineage revealed a high degree similarity within the pro-enzyme active site, reflecting shared chemical constraints. However, after autoproteolysis many enzymes, like ThnT, are observed to rearrange to accommodate their specific substrate. We propose this is a general phenomenon, whereby autoprocessing systems with shared chemistry may possess similar structural features that dissipate upon rearrangement into a mature state.","output":"Autoproteolytic activation of ThnT results in structural reorganization necessary for substrate binding and catalysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper aims to illustrate how integrating competitive intelligence (CI) into a US health-care firm can aid in information sharing and building knowledge for the organization Design/methodology/approachThis study is exploratory using a systematic literature review to develop a conceptual model applied to the US health-care industry FindingsThis research presents key propositions of CIs role in the CI process along with the C-suites role in supporting a process and culture to ultimately, gain competitive advantage through the knowledge-based view Practical implicationsWith the growing volume of data, a unified system and culture within a firm is paramount The US health-care system is a privatized industry that has become more competitive stifling information sharing The need for prompt and accurate decision-making has become an imperative Crises, like the current COVID-19 pandemic, only exacerbate the issue This model offers a blue print for executives to build a CI function and encourage information sharing Originality/valuePrevious research has focused on the CI process and its value Yet, little research is found on how to integrate CI into a firm and its role through the CI process This study builds a conceptual model addressing integration and the flow of information to knowledge along with key firm dynamics to nurture the function Although the model is applied specifically to US health care, it offers application to most any industry","output":"Competitive intelligence: a prescription for US health-care?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent business models are based on the latest information and telecommunication technologies cross over the world.

The Novara-COVID score was systematically applied to all COVID patients since its introduction in clinical practice and adopted to decide patients' destination. The ability of the Novara-COVID score to predict in-hospital clinical stability and in-hospital mortality were evaluated through multivariable logistic regression and Cox Regression Hazard models, respectively. RESULTS: Among the 480 COVID patients admitted to the ED, 338 were hospitalized: the Novara-COVID score was 0-1 in 49.7%, 2 in 24.6%, 3 in 15.4% and 4-5 in 10.3% of patients. Novara-COVID score values of 3 and 4-5 were associated with lower clinical stability with adjusted odds ratios of 0.28 [0.13-0.59] and 0.03 [0.01-0.12], respectively.

Approximately between Jan 19th and Feb 5th 2021 Portugal was the country in the world with the largest incidence rate, with 14-days incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants in excess of 1000. Despite its importance, accurate prediction of the geospatial evolution of COVID-19 remains a challenge, since existing analytical methods fail to capture the complex dynamics that result from both the contagion within a region and the spreading of the infection from infected neighboring regions. We use a previously developed methodology and official municipality level data from the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health (DGS), relative to the first twelve months of the pandemic, to compute an estimate of the incidence rate in each location of mainland Portugal. The resulting sequence of incidence rate maps was then used as a gold standard to test the effectiveness of different approaches in the prediction of the spatial-temporal evolution of the incidence rate. Four different methods were tested: a simple cell level autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, a cell level vector autoregressive (VAR) model, a municipality-by-municipality compartmental SIRD model followed by direct block sequential simulation and a convolutional sequence-to-sequence neural network model based on the STConvS2S architecture.

We utilized a self-administrated, online-based questionnaire designed to assess basic knowledge of COVID-19, attitude and disease perception, and the impact of risk communication messages among HCWs. RESULTS: A total of 1691 responses were received in the study. The HCWs exhibited good levels of knowledge (total maximum score is 1) of COVID-19 concerning the modes of transportation of COVID-19 (0.820.16), sample collection method for COVID-19 diagnosis (0.980.08), transmission of infection from asymptomatic individuals (0.990.11), and that antibiotics are not effective against the new COVID-19 (0.830.38). Nearly one-third of the participants considered a high/very high possibility of acquiring COVID-19 infection. HCWs had good attitude scores concerning their willingness to deal with new COVID-19 patients (0.870.33) and their beliefs in being educated on COVID-19 (0.990.11).

METHODS AND RESULTS: In this narrative viewpoint, we approach AF from the perspective of aging medicine and try to provide the readers with information usually neglected in clinical routine, mainly due to the fact that while the large majority of AF patients in real life are older, frail and cognitively impaired, these are mostly excluded from clinical trials, and physicians attitudes often prevail over standardized algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of existing evidence, (1) opportunistic AF screening by pulse palpation or ECG rhythm strip is cost-effective, and (2) whereas advanced chronological age by itself is not a contraindication to AF treatment, a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) including frailty, cognitive impairment, falls and bleeding risk may assist in clinical decision making to provide the best individualized treatment.","output":"Atrial fibrillation: a geriatric perspective on the 2020 ESC guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogen outbreaks (i.e., outbreaks of bacteria and viruses) in hospitals can cause high mortality rates and increase costs for hospitals significantly. An outbreak is generally noticed when the number of infected patients rises above an endemic level or the usual prevalence of a pathogen in a defined population. Reconstructing transmission pathways back to the source of an outbreak -- the patient zero or index patient -- requires the analysis of microbiological data and patient contacts. This is often manually completed by infection control experts. We present a novel visual analytics approach to support the analysis of transmission pathways, patient contacts, the progression of the outbreak, and patient timelines during hospitalization. Infection control experts applied our solution to a real outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a large German hospital. Using our system, our experts were able to scale the analysis of transmission pathways to longer time intervals (i.e., several years of data instead of days) and across a larger number of wards. Also, the system is able to reduce the analysis time from days to hours. In our final study, feedback from twenty-five experts from seven German hospitals provides evidence that our solution brings significant benefits for analyzing outbreaks. It is also applicable to COVID-19 hospital-associated transmissions.","output":"In Search of Patient Zero: Visual Analytics of Pathogen Transmission Pathways in Hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid development of medical imaging has boosted the abilities of modern medicine.

We aimed to address the current uncertainties regarding incident thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity among COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: We included consecutive adult COVID-19 patients without known thyroid disorders, who were admitted to Queen Mary Hospital from July 21 to September 21, 2020 and had serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and anti-thyroid antibodies measured both on admission and at 3 months. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were included. Among 20 patients with abnormal thyroid function tests (TFTs) on admission (mostly low fT3), 15 recovered. Among 102 patients with initial normal TFTs, two had new-onset abnormalities that could represent different phases of thyroiditis. Among 104 patients whose anti-thyroid antibody titers were reassessed, we observed increases in anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (P<0.001) and anti-thyroglobulin (P<0.001), but not anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor titers (P=0.486). Of 82 patients with negative anti-TPO findings at baseline, 16 had a significant interval increase in anti-TPO titer by >12 U, and four became anti-TPO-positive. Worse baseline clinical severity (P=0.018), elevated C-reactive protein during hospitalization (P=0.033), and higher baseline anti-TPO titer (P=0.005) were associated with a significant increase in anti-TPO titer. CONCLUSION: Most patients with thyroid dysfunction on admission recovered during convalescence. Abnormal TFTs suggestive of thyroiditis occurred during convalescence, but infrequently. Importantly, our novel observation of an increase in anti-thyroid antibody titers post-COVID-19 warrants further follow-up for incident thyroid dysfunction among COVID-19 survivors.","output":"Insights from a Prospective Follow-up of Thyroid Function and Autoimmunity among COVID-19 Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If you're patient in an ICU, this fact is in itself a traumatic unpleasant event.

To our knowledge, there are a limited number of peer-reviewed studies that evaluate the perceived difficulties of the patients with cancer when filling their opioid prescription. To understand these difficulties, we surveyed patients receiving opioids in our outpatient supportive care center (SCC). OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate cancer patients' perceptions of overall difficulties when filling their opioid prescription. Secondary objectives included determining associations between patient characteristics and difficulty and comparing difficulty between filling opioid and nonopioid prescriptions. METHODS: Patients with cancer receiving opioids that had been seen two times or more at our SCC were asked to complete a survey. The information collected included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and patients' experiences filling their opioid prescription. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 60 years; 54% were female and 69% were white. Forty-four patients (32%) reported that they have experienced difficulty filling their opioid prescription. More than 25% of those 44 patients perceived difficulty from interactions with the pharmacy and/or pharmacist. Forty-six patients (33%) reported more difficulty filling their opioid prescriptions than filling their nonopioid prescriptions. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that patients with cancer visiting our SCC perceived difficulties obtaining their opioid prescriptions. The results suggest that negative interactions with the pharmacy and/or pharmacist contribute to their perceived difficulty. Additional research is needed to further characterize the contributors of the difficulties patients with cancer face in filling their opioid prescriptions.","output":"Cancer Patients' Perceived Difficulties Filling Opioid Prescriptions After Receiving Outpatient Supportive Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the effect of COVID\\\\19 on the global stock market.

Though promising, that first formulation significantly lacks robustness against the Covid-19 data low quality (irrelevant or missing counts, pseudo-seasonalities,.. .) stemming from the emergency and crisis context, which significantly impairs accurate pandemic evolution assessments. The present work aims to overcome these limitations by carefully crafting a functional permitting to estimate jointly, in a single step, the reproduction number and outliers defined to model low quality data. This functional also enforces epidemiology-driven regularity properties for the reproduction number estimates, while preserving convexity, thus permitting the design of efficient minimization algorithms, based on proximity operators that are derived analytically.

The current most established quantification method for H2S is HPLC method coupled with fluorescence detection after derivatization with a costly fluorescent reagent, Monobromobimane (MBB). However, The MBB method is characterized by strict reaction condition, long reaction time, tedious operation, and inconsistent reported results. In this study, based on the thiolysis reaction of 7-nitro-2, 1, 3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) ether, the commonly used chromatographic modifier 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3- benzoxadiazole (NBDCl) and four probes (NBDOMe, NBDOEt, NBDOTFE and NBDOCMR) synthesized from NBDCl were tested as alternatives for fast quantification of H2S by LC-MS/MS. The reaction product between NBD ethers/NBDCl and H2S showed special pink color visible to the naked eye and was easy to synthesize and separate in lab; it also showed good retention on common chromatographic columns and high instrument response; therefore it is a good determinand. After establishment of LC-MS/MS methods for all the related compounds, the reaction conditions were optimized for all the probes with H2S. Then the stability, selectivity, reaction rate, sensitivity and quantitative linear relationship between the reaction product and H2S concentration were studied for each probe. Finally, NBDOEt was selected for LC-MS/MS detection of H2S. In comparision with the MBB method, the established NBDOEt method showed matched sensitivity and linearity, better selectivity, and higher repeatability; and had the advantages of easy operation, simple reaction condition, and cheap raw materials.

RESULTS Seven hundred and sixty-eight healthcare workers from 16 pediatric intensive care units were enrolled and 114 (14.8%) healthcare workers with a mean age of 29.7  6.7 years became coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Seventy-six (66.7%) patients were female. Approximately half (54.3%) of the patients were physicians, 34.2% were nurses, and 11.4% were ancillary staff. Transmission was deemed to occur through patient contact in 54.3% of the patients. Comorbid illness was present 10.5% of the patients. Transmission occurred during endotracheal intubation in 21%, cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 9.6%, and non-invasive ventilation in 12.2% of patients, while transmission was a result of multiple possible procedures in 43.8%. Intensive care admission was needed for 13.1% of the patients. Five patients needed oxygen by cannula, 7 needed oxygen with a non-rebreathing mask, 5 needed high-flow nasal cannula support, 5 needed non-invasive ventilation, and 3 needed invasive mechanical ventilation.

DESIGN: Observational multicenter cohort study. SETTING: A total of 23 acute care hospitals in four states. PATIENTS: One-hundred eighteen patients admitted between March 13, 2020, and April 16, 2020. Eighty-one patients received tocilizumab, and 37 were untreated and served as a control group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome was mortality and was analyzed by timing of tocilizumab dosing. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within 1 day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than 1 day after intubation. A control group that was treated only with standard of care, and without tocilizumab, was used for comparison. Early tocilizumab therapy was associated with a statistically significant decrease in mortality as compared to patients who were untreated (p = 0.003). Dosing tocilizumab late was associated with an increased mortality compared with the untreated group (p = 0.006).

All countries are in health prevention processes due to COVID-19, a virus that attacks the immune system. Trying to do any activity poses a risk of contagion, since the coronavirus spreads especially through human breath, which has led to the invasion of new daily habits, such as leaving the house with a mask, or not being able to meet other people for celebrations and events, or to teach in the classroom. Immersed in this unfavorable situation for any educational normality, in the case of artistic education we suffer doubly from this painful reality. In Spain, we started the year presenting a series of complaints to the new education law that the government wants to pass (LOMLOE), a law that practically eliminates the visual arts from the school curriculum. Also in other countries, there is a constant decline in Art Education as curricular teaching. If the coronavirus is promoting the use of digital technologies, and society claims the teachings on prevention, health, inclusion, equality, diversity and emerging technological languages, we should attend to the needs required by the new educational and vital scenario. Faced with such evidence, we are committed to a death worthy of our specialty, as we understood it until now, understanding that this right to euthanasia implies the birth of a renewed concept of artistic education, something that we must do immediately as a priority.","output":"Por una muerte digna para la educacin artstica"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Viruses on environmental surfaces, in saliva and other body fluids represent risk of contamination for general population and healthcare professionals. The development of vaccines and medicines is costly and time consuming. Thus, the development of novel materials and technologies to decrease viral availability, viability, infectivity, and to improve therapeutic outcomes can positively impact the prevention and treatment of viral diseases. METHODS: Herein, we discuss (a) interaction mechanisms between viruses and materials, (b) novel strategies to develop materials with antiviral properties and oral antiviral delivery systems, and (c) the potential of artificial intelligence to design and optimize preventive measures and therapeutic regimen. RESULTS: The mechanisms of viral adsorption on surfaces are well characterized but no major breakthrough has become clinically available. Materials with fine-tuned physical and chemical properties have the potential to compromise viral availability and stability. Emerging strategies using oral antiviral delivery systems and artificial intelligence can decrease infectivity and improve antiviral therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: Emerging viral infections are concerning due to risk of mortality, as well as psychological and economic impacts. Materials science emerges for the development of novel materials and technologies to diminish viral availability, infectivity, and to enable enhanced preventive and therapeutic strategies, for the safety and well-being of humankind.","output":"Fighting viruses with materials science: Prospects for antivirus surfaces, drug delivery systems and artificial intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several countries adopted lockdown to slowdown the exponential transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. Disease transmission models and the epidemic forecasts at the national level steer the policy to implement appropriate intervention strategies and budgeting. However, it is critical to design a data-driven reliable model for nowcasting for smaller populations, in particular metro cities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the transition of the epidemic from subexponential to exponential transmission in the Chennai metro zone and to analyze the probability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) secondary infections while availing the public transport systems in the city. METHODS: A single geographical zone \\"Chennai-Metro-Merge\\" was constructed by combining Chennai District with three bordering districts. Subexponential and exponential models were developed to analyze and predict the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic. Probabilistic models were applied to assess the probability of secondary infections while availing public transport after the release of the lockdown. RESULTS: The model predicted that transition from subexponential to exponential transmission occurs around the eighth week after the reporting of a cluster of cases. The probability of secondary infections with a single index case in an enclosure of the city bus, the suburban train general coach, and the ladies coach was found to be 0.192, 0.074, and 0.114, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nowcasting at the early stage of the epidemic predicts the probable time point of the exponential transmission and alerts the public health system. After the lockdown release, public transportation will be the major source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in metro cities, and appropriate strategies based on nowcasting are needed.","output":"Prediction of the Transition From Subexponential to the Exponential Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Chennai, India: Epidemic Nowcasting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US and the rest of the world have suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic for over a year. The high transmissibility and severity of this virus have provoked governments to adopt a variety of mitigation strategies. Some of these previous measures, such as social distancing and mask mandates, were effective in reducing the case growth rate yet became economically and administratively difficult to enforce as the pandemic continued. In late December 2020, COVID-19 vaccines were first approved in the US and states began a phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is limited quantitative evidence regarding the effectiveness of the phased COVID-19 vaccination. This study aims to provide a rapid assessment of the adoption, reach, and effectiveness of the phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination. We utilize an event-study analysis to evaluate the effect of vaccination on the state-level daily COVID-19 case growth rate. Through this analysis, we assert that vaccination was effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 shortly after the first shots were given. Specifically, the case growth rate declined by 0.124, 0.347, 0.345, 0.464, 0.490, and 0.756 percentage points corresponding to the 1C5, 6C10, 11C15, 16C20, 21C25, and 26 or more day periods after the initial shots.

For persons with dementia, it is crucial to timely engage in ACP. Therefore, we study ACP in dementia using electronic health record data. This study aims to determine how often ACP conversations are recorded, analyze time from dementia diagnosis until the first recorded conversation and time from the first recorded conversation to death, and analyze which factors are associated with the timing of ACP. METHODS: Electronic records of 15,493 persons with dementia in Dutch general practice between 2008 and 2016 were linked to national administrative databases. ACP conversations and indicators of health deficits to determine frailty were obtained from electronic records coded with the International Classification of Primary Care. Socio-demographic characteristics were derived from the national population registry managed by Statistics Netherlands. Date of death was derived from the Personal Records Database (2008C2018). RESULTS: ACP was recorded as such as 22 (95% CI, 20C23) first conversations per 1,000 person-years of follow-up. The hazard ratio (HR) for the first conversation increased every year after dementia diagnosis, from 0.01 in the first year to 0.07 in the 7th and 8th year after diagnosis. Median time from a first conversation to death was 2.57 years (95% CI, 2.31C2.82). Migrant status [non-Western vs. Western (HR 0.31, 95% CI, 0.15C0.65)] was significantly associated with a longer time from dementia diagnosis to the first conversation. Being pre-frail (HR 2.06, 95% CI, 1.58C2.69) or frail (HR 1.40, 95% CI, 1.13C1.73) vs. non-frail was significantly associated with a shorter time from dementia diagnosis to the first ACP conversation. CONCLUSION: ACP conversations in Dutch general practice were rare for persons with dementia, or was rarely recorded as such. In particular among persons with a non-Western migration background and those who are non-frail, it started long after diagnosis. We advise further research into public health and practical strategies to engage persons with dementia with a non-Western migration background and non-frail persons early in the disease trajectory in ACP.","output":"Occurrence and Timing of Advance Care Planning in Persons With Dementia in General Practice: Analysis of Linked Electronic Health Records and Administrative Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccines from multiple manufacturers are needed to cope with the problem of insufficient supply.

Senegal, in particular, has been noted for its relative success in mitigating the spread and impact of COVID-19. We report original research findings on COVID-19 beliefs and prevention behaviors in a sample of Senegalese adults. MethodsA multi-modal cross-sectional study was conducted to describe COVID-19 beliefs and prevention behaviors in a sample of Senegalese adults and to identify potential predictors of prevention behaviors. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were generated to describe the sample and explore potential correlations. ResultsMask wearing, hand washing, and use of hand sanitizer were most frequently reported. Social distancing and staying at home were also reported albeit to a lower degree. We also identified a range of psychosocial and demographic predictors for COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Men, compared to women, had lower odds (OR=0.59) of reporting prevention behaviors. Rural residents (vs. urban; OR=1.49) and participants with at least a high school education (vs. less than high school education; OR=1.33) were more likely to report COVID-19 prevention behaviors. DiscussionStakeholders and decision makers in Senegal and across Africa can use place-based evidence like ours to address COVID-19 risk factors and intervene effectively with policies and programming.

This gap was estimated to account for nearly one in seven US deaths in 2017. ObjectiveThe number and proportion of US deaths that can be attributed to this gap is expected to have grown during the pandemic. This study aims at quantifying this growth at the end of 2021. DesignThis cross-sectional study uses publicly available 2017 to 2021 data on deaths from all causes and 2020-2021 Covid-19 death counts in the United States and five European countries. Number of deaths are combined with publicly available estimates of population size by sex and age group in these European countries to produce sex- and age-specific mortality rates. These rates are averaged and applied to the US population by sex and age-group to compare the resulting and actual US death counts. SettingThe United States and the five most populous countries in Western Europe. ParticipantsAll deceased individuals in these countries are included in the death counts. This study does not use individual records. InterventionNone. Main Outcome and MeasureTotal number of US deaths and their counterfactuals when substituting average sex- and age-specific mortality rates for the European countries to those that prevailed in the United States. ResultsThe counterfactuals reveal 711,109 to 747,783 excess deaths in the United States in 2021, amounting to 20.8% to 21.7% of all US deaths that year (3,426,249). Excess deaths increased by 320,436 to 331,477 between 2017 and 2021, 80.0% to 82.7% more than the 2017 estimate. A decomposition of the lower figure showed that population change contributed little to the 2017-2021 increase in excess deaths (33,545 additional deaths). Covid-19 mortality alone continue contributed 230,672 excess deaths in 2021, more than 2020, whereas other causes of deaths contributed 56,219 more excess deaths in 2021 than in 2017. DiscussionThe proportion of US deaths that would be avoided if the United States could achieve the mortality of its West European counterparts surged to more than one in five during the pandemic. The large and still growing contribution of Covid-19 to excess mortality in the United States is consistent with vaccination rates plateauing at lower levels than in European countries. The overall increase in mortality from other causes during the pandemic increasingly separates the United States from West European countries as well. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow many fewer deaths would the United States experience with the same mortality rates as comparable European countries? FindingsUsing death counts from the United States and five large European countries, this cross-sectional study estimates 711,109 to 744,783 fewer US deaths in 2021 if the United States could achieve the average sex- and age-specific mortality rates of these five countries. This is an 80.0% to 82.7% increase relative to the same figure for 2017.

Atherosclerosis is primarily caused by the dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells and the subendothelial accumulation of oxidized forms of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Early observations have linked oxidized LDL effects in atherogenesis to the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) scavenger receptor. It was shown that LOX-1 is upregulated by many inflammatory mediators and proatherogenic stimuli including cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), hemodynamic blood flow, high blood sugar levels and, most importantly, modified forms of LDL. Oxidized LDL signaling pathways in atherosclerosis were first explored using LDL that is oxidized by copper (Cuox-LDL). In our study, we used a more physiologically relevant model of LDL oxidation and showed, for the first time, that myeloperoxidase oxidized LDL (Mox-LDL) may affect human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) function through the LOX-1 scavenger receptor. We report that Mox-LDL increases the expression of its own LOX-1 receptor in HAECs, enhancing inflammation and simultaneously decreasing tubulogenesis in the cells. We hypothesize that Mox-LDL drives endothelial dysfunction (ED) through LOX-1 which provides an initial hint to the pathways that are initiated by Mox-LDL during ED and the progression of atherosclerosis.","output":"Myeloperoxidase-Oxidized LDL Activates Human Aortic Endothelial Cells through the LOX-1 Scavenger Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The discovery of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) as the receptor for SARS- CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) has implicated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).

CXR mobile devices are efficient during epidemies, because allow to reduce the risk of contagion and are easy to sanitize. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From FebruaryCApril 2020, 14 radiologists retrospectively evaluated a pool of 312 chest X-ray exams to test a new software function for lung imaging analysis based on radiological features and graded on a three-point scale. This tool automatically generates a cumulative score (0C18). The intra- rater agreement (evaluated with Fleisss method) and the average time for the compilation of the banner were calculated. RESULTS: Fourteen radiologists evaluated 312 chest radiographs of COVID-19 pneumonia suspected patients (80 males and 38 females) with an average age of 64, 47 years. The inter-rater agreement showed a Fleiss kappa value of 0.53 and the intra-group agreement varied from Fleiss Kappa value between 0.49 and 0.59, indicating a moderate agreement (considering as moderate ranges 0.4C0.6).

To support this alternative living which can be in contrast to various other types of assisted living options, modes of monitoring technology need to be explored and studied in order to determine a balance between the preservation of privacy and adequacy of sensed information for better estimation and visualization of movements and activities. In this paper, we explore such monitoring paradigm on how a network of RGB-D sensors can be utilized for this purpose. This type of sensor offers both visual and depth sensing modalities from the scene where the information can be fused and coded for better protection of privacy. For this purpose, we introduce the novel notion of passive observer. This observer is only triggered by detecting the absence of movements of older adults in the scene. This is accomplished by classifying and localizing objects in the monitoring scene from both before and after the detection of movements. A deep learning tool is utilized for visual classification of known objects in the physical scene followed by virtual reality reconstructing of the scene where the shape and location of objects are recreated. Such reconstruction can be used as a visual summary in order to identify objects which were handled by an older adult in-between observation. The simplified virtual scene can be used, for example, by caregivers or monitoring personnel in order to assist in detecting any anomalies. This virtual visualization can offer a high level of privacy protection without having any direct visual access to the monitoring scene. In addition, using the scene graph representation, an automatic decision-making tool is proposed where spatial relationships between the objects can be used to estimate the expected activities. The results of this paper are demonstrated through two case studies.","output":"Passive Observer of Activities for Aging in Place Using a Network of RGB-D Sensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutational hotspots can determine evolutionary outcomes and make evolution repeatable. Hotspots are products of multiple evolutionary forces including mutation rate heterogeneity, but this variable is often hard to identify. In this work we reveal that a powerfully deterministic genetic hotspot can be built and broken by a handful of silent mutations. We observed this when studying homologous immotile variants of the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, AR2 and Pf0-2x. AR2 resurrects motility through highly repeatable de novo mutation of the same nucleotide in >95% lines in minimal media (ntrB A289C). Pf0-2x, however, evolves via a number of mutations meaning the two strains diverge significantly during adaptation. We determined that this evolutionary disparity was owed to just 6 synonymous variations within the ntrB locus, which we demonstrated by swapping the sites and observing that we were able to both break (>95% to 0% in AR2) and build (0% to 80% in Pf0-2x) a powerfully deterministic mutational hotspot. Our work reveals a fundamental role for silent genetic variation in determining adaptive outcomes.","output":"A mutational hotspot that determines highly repeatable evolution can be built and broken by silent genetic changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For over 40 years, biotechnology and genetic engineering (GE) have been used in the development of medicines and biologic agents important in protecting and augmenting human health and have been met with broad public acceptance in the health care arena. GE has also been used to improve and develop plants important to agriculture and forestry, but in these areas, has often encountered intense opposition that has prevented or delayed the introduction of potentially useful plants. Much of the opposition to GE's application in agriculture and forestry may be driven by concerns that GE plants will serve primarily to encourage the domination of the food and wood products industries by monopolistic corporations and/or will be disruptive to the environment. But to conflate genetic modifications intended to promote healthy ecosystems or preserve threatened species with GE projects aimed at benefiting corporate agriculture and forestry is misleading and illogical. Further, the pervasive human disruption and damage to forest ecosystems makes it prudent to bring the best that science can offer to the protection and restoration of critical woodland denizens and broader ecosystem health. The notion that minimal human intervention in the forest environment may be the best approach ignores our responsibility to help manage and protect some of the very places that have suffered most from human intrusion. GE efforts intended to improve forest health should be afforded the same consideration, acceptance, and support as GE efforts intended to improve human health. These efforts should include the use of GE technology such as carefully developed transgenic trees to cure ongoing forest pathogenesis such as the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica), which threatens to drive the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) to extinction.

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, social restrictions imposed to reduce viral transmission limited access to social support, which is critical to postnatal psychological wellbeing - potentially intensifying RNT. Objective: We examined whether perceived social support (from friends, family, and a significant other) played a moderating role in the relationship between RNT and maternal postnatal anxiety and depressive symptoms. Methods: A sample of women (N = 251) who had given birth in the preceding 12 months completed an online battery of standardised measures during the COVID-19 'lockdown' of May 2020. Results: As predicted, social support moderated the relationship between RNT and depression such that the association between RNT and depression was stronger for women who reported lower levels of social support. Interestingly, this finding emerged for social support from friends only; for support from family and significant other, social support did not play a moderating role. Further, and unexpectedly, overall social support did not moderate the relationship between RNT and postnatal anxiety, however, social support from friends was a significant moderator. Conclusions: High levels of perceived social support from friends (but not family or significant others) buffered the effects of RNT on depression and anxiety during the postpartum period. Strategies to bolster peer social support may be a valuable inclusion in interventions to prevent and treat postnatal depression and anxiety.","output":"Support from friends moderates the relationship between repetitive negative thinking and postnatal wellbeing during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased acute hospitalisations, a high demand for intensive care and high in-hospital mortality, placing a huge burden on healthcare systems. Objectives. To assess in-hospital mortality outcomes and associated factors in acute hospitalised COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Zambia. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort review of patients admitted to two tertiary-level hospitals in Zambia from 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021. We examined the factors (demographic, clinical and laboratory) that were associated with in-hospital mortality using multivariate logistic analysis. Adjusted odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Results. Of 350 patients, 59.4% were aged 55 years and 52.6% were male. The commonest comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), HIV/AIDS and chronic kidney disease (49.6%, 28.5%, 22.0% and 8.1%, respectively). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 42.6%, and mortality was significantly increased in patients aged 55 years (52.0% v. 48.0%) and in those with DM (52.1% v. 47.9%), cardiac disease (68.0% v. 32.0%), a Quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment (q-SOFA) score 2 (75.4% v. 24.6%), and admission blood glucose levels 7.0 mmol/L (66.3% v. 33.7%). Compared with patients who survived, who spent a median (interquartile range) of 6 (3 - 10) days in hospital, the median time between admission and death in those who died was 2.5 (1 - 6) days. In multivariate logistic analysis, age 55 years, a q-SOFA score 2 and a random blood sugar level 7.0 mmol/L were predictors of in-hospital mortality, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.54 (95% CI 1.09 - 2.17), 2.17 (95% CI 1.40 - 3.38) and 1.65 (95% CI 1.18 - 2.30), respectively. Raised serum creatinine was not associated with in-hospital COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for other confounders. Conclusions. This study highlights that high in-hospital COVID-19 mortality was associated with a high q-SOFA score, hyperglycaemia on admission and older age. The study reinforces the need to invest in emergency healthcare services for optimal management of COVID-19 patients presenting with high q-SOFA scores in resource-limited countries.","output":"Predictors of mortality in acute hospitalised COVID-19 pneumonia patients: A retrospective cohort study at two tertiary-level hospitals in Zambia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Acute bacterial sinusitis is common, but currently recommended antibiotic treatment provides minimal benefit. Objective: To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Interventions: Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of \\"a lot better\\" or \\"no symptoms\\" at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1 (a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment. Results: At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7-84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of \\"a lot better\\" or \\"no symptoms,\\" as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI, -24.4% to 8.5%; P = .35). The study was, therefore, stopped for futility. Diarrhea was common in both groups by day 3, with any diarrhea reported in 29 of 71 participants (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose and severe diarrhea reported in 5 of 71 (7.0%) and 5 of 65 (7.7%), respectively.

This study aimed to explore the material basis and molecular mechanism of Shenfu Decoction through network pharmacology and molecular mechanisms, to provide a research basis for clinical medication and clues for subsequent research. METHODS: The active components and targets of Shenfu decoction were searched in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), and the COVID-19-associated genes were collected using the Gene Cards platform. The target protein-protein interaction network map was constructed by mapping two genes, and the 'drug-active ingredient-target' network was constructed using Cytoscape software. The Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of the mapping targets were analyzed. RESULT: Based on Traditional Chinese medicine, Shenfu Decoction can take effect in the lung, spleen, kidney and heart. Considering oral bioavailability (OB) &#8805; 30% and drug-like (DL) &#8805; 0.18 as the standard, 43 active compounds were screened and 114 Shenfu decoction action targets were collected. The key targets were CASP3, MAPK8, PTGS2, IL1B, PPARG, ICAM1, IFNG, RELA, NOS2, NOS3, HMOX1, CASP8, STAT1, and TGFB1. According to the standard of p < .05, GO function was enriched in 108 biological processes, 16 cell processes and 27 molecular processes. Sixty-three signaling pathways were enriched by KEGG, which can be divided into four types: viral infection pathways, signal pathways, biological process pathways and different disease pathways. The comparison of negative and positive prescriptions further reflects the positive effect of Shenfu decoction against COVID-19. Finally, the effective ingredients with the high degree were molecular docked with Mpro, Rdrp and Spro proteins to further confirm the intervention effect of Shenfu Decoction on COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Shenfu decoction played an important role in regulating the anti-virus process, regulating immunity, inhibiting inflammation and regulating apoptosis through the interrelated regulation mechanism of multi-components and multi-targets, to treat patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"Chemical composition and pharmacological mechanism of shenfu decoction in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deaths among health-care workers in the United Kingdom (UK) were seven as of April 2020 7 During the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa in early 2013 to 2016, a high proportion of infections were among health-care workers 89 Infection among health-care workers during the aforementioned pandemics and epidemics were attributed to PPE shortages, incorrect PPE, inconsistent use of PPE, inadequate fit testing, insufficient training with donning and doffing, suboptimal hand hygiene before and after contact with patients, and protocol failure 6-10 Specific requirements for health-care workers' protection are advisable to ensure the functioning of the health-care system [ ]assessment of clinical outcomes was self-reported and prone to bias, as the intervention cannot be masked 15 Dangers of insufficient training Evidence from a cohort study conducted among health-care workers in Hong Kong and Toronto showed that insufficient training in and inconsistent wearing of either a surgical mask or an N95 was associated with developing SARS when compared with sufficient training and consistent use 10 The efficacy of respiratory protection in preventing respiratory infection among health-care workers may easily be lost, if compliance is poor or insufficient training is provided An observational study performed in 11 hospitals in Canada found that only half the health-care workers removed their PPE in the correct sequence and hand hygiene was not routinely performed after PPE removal, thereby creating opportunities for self-contamination 14 In a UK study in 2018, researchers saw that the healthcare workers were frequently contaminated, either through a protocol failure of the PPE ensemble itself, complication or errors in doffing 8 A recent experimental simulation of intubation was conducted by researchers using fluorescent-simulated body fluid Filtering facepiece respirators, including N95s, rely on having a good seal with the wearer's face [ ]a face fit test and pre-use seal check or fit check should be carried out in compliance with the NZ Standard AS/ NZS 1715:2009 to ensure the respiratory protective equipment can protect the wearer against biological hazards","output":"Using PPE correctly and safely"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research examines three distinct processes that influence Americans' prosocial responses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A questionnaire to be completed anonymously was submitted online to students attending the faculties of Dentistry and Oral Hygiene at Sapienza, University of Rome, after the end of distance lessons. The collected data were processed statistically, providing descriptive data and analysis of correlation of the most significant parameters, using Chi-squared test, Cramr V and Pearson (2), Goodman and Kruskals  and  and Kendalls b. The level of statistical significance was p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 314 students participated in the survey. The overall level of satisfaction on a ten- point scale was 5.39  2.59 for Oral Hygiene students and 6.15  2.98 for Dentistry students. The most common complaints were the lack of a structured online curriculum, less interaction with professors and a lower level of attention. On the basis of the responses, scored using Likert-type Scale, oral Hygiene students reported statistically higher level of physical fatigue(p = 0.0189), a lower level of attention (p = 0.0136) and of the quality and quantity of acquired knowledge during distance education (p = 0.0392), compared to Dentistry students.

Michael Horrigan points out that job losses in the COVID recession were heavily concentrated among women, minorities, and less-educated workers. In turn, these groups have shown less progress regaining jobs, and many have left the labor force. Horrigan shows that the industry connection between vacancies and wage increases is not at all tight, suggesting that traditional explanations that labor shortages are a matter of wages not clearing the market needs to be modified. Misty Heggeness notes that much of the weakness in womens recent labor force participation has been by working mothers, but that their behavior has not been radically different than in the past. Policies that address the concerns of working mothers could lessen the possibility of swings like those recently seen. Kate Bahn expands to discuss more specific such policies, including paid leave, paid sick leave, more predictable work schedules, greater income support, as well as a revival of unions, as means to not only alleviate hardship, but also to increase labor market efficiency. Michael Strain contends that federal policy greatly enhanced consumer demand, but the income support programs, along with other problems, have restricted supply, leading to some of the distortions observed in the labor market. While he supports some of the policies proposed by other panelists, he is leery about the effects of specific government programs that have been offered.","output":"Is there a labor shortage?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Depuis le dbut de lpidmie de COVID-19, la communaut scientifique internationale sest mobilise pour amliorer la prise en charge des patients et leurs permettre, dans des dlais jusqualors ingals, de participer  des essais thrapeutiques En labsence de rgulation nationale et internationale, la multiplication des tudes sur la thmatique COVID-19 remet en question leur faisabilit et leur capacit  produire des rsultats pertinents Matriels et mthodes Les tudes cliniques portant sur la COVID-19 ont t extraites des bases de donnes mondiales entre le 15/03 et le 28/04 Les objectifs, design et population ont t extraites et analyses Pour les essais thrapeutiques internationaux, nous avons compar les objectifs dinclusion au nombre de patients diagnostiqus COVID-19 dans les pays recruteurs entre S10 et S17 Pour les essais fran?ais, nous avons slectionn les tudes thrapeutiques ciblant les patients hospitaliss et compar le nombre de patients ncessaires  latteinte des objectifs de recrutement au nombre de patients hospitaliss en France entre S10 et S18 Rsultats  lchelle mondiale, 466 essais cliniques interventionnels ont t recenss dont 398 thrapeutiques, 56 prophylactiques et 5 mixtes Les essais thrapeutiques taient pour lessentiel acadmiques (76,8 %), concernaient des patients hospitaliss prsentant des formes modres  svres Il sagissait majoritairement dessais de phase III (35,3 %), randomiss (84 %) en ouvert (48,6 %) Lobjectif cumul des inclusions tait de 248 928 patients, soit 11,3 % de la population mondiale COVID-19 En France, 38 essais interventionnels taient autoriss (79 %  promotion acadmiques) : 31 tudes thrapeutiques (81,6 %) chez des patients atteints de SARS-COV-2, 3 tudes sur des techniques de ventilation, 2 essais de prophylaxie et 3 des tudes mixtes Sur les tudes thrapeutiques, 91 % avaient pour cible des patients hospitaliss, prsentant une forme modre  svre de COVID-19 Au total, 47 molcules ont t values dans des essais majoritairement de phase III (58 %), randomiss, contr?ls en ouvert dans 53 % des cas et en aveugle dans 26 % des tudes  la S15, sous rserve de linclusion de 50 % des patients hospitaliss, les objectifs de recrutement ntaient plus atteignables en France Avec un taux dacception  100 %, la faisabilit des tudes tait remise en question  la S17  la S18, 23 tudes taient encore en attente dautorisation Conclusion Le contexte durgence a pu motiver une tolrance vis--vis dtudes cliniques sans expertise mthodologique et disperser leffort de recherche Ce jour, alors que la pandmie a touch en 6 mois prs de 5 millions de personnes, aucun traitement na dmontr de lefficacit au cours dun essai bien conduit En France et certains pays, ces difficults sont exacerbes par la diminution de la courbe pidmique en France Que lon soriente vers lventualit dune seconde vague ou lextinction de lpidmie, il appara?t indispensable de limiter la dispersion de nos efforts et unir nos forces et de mettre en place dune task force pour coordonner les essais cliniques  lchelle nationale voire supranationale","output":"COVID-19 et pandmie de projets de recherche clinique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: No recommendation exists about the timing and setting for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in septic shock. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective multicenter observational study was conducted in 30 ICUs in France and Spain. All consecutive patients presenting with septic shock were eligible. The use of tracheal intubation was described across the participating ICUs. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify parameters associated with early intubation (before H8 following vasopressor onset). RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifty-nine patients were enrolled. Two hundred and nine patients were intubated early (24%, range 4.5C47%), across the 18 centers with at least 20 patients included. The cumulative intubation rate during the ICU stay was 324/859 (38%, range 14C65%). In the multivariate analysis, seven parameters were significantly associated with early intubation and ranked as follows by decreasing weight: Glasgow score, center effect, use of accessory respiratory muscles, lactate level, vasopressor dose, pH and inability to clear tracheal secretions. Global R-square of the model was only 60% indicating that 40% of the variability of the intubation process was related to other parameters than those entered in this analysis. CONCLUSION: Neurological, respiratory and hemodynamic parameters only partially explained the use of tracheal intubation in septic shock patients. Center effect was important. Finally, a vast part of the variability of intubation remained unexplained by patient characteristics.

Demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory variables on admission were collected from electronic medical records. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were adopted to investigate the independent predictors of mortality. A nomogram was formed for predicting the mortality risk. RESULTS: The multivariate stepwise logistic model demonstrated that age of 60+ years (OR =4.426, 95% CI: 1.955-10.019), comorbidity of cerebrovascular disease (OR =7.084, 95% CI: 1.545-32.471), white blood cell (WBC) count >9.5109/L (OR =7.308, 95% CI: 1.650-32.358), platelet count <125109/L (OR =5.128, 95% CI: 2.157-12.191), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >40 U/L (OR =2.554, 95% CI: 1.253-5.206), cystatin C >1.1 mg/L (OR =4.132, 95% CI: 2.118-8.059), C reactive protein (CRP) &#8805;100 mg/L (OR =2.830, 95% CI: 1.311-6.109), creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB) >24 U/L (OR =6.015, 95% CI: 2.119-17.07) and D-dimer >5 g/L (OR =4.917, 95% CI: 1.619-14.933) were independent predictors of mortality of COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: 116 patients with positive PCR test results for COVID-19 and followed up by otolaryngologists at a tertiary referral center/COVID-19 pandemic hospital were questioned in terms of otolaryngology symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection. Data including demographics, disease severity, concomitant diseases, previous otolaryngologic diseases,incidence and duration of new onset symptoms were collected and categorically analyzed. In addition, the severity of loss of smell and taste was evaluated by visual analogue score (VAS). RESULTS: A total of 58 men and 58 women participated. The mean age of the patients was 57.24  14.32 (19C83). The most common otolaryngological findings were hyposmia/anosmia (37.9%) and hypogeusia/ageusia (41.37%), respectively. These complaints were followed by headache (37.1%), and nausea/vomiting (31%). The most common oropharyngeal symptoms were sore throat (32.7%) and dysphagia (20.6%). The rate of otological/vestibular symptoms was dizziness (31.8%), tinnitus (11%), true vertigo (6%), and hearing impairment (5.1%), respectively. The most of symptoms were more frequent in > 60 years and women. There was a significant correlation between nasal itching and smell disturbance in patients with allergic rhinitis. Considering the duration of symptoms, the longest were hyposmia/anosmia and hypogeusia/ageusia. The mean VASs in patients with hyposmia/anosmia and hypogeusia/ageusia were 5.52  2.08 and 5.79  2.21, respectively. CONCLUSION: The most common otolaryngologic symptoms of COVID-19 infection are known as sore throat, smell and/or taste disturbances. However, our study showed that these patients can be seen with different symptoms in otological or laryngeal areas.

The primary endpoint, radiologic hiatal hernia (HH) recurrence, was higher with PR (24%) than with SIS buttressed repair (9%) after 6 months. The second phase of this trial was designed to determine the long-term durability of biologic mesh-buttressed repair. METHODS We systematically searched for the 108 patients in phase I of this study to assess current clinical symptoms, quality of life (QOL) and determine ongoing durability of the repair by obtaining a follow-up upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) read by 2 radiologists blinded to treatment received. HH recurrence was defined as the greatest measured vertical height of stomach being at least 2 cm above the diaphragm. RESULTS At median follow-up of 58 months (range 42 to 78 mo), 10 patients had died, 26 patients were not found, 72 completed clinical follow-up (PR, n = 39; SIS, n = 33), and 60 repeated a UGI (PR, n = 34; SIS, n = 26). There were 20 patients (59%) with recurrent HH in the PR group and 14 patients (54%) with recurrent HH in the SIS group (p = 0.7). There was no statistically significant difference in relevant symptoms or QOL between patients undergoing PR and SIS buttressed repair. There were no strictures, erosions, dysphagia, or other complications related to the use of SIS mesh. CONCLUSIONS LPEHR results in long and durable relief of symptoms and improvement in QOL with PR or SIS.

There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increased by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of \\"daily settlement\\" (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could started to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%.

Although respiratory tract symptoms are often the initial presentation among kidney transplant recipients who contract COVID-19, other clinical features which may indicate underlying SARS-CoV-2-related inflammation, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, are not uncommon. Hyponatremia can develop and may reflect underlying inflammation. Interferon-6 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 complications and may play a role in the inappropriately higher secretion of antidiuretic hormone leading to hyponatremia. This pathway is the so-called immuno-neuroendocrine interface. Hyponatremia in COVID-19 has been reported in a few case series of non-kidney transplant patients and only one reported kidney transplant recipient. However, the clinical course and prognostic value of hyponatremia in this population are not described in detail. We report a kidney transplant recipient who was infected with COVID-19 and exhibited severe hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Hyponatremia is one of the clinical presentations of COVID-19, although less common, and may occur more frequently in kidney transplant recipients. Thus, the possible underlying immuno-neuroendocrine relationship related to the inflammatory process of COVID-19 leading to hyponatremia and its prognostic value are reviewed.","output":"Hyponatremia: A possible immuno-neuroendocrine interface with COVID-19 in a kidney transplant recipient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Microvascular decompression (MVD) is a non-ablative technique designed to resolve the neurovascular conflict responsible for typical idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN).

In the last decade, along with the technological progress mainly achieved with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), there has been an exponential growth of software platforms enabled to return photogrammetric products. On the other hand, the different levels of final product accuracy resulting from the adoption of different processing approaches in various softwares have not yet been fully understood. To date, there is no validation analysis in literature focusing on the comparability of such products, not even in relation to the use of workflows commonly allowed inside various software platforms. The lack of detailed information about the algorithms implemented in the licensed platforms makes the whole interpretation even more complex. This work therefore aims to provide a comparative evaluation of three photogrammetric softwares commonly used in the industrial field, in order to obtain coherent, if not exactly congruent results. After structuring the overall processing workflow, the processing pipelines were accurately parameterized to make them comparable in both licensed and open-source softwares. For the best interpretation of the results derived from the generation of point clouds processed by the same image dataset, the obtainable values of root-mean-square error (RMSE) were analyzed, georeferencing models as the number of GCPs varied.

To temper its effects, diagnostic methods that are simple, rapid, inexpensive, accurate, selective and sensitive continue to be necessary. In our study, we developed an electrochemical biosensing platform based on gold clusters, mercaptoethanol, the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen and bovine serum albumin-modified glassy carbon electrode able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody. Moreover, during the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody in spiked-real samples, the anodic signal of the produced biosensor at 0.85 V decreased as the amount of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody increased. Meanwhile, the recovery and relative standard deviation values for saliva and oropharyngeal swab samples were 97.73% and 3.35% and 102.43% and 4.63%, respectively. In 35 min, the biosensing platform could detect 0.03 fg/mL of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody in synthetic media and spiked-saliva or -oropharyngeal swab samples. The method thus issues a linear response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody from 0.1 fg/mL to 10 pg/mL. The cross-reactivity studies with spike antigens of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and influenza A and the antigen of pneumonia confirmed the excellent selectivity of the proposed method. The developed method was compared with the lateral flow immunoassay method in terms of sensitivity and it was found to be approximately 10(9) times more sensitive.

The burden of CMDs amongst ART-experienced patients in sub-Saharan Africa was unknown. OBJECTIVE: We quantified the burden of CMDs and identified the associated risk factors in a large treatment cohort on ART at a high-volume facility in Lesotho. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted data from the daily dispensing electronic system and routine clinical records of 785 adults on ART between 2011 and 2015 in Maseru, Lesotho. CMD was defined as a diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia (singly or collectively). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the disease burden; KaplanCMeier curves and cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to examine the impact of the ART regimen and identify the risk factors associated with the occurrence of CMD. RESULTS: Of the 785 participants, 473 (60%) were women. The median age of the group was 42 years, interquartile range (IQR), 36C51 years. The overall incidence of CMD was 5.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4C7.1) per 100 person-months of follow-up. The median time to onset of CMD was 16.6 months (IQR = 7.4C23.4). ART was not associated with the occurrence of CMD (cause-specific hazard ratio [CHR] = 1.55; 95% CI = 0.14C16.85; P = 0.72). Higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with the occurrence of diabetes mellitus (CHR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.14C1.38; P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: The incidence of CMD in this relatively young patient population is low yet noteworthy. We recommend that patients living with HIV and AIDS should be routinely screened for CMD.

METHODS: Between July 2018 and February 2020, the Southern Adelaide Local Health Network (SALHN), a network of health services in Adelaide, South Australia, conducted three capability-oriented capacity building programs that incorporated 82 longstanding individual quality improvement projects. Qualitative analysis of data collected from interviews of 19 project participants and four SALHN Improvement Faculty members and ethnographic observations of seven project team meetings were conducted. RESULTS: We found four interacting components that lead to successful implementation of quality improvement projects and the overall program that facilitates or support these: an agreed and robust quality improvement methodology, a skilled faculty to assist improvement teams, active involvement of leadership and management, and a deep understanding that teams matter. A strong safety culture is not necessarily a pre-requisite for quality improvement gains to be made; indeed, undertaking quality improvement activities can contribute to an improved safety culture.

The procedures were performed with a prototype MW ablation device with a 1.6-cm radiating section antenna (Valleylab MW Ablation System) and with a 2-cm exposed-tip RF electrode (Cool-tip RF Ablation System). At immediate computed tomography increase in density, maximum diameters (D1-D3) of ablation zones were measured and ablation volume was calculated. Histopathologic assessment was performed 3 and 7 days after the procedure. Technical success was achieved in nine of 10 rabbits in each group. One death occurred in group B. Complications included pneumothorax (group A, n = 4; group B, n = 4), abscess (group A, n = 1; group B, n = 1), and thoracic wall burn (group A, n = 4).

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients who underwent an HbA1c test. Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory test results, and final outcomes of COVID-19 treatment were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were included and divided into three groups based on their blood glucose status. There were significant differences in SaO2, serum ferritin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (Fbg) level, and IL6 level among the three groups. A pairwise comparison of the groups showed that groups B and C were significantly different from group A in terms of CRP, ESR, and Fbg, IL6, and serum ferritin levels (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that there was a linear negative correlation between SaO2 and HbA1c (r = -0.22, P = 0.01), while there was a linear positive correlation between serum ferritin, CRP, Fbg, and ESR levels and HbA1c (P < 0.05).

However, the mechanisms underlying these associations remain elusive in many cases. The best-characterized function of classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens is to allow safe presentation of antigenic peptides via a self/non-self-discrimination process. Therefore, most hypotheses to date have posited that the observed associations between certain HLA molecules and human diseases involve antigen presentation (AP). However, these hypotheses often represent inconsistencies with current knowledge. To offer answers to the inconsistencies, a decade ago we have invoked the MHC Cusp theory, postulating that in addition to its main role in AP, the MHC codes for allele-specific molecules that act as ligands in a conformationally-conserved cusp-like fold, which upon interaction with cognate receptors can trigger MHC-associated diseases. In the ensuing years, we have provided empirical evidence that substantiates the theory in several HLA-Class II-associated autoimmune diseases. Notably, in a recent study we have demonstrated that HLA-DRB1 alleles known to protect against several autoimmune diseases encode a protective epitope at the cusp region, which activates anti-inflammatory signaling leading to transcriptional and functional modulatory effects. Relevant to the topic of this session, cusp ligands demonstrate several similarities to the functional effects of HLA-G.

However, the situation changed after the early 1980s, partly because of low costs in China pulled investment from Hong Kong, and the post-1997 political uncertainty also resulted in short-term investment behavior. Economic overheating in the mid-1990s led to severe recession after the Asian financial crisis. Economic restructuring has been slow since 1997.

Results Seven patients (5 men) with single organ failure underwent bilateral LT. Median age was 47 years old. All ARDS cases had poor lung mechanics on invasive mechanical ventilation with radiographic evidence of lung fibrosis: pneumatocele, GGO, consolidations, subpleural reticulations and traction bronchiectasis. vvECMO was bridge to transplant in 5 cases (bridge to recovery in 2). Median ECMO duration for ARDS was 32 days (range 7-99). Median time to LT from Covid diagnosis was 59 days (Q1-IQ3, 54-62). Two patients were post-partum women with ARDS. Explanted pathology showed UIP, DAD, diffuse hemorrhage and one case of fibrosing NSIP. Pulmonary hypertension was seen in 4 cases. One patient did not survive. Organizing pneumonia and granuloma were present in this patient. Most ARDS patients were unable to tolerate lower sedation and consent by a substitute decision-makers was obtained.

Twelve guidelines were identified for data extraction and synthesis, and themes were subsequently formulated. Four themes emerged from the integrative literature review regarding a healthy work environment for nurses: (1) the need for effective nursing leadership, (2) effective communication as central to enhancement of a healthy environment, (3) effective teamwork as an integral part of a healthy work environment and (4) the need for professional autonomy. In summary, a healthy work environment for nurses requires leadership, effective communication, teamwork and professional autonomy. CONTRIBUTION: The findings can be used to conduct quality studies related to healthy work environments for nurses in comprehensive health care settings, particularly those dealing with resource constraints. This can inform evidence-based recommendations and guidelines in these settings, as such guidelines are currently lacking.","output":"Best practice recommendations for healthy work environments for nurses: An integrative literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To analyze and discuss the effect of clinical refined nursing intervention on maintenance hemodialysis patients during the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods: The Symptom Checklist90 (SCL?90) was used to conduct nursing interventions before, during and after dialysis for maintenance hemodialysis patients, and the results were compared with the Chinese adult SCL?90 norm. Results: The scores of all factors of SCL-90 in maintenance hemodialysis patients are all higher than normal Chinese SCL-90, and patients with a single factor score greater than or equal to 2 have a higher proportion of depression and anxiety, with extremely significant difference (P < 0.01). The depression and anxiety of the patients were reduced after the intervention, and there was a statistical difference. Two nucleic acid test results of 172 patients were negative. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 epidemic, providing maintenance hemodialysis patients with refined nursing intervention can improve their health behavior compliance, regulate negative emotions, reduce related complications, improve their quality of life, and improve the nurse-patient relationship. At the same time, it can fundamentally control the occurrence of nursing errors and adverse events, with outstanding clinical application value.","output":"Research and Analysis of the Effect of Refined Nursing Intervention on COVID-19 Epidemic in Hemodialysis Center Runing Title:Effect of Refined Nursing Intervention on COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continued explosive spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) despite aggressive public health measures has triggered an unprecedented international vaccine effort.

Many published commentaries have proposed plans for pandemic control that are primarily based on mortality rates among older individuals without considering long-term morbidity among individuals of all ages. Reliable estimates of such morbidity are important for patient care, prognosis, and development of public health policy. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of studies examining the frequency and variety of persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A search of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies published from January 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, that examined persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Persistent symptoms were defined as those persisting for at least 60 days after diagnosis, symptom onset, or hospitalization or at least 30 days after recovery from the acute illness or hospital discharge. Search terms included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, long-term, after recovery, long-haul, persistent, outcome, symptom, follow-up, and longitudinal. All English-language articles that presented primary data from cohort studies that reported the prevalence of persistent symptoms among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and that had clearly defined and sufficient follow-up were included. Case reports, case series, and studies that described symptoms only at the time of infection and/or hospitalization were excluded. A structured framework was applied to appraise study quality. FINDINGS: A total of 1974 records were identified; of those, 1247 article titles and abstracts were screened. After removal of duplicates and exclusions, 92 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility; 47 studies were deemed eligible, and 45 studies reporting 84 clinical signs or symptoms were included in the systematic review. Of 9751 total participants, 5266 (54.0%) were male; 30 of 45 studies reported mean or median ages younger than 60 years. Among 16 studies, most of which comprised participants who were previously hospitalized, the median proportion of individuals experiencing at least 1 persistent symptom was 72.5% (interquartile range [IQR], 55.0%-80.0%). Individual symptoms occurring most frequently included shortness of breath or dyspnea (26 studies; median frequency, 36.0%; IQR, 27.6%-50.0%), fatigue or exhaustion (25 studies; median frequency, 40.0%; IQR, 31.0%-57.0%), and sleep disorders or insomnia (8 studies; median 29.4%, IQR, 24.4%-33.0%). There were wide variations in the design and quality of the studies, which had implications for interpretation and often limited direct comparability and combinability. Major design differences included patient populations, definitions of time zero (ie, the beginning of the follow-up interval), follow-up lengths, and outcome definitions, including definitions of illness severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review found that COVID-19 symptoms commonly persisted beyond the acute phase of infection, with implications for health-associated functioning and quality of life. Current studies of symptom persistence are highly heterogeneous, and future studies need longer follow-up, improved quality, and more standardized designs to reliably quantify risks.","output":"Assessment of the Frequency and Variety of Persistent Symptoms Among Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technologies for mass production require cheap and abundant materials such as ferrous chloride (FeCl2). The literature survey shows the lack of experimental studies to validate theoretical conclusions related to the population of ionic Fe-species in the aqueous FeCl2 solution. Here, we present an in situ X-ray absorption study of the structure of the ionic species in the FeCl2 aqueous solution at different concentrations (1-4 molL-1) and temperatures (25-80 C). We found that at low temperature and low FeCl2 concentration, the octahedral first coordination sphere around Fe is occupied by one Cl ion at a distance of 2.33 (0.02) ? and five water molecules at a distance of 2.095 (0.005) ?. The structure of the ionic complex gradually changes with an increase in temperature and/or concentration. The apical water molecule is substituted by a chlorine ion to yield a neutral Fe[Cl2(H2O)4]0. The observed substitutional mechanism is facilitated by the presence of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds as well as entropic reasons. The transition from the single charged Fe[Cl(H2O)5]+ to the neutral Fe[Cl2(H2O)4]0 causes a significant drop in the solution conductivity, which well correlates with the existing conductivity models.","output":"Structure and Population of Complex Ionic Species in FeCl2 Aqueous Solution by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), operating through 1 incision presents ergonomic challenges. No consensus exists on whether articulating instruments (ARTs) may help. This study evaluated their effect on simulated SILS, hypothesizing that they would affect performance and workload. DESIGN Surgeons were randomized to 2 straight instruments (STRs), 1 ART and 1 STR, or 2 ARTs. After baseline testing, 25 repetitions of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) peg-transfer (PEG) task and 5 repetitions of the short-hand for the FLS pattern-cutting task (CIRCLE) were performed. Primary outcomes were maximum FLS PEG scores, CIRCLE times and errors, and Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device hand motion analysis. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Raw Task Load Index (RTLX) questionnaires evaluated a secondary outcome--workload. SETTING The trial took place in a simulated operating theater within the Academic Surgical Unit at St Mary's Hospital, London, UK. PARTICIPANTS Eligible surgeons had completed at least 5 laparoscopic cases as a primary operator. Surgeons were stratified by laparoscopic experience into intermediate (less than 25 previous procedures as primary operator) or advanced (25 procedures or more). A total of 21 surgeons were recruited and randomized; 7 of them to each instrument combination group. All surgeons completed PEG, and 5 from each group completed CIRCLE. RESULTS Groups' baseline PEG scores were similar (p = 0.625). STR-ART achieved higher maximum PEG scores than STR or ART did (median = 236 vs 198 vs 193, respectively, p = 0.002). Fastest CIRCLE times were similar (median = 190s vs 130s vs 186s, p = 0.129) as were minimum errors (median = 1 vs 2 vs 3, p = 0.101). For PEG, Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device demonstrated similar total path lengths (median = 12.3m vs 12.3m vs 16.0m, p = 0.545) and total numbers of movements (median = 89.6 vs 86.4 vs 171, p = 0.080). Groups' NASA Raw Task Load Index scores were similar (p = 0.708). CONCLUSIONS Combining 1 STR and 1 ART improved SILS performance in the PEG task.

RESULTS: In 2019, under-5 mortality was 8 per 1000 live births in Ukraine. Underweight and adverse childhood experiences, including child abuse, were frequent compared to other European countries, while childhood obesity seemed less common. Alcohol consumption was common in women of reproductive age, including during pregnancy, risking foetal alcohol syndrome. Neonatal screening programmes provided low coverage. Vaccine hesitancy was common and vaccination rates were low. Other concerns were measles, HIV, antibiotic resistance and multi-resistant tuberculosis. Many children are expected to suffer from psychological and physical trauma due to the war.

However, HCTs for COVID-19 pose ethical and practical challenges, in part due to the unclear and developing risks. In this paper, we introduce an interactive model for exploring some risks of a SARS-COV-2 dosing study, a prerequisite for any COVID-19 challenge trials. The risk estimates we use are based on a Bayesian evidence synthesis model which can incorporate new data on infection fatality rates (IFRs) to patients, and infer rates of hospitalization. We have also created a web tool to explore risk under different study design parameters and participant scenarios. Finally, we use our model to estimate individual risk, as well as the overall mortality and hospitalization risk in a dosing study. Based on the Bayesian model we expect IFR for someone between 20 and 30 years of age to be 17.5 in 100,000, with 95% uncertainty interval from 12.8 to 23.6. Using this estimate, we find that a simple 50-person dosing trial using younger individuals has a 99.1% (95% CI: 98.8% to 99.4%) probability of no fatalities, and a 92.8% (95% CI: 90.3% to 94.6%) probability of no cases requiring hospitalization. However, this IFR will be reduced in an HCT via screening for comorbidities, as well as providing medical care and aggressive treatment for any cases which occur, so that with stronger assumptions, we project the risk to be as low as 3.1 per 100,000, with a 99.85% (95% CI: 99.7% to 99.9%) chance of no fatalities, and a 98.7% (95% CI: 97.4% to 99.3%) probability of no cases requiring hospitalization.","output":"Exploring Risks of Human Challenge Trials for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of corona discharge-generated air ions on the filtration of aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 was studied. A carbon-fiber ionizer was installed upstream of a medium-efficiency air filter to generate air ions, which were used to charge the virus aerosols and increase their filtration efficiency. After the virus aerosols were captured by the filter for a certain time interval, they were exposed to a newly incoming air ion flow. Captured virus particles were detached from the filter by sonication, and their antiviral efficiency due to air ions was calculated by counting the plaque-forming units. The antiviral efficiency increased with ion exposure time and ion concentration. When the concentration of positive air ions was 10(7) ions/cm(3), the antiviral efficiencies were 46.1, 78.8, and 83.7% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. When the ionizer was operated in a bipolar mode, the number concentrations of positive and negative ions were 6.610(6) and 3.410(6) ions/cm(3), respectively, and the antiviral efficiencies were 64.3, 89.1, and 97.4% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. As a quantitative parameter for the performance evaluation of air ions, the susceptibility constant of bacteriophage MS2 to positive, negative, bipolar air ions was calculated as 5.510(?3), 5.410(?3) and 9.510(?3), respectively.

Sixty-four women did not receive antiviral therapy during pre-conception and the entire pregnancy. All infants in the two groups had received immunoprophylaxis on schedule. Mother-infant pairs were followed up at least 7 months postpartum. The outcome was the safety and efficacy of antiviral therapy for mothers and offspring.Findings: All mothers tolerated antiviral therapy (TDF or LDT) well. The mean maternal HBV DNA level in the antiviral therapy group was less than that of the control group before delivery as well as in the three months postpartum (P<0.05). Before delivery, the mean maternal serum ALT level in the antiviral group (15.478.36 U/L) was slightly higher than that of the control group (12.679.42 U/L) (P=0.010). However, in 3 months postpartum, there was not a statistically significant difference in the maternal serum ALT level between the two groups (P=0.185).

The clinical features, antibody responses targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and its different domains, SARS-CoV-2-specific Ig isotypes, IgG subclasses, ACE2 competitive antibodies, binding titers with FcIIa and FcIIb receptors, and 14 cytokines were comprehensively investigated. The differences between severe and non-severe groups were analyzed using MannCWhitney U test or Fishers exact test. RESULTS: Severe group including 9 patients represented lower lymphocyte count, higher neutrophil count, higher level of LDH, total bile acid (TBA) (P < 1  10(C4)), r-glutaminase (P = 0.011), adenosine deaminase (P < 1  10(C4)), procalcitonin (P = 0.004), C-reactive protein (P < 1  10(C4)) and D-dimer (P = 0.049) compared to non-severe group (28 patients). Significantly, higher-level Igs targeting S, different S domains (RBD, RBM, NTD, and CTD), FcRIIa and FcRIIb binding capability were observed in a severe group than that of a non-severe group, of which IgG1 and IgG3 were the main IgG subclasses. RBD-IgG were strongly correlated with S-IgG both in severe and non-severe group. Additionally, CTD-IgG was strongly correlated with S-IgG in a non-severe group. Positive RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition was strongly associated with high titers of antibody (S-IgG1, S-IgG3, NTD-IgG, RBD-IgA, NTD-IgA, and CTD-IgA) especially RBD-IgG and CTD-IgG in the severe group, while in the non-severe group, S-IgG3, RBD-IgG, NTD-IgG, and NTD-IgM were correlated with ACE2 blocking rate. S-IgG1, NTD-IgM and S-IgM were negatively associated with illness day in a severe group, while S-IgG3, RBD-IgA, CTD-IgA in the severe group (r = 0.363, P = 0.011) and S-IgG1, NTD-IgA, CTD-IgA in the non-severe group were positively associated with illness day. Moreover, GRO-, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MCP-3, MIG, and BAFF were also significantly elevated in the severe group. CONCLUSION: Antibody detection provides important clinical information in the COVID-19 process. The different signatures in Ig isotypes, IgG subclasses, antibody specificity between the COVID-19 severe and non-severe group will contribute to future therapeutic and preventive measures development.

Here, we relate online recommendations for immunity-boosting foods across five continents to their environmental and human health impacts. More frequently recommended food items and groups are plant based and have lower land use and greenhouse gas emission impacts plus more positive health outcomes (reducing relative risks of mortality or chronic diet-related diseases) per serving of food. We identify trade-offs between environmental outcomes of increasing consumption of recommended food items, with aquatic environment impacts increasing with food recommendation frequency. Peoples reliance on the Internet for health information creates an opportunity to consolidate behaviour change towards consuming foods with multiple co-benefits.

Method: A postal survey was sent in June 2020 to 859 participants from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), an ongoing longitudinal study. The survey was developed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and related infection-control measures on daily life, specifically commitment to distancing measures, access to health care and social services, daily activities, and changes in cognitive and social activities. Results: By September 2020, 613 (71%) participants responded (mean age = 77.7 years, 32% lived alone, and 80% had at least one chronic condition). Three quarters adopted some distancing practices during the first months of the pandemic. Older participants were more likely to practice total isolation than younger ones (29 vs. 19%; p = 0.003). Non-acute health-care visits were canceled for 5% of the participants who needed appointments, but cancellations in dental health care (43%), home aid (30%), and rehabilitative services (53%) were more common. Pandemic-related changes were reported in social engagements, for example, less contact with friends (55%) and family (31%), or less frequent attendance in cultural events (38%) or associations (25%), although remote contact with others increased for 40%. Feelings of loneliness increased for 21%, particularly those who were older (p = 0.023) or living alone (p < 0.001). Physical activity reduced for 34%, but dietary habits remained stable or improved. Pandemic-related changes in lifestyle and activities were more evident among those living alone. Conclusions: Finnish older persons generally reported less negative changes in lifestyles and behaviors during the pandemic than expected. Older people and those living alone seemed more susceptible to negative changes.

Researchers have identified \\"person-centered\\" methods that cluster within-individual characteristics as appropriate to intersectionality. We aimed to review their use and match with theory. METHODS We conducted a multidisciplinary systematic review of English-language quantitative studies wherein authors explicitly stated an intersectional approach, and used clustering methods. We extracted study characteristics and applications of intersectionality. RESULTS 782 studies with quantitative applications of intersectionality were identified, of which 16 were eligible: eight using latent class analysis, two latent profile analysis, and six clustering methods. Papers used cross-sectional data (100.0%) primarily had U.S. lead authors (68.8%) and were published within psychology, social sciences, and health journals. While 87.5% of papers defined intersectionality and 93.8% cited foundational authors, engagement with intersectionality method literature was more limited. Clustering variables were based on social identities/positions (e.g., gender), dimensions of identity (e.g., race centrality), or processes (e.g., stigma). Results most commonly included four classes/clusters (60.0%), which were frequently used in additional analyses. These described sociodemographic differences across classes/clusters, or used classes/clusters as an exposure variable to predict outcomes in regression analysis, structural equation modeling, mediation, or survival analysis. Author rationales for method choice included both theoretical/intersectional and statistical arguments.

Recent studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share around 80% of homology and use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2. These inspired us to study other receptors of SARS-CoV, which may be used for SARS-CoV-2 binding as well. In this study, we screened the gene expression of three receptors (ACE2, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN) in four datasets of normal lung tissue from lung adenocarcinoma patients and two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from normal lung and bronchial epithelial cells separately. No significant difference in gene expression of these three receptors were found between gender groups (male vs female). We found higher gene expression of DC-SIGN in elder with age>60 and higher gene expression of L-SIGN in Caucasian than Asian. Similar to ACE2, we observed significantly higher DC-SIGN gene expression in the lungs of smokers, especially former smokers. However, smokers upregulate ACE2 and DC-SIGN gene expression in different cell types. In the whole lung, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodeled Alveolar Type II cells of former smokers, while DC-SIGN is largely expressed in monocytes of former smokers and dendritic cells of current smokers. In bronchial epithelium, no obvious gene expression of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN was observed while ACE2 was found to be actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In conclusion, our findings may indicate that smokers, especially former smokers, and people over 60 have higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Therefore, psychiatrists and GPs are key populations where it is crucial to examine stigma, improve attitudes and reduce discrimination towards psychiatric patients. AIMS: This study is the first to explore mental health-related stigma among Portuguese psychiatrists and GPs, examining the differences between these two specialities and assessing whether sociodemographic and professional variables are associated with stigma. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was performed between June 2018 and August 2019. A consecutive sample of 55 Psychiatrists and 67 GPs working in Porto (Portugal) filled a 25-item self-report questionnaire to assess their attitudes towards PDMDs in clinical practice. The instrument was designed by the authors, based on previous mental health-related stigma studies and validated scales. The questionnaire includes 12 stigma dimensions (Autonomy, Coercion, Incompetence, Dangerousness, Permanence, Pity, Responsibility, Segregation, Labelling, Diagnostic Overshadowing, Shame and Parental Incompetence), and its total score was used to measure Overall Stigma (OS). Sample characteristics were examined using descriptive statistics, and the factors affecting stigma were assessed through regression analysis. RESULTS: GPs exhibit significantly higher OS levels than psychiatrists, and present higher scores in the dimensions of dangerousness, parental incompetence, diagnostic overshadowing and responsibility. Besides medical speciality, several other sociodemographic variables were associated with sigma, including age, gender, having a friend with a mental disorder, professional category, agreement that Psychiatry diverges from core medicine and physician's interest in mental health topics. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that both psychiatrists and GPs hold some degree of stigmatizing attitudes towards PDMDs.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of atrioventricular block (AV) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and its association between in-hospital morbidity and mortality. METHODS: In-hospital electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 438 patients were compared with their prior or baseline ECGs to ascertain the development of new onset AV block. Patients who developed new AV blocks were then followed at 30 and 90 days post-discharge to check for resolution of AV block. Demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and complications during their hospital stay were evaluated. Major complications including respiratory failure requiring oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation, sepsis, deep vein thrombosis, elevated troponins, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, as well as death were compared between those who developed new onset AV blocks and those who did not. RESULTS: Based on our single center study, the incidence of new onset AV blocks among patients admitted for COVID-19 during the study period was 5.5 cases per 100 patients. New onset AV blocks were not associated with longer hospital and ICU length of stay, increased intubation rates, or increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Although the development of a new onset AV block is most likely multifactorial and not solely due to COVID-19, it is still important for clinicians to be mindful about the possibility of developing symptomatic bradycardia and life-threatening arrhythmias in patients admitted for COVID-19. This can be achieved by appropriate rhythm monitoring in-patient but the need for a cardiac event monitor upon discharge is unlikely to be necessary. Careful history taking, including family and drug use history is also of great importance as emerging drug therapies for COVID-19 have potential arrhythmogenic effects.","output":"Incidence of Atrioventricular Blocks and its Association with In-Hospital Mortality and Morbidity in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Male Breast Cancer (MBC) is a rare and aggressive disease that is associated with genetic factors.

Scan sampling on thirteen reptile species (two chelonians and eleven squamates) showed species-specific differences in response to the presence/absence of visitors, with most taxa being only weakly affected. High-resolution scan sampling via video footage of an off-show and on-show enclosure was carried out for tokay geckos (Gekko gecko) over the open and closed periods. In this part of the study, tokay geckos were significantly more visible during zoo closure than when visitors were present on-exhibit, but there was no change in off-show animals, indicating the effect of visitors as opposed to other factors, such as seasonality, which applied equally to both on- and off-show animals. The high-resolution study showed that a significant effect was present for tokay geckos, even though the low-resolution suggested that they were more weakly affected than other taxa.

We conclude that, with the exception of fraud, all property offence categories declined significantly. For some offence types (shop stealing, other theft offences, and residential burglary), the decrease commenced as early as March. For other offence types, the decline was lagged and did not occur until April or May. Non-residential burglary was the only offence type to significantly increase, which it did in March, only to then decline significantly thereafter.

Moreover, proper placement of purifiers could offer significant advantages in reducing airborne aerosol numbers (offering several orders of magnitude higher aerosol removal when compared to nearly zero removal when having no purifiers), and improper placement of the purifiers could worsen the situation. This study suggests the purifier to be placed close to the injector to yield a benefit and away from the people to be protected.

This study analyses the outbreak and the social-distancing effectiveness timeline in the general population and the care homes. Methods: A novel distributed-compartmental, time-variant epidemiological model was designed specifically for COVID-19 transmission characteristics, featuring a/pre/symptomatic transmission, a non-linear hospital model, a weakly-coupled sub-model for the care-home population, and parametrized continuous social-distancing functions. The model parameters and the social-distancing timelines are determined by randomization and Monte-Carlo simulations analysing real-world data. Findings: Despite a high initial reproduction number (3.29) and the near-absence of governmental interventions, the model quantitated that the transmission rate in the general population was suppressed by 73%, and in the care homes by 79%. The measures in the care homes took effect 4.8 days delayed; and if applied 4 or 8 days earlier, the fatalities could have been reduced by 63.2% or 89.9%. The infected population is estimated to 16.2% (June 10). An expected underestimation of population immunity by antibody studies is confirmed. The infection fatality ratio extrapolates to 0.61% (peak: 1.34%). The model indicates a seasonal effect which effectively suppressed a new rise. An analysed large-scale public event had no large influence. The asymptomatic ratio was determined to 35%. Interpretation: The proposed model and methods have proven to analyse a COVID-19 outbreak and to re-construct the social-distancing behaviour with unprecedented accuracy, confirming even minor details indicated by mobility-data analysis, and are applicable to other regions and other emerging infectious diseases of similar transmission characteristics. The self-regulation of the population in Stockholm, influenced by advices by the authorities, was able to suppress a COVID-19 outbreak to a level far beyond that the stringency index of governmental interventions suggests.

The dynamics of vascular damage, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of an immune cell-mediated cytokine storm remain unknown. Using a vascularized lung-on-chip model, we find that infection of alveolar epithelial cells leads to limited apical release of virions, consistent with reports of monoculture infection. However, viral RNA and proteins are rapidly detected in underlying endothelial cells, which are themselves refractory to apical infection in monocultures. Although endothelial infection is unproductive, it leads to the formation of cell clusters with low CD31 expression, a progressive loss of barrier integrity and a pro-coagulatory microenvironment. Viral RNA persists in individual cells generating an inflammatory response, which is transient in epithelial cells but persistent in endothelial cells and typified by IL-6 secretion even in the absence of immune cells. Inhibition of IL-6 signalling with tocilizumab reduces but does not prevent loss of barrier integrity.

To guarantee workers' safety, it could be useful to analyze the influence of the face mask use on physiological parameters during working activities. This paper aims at collecting and comparing both objective and subjective measurements during lifting and moving a light load (3 kg) in two working conditions: with and without a N95 face mask. The recorded physiological measures are the cardiac and respiratory activity, the skin temperature and the muscular activation. They are synchronously collected via an integrated wearable and unobtrusive sensory system. Moreover, the Borg scale is used to estimate the perceived exertion of the participants during the execution of the working activity. The analysis carried out in this work pointed out some statistically significant differences in the physiological measures due to an increased physical workload experimented by the volunteers when wearing the face mask. In addition, the correlation between the Borg scale and the monitored physiological measurements does not change significantly in the two experimented conditions. Moreover, the strong correlation between perceived exertion and physiological parameters demonstrates that the Borg scale remains an excellent method for estimating the level of perceived strain.

However, such a commitment is not credible, since investments are sunk at the time when the government chooses a lockdown. As a result, lockdown under lack of commitment deviates from the optimal policy. Rules that limit a government's lockdown discretion can improve social welfare, even in the presence of noncontractible information. Quantitatively, lack of commitment causes lockdown to be significantly more severe than is socially optimal.

This unprecedented crisis affected all aspects of health care, including plastic surgery residency training. The purpose of this study was to understand the specific impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on plastic surgery residencies. METHODS A survey of all plastic surgery residency training programs in the greater New York City area was conducted. The impact to training during the peak months of infection (March and April of 2020) was evaluated using resident education as measured by case numbers, need for redeployment, and staff wellness as primary outcome variables. RESULTS A total of 11 programs were identified in the region, and seven programs completed the survey, with a response rate 63.6 percent. When comparing productivity in March and April of 2019 to March and April of 2020, a total decrease in surgical volume of 64.8 percent (range, 19.7 to 84.8 percent) and an average of 940 (range, 50 to 1287) cancelled clinic visits per month were observed. These decreases directly correlated with the local county's COVID-19 incidence rates (p = 0.70). A total of 83 percent of programs required redeployment to areas of need, and correlation between local incidence of COVID-19 and the percentage of residents redeployed to non-plastic surgical clinical environments by a given program ( = 0.97) was observed. CONCLUSION As the first COVID-19 wave passes the greater New York area and spreads to the rest of the country, the authors hope their experience will shed light on the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and inform other programs on what to expect and how they can try and prepare for future public health crises.","output":"Frontline Reporting from the Epicenter of a Global Pandemic: A Survey of the Impact of COVID-19 on Plastic Surgery Training in New York and New Jersey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public and school holidays have important impacts on population mobility and dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales, subsequently affecting the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and many socioeconomic activities.

These scaffolds made of porous bioelastomers support tissue ingrowth along with their own degradation. It is necessary to develop a computer-aided analyzing method based on ultrasound images to identify the degradation performance of the scaffold, not only to obviate the need to do destructive testing, but also to monitor the scaffold's degradation and tissue ingrowth over time. It is difficult using a single traditional image processing algorithm to extract continuous and accurate contour of a porous bioelastomer. This paper proposes a joint algorithm for the bioelastomer's contour detection and a texture feature extraction method for monitoring the degradation behavior of the bioelastomer. Mean-shift clustering method is used to obtain the bioelastomer's and native tissue's clustering feature information. Then the OTSU image binarization method automatically selects the optimal threshold value to convert the grayscale ultrasound image into a binary image. The Canny edge detector is used to extract the complete bioelastomer's contour. The first-order and second-order statistical features of texture are extracted. The proposed joint algorithm not only achieves the ideal extraction of the bioelastomer's contours in ultrasound images, but also gives valuable feedback of the degradation behavior of the bioelastomer at the implant site based on the changes of texture characteristics and contour area. The preliminary results of this study suggest that the proposed computer-aided image processing techniques have values and potentials in the non-invasive analysis of tissue scaffolds in vivo based on ultrasound images and may help tissue engineers evaluate the tissue scaffold's degradation and cellular ingrowth progress and improve the scaffold designs.","output":"Computer-aided Recognition and Assessment of a Porous Bioelastomer on Ultrasound Images for Regenerative Medicine Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has necessitated the implementation of diverse pandemic control strategies throughout the world.

Competition in pharmaceutical R&D, and for generic entry, produces essential drugs and ensures that medications are accessible and affordable. That promise is fading. There is mounting evidence that connects high market concentration and high drug prices. Price gouging for important drugs, conspiracies to fix generic drug prices, and ever more innovative schemes by branded drug manufacturers to keep generic rivals out of the market put merger control at center stage.The AAI White Paper From Competition to Conspiracy: Accessing the Federal Trade Commissions Merger Policy in the Pharmaceutical Sector examines a major root of this problemthe Federal Trade Commissions (FTCs) policy of settling virtually all challenged horizontal pharmaceutical mergers with consent orders requiring divestitures. This stands in contrast to agency decisions to seek injunctions to stop highly concentrative, harmful mergersarguably the most effective remedy for fully restoring competition. AAIs macro-analysis of pharmaceutical mergers challenged by the FTC between 1994-2020 (to date) reveals that many drug makers engaged in serial mergers and/or repeatedly went to the till to purchase divestiture assets in other challenged mergers. Many of these firms were subsequently acquired by other pharmaceutical manufacturers, sometimes shortly after purchasing divestiture assets.The effect of the FTCs policy has been the swapping of assets within a relatively small group of large and increasingly powerful firms. Just under 20% of all unique branded and generic firms that engaged in repeated mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and/or purchases of divestiture assets account for almost 45% of pharmaceutical assets changing hands from 1994-2020. Many of the very firms that were the most active in M&A, and as purchasers of divestiture assets, appear as defendants in private, state, and federal non-merger antitrust litigations and in federal criminal indictments. These accumulating lawsuits serve as powerful evidence that something has gone awry with merger policy in the pharmaceutical sector, leading to the exercise of market power by dominant firms and oligopolies.The FTCs role in managing the allocation and ownership of important pharmaceutical assets through its extraordinary approach toward merger control has unduly involved it in shaping the industry. This resembles a form of industrial planning rather than antitrust law enforcement, which is designed to deter future anticompetitive conduct and relies on market forces to determine market structures. The FTCs policy has also deprived the antitrust community and public of important transparency. Because no challenged merger between 1994-2020 was litigated in federal court, there is no judicial record detailing how highly concentrative mergers were likely to have survived a presumption of illegality. There is thus no way to evaluate claims that pharmaceutical mergers were likely to have delivered lower prices through claimed cost savings or consumer benefits due to improved quality and innovation.This White Paper begins with background on drug pricing and competition in the pharmaceutical supply chain. It then turns to the drug mergers themselves and the asset divestitures required in FTC consent orders. Next is an assessment of private, state, and federal antitrust cases against the companies involved in M&A and as buyers of divestiture assets. It concludes with policy recommendations on reframing competition policy in the pharmaceutical sector. The FTC, which has devoted considerable resources and expertise to understanding the pharmaceutical sector, should take the lead in reforming its own policy on merger control.Competition problems in pharmaceuticals now rise to the level a public policy concern, addressable only through a coordinated policy response, of which stronger antitrust enforcement and legislative reform should be central componen s. The imperative for wholesale change in the FTCs merger policy in the pharmaceutical sector is more pressing than ever. Only robust competition among drug makers will result in the availability and affordability of drugs more generally, but also essential drug therapies and vaccines relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"From Competition to Conspiracy: Accessing the Federal Trade Commissions Merger Policy in the Pharmaceutical Sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyperimmune immunoglobulin (hCoV-2IG) preparations generated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CP) are under evaluation in several clinical trials of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Here we explored the antibody epitope repertoire, antibody binding and virus neutralizing capacity of six hCoV-2IG batches as well as nine convalescent plasma (CP) lots against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern (VOC). The Gene-Fragment Phage display library spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike-based epitope-mapping demonstrated broad recognition of multiple antigenic sites spanning the entire spike including NTD, RBD, S1/S2 cleavage site, S2-fusion peptide and S2-heptad repeat regions. Antibody binding to the immunodominant epitopes was higher for hCoV-2IG than CP, with predominant binding to the fusion peptide. In the pseudovirus neutralization assay (PsVNA) and in the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PRNT assay, hCoV-2IG lots showed higher titers against the WA-1 strain compared with CP. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from around the globe were reduced to a different extent by hCoV-2IG lots. The most significant loss of neutralizing activity was seen against the B.1.351 (9-fold) followed by P.1 (3.5-fold), with minimal loss of activity against the B.1.17 and B.1.429 ( < 2-fold). Again, the CP showed more pronounced loss of cross-neutralization against the VOCs compared with hCoV-2IG. Significant reduction of hCoV-2IG binding was observed to the RBD-E484K followed by RBD-N501Y and minimal loss of binding to RBD-K417N compared with unmutated RBD. This study suggests that post-exposure treatment with hCoV-2IG is preferable to CP. In countries with co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, identifying the infecting virus strain could inform optimal treatments, but would likely require administration of higher doses achieved by larger volumes or repeated infusions of hCOV-2IG or CP, in patients infected with the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.Funding: The research work described in this manuscript was supported by FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMi) grant # OCET 2021-1565 and NIH-NIAID IAA #AAI20040.

This study aimed to characterize the epidemics of HFMD and the serotypes of enterovirus (EV) after the introduction of EV-A71 vaccines in Shanghai, a city in Eastern China. RESULTS: A total of 2271 HFMD cases were recruited in this study from May 2017 through October 2020. Among these cases, a male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1 was observed, and the cases were mainly in 1C4 years old (63.1%). Children of all ages had a relatively similar time span between the onset of HFMD and the initial medical visit (P = 0.5192). The cases were reported year-round with peaks in the summer (2018 and 2019) and fall (2017), which was consistent with previous epidemics of the reported HFMD cases in the Shanghai municipality. Among the specimens that tested positive for EV (n = 1855), CV-A6 was predominantly detected (71.1%), followed by CV-A16 (14.2%) and EV-A71 (7.0%). Notably, the number of HFMD cases infected with EV-A71 increased in 2019. Furthermore, 9.2% of the cases had comorbidities, mostly convulsion, bronchopneumonia, and pneumonia; however, they were not correlated with the EV serotypes. In addition, 31.2% (709/2271) of the cases were vaccinated with EV-A71 vaccines. The time span differed significantly between the time of vaccination and the onset of the disease across the groups based on whether the onset was before or after vaccination (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CV-A6 is the predominant EV serotype in the epidemic of HFMD in Shanghai; in addition, CV-A16 and EV-A71 may be moderately prevalent. The changing trends in the presence of EV serotypes contributes to the periodicity of the HFMD epidemic. In addition, the minority of HFMD cases may have comorbidities, regardless of the EV serotype. The use of the EV-A71 vaccine has affected the HFMD epidemic. And serotype-specific protection by the EV-A71 vaccine may promote vaccination in children infected with EV-A71 compared to those infected with non-EV-A71 serotypes, which would further change the epidemic scenario of HFMD.","output":"Changing serotypes of hand, foot and mouth disease in Shanghai, 2017C2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the lack of evidence that bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics are useful in treating bronchiolitis, their use is still widespread.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to produce an inactivated PEDV vaccine using the KNU-141112 strain and evaluate its effectiveness in neonatal piglets. Pregnant sows were immunized intramuscularly with the inactivated adjuvanted monovalent vaccine at six and three weeks prior to farrowing. Six-day-old piglets born to vaccinated or unvaccinated sows were challenged with the homogeneous KNU-141112 virus. The administration of the inactivated vaccine to sows greatly increased the survival rate of piglets challenged with the virulent strain, from 0% to approximately 92% (22/24), and significantly reduced diarrhea severity including viral shedding in feces. In addition, litters from unvaccinated sows continued to lose body weight throughout the experiment, whereas litters from vaccinated sows started recovering their daily weight gain at 7 days after the challenge. Furthermore, strong neutralizing antibody responses to PEDV were verified in immunized sows and their offspring, but were absent in the unvaccinated controls. Altogether, our data demonstrated that durable lactogenic immunity was present in dams administrated with the inactivated vaccine and subsequently conferred critical passive immune protection to their own litters against virulent PEDV infection.","output":"Efficacy of an inactivated genotype 2b porcine epidemic diarrhea virus vaccine in neonatal piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health information-seeking behavior is the process of gathering information about health and disease and can be influential for health-related perception and behavior. University students are an important target group for prevention and health promotion and largely belong to an age group that is considered to play a leading role in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Germany. The paper deals with students' health information-seeking behavior before and during the corona crisis, aiming to give insights into its determinants and implications. Using the example of a large German comprehensive university and based on two cross-sectional surveys in the summer of 2019 (n = 4,351) and 2020 (n = 3,066), we investigate which information channels students use for health information, how information seeking changes during the course of the pandemic, and to what extent information seeking is associated with risk perception and risk behavior. For a subsample of participants that participated in both surveys (n = 443), we also trace developments at the individual level through a longitudinal analysis. The results show that students' health information seeking takes place primarily online and changed markedly during the corona crisis. The comparatively high relevance of sources that are largely based on unchecked user-generated content raises the concern whether students' health information-seeking behavior guarantees the necessary quality and reliability of health information.

Here we investigated the diagnostic value of hypoxia-related genes and explored their potential molecular mechanisms of action in OSA. Expression data from OSA and control subjects were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between OSA and control subjects were identified using the limma R package and their biological functions investigated with the clusterProfiler R package. Hypoxia-related DEGs in OSA were obtained by overlapping DEGs with hypoxia-related genes. The diagnostic value of hypoxia-related DEGs in OSA was evaluated by receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. Random forest (RF) and lasso machine learning algorithms were used to construct diagnostic models to distinguish OSA from control. Geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore pathways related to key hypoxia-related genes in OSA. Sixty-three genes associated with hypoxia, transcriptional regulation, and inflammation were identified as differentially expressed between OSA and control samples. By intersecting these with known hypoxia-related genes, 17 hypoxia-related DEGs related to OSA were identified. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that 16 hypoxia-related genes interacted, and their diagnostic value was further explored. The 16 hypoxia-related genes accurately predicted OSA with AUCs >0.7. A lasso model constructed using AREG, ATF3, ZFP36, and DUSP1 had a better performance and accuracy in classifying OSA and control samples compared with an RF model as assessed by multiple metrics. Moreover, GSEA revealed that AREG, ATF3, ZFP36, and DUSP1 may regulate OSA via inflammation and contribute to OSA-related cancer risk. Here we constructed a reliable diagnostic model for OSA based on hypoxia-related genes. Furthermore, these transcriptional changes may contribute to the etiology, pathogenesis, and sequelae of OSA.","output":"The Discovery, Validation, and Function of Hypoxia-Related Gene Biomarkers for Obstructive Sleep Apnea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid development of vaccines for COVID-19 has relied on the application of existing vaccine technologies.

Here, we used spectral dynamic causal modelling and parametric empirical Bayes on rs-fMRI data to assess whether DMN changes in PDOC are caused by disruptions in the AFM. PDOC patients displayed overall reduced coupling within the AFM, and specifically, decreased self-inhibition of the striatum paired with reduced coupling from striatum to thalamus. This led to loss of inhibition from AFM to DMN, mostly driven by posterior areas including the precuneus and inferior parietal cortex. In turn, the DMN showed disruptions in self-inhibition of the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex.

When choosing a bladder management technique (three studies), there were two major themes (bladder management decision makers, and characteristics and risks) that impacted the process. For studies evaluating life with a urinary catheter (five about intermittent catheters, and five about indwelling catheters), relevant themes could be arranged into three consecutive periods: First, a changed life (the initial stage of selecting and using a catheter: coping, teaching and technical challenges, and control and independence). Second, learning to live with a catheter (the practical skill and knowledge that goes into using a catheter: knowledge, adjustments, and normalization). Third, a new life (the acceptance and integration of a catheter into a person's life: problems and benefits, unpredictability, travel and social activities, intimacy and relationships, and dealing with negative emotions). Themes were generally consistent across studies.

The full-length CKLF1 cDNA contains 530 bp encoding 99 amino acid residues with a CC motif similar to that of other CC family chemokines. Recombinant CKLF1 exhibits chemotactic activity on leucocytes and stimulates proliferation of murine skeletal muscle cells. We questioned whether CKLF1 could be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation and proliferation in the lung. Therefore we used efficient in vivo gene delivery method to investigate the biological effect of CKLF1 in the murine lung. METHODS CKLF1-expressing plasmid, pCDI-CKLF1, was constructed and injected into the skeletal muscles followed by electroporation. Lung tissues were obtained at the end of week 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively after injection. The pathological changes in the lungs were observed by light microscope. RESULTS A single intramuscular injection of CKLF1 plasmid DNA into BALB/c mice caused dramatic pathological changes in the lungs of treated mice. These changes included peribronchial leukocyte infiltration, epithelial shedding, collagen deposition, proliferation of bronchial smooth muscle cells and fibrosis of the lung. CONCLUSIONS The sustained morphological abnormalities of the bronchial and bronchiolar wall, the acute pneumonitis and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis induced by CKLF1 were similar to phenomena observed in chronic persistent asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome. These data suggest that CKLF1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of these important diseases and the study also implies that gene electro-transfer in vivo could serve as a valuable approach for evaluating the function of a novel gene in animals.","output":"Chemokine-like factor 1, a novel cytokine, contributes to airway damage, remodeling and pulmonary fibrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine if Neurofilament Light chain protein in cerebrospinal fluid (cNfL); a sensitive biomarker of neuroaxonal damage, reflects disease severity or can predict survival in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS We investigated if disease severity, phenotype or survival in patients with new-onset PD correlates with cNfL concentrations around the time of diagnosis in the population-based NYPUM study cohort (n = 99). A second, larger new-onset PD cohort (n = 194) was used for independent validation. Association of brain pathology with the cNfL concentration was examined using striatal dopamine transporter imaging and repeated diffusion tensor imaging, at baseline, 1 and 3 years. RESULTS Higher cNfL in the early phase of PD was associated with greater severity of all cardinal motor symptoms except tremor, in both cohorts, and with shorter survival and impaired olfaction. cNfL concentrations above the median of 903 ng/L conferred an overall 5.8 times increased hazard of death, during follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex, higher cNfL correlated with striatal dopamine transporter uptake deficits and lower fractional anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging of several axonal tracts. CONCLUSIONS cNfL shows usefulness as a biomarker of disease severity and to predict survival in PD. The present results indicate that the cNfL concentration reflects the intensity of the neurodegenerative process, which could be of importance in future clinical trials.

Worldwide, a number of studies were conducted to estimate the magnitude of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. However, there is a need for more robust and well-designed studies to have a relevant public health intervention. Synthesis of the available studies significantly strengthens the quality of evidences for public health practice. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the overall magnitude of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection using available evidences. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA checklist to present this study. Two experienced review authors (MA and DBK) were systematically searched international electronic databases for studies. We performed meta-analysis using R statistical software. The overall weighted proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course infection was computed. The pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were presented using forest plot. Eggers tests were used to assess publication bias, and primary estimates were pooled using a random effects model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assure the robustness of the result. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Consequently, in the meta-analysis, a total of 6,071 COVID-19 cases were included. The proportion of asymptomatic infections among the included studies ranged from 1.4% to 78.3%. The findings of this meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection was 25% (95%CI: 16C38). The leave-one out result also revealed that the weighted pooled average of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 28% and 31.4%.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the observed low incidence of perinatal infection could be related to a low expression of the membrane receptor for SARS-CoV2, ACE2, in the fetal-placental unit. We evaluated protein expression of ACE2 both in placentas and fetal organs from non-infected pregnancies across gestation. METHODS: Discovery study. Immunocytochemistry analysis for ACE2 in organs and placentas were performed in May 2020, in samples from a registered biobank. Five cases of medical termination of pregnancy performed at between 15 and 38 weeks' in healthy women. Paraffin-embedded tissues (kidneys, brain, lungs, intestinal tract, heart). Matching tissues from 8-year-old children (N=4) were tested as controls. Seven placentas including those of the 5 cases, 1 of a 7-week miscarriage and 1 of a symptomatic SARS-COV2 pregnancy at 34 weeks. Tissues' sections were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE2. Protein expression of ACE2 was detected by immunochemistry. RESULTS: ACE2 expression was detected in fetal kidneys, rectum and ileum across gestation and similarly in the pediatric control. It was barely detectable in lungs at 15 weeks' and not found thereafter. In the pediatric control, ACE2 was only detectable in type 2 pneumocytes. No ACE2 expression was found in the cerebral ependymal, parenchyma nor in cardiac tissues ACE2 was expressed in syncitiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast from 7th weeks' onwards and across gestation but not in the amnion. Similar intensity and distribution of ACE2 staining were identified in the mother's SARS-CoV2 placenta. CONCLUSIONS: Marked placental expression of ACE2 provides a rationale for vertical transmission at cellular level. Absence of ACE2 expression in the fetal brain and heart is reassuring on the risk of congenital malformation.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, referrals from gynecologic oncology, perinatology, and gynecology clinics in a large teaching hospital of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) were compared from February 20 to May 20, 2020, with the same period in 2019. Finally, referral trends in 2020 were compared with the COVID-19 admission pattern. RESULTS: Total admissions to all three clinics declined 63% in 2020 compared to 2019. There was a significant relationship between the number of visits to three clinics during these2 years (p < 0.001). The reduction in referrals to the gynecology clinic was more than gynecologic oncology and perinatology. The COVID-19 referral pattern was conversely linked to gynecology-related admissions. CONCLUSION: As the pandemic situation makes patients hesitant to go to the hospitals or not, health policymakers should consider other non-COVID issues, including maternal and fetal concerns. Providing safe places for other patients to visit is a goal that can be achieved through developing guidelines for nosocomial hygiene and training informed healthcare staff.

In regard to the major impacts of COVID-19 on EBP implementation, three themes emerged: 1) increased difficulty delivering certain therapies via telehealth, 2) potential limitations to session confidentiality, and 3) challenge of engaging children in telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, community mental health providers continued to engage with clients and implement EBPs while navigating a number of changes related to the transition to telehealth. This study highlights the need for further work on what supports providers need to effectively engage with clients and deliver EBPs via telehealth and has implications for how telehealth is sustained or de-implemented in response to COVID-19.","output":"An Observational Study of the Impact of COVID-19 and the Transition to Telehealth on Community Mental Health Center Providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a simple, validated, and readily acceptable method of determining the risk of mortality from comorbid disease. It has been used as a predictor of long-term survival and prognosis. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of CCI score on mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients and test the efficacy of the CoLACD score (COVID-19 lymphocyte ratio, age, CCI score, dyspnoea) in predicting mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methodology: It was a retrospective cohort, and the data of this study were gathered from two tertiary hospitals of Karachi, including Liaquat National Hospital and Ziauddin Hospital. Data of patients hospitalized in any of these tertiary care hospitals and diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 infection were used in the study from January 15, 2021, to April 30, 2021. Results: The mean age of participants was 53.22 (14.21) years. The majority of participants were males (74.91%). Predictors of mortality include CCI score, age of participants, D-dimer, smoking status, and shortness of breath. The sensitivity of this CoLACD score was 80.23%, and specificity was 50.23% (diagnostic accuracy is 60.45%). The negative predictive value (NPV) of this test was 39.44%, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 83.01%. Conclusion: Our study showed that CCI can be used in a clinical setting to achieve a prediction of mortality in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The Impact of Charlson Comorbidity Index on Mortality From SARS-CoV-2 Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worlds population continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace. The decelerating growth is mainly attributable to fertility declines in a growing number of countries. However, there are substantial variations in the future trends of populations across regions and countries, with sub-Saharan African countries being projected to have most of the increase. Population momentum plays an important role in determining the future population growth in many countries and areas where fertility is in a rapid transition. With declines in fertility, the worlds population is unprecedentedly aging, and the numbers of households with smaller sizes are growing. International migration is also on the rise since the beginning of this century. The worlds population is also urbanizing due to increased internal rural to urban migration. Nevertheless, there are uncertainties in future population growth, not only because there are uncertainties in the future trends in fertility, mortality, and migration, but also because there are many other factors that could affect these trajectories.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of inhaled nebulised interferon beta-1a (SNG001) for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 pilot trial at nine UK sites. Adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, with a positive RT-PCR or point-of-care test, or both, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SNG001 (6 MIU) or placebo by inhalation via a mouthpiece daily for 14 days. The primary outcome was the change in clinical condition on the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) during the dosing period in the intention-to-treat population (all randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study drug). The OSCI is a 9-point scale, where 0 corresponds to no infection and 8 corresponds to death. Multiple analyses were done to identify the most suitable statistical method for future clinical trials. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events for 28 days. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrialsregister.eu (2020-001023-14) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04385095); the pilot trial of inpatients with COVID-19 is now completed. FINDINGS: Between March 30 and May 30, 2020, 101 patients were randomly assigned to SNG001 (n=50) or placebo (n=51). 48 received SNG001 and 50 received placebo and were included in the intention-to-treat population. 66 (67%) patients required oxygen supplementation at baseline: 29 in the placebo group and 37 in the SNG001 group. Patients receiving SNG001 had greater odds of improvement on the OSCI scale (odds ratio 232 [95% CI 107-504]; p=0033) on day 15 or 16 and were more likely than those receiving placebo to recover to an OSCI score of 1 (no limitation of activities) during treatment (hazard ratio 219 [95% CI 103-469]; p=0043). SNG001 was well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event was headache (seven [15%] patients in the SNG001 group and five [10%] in the placebo group). There were three deaths in the placebo group and none in the SNG001 group. INTERPRETATION: Patients who received SNG001 had greater odds of improvement and recovered more rapidly from SARS-CoV-2 infection than patients who received placebo, providing a strong rationale for further trials.

Chronic Mg deficiency may result in increased oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, including higher predisposition to infectious diseases. Mg might play a role in the immune response being a cofactor for immunoglobulin synthesis and other processes strictly associated with the function of T and B cells. Mg is necessary for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D, another key factor in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The regulation of cytosolic free Mg in immune cells involves Mg transport systems, such as the melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 channel, the solute carrier family, and the magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1). The functional importance of Mg transport in immunity was unknown until the description of the primary immunodeficiency XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with Mg defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia) due to a genetic deficiency of MAGT1 characterized by chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection. This and other research reporting associations of Mg deficit with viral and bacterial infections indicate a possible role of Mg deficit in the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications.

This ground-breaking experiment challenged a long-standing dogma of irreversible cellular differentiation that prevailed for over a century and enabled the development of methodologies for reversal of differentiation of somatic cells, also known as nuclear reprogramming. Thanks to this new paradigm, novel alternatives for regenerative medicine in humans, improved animal breeding in domestic animals and approaches to species conservation through reproductive methodologies have emerged. Combined with the incorporation of new tools for genetic modification, these novel techniques promise to (i) transform and accelerate our understanding of genetic diseases and the development of targeted therapies through creation of tailored animal models, (ii) provide safe animal cells, tissues and organs for xenotransplantation, (iii) contribute to the preservation of endangered species, and (iv) improve global food security whilst reducing the environmental impact of animal production. This review discusses recent advances that build on the conceptual legacy of nuclear transfer and C when combined with gene editing C will have transformative potential for medicine, biodiversity and sustainable agriculture.

Meteorological data have been collected over the same region for temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. In this work, we evaluated the combined impact of environmental pollutants and climate conditions on the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis evidenced a positive correlation between spatial distribution of COVID-19 infection cases with high concentrations of suspended particulate matter and a negative relationship with ozone. Moreover, suspended particulate matter concentration peaks in February correlated positively with infection peaks according to the virus incubation period.

Compounds that interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain protein (RBD)-ACE2 receptor interaction may function as entry inhibitors. Here, we used a dual strategy of molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) screening of compound libraries to identify those that bind to human ACE2 or the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Molecular modeling screening interrogated 57,641 compounds and focused on the region of ACE2 that is engaged by RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and vice versa. SPR screening used immobilized human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to evaluate the binding of these proteins to a library of 3,141 compounds. These combined screens identified compounds from these libraries that bind at K(D) (equilibrium dissociation constant) <3 M affinity to their respective targets, 17 for ACE2 and 6 for SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Twelve ACE2 binders and six of the RBD binders compete with the RBD-ACE2 interaction in an SPR-based competition assay.

We report the preliminary safety and immunogenicity results for the ReCOV. Methods This first in human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I study, was conducted at 2 study sites in New Zealand. Subjects were stratified into two age cohorts (18-55 years and 56-80 years old) and then randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive two 0.5 mL intramuscular doses of the ReCOV vaccine (20ug or 40ug, adjuvanted with BFA03 in each) or placebo, 21 days apart. The primary endpoints were incidence of solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) and unsolicited AEs after each dose; incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) up to 30 days after the second dose; changes in clinical laboratory tests from baseline up to 7 days after each dose; and changes in vital signs from baseline up to 30 days after the second dose. The key secondary endpoints for immunogenicity were neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2, S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) IgG titers post-vaccination. The T cell-specific immune response elicited by ReCOV were also evaluated. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04818801). Findings One hundred participants (50 for each age group) were randomized. The incidence of solicited local AEs in 20ug ReCOV, 40ug ReCOV, and pooled placebo group among younger adults were 60.0%, 70.0%, and 10.0%, respectively, while among older adults were 55.0%, 84.2%, and 10.0%, respectively. The incidence of solicited systemic AEs in 20ug ReCOV, 40ug ReCOV, and pooled placebo group among younger adults were 60.0%, 60.0%, and 30.0%, respectively, while among older adults were 50.0%, 52.6%, and 50.0%, respectively. All solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs were mild. No vaccination- related SAE, adverse events of special interest, and AE leading to early discontinuation were reported. ReCOV elicited SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody after the first vaccination, which were increased further after the second vaccination irrespective of dose and age groups. The neutralizing antibody against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 peaked at 14 days post the second vaccination in both 20ug and 40ug ReCOV groups, with GMT of 1643.17 IU/mL and 1289.21 IU/mL among younger adults, and 1122.32 IU/mL and 680.31 IU/mL among older adults, respectively. Similarly, both anti-RBD and anti-NTD specific IgG were elicited after the first vaccination, and peaked at 14 days after the second vaccination.

Interprofessional immersive simulation training appears to represent a useful educational tool to meet the evolving needs of the profession, but the impact of such training on workplace behaviour and relationships has not been explored. This study aimed to explore how interprofessional simulation training facilitates transformative learning in pre-registration pharmacists. METHODS: Across three different locations in Scotland, pre-registration pharmacists were paired with medical students to participate in immersive simulation scenarios with post-scenario debriefs. Pre-registration pharmacists were individually interviewed shortly after their simulation session, using a semi-structured interview schedule based on the transformative learning framework. Transcripts were analysed using template analysis, with Mezirows phases of perspective transformation forming the initial coding template. RESULTS: Fifteen interviews following five simulation sessions at three different sites were undertaken. Phases 1C6 of the transformative learning framework all resonated with the pre-registration pharmacists to varying degrees. Two prominent threads became evident in the data: a change in participants perceptions of risk, and deepened understanding of their role within an acute context. These themes were woven throughout phases 2C6 of the transformative learning framework. CONCLUSIONS: Interprofessional immersive simulation training involving acute clinical scenarios has been found to be helpful for pre-registration pharmacists and can foster transformative learning. Through this powerful process, they developed new ways to see the world, themselves and their professional relationships. Positive future actions and roles were planned. As the patient-facing roles of pharmacists expand, educational practices that translate into meaningful change to workplace behaviour and relationships become increasingly important.

The study was a randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of three formulations of irrigation nasal spray in 441 subjects. The objective was to test whether the formulations reduced Cold severity and Cold duration compared to a placebo nasal spray. Subjects were recruited, and supplied with the product when healthy, and were instructed to begin treating and recording symptom severity once they experienced the \\"first signs\\" of a Common Cold. To qualify, subjects had to volunteer that they had at least one of the symptoms: sore/scratchy throat, runny nose or congested nose. The product was used 4 times daily, with at least 4 hours separating each dose, for a maximum of 7 days. Efficacy was assessed by an Interactive Voice Recall System whereby subjects were required to contact the investigation site, by telephone, twice daily when they were asked to assess the severity of their symptoms using a four point ordinal scale where 0 = \\"absent\\", and 3 = \\"severe\\". The symptoms assessed were sore throat, runny nose, blocked nose, cough and tired/run-down feeling. Two formulations demonstrated significant effects. A hydroxy methyl propyl cellulose based formulation reduced symptom severity compared with placebo by 17% and a Poloxamer based formulation reduced severity by 21%. Duration of illness was reduced with a hydroxy methyl propyl cellulose based formulation by 1.5 days to 2.4 days (according to the dose) and by a Poloxamer based formulation by 2.5 days. Results of this study suggest that the creation of a non virus-specific, inhibitory environment in the nasopharynx holds promise as an effective method of controlling the severity and duration of the Common Cold.","output":"Effects of creating a non-specific, virus-hostile environment in the nasopharynx on symptoms and duration of common cold."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerged in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world despite authorities having made available a number of vaccines. While the coronavirus has been around for a significant period of time, people and authorities still feel the need for awareness due to the mutating nature of the virus and therefore varying symptoms and prevention strategies. People and authorities resort to social media platforms the most to share awareness information and voice out their opinions due to their massive outreach in spreading the word in practically no time.

METHODS: We evaluated PowerChek MERS assay performance in comparison with nested RT-PCR and sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes. To evaluate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, 100 clinical specimens (50 positive and 50 negative for MERS-CoV) were simultaneously tested by using the PowerChek MERS and sequencing assays. Assay performance, including limit of detection and precision, was evaluated in vitro by using MERS-CoV RNA transcripts. Analytical specificity was evaluated with a diverse collection of 16 respiratory virusCpositive clinical specimens and 14 respiratory bacterial isolates. RESULTS: The 95% limits of detection of the PowerChek MERS assay for the upE and the open rading frame (ORF)1a were 16.2 copies/L and 8.2 copies/L, respectively. No cross-reactivity was observed. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the PowerChek MERS assay were both 100% (95% confidence interval, 91.1C100%).

This study aimed to evaluate the association between surgical wait time and oncologic outcomes for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS The Canadian Kidney Cancer information system (CKCis) is a multi-institutional prospective cohort initiated in January 2011. Patients with clinical stage T1b or greater RCC diagnosed between January 2011 to December 2019 were included in this analysis. Outcomes of interest were pathologic upstaging, cancer recurrence, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. Time to recurrence and death were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and associations were determined using cox-proportional hazards models. RESULTS 1,769 patients satisfied the study criteria. Median wait times were 54 days (IQR 29-86) for the overall cohort and 81 days (IQR 49-127) for cT1b tumors (n=1166), 45 days (IQR 27-71) for cT2 tumors (n=672), and 35 days (IQR 18-61) for cT3/4 tumors (n=563 tumors). Adjusting for comorbidity, tumor size, grade, histologic subtype, margin status, and pathologic stage, there was no association between prolonged wait time and cancer recurrence or death.

All 50 states closed schools in March 2020 despite uncertainty if school closure would be effective. Objective To determine if school closure and its timing were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants US population-based observational study conducted between March 9, 2020, and May 7, 2020, using interrupted time series analyses incorporating a lag period to allow for potential policy-associated changes to occur. To isolate the association of school closure with outcomes, state-level nonpharmaceutical interventions and attributes were included in negative binomial regression models. States were examined in quartiles based on state-level COVID-19 cumulative incidence per 100 000 residents at the time of school closure. Models were used to derive the estimated absolute differences between schools that closed and schools that remained open as well as the number of cases and deaths if states had closed schools when the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was in the lowest quartile compared with the highest quartile. Exposures Closure of primary and secondary schools. Main Outcomes and Measures COVID-19 daily incidence and mortality per 100 000 residents. Results COVID-19 cumulative incidence in states at the time of school closure ranged from 0 to 14.75 cases per 100 000 population. School closure was associated with a significant decline in the incidence of COVID-19 (adjusted relative change per week, -62% [95% CI, -71% to -49%]) and mortality (adjusted relative change per week, -58% [95% CI, -68% to -46%]). Both of these associations were largest in states with low cumulative incidence of COVID-19 at the time of school closure. For example, states with the lowest incidence of COVID-19 had a -72% (95% CI, -79% to -62%) relative change in incidence compared with -49% (95% CI, -62% to -33%) for those states with the highest cumulative incidence. In a model derived from this analysis, it was estimated that closing schools when the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was in the lowest quartile compared with the highest quartile was associated with 128.7 fewer cases per 100 000 population over 26 days and with 1.5 fewer deaths per 100 000 population over 16 days. Conclusions and Relevance Between March 9, 2020, and May 7, 2020, school closure in the US was temporally associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence and mortality; states that closed schools earlier, when cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was low, had the largest relative reduction in incidence and mortality. However, it remains possible that some of the reduction may have been related to other concurrent nonpharmaceutical interventions.","output":"Association Between Statewide School Closure and COVID-19

An empirical analysis shows that the rise in dispersion of earnings forecasts can be explained by the introduction of lockdown measures, which had a particularly adverse impact on the travel sector. Accordingly, in terms of earnings expectations, countries that are relatively independent from the travel sector were least affected by a tightening of lockdowns. At the same time, the start of vaccination campaigns has been a game changer: more stringent lockdown measures added far less to the crosssectoral dispersion in earnings expectations once vaccines started to be rolled out in late 2020. Going forward, the dispersion in earnings expectations remains elevated, implying that analysts may expect the effects of the crisis to be of a rather structural nature.","output":"The Rise in the Cross-sectoral Dispersion of Earnings Expectations During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the performance of pneumonia risk stratification tools in patients with COVID-19 for predicting adverse outcomes within 72 hours of admission The secondary objective is to evaluate pneumonia scores in predicting ICU admission, mortality and hospital revisits at 7 days An exploratory objective is to evaluate patient risk factors and pneumonia risk stratification scores on likelihood of intensive care unit (ICU) admission at 72 hours and 7 days Methods: This is a prospective observational study at an academic ED Adult patients who presented with dyspnea in the ED, were hospitalized with pneumonia symptoms and under investigation for COVID-19 were eligible for enrollment Demographic data, triage vital signs and laboratory data within 12 hours of presentation were collected via chart review and utilized for predictor variables Adverse outcomes were defined as patients needing intensive respiratory support or vasopressor support or death within 72 hours of admission MuLBSTA, CURB-65, and SMART-COP scores were evaluated using sensitivity, specificity and ROC curve analyses Regression analyses were performed to determine correlations between clinical predictors and ICU admission Results: Of 1196 patients, 139 tested positive for COVID-19 (11 6%) The COVID-19 positive cohort was comprised of 65 5% male with a mean age of 48 5 (15) The most common comorbidities were hypertension (41 7%), smoking history (34 5%), and diabetes (31 7%) The most common chief complaints were cough (51 7%) and shortness of breath (50 4%), while common vital sign abnormalities were fever (24 5%), tachypnea (31 7%) and hypotension (8 6%) Adverse outcomes within 72 hours of arrival were noted in 33 (23 7%) patients with 31 (23%) admitted to the ICU Of these, 15 (10 7%) patients required non-invasive respiratory support while 21(15 1%) required endotracheal intubation Only 5 more patients (3 6%) required ICU care beyond 72 hours of arrival Overall mortality rate was 5% Of the three scores evaluated for adverse outcomes within the first 72 hours, CURB-65 was the only score with significant area under the curve (AUC 0 72 [95% CI 0 61,0 83], n=63), with sensitivity of 0 07 and specificity of 0 98 at a cut-off value of 3 (admission criteria per scoring system) For the 7-day outcome, once again, CURB-65 had a significant area under the curve (AUC 0 76 [95% CI 0 66, 0 86], p=0 00) with sensitivity of 0 06 and specificity of 0 98 with cut-off of 3, while SMART-COP and MuLBSTA did not reach significance (AUC 0 56 [95% CI 0 47, 0 71], p=0 15) and (AUC 0 55 [95% CI 0 43, 0 66], p=0 41) respectively Significant predictors for ICU admission include history of cancer, chronic kidney disease and diabetes A higher CURB-65 score was associated with increased odds of ICU admission at 72 hours and 7 days Conclusion: Current pneumonia risk stratification tools have poor sensitivities in detecting adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients Hence, there is a need for new scoring tools to manage patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia in the ED","output":"223 Evaluation of Pneumonia Scores in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19-Related Dyspnea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During 2021, COVID-19 vaccinations were delivered much more rapidly in some countries than in others. Ethical principles would have suggested allocating available vaccines to people by age, irrespective of where they live, because mortality risks from COVID-19 are much higher for older people. The World Health Organization recommended initial allocations of vaccines to countries based on their total population size, in part due to uncertainty about how COVID-19 would affect different countries. This paper estimates how many people would have died from COVID-19 up to 31 October 2021 if either of these allocation rules had been applied, compared to estimates of actual COVID-19 deaths. The estimates suggest that allocating vaccines by age would have resulted in between 500,000 and 1,500,000 fewer deaths globally (with a best estimate of 1,090,000 fewer deaths), while allocating vaccines between countries based on national population sizes would have reduced total deaths globally by between 450,000 and 2,100,000 (with a best estimate of 1,440,000 fewer deaths). Most low- and middle-income countries would have seen reductions in deaths, with the greatest absolute numbers in large middle-income countries (especially Bangladesh, India and Indonesia). More deaths would have taken place in many high-income countries, with the greatest absolute numbers in the United States and Turkey, and the greatest percentage changes in Arabian Peninsula countries, Israel and some island states. In most European Union countries, deaths would not have differed much if vaccines were allocated by age, because they would have received more vaccine doses during the early months of 2021 but fewer later in the year. Although allocation of vaccines by age should intuitively lead to fewest deaths, the estimated deaths would have been even lower if vaccines were allocated based on population size. Allocation by population would have directed disproportionate numbers of vaccines to a set of countries - especially India, Bangladesh and Indonesia - which experienced large outbreaks due to the Delta variant in 2021 after having previously limited infections through \\"flattening the curve\\". Sequencing of vaccination by age in national vaccination rollouts is critical to maximizing the numbers of lives saved. The estimated gains from fairer global vaccination allocation would be greater if high-income and upper-middle-income countries did not sequence vaccinations by age cohort, and would be lower if lower-middle-income and low-income countries did not vaccinate most of their elderly before the general population, whether due to policy choices or people not accepting vaccines made available to them or logistical difficulties in vaccine delivery. The estimates correspond to a reduction of between 8.5% and 10.7% (with a best estimate of 10.4%) of the total estimated actual deaths from COVID-19 between 1 January and 31 October 2021, if vaccines were allocated by age, and between 7.8% and 15.0% (with a best estimate of 13.6%) of total estimated actual deaths, if vaccines were allocated based on national population sizes. These percentages are small, despite the large differences in vaccine deployment between countries, because the mostly high-income countries which vaccinated their populations faster have disproportionately large numbers of elderly people. If a future SARS-CoV-2 variant, or a future pandemic, were to have fatality rates that are similar across age groups, or that are higher for children and young adults, then unequal global allocation of vaccines would have a much more severe effect on overall global mortality than it has for COVID-19 so far.","output":"Estimates of the impact on COVID-19 deaths of unequal global allocations of vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel, human-infecting -coronavirus enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection that emerged in November 2002.

METHODS We evaluated associations between imaging assessments (baseline mismatch profiles/ischemic core volumes and successful reperfusion) with imaging outcomes (27-hour infarct volume/growth) and clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale scores at 90 days). Imaging variables that predict favorable clinical outcomes were assessed in both univariate and multivariate models. RESULTS One hundred and ninety-five patients were included. Successful reperfusion and infarct volume (assessed at 27 hours) were powerful independent predictors of favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days). Patients with the target mismatch profile at baseline had a higher rate of reperfusion, lesser infarct growth, smaller infarct volumes, and better clinical outcomes in the Solitaire plus tissue-type plasminogen activator (intervention) group than those in the tissue-type plasminogen activator-alone (control) group. Patients with larger mismatch volumes at baseline had a trend toward better treatment response in the intervention group than patients who had smaller (<50 mL) mismatch volumes. CONCLUSIONS Patients who achieved reperfusion had substantially more favorable clinical and imaging outcomes in both the intervention and the control groups. Infarct volume at 27 hours strongly correlated with clinical outcome at 90 days in both treatment groups.

Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments and myocardial function assessed by transthoracic echocardiography were collected and analysed in CoV+ with (TnT+) and without (TnT-) elevation of troponin T levels and compared with CoV-. Among CoV+, 13 (42%) exhibited myocardial injury. CoV+/TnT + patients were older, had lower diastolic arterial pressure and were more likely to have hypertension and chronic renal failure compared with CoV+/TnT-. The control group was comparable except for an absence of biological inflammatory syndrome. Left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain were not different among the three groups. There was a trend of decreased myocardial work and increased peak systolic tricuspid annular velocity between the CoV- and CoV + patients, which became significant when comparing CoV- and CoV+/TnT+ (2167  359 vs. 1774  521%/mmHg, P = 0.047 and 14  3 vs. 16  3 cm/s, P = 0.037, respectively).

BACKGROUND: Health professionals caring for patients during infectious outbreaks such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome have reported negative psychological effects. However, little is known about how the experience influences their professional self-image. DESIGN: An interpretive phenomenological approach was applied using individual in-depth interviews. METHODS: Through purposeful and snowball sampling, 11 health professionals who had experienced hospital isolation due to suspicious symptoms of Middle East respiratory syndrome during the outbreak, participated in face-to-face interviews (50-90 min). We adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guideline for reporting. RESULTS: Six themes were identified: (a) engulfed in chaos and exhaustion; (b) feeling hurt and constrained by the rejection and blame; (c) anxiety induced by the enclosed environment; (d) dread of this uncertain and critical disease; (e) sustained by family and colleagues; and (f) reflection at this turning point, expanding self-understanding and seeking a balance. CONCLUSION: Hospitalised isolation was a \\"turning point\\" that appeared to change health professionals' sense of identity and direction.

Wnt/-catenin signaling is essential for maintaining the integrity of the adult BBB in physiological and pathological conditions, including stroke. However, how the impairment of the endothelial Wnt/-catenin signaling results in BBB breakdown remains unclear. Furthermore, the individual contributions of different BBB permeability-inducing mechanisms, including intercellular junction damage, endothelial transcytosis, and fenestration, remains unexplored. Here, we induced -catenin endothelial-specific conditional knockout (ECKO) in adult mice and determined its impact on BBB permeability and the underlying mechanism. -catenin ECKO reduced the levels of active -catenin and the mRNA levels of Wnt target genes in mice, indicating downregulation of endothelial Wnt/-catenin signaling. -catenin ECKO mice displayed severe and widespread leakage of plasma IgG and albumin into the cerebral cortex, which was absent in wild-type controls. Mechanistically, both the paracellular and transcellular transport routes were disrupted in -catenin ECKO mice. First, -catenin ECKO reduced the tight junction protein levels and disrupted the intercellular junction ultrastructure in the brain endothelium. Second, -catenin ECKO substantially increased the number of endothelial vesicles and caveolae-mediated transcytosis through downregulating Mfsd2a and upregulating caveolin-1 expression. Interestingly, fenestration and upregulated expression of the fenestration marker Plvap were not observed in -catenin ECKO mice. Overall, our study reveals that endothelial Wnt/-catenin signaling maintains adult BBB integrity via regulating the paracellular as well as transcellular permeability.

The study aims to determine the prevalence of PE elevation, and the relationship between elevated PE and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted according to the PRISMA guideline in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for studies reporting PE elevation in patients with COVID-19 from 1st January 2020 to 24th November 2021. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies (24,353 participants) were included in our review. The pooled prevalence of PE elevation in COVID-19 patients was 24% (18%C31%), the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality was 2.5 (1.7C3.6), the pooled OR of ICU admission was 4.4 (2.8C6.8), and the pooled OR of kidney injury, respiratory failure and liver injury were 3.5 (1.6C7.4), 2.0 (0.5C8.7), and 2.3 (1.4C3.9) respectively. In addition, the subgroup analysis revealed that although PE elevated to > 3  upper normal limit (ULN) was significantly related to the mortality (OR = 4.4, 2.1C9.4), it seemed that mild elevation of PE to 1C3 ULN also had a considerable risk of mortality (OR = 2.3, 1.5C3.5). CONCLUSIONS: PE elevation was a common phenomenon in patients with COVID-19, and was associated with poor clinical outcomes.

In addition, inhibition of 51 by the small peptide noncompetitive integrin 5 inhibitor, ATN-161, is beneficial in a mouse model of ischemic stroke through reduction of infarct volume, edema, stabilization of the BBB, and reduced inflammation and immune cell infiltration into the brain. In continuation with our previous findings, we have further evaluated the mechanistic role of ATN-161 in vitro and found that oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial depolarization, and fibrosis attenuate tight junction integrity via induction of 5, NLRP3, p-FAK, and p-AKT signaling in mouse brain endothelial cells. ATN-161 treatment (10 M) effectively inhibited OGD/R-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by reducing integrin 5, MMP-9, and fibronectin expression, as well as reducing oxidative stress by reducing mitochondrial superoxide radicals, intracellular ROS, inflammation by reducing NLRP3 inflammasome, tight junction loss by reducing claudin-5 and ZO-1 expression levels, mitochondrial damage by inhibiting mitochondrial depolarization, and apoptosis via regulation of p-FAK and p-AKT levels.

It is called COVID-19 because it was caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) in 2019. A total of 1.9 M deaths and 87.9 M cases have been reported all over the world where 49M cases have recovered so far. Scientists are working hard to find chemotherapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have been observed in a combination of several hazardous stresses, making them more resistant and beneficial. So to break down the viral system, the disease targets are examined. OBJECTIVE: In today's review, a comprehensive study of spike protein explains the main purpose of the novel coronavirus and how to prevent the spread of the disease virus, cross-transmission from infected to a healthy person. METHOD: Covid-19 has already been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to global death and wide illness. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. However, the intermediate host of the novel coronavirus is not clear. To explore the mechanisms of disease, one of the viral targets, such as the spike protein that binds to human cells and causes the disease and its genetic structure, is considered with potential inhibitors. RESULTS: It has been shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS- CoV-2 spike and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor interact and further replication of coronavirus spike protein causes its invasion in the host cell. The human Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, Locus E (LY6E) inhibits the entry of CoV into host cells by interfering with the human gene, spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Some natural formulations have also been shown to prevent spike protein from binding to the host cell. CONCLUSION: With the development of the LY6E gene activator that can inhibit spike protein-ACE2-mediated membrane fusion, new opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 treatment may emerge. Existing antiviral fusion inhibitors and natural compounds targeting spike resistance can serve as a template for further SARS-CoV-2 drug formulation.","output":"Exploring Spike Protein as Potential Target of Novel Coronavirus and to Inhibit the Viability utilizing Natural Agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sporotrichosis is a chronic subcutaneous mycosis caused by Sporothrix species, of which the main aetiological agents are S. brasiliensis, S. schenckii, and S. globosa. Infection occurs after a traumatic inoculation of Sporothrix propagules in mammals' skin and can follow either a classic route through traumatic inoculation by plant debris (e.g., S. schenckii and S. globosa) or an alternative route through zoonotic transmission from animals (e.g., S. brasiliensis). Epizootics followed by a zoonotic route occur in Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro as the epicenter of a recent cat-transmitted epidemic. DNA-based markers are needed to explore the epidemiology of these Sporothrix expansions using molecular methods. This paper reports the use of amplified-fragment-length polymorphisms (AFLP) to assess the degree of intraspecific variability among Sporothrix species. We used whole-genome sequences from Sporothrix species to generate 2,304 virtual AFLP fingerprints. In silico screening highlighted 6 primer pair combinations to be tested in vitro. The protocol was used to genotype 27 medically relevant Sporothrix. Based on the overall scored AFLP markers (97-137 fragments), the values of polymorphism information content (PIC = 0.2552-0.3113), marker index (MI = 0.002-0.0039), effective multiplex ratio (E = 17.8519-35.2222), resolving power (Rp = 33.6296-63.1852), discriminating power (D = 0.9291-0.9662), expected heterozygosity (H = 0.3003-0.3857), and mean heterozygosity (Havp = 0.0001) demonstrated the utility of these primer combinations for discriminating Sporothrix. AFLP markers revealed cryptic diversity in species previously thought to be the most prevalent clonal type, such as S. brasiliensis, responsible for cat-transmitted sporotrichosis, and S. globosa responsible for large sapronosis outbreaks in Asia. Three combinations (#3 EcoRI-FAM-GA/MseI-TT, #5 EcoRI-FAM-GA/MseI-AG, and #6 EcoRI-FAM-TA/MseI-AA) provide the best diversity indices and lowest error rates. These methods make it easier to track routes of disease transmission during epizooties and zoonosis, and our DNA fingerprint assay can be further transferred between laboratories to give insights into the ecology and evolution of pathogenic Sporothrix species and to inform management and mitigation strategies to tackle the advance of sporotrichosis.","output":"Genome-wide mapping using new AFLP markers to explore intraspecific variation among pathogenic Sporothrix species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As language pedagogy evolves and the pressure to articulate the value of the humanities in undergraduate education mounts, new curricular models are needed more than ever.

However, the immune responses that underlie stem cell therapy have not been well reported, particularly, in patients associated with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: On Days 0 and 4, an intravenous infusion of 2  10(7) placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (pcMSCs) (MatriPlax) were administered to five severe COVID-19 patients refractory to current standard therapies. Peripheral blood inflammatory markers and immune profiles were determined by multi-parameter flow cytometry and studied at Days 0, 4, and 8. Clinical outcomes were also observed. RESULTS: None of the pc-MSC treated patients experienced 28-day mortality compared with the control group and showed a significant improvement in the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, Murrays lung injury scores, reduction in serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The cytokine profiles also showed a reduction in IL-1, IFN-, IL-2, and IL-6, and an increase in IL-13 and IL-5 type 2 cytokines within 7 days of therapy. Lymphopenia was also significantly improved after 7 days of treatment. Immune cell profiles showed an increase in the proportions of CD4(+) T cells (namely, CD4(+) na?ve T cells and CD4(+) memory T cell subtypes), Treg cells, CD19(+) B cells (namely, CD19(+) na?ve B cells, CD27(+) switched B cell subtypes) and dendritic cells, and a significant decrease in the proportion of CD14(+) monocytes (namely, CD16(-) classical and CD16(+) non-classical subtypes), and plasma/plasmablast cells.

Interfering with this event represents an attractive avenue for the development of therapeutics and vaccine development. Here, a hybrid approach of ligand- and structure-based virtual screening techniques were employed to disclose similar analogues of a reported antiviral phytochemical, glycyrrhizin, targeting the blockade of ACE2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike. A ligand-based similarity search using a stringent cut-off revealed 40 FDA-approved compounds in DrugBank. These filtered hits were screened against ACE2 using a blind docking approach to determine the natural binding tendency of the compounds with ACE2. Three compounds, deslanoside, digitoxin, and digoxin, were reported to show strong binding with ACE2. These compounds bind at the H1-H2 binding pocket, in a manner similar to that of glycyrrhizin which was used as a control. To achieve consistency in the docking results, docking calculations were performed via two sets of docking software that predicted binding energy as ACE2-Deslanoside (AutoDock, -10.3 kcal/mol and DockThor, -9.53 kcal/mol), ACE2-Digitoxin (AutoDock, -10.6 kcal/mol and DockThor, -8.84 kcal/mol), and ACE2-Digoxin (AutoDock, -10.6 kcal/mol and DockThor, -8.81 kcal/mol). The docking results were validated by running molecular simulations in aqueous solution that demonstrated the stability of ACE2 with no major conformational changes in the ligand original binding mode (~ 2 ? average RMSD). Binding interactions remained quite stable with an increased potential for getting stronger as the simulation proceeded. MMGB/PBSA binding free energies were also estimated and these supported the high stability of the complexes compared to the control (~ -50 kcal/mol net MMGB/PBSA binding energy versus ~ -30 kcal/mol).

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in a non-intensive care unit (ICU) ward in Jinyintan Hospital from 2 February 2020 to 20 March 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal swab specimens. The confirmed patients were divided into the umifenovir group and the control group according to the use of umifenovir. The main outcomes were the rate of negative pharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 within 1 week after admission and the time for the virus to turn negative. The negativity time of SARS-CoV-2 was defined as the first day of a negative test if the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 was negative for two consecutive tests. RESULTS: A total of 81 COVID-19 patients were included, with 45 in the umifenovir group and 36 in the control group. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Thirty-three out of 45 (73%) patients in the umifenovir group tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days after admission, the number was 28/36 (78%) in the control group (p 0.19). The median time from onset of symptoms to SARS-CoV-2 turning negative was 18 days (interquartile range (IQR) 12-21) in the umifenovir group and 16 days (IQR 11-21) in the control group (p 0.42). Patients in the umifenovir group had a longer hospital stay than patients in the control group (13 days (IQR 9-17) vs 11 days (IQR 9-14), p 0.04).

The genetic background represents a factor that predisposes the way the host responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this sense, genetic variants of ACE and ACE2 could explain the observed interindividual variability to COVID-19 outcomes. In order to improve the understanding of how genetic variants of ACE and ACE2 are involved in the severity of COVID-19, we included a total of 481 individuals who showed clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and were diagnosed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and saliva samples. ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism was evaluated by the high-resolution melting method; ACE single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs4344) and ACE2 SNPs (rs2285666 and rs2074192) were genotyped using TaqMan probes. We assessed the association of ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms with disease severity using logistic regression analysis adjusted by age, sex, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. The severity of the illness in our study population was divided as 31% mild, 26% severe, and 43% critical illness; additionally, 18% of individuals died, of whom 54% were male. Our results showed in the codominant model a contribution of ACE2 gene rs2285666 T/T genotype to critical outcome [odds ratio (OR) = 1.83; 95%CI = 1.01C3.29; p = 0.04] and to require oxygen supplementation (OR = 1.76; 95%CI = 1.01C3.04; p = 0.04), in addition to a strong association of the T allele of this variant to develop critical illness in male individuals (OR = 1.81; 95%CI = 1.10C2.98; p = 0.02).

However, when and whether LSD can be considered is subject to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the recovery rate, and the case-fatality rate. It is imperative to provide real-time assessment of three factors to guide LSD. OBJECTIVE: A simple LSD index was developed for health decision makers to do real-time assessment of COVID-19 at the global, country, region, and community level. METHODS: Data on the retrospective cohort of 186 countries with three factors were retrieved from a publicly available repository from January to early July. A simple index for guiding LSD was measured by the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and recoveries, and the case-fatality rate was envisaged. If the LSD index was less than 1, LSD can be considered. The dynamic changes of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated to assess whether and when health decision makers allowed for LSD and when to reimplement social distancing after resurgences of the epidemic. RESULTS: After large-scale outbreaks in a few countries before mid-March (prepandemic phase), the global weekly LSD index peaked at 4.27 in March and lasted until mid-June (pandemic phase), during which most countries were affected and needed to take various social distancing measures. Since, the value of LSD has gradually declined to 0.99 on July 5 (postpandemic phase), at which 64.7% (120/186) of countries and regions had an LSD<1 with the decile between 0 and 1 to refine risk stratification by countries. The LSD index decreased to 1 in about 115 days. In addition, we present the results of dynamic changes of the LSD index for the world and for each country and region with different time windows from January to July 5. The results of the LSD index on the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic in certain regions and validation by other emerging infectious diseases are presented.

Key epidemiological parameters, temporal trend of viral loads and secondary attack rates were estimated and compared between the Delta variant and the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also evaluated the association of vaccination with viral load and transmission. Results: We identified 167 patients infected with the Delta variant in the Guangdong outbreak. The mean estimates of the latent period and the incubation period were 4.0 days and 5.8 days, respectively. A relatively higher viral load was observed in Delta cases than in wild-type infections.

PARTICIPANTS: Data on total hospital admissions between March 2018 and June 2020, all active cancer diagnoses between March 2019 and June 2020 and clinical parameters of COVID-19-positive admissions between March 2020 and June 2020 were collected. 526 COVID-19 admissions without an active cancer diagnosis were compared with 87 COVID-19 admissions with an active cancer diagnosis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: 30-day and 90-day post-COVID-19 survival. RESULTS: In total, 613 patients were enrolled with male to female ratio of 1:6 and median age of 77 years. The estimated infection rate of COVID-19 was 87 of 22 729 (0.4%) in the patients with cancer and 526 of 404 379 (0.1%) in the population without cancer (OR of being hospitalised with COVID-19 if having cancer is 2.942671 (95% CI: 2.344522 to 3.693425); p<0.001). Survival was reduced in patients with cancer with COVID-19 at 90 days. R-Studio software determined the association between cancer status, COVID-19 and 90-day survival against variables using MLA. Multivariate analysis showed increases in age (OR 1.039 (95% CI: 1.020 to 1.057), p<0.001), urea (OR 1.005 (95% CI: 1.002 to 1.007), p<0.001) and C reactive protein (CRP) (OR 1.065 (95% CI: 1.016 to 1.116), p<0.008) are associated with greater 30-day and 90-day mortality. The MLA model examined the contribution of predictive variables for 90-day survival (area under the curve: 0.749); with transplant patients, age, male gender and diabetes mellitus being predictors of greater mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Active cancer diagnosis has a threefold increase in risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19. Increased age, urea and CRP predict mortality in patients with cancer.

Utilization differed based on patient age, race/ethnicity, and rurality. Patients and providers perceived value in using telehealth, yet had limited experience with this modality pre-pandemic. Providers preferred in-person appointments for initial encounters and telehealth for follow-up visits. Providers and patients identified benefits and challenges of telehealth delivery, often relying on multiple delivery methods for telehealth to enhance patient engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of telehealth delivery of headache-related care rapidly expanded in response to the pandemic. Patients and providers were amenable to utilizing telehealth, yet also experienced technological barriers. To encourage equitable access to telehealth and direct resources to those in need, it is crucial to understand patient preferences regarding in-person versus telehealth visits and identify patient groups who face barriers to access.","output":"Telehealth perceptions and utilization for the delivery of headache care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims To describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults with T1D or T2D in the U.S..

Objectives We aim to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community sample of asymptomatic individuals and among symptomatic patients (without confirmed diagnosis) followed in a primary care setting. As a secondary objective, we estimated the proportions of symptomatic patients seeing at an emergency department (ED), hospitalized or dying, and identified the most important clinical symptoms associated with a positive infection. Methods From April 21 to April 24 2020, we selected a random sample of 600 individuals stratified by age groups, from a total population of 19,899 individuals from a community area in Barcelona (study population 1). From April 29 to May 5 2020, we also invited all the patients that had been followed by general practitioners (GPs) (study population 2). We used for both populations COVID-19 Rapid lateral flow immunoassay which qualitatively assesses the presence of patient-generated IgG and IgM in approximately 10-15 minutes. The prevalence (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of infection (past and current) was defined as the proportion of individuals with antibody seropositivity. Odds ratios (ORs) for a positive test result were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results Three hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals from the randomly selected sample accepted to participate in the study. The overall mean age was 43.7 years (SD 21.79, range 1-94) and 55% were women. Seventeen individuals were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG, resulting an overall prevalence of 5,47% (95% CI, 3.44-8.58). Six-hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed by GPs. The overall mean age was 46.97 years (SD 20.05, range 0-92) and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG. During the follow-up period, 27.13% of symptomatic patients attended the ED, 11.83% were hospitalized and about 2% died. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the OR for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who had fever (>38{degrees}C), ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusions The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals in the general population was lower than expected. Approximately 40% of the symptomatic patients followed by GPs during the peak months of the pandemic in Barcelona, were positive.

PURPOSE: The current research asks: How well does the public's perception of such policies align with actual policies, and how well do actual versus perceived policies predict the public's mask-wearing and social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: We conducted a preregistered cross-sectional study among 1,073 online participants who were representative of the U.S. population on age, gender, and education on Monday-Tuesday, July 20-21, 2020. We asked participants which locations they visited in the past weekend, and their mask-wearing and social distancing behaviors at each location. We also measured participants' beliefs about their state's policies on mask mandate and business opening and obtained objective measures of these policies from publicly available data. RESULTS: Perception about the existence of mask mandate was 91% accurate in states with a mask mandate but only 46% accurate in states without one. Perception of state reopening level did not correlate with policy. It was the perceived but not actual state mask mandate that positively predicted both mask-wearing and social distancing, controlling for state COVID-19 cases, demographic factors, and participants' numeracy and COVID-19 history. CONCLUSIONS: The public's perception of state-level mask mandates erred on the side of assuming there is one. Perception of reopening is almost completely inaccurate.

In this study, ambient VOCs were monitored online at an urban site in Guangzhou in the Pearl River Delta region before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. The average total mixing ratios of VOCs became 19.1% lower during the lockdown than before, and those of alkanes, alkenes and aromatics decreased by 19.0%, 24.8% and 38.2%, respectively. The levels of light alkanes (C < 6) decreased by only 13.0%, while those of higher alkanes (C  6) decreased by 67.8% during the lockdown. Disappeared peak VOC levels in morning rush hours and the drop in toluene to benzene ratios during the lockdown suggested significant reductions in vehicle exhaust and industrial solvent emissions. Source apportioning by positive matrix factorization model revealed that reductions in industrial emissions, diesel exhaust (on-road diesel vehicles and off-road diesel engines) and gasoline-related emissions could account for 48.9%, 42.2% and 8.8%, respectively, of the decreased VOC levels during the lockdown. Moreover, the reduction in industrial emissions could explain 56.0% and 70.0% of the reductions in ambient levels of reactive alkenes and aromatics, respectively. An average increase in O3C1 h by 17% and a decrease in the daily maximum 8-h average ozone by 11% under an average decrease in NOx by 57.0% and a decrease in VOCs by 19.1% during the lockdown demonstrated that controlling emissions of precursors VOCs and NOx to prevent ambient O3 pollution in megacities such as Guangzhou remains a highly challenging task.","output":"Decrease in ambient volatile organic compounds during the COVID-19 lockdown period in the Pearl River Delta region, south China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The variation in experiences between high and low-socioeconomic status contexts are posited to play a crucial role in shaping the developing brain and may explain differences in child outcomes.

It uses both descriptive statistics and multilevel modelling using General Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to examine the relationship between household food security and 16 different shocks experienced in the six months prior to the administration of the survey. The findings showed that only 29% of surveyed households were completely food secure. Of those experiencing some level of food insecurity, more experienced economic (55%) than sociopolitical (16%) and biophysical (10%) shocks. Economic shocks such as food price increases, loss of employment, and reduced income were all associated with increased food insecurity. Coupled with the lack of functioning social safety nets in Nairobi, households experiencing shocks and emergencies experience serious food insecurity and related health effects. In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a major negative economic impact on many vulnerable urban households.

A survey was conducted to evaluate the perceptions among the general patient population with asthma and/or eczema regarding disease and treatment burden and barriers to adequate care. METHODS: An online survey was completed by market research panelists in the USA between March 24, 2020 and April 6, 2020. Eligible participants were at least 18 years of age and endorsed a diagnosis of asthma and/or eczema. Survey responses are described for all participants, by designated racial/ethnic groups, and by income level. RESULTS: In all, 841 participants completed the survey (asthma, n = 554; eczema, n = 398; both, n = 111; White, n = 421; Black, n = 252; Hispanic, n = 95; low income [less than $15,000/year], n = 99; higher income [at least $15,000/year], n = 713). More Black and Hispanic participants than White participants, and more participants with low income than higher income, endorsed health literacy as a barrier (e.g., filling out official documents, understanding written materials). Participants with low income were less likely than participants with higher income to have an asthma action plan (42% vs 53%, respectively) and to discuss asthma control with their healthcare provider (54% vs 69%). Black and Hispanic participants were more likely than White participants to have an emergency department visit (52% and 49% vs 31%, respectively) or hospitalization (31% and 39% vs 16%) for asthma within the last 12 months. Participants reporting low income indicated that they experienced eczema symptoms more frequently than participants with higher income; 35% of low-income participants vs 15% of higher-income participants reported that they had not tried any eczema treatments. Participants in all racial/ethnic and income-level groups reported that their asthma or eczema impacted their lifestyle and daily activities.

DESIGN: We utilized Strauss grounded theory to develop an expanded model of social disruption due to biological events based on retrospective and prospective case studies. We then applied this model to the temporal domain and propose a heuristic staging model, the WilsonCCollmann Scale for assessing biological event evolution. MEASUREMENTS: We retrospectively and manually examined hard copy archival local media reports in the native vernacular for three biological events associated with substantial social disruption. The model was then tested prospectively through media harvesting based on keywords corresponding to the model parameters. RESULTS: Our heuristic staging model provides valuable information about the features of a biological event that can be used to determine the level of concern warranted, such as whether the pathogen in question is responding to established public health disease control measures, including the use of antimicrobials or vaccines; whether the public health and medical infrastructure of the country involved is adequate to mount the necessary response; whether the countrys officials are providing an appropriate level of information to international public health authorities; and whether the event poses a international threat. The approach is applicable for monitoring open-source (public-domain) media for indications and warnings of such events, and specifically for markers of the social disruption that commonly occur as these events unfold. These indications and warnings can then be used as the basis for staging the biological threat in the same manner that the United States National Weather Service currently uses storm warning models (such as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) to detect and assess threatening weather conditions.

The expression of IARS2 was measured by real time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction and western blot analysis. Cell counting, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and colony formation assay were conducted to assess the effect of IARS2 on melanoma cell proliferation.

However, the underlying mechanism between optimism, autonomy and work engagement has not been explored. AIMS: To examine whether optimism has a positive impact on work engagement via autonomy among physicians fighting COVID-19 in China. METHODS: This study was conducted among physicians in March 2020. A convenience sample was used to recruit physicians from the Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. One hundred and four Chinese physicians working in the COVID-19 epidemic completed a survey measuring levels of autonomy, optimism and work engagement. The PROCESS macro (model 4) was used to test hypotheses about mediation. RESULTS: This current study found that optimism was related to increased autonomy, and autonomy was related to increased work engagement. The results of the bias-corrected bootstrap method suggested the indirect effect of optimism on work engagement via autonomy (Effect = 0.16, SE = 0.08, lower level confidence interval = 0.04, upper level confidence interval = 0.37), indicating a mediated relationship, in which autonomy is one mechanism to explain the link between optimism and increased work engagement.

Nsp1 interacts with host proteins that facilitate nsp1 to block host protein synthesis by cellular protein translation factors. Nsp1 also triggers the degradation of host messenger RNA (mRNA) while keeping the viral RNA intact. During viral infection, stalled host mRNAs accumulate in non-membranous vesicles, known as stress granules (SGs). This allows mRNAs to be protected until stress ceases. Recently, our lab observed that nsp1 interacts with proteins of, and accumulates in, the SGs as well. We found SGs are smaller in size in the presence of nsp1. We aimed to determine the role of nsp1 within these granules. Given the role of nsp1 in degrading mRNAs, we suspected that this viral protein may modify the composition of SGs to prevent it from protecting host mRNAs. To identify any compositional changes by nsp1, we successfully adapted and optimized SG isolation methods in nsp1-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. We then further isolated the RNA following standard protocols for RNA-seq analysis. Using immunoblot, we analyzed the proteins present in SGs isolated from cells in the presence and absence of nsp1. We were able to further isolate and identify these proteins using immunoblot and found that SG core protein, Ras-GTPase activating protein (SH3 domain)-binding protein 1 or G3BP1, decreases overtime in the presence of nsp1.

Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) can identify early changes in RV systolic function and be quantified as systolic strain. We measured the feasibility of RV global longitudinal systolic strain (RV GLS) in respiratory failure patients and its association with clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Two tertiary hospital medical ICUs in Providence, RI, from March 2015 to January 2018. PATIENTS: Two hundred twenty-three patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) with available echocardiograms. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data were extracted from medical records. RV GLS was measured via STE (TOMTEC, Chicago, IL), along with standard echocardiographic measurements by two independent readers blinded to outcomes. The average age was 65 years (range, 21C90 yr), 121 (54%) were men, and the most common etiology of respiratory failure was pneumonia (n = 83, 37%). The average RV GLS was C16% (sd  7). The intraobserver correlation coefficients were 0.78 and 0.94, whereas the interobserver correlation coefficient was 0.61 for RV GLS. In the majority of echocardiograms (n = 178, 80%), all wall segments were tracked appropriately by operator visual inspection. Worse RV GLS was associated with greater hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00C1.07; p = 0.03), such that every 1% decrement in RV GLS was associated with up to a 7% increase in the risk of death. RV GLS was 90% sensitive for the detection of RV dysfunction compared with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of RV GLS by STE in subjects on MV is feasible, reproducible, and sensitive for the detection of RV dysfunction.

Baseline clinical characteristics were compared between patients with stable mild illness (stable mild group) and those who deteriorated from mild to severe illness (progression group). RESULTS: From Jan 17, 2020, to Feb 1, 2020, 85 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 16 in the progression group and 69 in the stable mild group. Compared to stable mild group (n = 69), patients in the progression group (n = 16) were more likely to be older, male, presented with dyspnea, with hypertension, and with higher levels of lactase dehydrogenase and c-reactive protein. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, advanced age (odds ratio [OR], 1.012; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.020C1.166; P = 0.011) and the higher level of lactase dehydrogenase (OR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.001C1.024; P = 0.038) were independently associated with exacerbation in mild COVID-19 patients.

Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended as a core intervention in the management of people with chronic respiratory diseases. However, the intervention remains poorly accessed/utilised globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries. AIM: This qualitative study explored barriers and enablers to pulmonary rehabilitation in low- and middle-income countries from the perspective of healthcare professionals with pulmonary rehabilitation experience in these settings. METHODS: Online-based semi-structured in-depth interviews with healthcare professionals were undertaken to data saturation, exploring lived barriers and enablers to pulmonary rehabilitation in their low- or middle-income country. Anonymised interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of seven healthcare professionals from seven low- and middle-income countries representing Africa, Asia, and South America were interviewed. They included five physiotherapists (four females), one family physician (male), and one pulmonologist (female). Themes for barriers to pulmonary rehabilitation included limited resources, low awareness, coronavirus disease 2019, and patient access-related costs. Themes for enablers included local adaptation, motivated patients, coronavirus disease 2019 (which spanned both enablers and barriers), better awareness/recognition, provision of PR training, and resource support. CONCLUSION: Barriers to pulmonary rehabilitation in low- and middle-income countries include limited resources, low awareness, coronavirus disease 2019, and patient access-related costs. Enablers include local adaptation, motivated patients, coronavirus disease 2019 (which spanned both enablers and barriers), better awareness/recognition, provision of PR training, and resource support. Successful implementation of these enablers will require engagement with multiple stakeholders.

SA has implemented a 5-stage Risk-Adjusted Strategy which includes a phased national lockdown, requiring social distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing face masks. Strict adherence to this strategy is crucial to reducing COVID-19 transmission, flattening the curve, and preventing resurgence. As part of the 22-country International Citizens Project COVID-19 (ICPcovid), this study aimed to describe the SA adherence to the Risk-Adjusted Strategy and identify determinants of adherence. METHOD: During 24 April-15 May 2020, people were electronically invited, through social media platforms and a text blast, to complete an online survey, accessible via www.icpcovid.com. The survey investigated COVID-19 testing and preventative adherence measures, then used logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of adherence. RESULTS: There were 951 participants, with 731(76.9%) 25 to 54 years. Most (672;70.7%) were female, and 705(74.1%) had a university degree. Since the epidemic started, 529(55.6%) and 436(45.9%) participants stated they were eating healthier and taking more vitamins, respectively. Only 82(8.6%) had been COVID-19 tested, and 1(1.2%) tested positive. In public, 905(95.2%) socially distanced, however 99(10.4%) participants had recently attended meetings with over ten people. Regular hand washing was practiced by 907(95.4%) participants, 774(81.4%) wore face masks and 854(89.8%) stayed home when they experienced flu-like symptoms. The odds of adhering to the guidelines were lower among men versus women (AOR 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.528, 0.971) and those who had flu-like symptoms (AOR 0.42, 95% CI = 0.277, 0.628). In contrast, increased odds were reported for those who reported increased vitamin intake (AOR 1.37, 95% CI = 1.044,1.798), and were either cohabiting or married (AOR 1.39, 95% CI = 1.042,1.847). CONCLUSION: Despite high reported adherence, face mask use and symptomatic individuals not self-isolating, were areas for improvement. However, these factors cannot solely account for SA's increasing COVID-19 cases. Larger general population studies are needed to identify other adherence predictors for a strengthened SA COVID-19 response.

We investigated the impact of the pandemic on the use of remote consultation and on the prescribing of psychiatric medications. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Clinical Record Interactive Search tool was used to examine deidentified electronic health records of people receiving mental healthcare from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust. Data from the period before and after the onset of the pandemic were analysed using linear regression, and visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. PARTICIPANTS: All patients receiving care from SLaM between 7 January 2019 and 20 September 2020 (around 37 500 patients per week). OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) The number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals per week.(ii) Prescribing of antipsychotic and mood stabiliser medications per week. RESULTS: Following the onset of the pandemic, the frequency of in-person contacts was significantly reduced compared with that in the previous year (? coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p<0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts significantly increased (? coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p<0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite this change in the type of patient contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in psychiatric prescribing.

Morbidity patterns of COVID-19 variants have a strong association with age, while restrictive lockdown measures have association with negative mental health outcomes in some age groups. Reduced economic prospects may also afflict some age cohorts more than others. Motivated by this, we propose a model to describe COVID-19 community spread incorporating the role of age-specific social interactions. Through a flexible parameterisation of an age-structured deterministic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed (SEIR) model, we provide a means for characterising different forms of lockdown which may impact specific age groups differently. Social interactions are represented through age group to age group contact matrices, which can be trained using available data and are thus locally adapted.

There are also justifiable concerns about the scarcity of health-equity actions oriented analyses of the situation and calls for more empirical evidence on COVID-19 and health inequalities. A preliminary condition to establish this type of information is strong capacity to conduct health inequalities research. Worldwide, however, this type of capacity is limited, which, alongside other challenges, will likely hinder capacities of many countries to develop comprehensive equity-oriented COVID-19 analyses, and adequate responses to present and future crises. The current pandemic reinforces the pending need to invest in and strengthen these research capacities. These capacities must be supported by widespread recognition and concern, cognitive social capital, and greater commitment to coordinated, transparent action, and responsibility.

However, the relationship between comorbidities and the prognosis of elderly patients with COVID-19 was not clear. This study was supposed to describe the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with COVID-19 infection from Sichuan province and the effects of comorbidity. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 patients from Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu between December 16, 2019 and February 26, 2020 were included in this study. Patients were divided into elderly group (&#8805;60 years old) and non-elderly group (< 60 years old). RESULTS: Elderly patients with COVID-19 indicated relatively higher proportion of comorbidities, and the most common were atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (56.5%), hypertension (43.5%) and chronic pulmonary disease (21.7%). The proportion of severe cases was higher in elderly group than that in non-elderly group (73.9% and 42.2%, respectively, P=0.012). During hospitalization, elderly patients indicated relatively higher proportion of complications, such as shock (21.7%), respiratory failure (21.7%). The proportion of patients with a decreased number of CD8+ lymphocytes (82.6%) and B lymphocytes (77.8%) in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in non-elderly group (48.9% and 44.8%, respectively). All 3 deaths were elderly patients with comorbidities and the cell counts of T lymphocyte subsets, B and NK cells of them were significantly decreased at admission. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with COVID-19 had a high proportion of severe cases and comorbidities, more likely to show low immune function, and indicate higher proportion of complications.","output":"Effects of Comorbidities on the Elderly Patients with COVID-19: Clinical Characteristics of Elderly Patients Infected with COVID-19 from Sichuan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Diabetes Stakeholders Covid-19 Response Group was formed in early April 2020 as a rapid action by the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care, Diabetes UK, the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists, and Diabetes Frail to address and support the special needs of residents with diabetes in UK care homes during Covid-19.

Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (>37.3), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage  2/rectal cancer T stage  3/unresectable colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP.

Yet the function of FliI6-FliJ complex, a homolog of the F1 ATPase motor, within the flagellar export apparatus remains unclear. We use a simple two-state model adapted from studies of linear molecular motors to identify key features of this motor. The two states are the 'locked' ground state where the FliJ coiled coil filament experiences angular fluctuations in an asymmetric torsional potential, and a 'free' excited state in which FliJ undergoes rotational diffusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to treat transitions between these two states, and obtain the average angular velocity of the unloaded FliJ filament within the FliI6 stator: &#969;max &#8776; 9.0 rps. The motor was then studied under external counter torque conditions in order to ascertain its maximal power output: Pmax &#8776; 42 kBT/s (or 102 kW/mol), and the stall torque: Gstall &#8776; 3 kBT/rad (or 0.01 nNnm/rad). Two modes of action within the flagellar export apparatus are proposed, in which the motor performs useful work either by continuously 'grinding' through the resistive environment of the export gate, or by exerting equal and opposite stall force on it. In both cases, the resistance is provided by flagellin subunits entering the flagellar export channel prior to their unfolding. We therefore propose that the function of the FliI6-FliJ complex is to lower the energy barrier, and therefore assist in unfolding of the flagellar proteins before feeding them into the transport channel.","output":"FliI6-FliJ molecular motor assists with unfolding in the type III secretion export apparatus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is an international public health crisis with more than 132 million infections worldwide. Beyond acute infection, emerging data indicate patients diagnosed with COVID-19 may experience persistent sequelae similar to survivors of sepsis or acute respiratory syndromes, including mobility limitations and fatigue. However, there is limited evidence on the trajectory of functional recovery in those hospitalised with COVID-19. The primary aim of the Coronavirus Registry Functional Recovery (COREG-FR) study is to understand the trajectory of functional recovery among individuals hospitalised for COVID-19 over the medium (up to 6 months) and longer term (6C12 months) that will guide clinical care and optimal management of serious COVID-19 illness and recovery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: COREG-FR is a multicentre longitudinal cohort study. We will enrol a minimum of 211 adults age 18 years and older with COVID-19 from five hospitals. Participants will be followed from admission to hospital as an inpatient, to hospital discharge, and at 3-month, 6-month, 9-month and up to 12-month post-hospital discharge. We will conduct telephone interviews at ward admission and discharge, and telephone interviews plus in-person assessments of physical function and lung function at all remaining follow-ups. Our primary outcome is the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care mobility scale measured at all time points. We will conduct linear mixed effects regression analyses to explore determinants of functional outcomes after COVID-19 illness. Subgroup analyses based on age (65 vs >65 years), frailty status (Clinical Frailty Scale score 4 vs >5) and variants of concern will be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: COREG-FR has been approved by Research Ethics Boards at participating sites. We will disseminate this work through peer-reviewed manuscripts, presentations at national and international meetings and through the established COREG website (www.coregontario.ca). COREG-FR is designed as a data platform for future studies evaluating COVID-19 recovery.

Food supply chains may have to become more efficient to meet the increasing food requirement of 10 Billion people by 2050. At the same time, food and nutrition security are at risk from increasingly likely shocks like extreme climate events, market shocks, pandemics, changing consumer preferences, and price volatility. Here we consider some possibilities and limitations regarding the improvement of resilience (the capacity to deal with shocks) and efficiency (here interpreted as the share of produced food delivered to consumers) of food supply chains. We employ an Agent Based Model of a generic food chain network consisting of stylized individuals representing producers, traders, and consumers. We do this: 1/ to describe the dynamically changing disaggregated flows of crop items between these agents, and 2/ to be able to explicitly consider agent behaviour. The agents have implicit personal objectives for trading. We quantify resilience and efficiency by linking these to the fraction of fulfilment of the overall explicit objective to have all consumers meet their food requirement. We consider different types of network structures in combination with different agent interaction types under different types of stylized shocks. We find that generally the network structures with higher efficiency are also more sensitive to shocks, while less efficient network types display more resilience. At first glance these results seem to confirm the existence of a system-level trade-off between resilience and efficiency similar to what is reported in business management and ecology literature. However, the results are modified by the trading interactions and the type of shock. In our simulations resilience and efficiency are affected by soft boundaries caused by the preference and trust of agents (i.e., social aspects) in trading. The ability of agents to switch between trading partners represents an important aspect of resilience, namely a capacity to reorganize. These insights may be relevant when considering the reorganization of real-life food chains to increase their resilience to meet future food and nutrition security goals.","output":"An agent based model representation to assess resilience and efficiency of food supply chains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children are not indifferent to the significant psychological impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Abstract Introduction: During the state of alarm established in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the face-to-face outpatient consultations were cancelled and a telephone consultation was established to follow up coloproctological patients. The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. Results: From March 19th to April 17th, 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation. The reasons for reprogramming are analyzed in the study. Conclusion: In the context of a pandemic, teleconsultation has allowed 61% of follow-up visits to be definitively solved, avoiding the reprogramming of 116 patients.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to show protecting the children from radiation as much as possible while guiding the diagnosis. METHODS: Between March and June 2020, 148 pediatric patients examined who underwent CT due to suspicion of COVID-19. Fifty patients of 148 with normal thorax CT and negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 98 patients were evaluated retrospectively by two pediatric radiologists with 15 years of experience. RESULTS: The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were evaluated for 52 RT-PCR-positive patients. CT finding of 23 RT-PCR positive and 12 negative patients was classified. According to our study, unilateral (61C67%), multifocal (50C52%), and peripheral (83C91%) involvement were higher in all groups. Lower lobe involvement was frequently detected (58C65%). The most frequently detected parenchymal lesion was ground-glass opacity followed by consolidated areas accompanying ground-grass opacities.

While ileum and colon both were equally involved bowel segments (32.07% each), SMA (24.9%), SMV (14.3%), and the spleen (12.5%) were the most commonly involved artery, vein, and solid organ, respectively. 50% of the patients receiving conservative/medical management died, highlighting high mortality without surgery. Findings on laparotomy and histopathology corroborated strikingly with CT imaging findings. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients with AMI, small bowel ischemia is the most prevalent imaging diagnosis and NOMI is the most common pattern of bowel involvement. Contrast-enhanced CT is a powerful decision-making tool for prompt diagnosis of AMI in COVID-19, thereby potentially improving time to treat as well as clinical outcomes.

Under this scenario, the combination of two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, has attracted attention since they have been previously employed against the SARS-CoV main proteinase (Mpro) and exhibited some signs of effectiveness. Recently, the 3D structure of SARS-CoV2 Mpro was constructed based on the monomeric SARS-CoV Mpro and employed to identify potential approved small inhibitors against SARS-CoV2 Mpro, allowing the selection of 15 drugs among 1903 approved drugs to be employed. In this study, we performed docking of these 15 approved drugs against the recently solved X-ray crystallography structure of SARS-CoV2 Mpro in the monomeric and dimeric states; the latter is the functional state that was determined in a biological context, and these were submitted to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) approach to obtain insight into the inhibitory activity of these compounds. Similar studies were performed with lopinavir and ritonavir coupled to monomeric and dimeric SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV2 Mpro to compare the inhibitory differences. Our study provides the structural and energetic basis of the inhibitory properties of lopinavir and ritonavir on SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV2 Mpro, allowing us to identify two FDA-approved drugs that can be used against SARS-CoV2 Mpro.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The mortality rate, hospital disorders and incalculable economic and social damages, besides the unproven efficacy of the treatments evaluated against COVID-19, raised the need for immediate control of this disease. Therefore, the current study employed in silico tools to rationally identify new possible SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. That is an enzyme conserved among the coronavirus species; hence, the identification of an Mpro inhibitor is to make it a broad-spectrum drug. Molecular docking studies described the binding sites and the interaction energies of 74 Mpro-ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). A structural similarity screening was carried out in order to identify possible Mpro ligands that show additional pharmacological properties against COVID-19. We identified 59 hit compounds and among them, melatonin stood out due to its prominent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities; it can reduce oxidative stress, defence cell mobility and efficiently combat the cytokine storm and sepsis. In addition, melatonin is an inhibitor of calmodulin, an essential intracellular component to maintain angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on the cell surface. Interestingly, one of the most promising hits in our docking study was melatonin. It revealed better interaction energy with Mpro compared to ligands in complexes from PDB. Consequently, melatonin can have response potential in early stages for its possible effects on ACE-2 and Mpro, although it is also promising in more severe stages of the disease for its action against hyper-inflammation. These results definitely do not confirm antiviral activity, but can rather be used as a basis for further preclinical and clinical trials.","output":"COVID-19: Rational discovery of the therapeutic potential of Melatonin as a SARS-CoV-2 main Protease Inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data from the UK COVID-19 outbreak are emerging, and there are ongoing concerns about a disproportionate effect on ethnic minorities. There is very limited information on COVID-19 in the over-80s, and the rates of hospital-onset infections are unknown. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study from electronic case records of the first 450 patients admitted to our hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 77% of the total inpatient caseload to date. Demographic, clinical and biochemical data were extracted. The primary endpoint was death during the index hospital admission. The characteristics of all patients, those over 80 years of age and those with hospital-onset COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: The median (IQR) age was 72 (56, 83), with 150 (33%) over 80 years old and 60% male. Presenting clinical and biochemical features were consistent with those reported elsewhere. The ethnic breakdown of patients admitted was similar to that of our underlying local population. Inpatient mortality was high at 38%. Patients over 80 presented earlier in their disease course and were significantly less likely to present with the typical features of cough, breathlessness and fever. Cardiac co-morbidity and markers of cardiac dysfunction were more common, but not those of bacterial infection. Mortality was significantly higher in this group (60% vs 28%, p < 0.001). Thirty-one (7%) patients acquired COVID-19 having continuously been in hospital for a median of 20 (14, 36) days. The peak of hospital-onset infections occurred at the same time as the overall peak of admitted infections. Despite being older and more frail than those with community-onset infection, their outcomes were no worse. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient mortality was high, especially among the over-80s, who are more likely to present atypically. The ethnic composition of our caseload was similar to the underlying population. While a significant number of patients acquired COVID-19 while already in hospital, their outcomes were no worse.","output":"COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study with focus on the over-80s and hospital-onset disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is one of the most reported symptoms of COVID -19. Previous studies have identified olfactory training (OT) as an important treatment for postinfectious OD, but little is known about its effect after SARS-CoV-2 infection and how it can be optimized. Objective: To assess whether OT can be optimized if performed intensively, with more fragrances over a shorter period in patients with persistent OD after COVID -19. Also, to determine the presence of other variables related to OD and treatment response in this population. Method: This multicenter randomized clinical trial recruited 80 patients with persistent OD with previous COVID-19 for less than three months. The patients were divided into two groups, who received treatment with 4 and 8 essences over four weeks. Subjective assessments and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) were performed before and after treatment. Results: A significant improvement in olfaction was measured subjectively and on UPSIT in both groups, but without significant differences between groups. In addition, the presence of olfactory fluctuation was associated with higher UPSIT scores. Conclusion: These data suggest that intensifying the training by increasing the number of essences for 4 weeks does not show superiority over the classical method.

Unfortunately, considering the intensification of multiple electron-vibration interactions as temperature increases, luminescence thermal quenching of lanthanide-doped materials is generally considered to be inevitable. Recently, the emergence of thermally enhanced upconversion luminescence in lanthanide-doped nanoparticles seemed to challenge this stereotype, and the research on this topic rapidly aroused wide attention. While considerable efforts have been made to explore the origin of this phenomenon, the key mechanism of luminescence enhancement is still under debate. Here, to sort out the context of this intriguing finding, the reported results on this exciting topic are reviewed, and the corresponding enhancement mechanisms as proposed by different researchers are summarized. Detailed analyses are provided to evaluate the contribution of the most believed \\"surface-attached moisture desorption\\" process on the overall luminescence enhancement of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles at elevated temperatures. The impacts of other surface-related processes and shell passivation on the luminescence behaviour of the lanthanide-doped materials are also elaborated. Lack of standardization in the reported data and the absence of important experimental information, which greatly hinders the cross-checking and reanalysis of the results, is emphasized as well. On the foundation of these discussions, it is realized that the thermal-induced luminescence enhancement is a form of recovery process against the strong luminescence quenching in the system, and the enhancement degree is closely associated with the extent of luminescence loss induced by various quenching effects beforehand.","output":"Thermal enhancement of upconversion emission in nanocrystals: a comprehensive summary."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection of surgical wounds with acid-fast bacilli, including tubercle bacilli, is rare, and is poorly described in the literature.

The average fecal PEDV RNA shedding time was 7.2  1.0 d for the PEDVCBovSDP group and 9.3  1.1 d for the PEDV group with an overall time to clearance of PEDV shedding of 11 d for PEDVCBovSDP pigs and at least 14 d for PEDV pigs, which was not different (P = 0.215). The results indicate that addition of BovSDP induced an earlier anti-PEDV antibody response in pigs experimentally infected with PEDV thereby reducing clinical disease and the amount and duration of viral shedding during acute PEDV infection.","output":"Impact of dietary spray-dried bovine plasma addition on pigs infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to explore parents' perceptions regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their children, with and without disabilities, from psychological, academic and social aspects.

OBJECTIVE : To study how the risk factors for recurrent wheezing and asthma vary by different definitions of bronchiolitis. METHODS : Viral etiology and atopic characteristics were studied in 259 hospitalized wheezing children (median age, 14 months; range, 0-36 months). The data were analyzed according to age (<6, <12, <24 and <36 months) and whether they had a history or no history of a previous wheezing episode. Sixteen viruses were detected by conventional and molecular methods. Atopic characteristics included the presence of eczema, specific and total IgE responses, blood eosinophil count, and modified asthma predictive index. RESULTS : Evidence of respiratory virus infection was found in 93% of the cases and allergic sensitization in 26% of the cases. Rhinovirus infections and atopic characteristics (sensitization, blood eosinophil count, and modified asthma predictive index) increased by age and were significantly more common in children with recurrent wheezing episodes than in first-time wheezers in age categories of <24 and <36 months (P < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS : In children with bronchiolitis, 2 clinical factors, age and number of previous wheezing episodes, are linked to inflammatory (atopy-related factors) and virologic risk factors of asthma (rhinovirus-associated disease). According to current US and UK guidelines, bronchiolitis includes wheezing children <24 months of age.

Recently, H. influenzae was classified by the WHO as priority pathogen due to the wide spread of ampicillin resistant strains. However, other Haemophilus spp. are often misclassified as H. influenzae. Therefore, we established an accurate and rapid whole genome sequencing (WGS) based classification and serotyping algorithm and combined it with the detection of resistance genes. METHODS: A gene presence/absence-based classification algorithm was developed, which employs the open-source gene-detection tool SRST2 and a new classification database comprising 36 genes, including capsule loci for serotyping. These genes were identified using a comparative genome analysis of 215 strains belonging to ten human-related Haemophilus (sub)species (training dataset). The algorithm was evaluated on 1329 public short read datasets (evaluation dataset) and used to reclassify 262 clinical Haemophilus spp. isolates from 250 patients (German cohort). In addition, the presence of antibiotic resistance genes within the German dataset was evaluated with SRST2 and correlated with results of traditional phenotyping assays. RESULTS: The newly developed algorithm can differentiate between clinically relevant Haemophilus species including, but not limited to, H. influenzae, H. haemolyticus, and H. parainfluenzae. It can also identify putative haemin-independent H. haemolyticus strains and determine the serotype of typeable Haemophilus strains. The algorithm performed excellently in the evaluation dataset (99.6% concordance with reported species classification and 99.5% with reported serotype) and revealed several misclassifications. Additionally, 83 out of 262 (31.7%) suspected H. influenzae strains from the German cohort were in fact H. haemolyticus strains, some of which associated with mouth abscesses and lower respiratory tract infections. Resistance genes were detected in 16 out of 262 datasets from the German cohort. Prediction of ampicillin resistance, associated with bla(TEM-1D), and tetracycline resistance, associated with tetB, correlated well with available phenotypic data. CONCLUSIONS: Our new classification database and algorithm have the potential to improve diagnosis and surveillance of Haemophilus spp. and can easily be coupled with other public genotyping and antimicrobial resistance databases. Our data also point towards a possible pathogenic role of H. haemolyticus strains, which needs to be further investigated.

In this process, a patient who tests positive for an infectious disease and public health officials work to identify the patients close contacts, notify them of their risk of possible exposure to the disease, and provide resources to facilitate the decreased spreading of disease. Contact notification can be done physically in person, via phone call, or digitally through the use of media such as SMS text messages and email. When alerts are made through the latter, it is called digital contact notification. OBJECTIVE: For this study, we aim to perform a preliminary evaluation of the use of the TellYourContacts website, a digital contact notification tool for COVID-19 that can be used confidentially and anonymously. We will gather information about the number of website users and message senders, the types of messages sent, and the geographic distribution of senders. METHODS: Patients who chose to get tested for COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for the disease were alerted of their positive results through Curative Inc (a COVID-19 testing laboratory) and Healthvana (a results disclosure app). Included in the notification was a link to the TellYourContacts website and a message encouraging the person who tested positive for COVID-19 to use the website to alert their close contacts of exposure risk. Over the course of three months, from May 18, 2020, to August 17, 2020, we used Google Analytics and Microsoft Excel to record data on the number of website users and message senders, types of messages sent, and geographic distribution of the senders. RESULTS: Over the course of three months, 9130 users accessed the website and 1474 unique senders sent a total of 1957 messages, which included 1820 (93%) SMS text messages and 137 (7%) emails. Users sent messages from 40 US states, with the majority of US senders residing in California (49%). CONCLUSIONS: We set out to determine if individuals who test positive for COVID-19 will use the TellYourContacts website to notify their close contacts of COVID-19 exposure risk. Our findings reveal that, during the observation period, each unique sender sent an average of 1.33 messages. The TellYourContacts website offers an additional method that individuals can and will use to notify their close contacts about a recent COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"A Patient-Initiated Digital COVID-19 Contact Notification Tool (TellYourContacts): Evaluation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to assess red blood cell parameters as a biomarker for long-term glycemic monitoring among T2 DM patients. METHODS: Facility-based cross-sectional study through a consecutive sampling technique was conducted among 124 T2 DM patients at the chronic illness follow-up clinic of Jimma Medical Center (JMC) from July 27 to August 31, 2020. A structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic and clinical-related data. Five milliliters of the blood specimen were collected from each eligible T2 DM patient. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and red blood cell parameters were determined by Cobas 6000 and DxH 800 fully automated analyzers, respectively. Data were entered into EpiData software version 3.1 and exported to SPSS 25 version for analysis. Independent t-test and Pearsons correlation coefficient were used to address the research questions. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 51.84 11.6 years. Moreover, 60.5% of T2 DM patients were in poor glycemic control. There was a significant mean difference between good and poor glycemic controlled T2 DM patients in red blood cell count (4.790.5 vs 4.380.8), hemoglobin (14.131.4 vs 13.601.6), mean corpuscular volume (89.524.7 vs 92.627.5), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (29.631.6 vs 30.772.9), and red cell distribution width (13.681.1 vs 14.631.2) respectively.

CONCLUSION: Red cell count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and red cell distribution width could be useful indicators to monitor the glycemic status of T2 DM patients instead of HbA1c, though large prospective studies should be considered.","output":"Evaluation of Red Blood Cell Parameters as a Biomarker for Long-Term Glycemic Control Monitoring Among Type 2 Diabetic Patients in Southwest Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND For pancreatic tumors located in the body or tail of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy (DP) remains the surgical procedure of choice to achieve radical tumor removal. Purpose of this study was to evaluate outcome and overall survival of patients who underwent DP combined with multivisceral resection (MVR). METHODS Retrospective single-center case-matched analysis. Between January 1994 and June 2014, 494 consecutive patients were entered into a prospective database, and 126 patients undergoing DP + MVR (cases) were matched with 126 patients undergoing DP (controls) for gender, age, and underlying final diagnosis. RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient demographics. Rates of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) (36 (28.6%) vs. 29 (23.0%); p = 0.388) and postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) (7 (5.5%) vs. 5 (3.9%); p = 0.769) did not reveal any significant differences. Although operative time (237.8  57.9 vs. 203.5  34.5; p < 0.001) and the necessity for intraoperative transfusions (18 (14.3%) vs. 5 (4.0%); p < 0.001) was significantly higher, the number of patients with major complications (the Clavien-Dindo  3) was not increased (27 (19.8%) vs. 20 (15.9%); p = 0.332) in the DP + MVR group. Midterm survival analysis indicated no significant difference for adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors for either group. CONCLUSION DP + MVR is a feasible and safe surgical procedure to achieve radical tumor removal and can offer beneficial survival outcomes. Although operative time and intraoperative transfusions are enhanced, POPF, PPH, or major complications (the Clavien-Dindo  3) are not significantly increased after DP + MVR.

We compare it to five other ELISAs, two of which are designed to detect neutralizing antibodies. Results: In 491 pre-vaccination serum samples, sVNT missed 23.6% of PRNT-positive samples when using the manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 30% binding inhibition. Introducing a equivocal area between 15 and 35% maximized sensitivity and specificity against PRNT to 72.8-93.1 % and 73.5-97.6%, respectively.

Conclusion: Our study presents geographical variations in seroprevalence within the Falck organization and shows evidence that social interaction is one of the biggest risk factors for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Antibodies among Danish and Swedish Falck Emergency and Non-Emergency Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of advanced brochoscopic diagnostic techniques in detection and staging of lung cancer has steeply increased in recent years. Bronchoscopic imaging techniques became widely available and easy to use. Technical improvement led to merging in technologies making autofluorescence or narrow band imaging incorporated into one bronchoscope. New tools, such as autofluorescence imagining (AFI), narrow band imaging (NBI) or fuji intelligent chromo endoscopy (FICE), found their place in respiratory endoscopy suites. Development of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) improved minimally invasive mediastinal staging and diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. Linear EBUS proven to be complementary to mediastinoscopy. This technique is now available in almost all high volume centers performing bronchoscopy. Radial EBUS with mini-probes and guiding sheaths provides accurate diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions. Combining EBUS guided procedures with rapid on site cytology (ROSE) increases diagnostic yield even more. Electromagnetic navigation technology (EMN) is also widely used for diagnosis of peripheral lesions. Future development will certainly lead to new improvements in technology and creation of new sophisticated tools for research in respiratory endoscopy.

For now patient isolation, physical distancing and good hygiene are the sole measures for prevention. Processed breast milk with antibodies against SaRS-CoV-2 may serve as additional protection. We aimed to determine the presence and neutralization capacity of antibodies against SaRS-CoV-2 in breastmilk of mothers who have recovered from COVID-19. Methods: This prospective case control study included lactating mothers, recovered from (suspected) COVID-19 and healthy controls. Serum and breastmilk was collected. To assess the presence of antibodies in breastmilk and serum, we used multiple complementary assays, namely ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein for IgG and bridging ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and N protein for total Ig. To assess the effect of pasteurization breastmilk was exposed to Holder Pasteurization and High Pressure Pasteurization. Results: Breastmilk contained antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using any of the assays in 24 out of 29 (83%) proven cases, in six out of nine (67%) suspected cases and in none of the 13 controls. In vitro neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate virus strain was successful in a subset of serum (13%) and milk samples (26%). Although after pasteurization of the milk SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected with both methods of pasteurization, virus neutralizing capacity of those antibodies was only retained with the HPP approach.

METHODS: Participants were 18C26-year-old college student e-cigarette users attending four geographically diverse, large U.S. public universities during October-December 2020 (N = 800). Multivariable logistic regression models explored associations between exclusive e-cigarette use and concurrent e-cigarette and cannabis use and COVID-19 symptoms, testing, and diagnosis. Models controlled for demographics, university site, and current use of combustible cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. RESULTS: Over half of student e-cigarette users (52.0%) concurrently used cannabis. Compared to exclusive e-cigarette users, concurrent e-cigarette and cannabis users were 3.53 times more likely (95%CI = 1.96C6.36) to report COVID-19 symptoms, after adjusting for the covariates. Compared to infrequent exclusive e-cigarette users, infrequent concurrent users (AOR = 4.72, 95%CI = 1.31C17.00), intermediate concurrent users (AOR = 5.10, 95%CI = 1.37C18.97), and frequent concurrent users (AOR = 7.44, 95%CI = 2.06C26.84) were at increased odds of reporting COVID-19 symptoms. Compared to exclusive e-cigarette users, concurrent e-cigarette and cannabis users were 1.85 times more likely (95%CI = 1.15C2.98) to report a COVID-19 diagnosis. Intermediate concurrent users (AOR = 2.88, 95%CI = 1.13C7.35) and frequent concurrent users (AOR = 3.22, 95%CI = 1.32C7.87) were at increased odds of reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared to infrequent exclusive e-cigarette users. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent use of e-cigarettes and cannabis may be an underlying risk factor of COVID-19 symptomatology and diagnosis, with more pronounced odds found among intermediate and frequent users.

METHODS We analyzed the 1180 symptomatic patients in CREST who received their assigned procedure and had clearly defined timing of symptoms. Patients were classified into 3 groups based on time from symptoms to procedure: <15, 15 to 60, and >60 days. RESULTS For carotid endarterectomy, risk of periprocedural stroke or death was not significantly different for the 2 later time periods relative to the earliest time period (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-2.49 for 15-60 days and hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-3.33 for >60 days; P=0.89).

However, when it comes to agent theory, which is a highly important part of the general AI (Artificial Intelligence) research focus, there is a noticeable absence of such educational tools.

OBJECTIVE: To define performance standards and predict the clinical, epidemiologic, and economic outcomes of nationwide, home-based antigen testing. DESIGN: A simple compartmental epidemic model that estimated viral transmission, portrayed disease progression, and forecast resource use, with and without testing. DATA SOURCES: Parameter values and ranges as informed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and published literature. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. population. TIME HORIZON: 60 days. PERSPECTIVE: Societal; costs included testing, inpatient care, and lost workdays. INTERVENTION: Home-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative infections and deaths, number of persons isolated and hospitalized, and total costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Without a testing intervention, the model anticipates 11.6 million infections, 119 000 deaths, and $10.1 billion in costs ($6.5 billion in inpatient care and $3.5 billion in lost productivity) over a 60-day horizon. Weekly availability of testing would avert 2.8 million infections and 15 700 deaths, increasing costs by $22.3 billion. Lower inpatient outlays ($5.9 billion) would partially offset additional testing expenditures ($12.5 billion) and workdays lost ($14.0 billion), yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $7890 per infection averted and $1 430 000 per death averted. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Outcome estimates vary widely under different behavioral assumptions and testing frequencies. However, key findings persist across all scenarios, with large reductions in infections, mortality, and hospitalizations. Costs per death averted are roughly an order of magnitude lower than commonly accepted willingness-to-pay values per statistical life saved ($5 to $17 million). LIMITATIONS: Analysis was restricted to at-home testing. There are uncertainties concerning test performance.

An in-depth analysis about both population and molecular epidemiology of this pathogen is needed. METHODS: MERS cases reported globally as of June 2020 were collected mainly from World Health Organization official reports, supplemented by other reliable sources. Determinants for case fatality and spatial diffusion of MERS were assessed with Logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses were performed to examine the evolution and migration history of MERS-CoV. RESULTS: A total of 2562 confirmed MERS cases with 150 case clusters were reported with a case fatality rate of 32.7% (95% CI: 30.9?34.6%). Saudi Arabia accounted for 83.6% of the cases. Age of  65 years old, underlying conditions and  5 days delay in diagnosis were independent risk factors for death. However, a history of animal contact was associated with a higher risk (adjusted OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.10C7.98) among female cases < 65 years but with a lower risk (adjusted OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.18C0.51) among male cases  65 years old. Diffusion of the disease was fastest from its origin in Saudi Arabia to the east, and was primarily driven by the transportation network. The most recent sub-clade C5.1 (since 2013) was associated with non-synonymous mutations and a higher mortality rate. Phylogeographic analyses pointed to Riyadh of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates as the hubs for both local and international spread of MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV remains primarily locally transmitted in the Middle East, with opportunistic exportation to other continents and a potential of causing transmission clusters of human cases. Animal contact is associated with a higher risk of death, but the association differs by age and sex. Transportation network is the leading driver for the spatial diffusion of the disease. These findings how this pathogen spread are helpful for targeting public health surveillance and interventions to control endemics and to prevent a potential pandemic.

A Code Silver Exercise (CSE) involving an independent mental practice exercise with written responses to scenarios and questions, followed by a facilitated debrief with all participants, was conceptualized and trialled for feasibility and efficacy. The CSE was piloted as a quality improvement and emergency preparedness initiative in three different settings including in situ within a hospital Emergency Department or Intensive Care Unit, offsite in a large conference room workshop, and online via virtual platform. These sessions took place in 4 different cities in Canada and included 3 academic teaching hospitals. Participants of the in situ and virtual CSE completed pre- and post-simulation surveys which showed improved understanding of Code Silver protocols following participation. The CSE is a reproducible simulation alternative, designed to operationalize a Code Silver policy at a large healthcare institution in a sustainable way. This training model can be administered in multiple settings in-person (in situ or offsite), and virtually, making it versatile and easily accessible for participants. This exercise enables participants to mentally rehearse practical responses to an active shooter in their unique work environments and to discuss ethical and medical-legal implications of their responses during a facilitated debrief with fellow healthcare providers. Implementation of a CSE for training in hospitals may help staff to create a mental schema prior to an active shooter event, and thus indirectly improve the chances of survivability in the event of a real active shooter situation.

In particular, atrophy of the diaphragm, the major muscle responsible for breathing, is an important determinant of cancer-associated mortality. However, therapeutic options are limited. Here, we have used Drosophila transgenic screening to identify muscle-secreted factors (myokines) that act as paracrine regulators of myofiber growth. Subsequent testing in mouse myotubes revealed that mouse Fibcd1 is an evolutionary-conserved myokine that preserves myofiber size via ERK signaling. Local administration of recombinant Fibcd1 (rFibcd1) ameliorates cachexia-induced myofiber atrophy in the diaphragm of mice bearing patient-derived melanoma xenografts and LLC carcinomas. Moreover, rFibcd1 impedes cachexia-associated transcriptional changes in the diaphragm. Fibcd1-induced signaling appears to be muscle selective because rFibcd1 increases ERK activity in myotubes but not in several cancer cell lines tested.

Hemodialysis patients are already at an increased risk for thromboembolic events such as stroke and pulmonary embolism. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of late thrombotic complications (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, new-onset vascular access thrombosis) in maintenance hemodialysis patients after recovery from COVID-19. METHOD: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 200 prevalent hemodialysis patients in our center at the start of the pandemic. We excluded incident patients after the cohort entry date and those who required hemodialysis for acute kidney injury, and excluded patients with less than 1 month follow-up due to kidney transplantation or death from non-thrombotic causes. RESULTS: 185 prevalent hemodialysis patients finally met the inclusion criteria; 37 patients (17.6%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection, out of which 10 (27%) died during the acute phase of disease without evidence of thrombotic events. There was an increased risk of thrombotic events in COVID-19 survivors compared to the non-infected cohort (18.5% vs 1.9%, p=0.002) after a median follow-up of 7 months. Stroke incidence was 38.9 episodes/1000 patient-years in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, compared to an incidence of 2.8 episodes/1000 patient-years in non-infected patients during the follow-up period. The median time from diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to the first thrombotic event was 62 days (interquartile range 5-118 days). Survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier curves revealed an increase in the rate of thrombotic events after SARS-CoV-2 compared to non-infected patients (see Figure 1). Mean survival from thrombotic event was 6.10.4 months in the COVID-infected group, compared to 6.970.04 months in the non-infected group (p<0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that COVID-19 infection increased risk for late thrombotic events adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, antithrombotic treatment and previous thrombotic events (OR 26.4, 95% CI 2.5-280.6, p=0.01).

We therefore, investigated the risk factors associated with this outbreak to recommend prevention and control measures. METHODS: we conducted a 1:1 unmatched case-control study. A case was any person who suffered from diarrhoea, and was resident in the clinics catchment since the 21(st) of September 2020. Demographic data, knowledge and practices related to diarrhoea were collected using a standard questionnaire for both cases and controls. Environmental assessment, water quality and stool testing was also done. We conducted univariate and multivariate analysis at 95% confidence interval, to determine factors independently associated with contracting diarrhoea. RESULTS: the median age was 30 years (Q1=12, Q3=46) for cases and 30 years (Q1=22, Q3=48) for controls. The dominant gender was female for cases and male for controls. The independent risk factors were: drinking borehole water [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR)=2.66; 95%CI=(1.41-5.00)], storing water in open container [aOR=2.76; 95%CI=(1.38-5.53)] and being under-five years old [aOR=5.73; 95%CI=(2.06-15.89)]. Boiling drinking water [aOR=0.39; 95%CI=(0.20-0.75)] was protective. Coliforms were detected from boreholes and stored water samples, and Shigella flexneri was isolated from 2 of the 13 stool specimens collected. Residents accessed water from decommissioned boreholes due to severe municipal water rationing.

METHODS: A pixel-based analysis of pre-treatment CT perfusion (CTP) was undertaken to define the optimum CTP permeability thresholds to predict the likelihood of HT. We then compared previously proposed predictors of HT using regression analyses and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis to produce an Area Under the Cure (AUC), and compared AUCs using Chi Square analysis. RESULTS: From 5 centres, 1407 patients were included in this study, 282 had HT. The cohort was split into a derivation (1025, 70% patients) and validation cohort (382 patients or 30%). The E permeability map at a threshold of 30% relative to contralateral had the highest AUC at predicting any HT (derivation AUC 0.85, 95% CI, 0.79-0.91, validation AUC 0.84, 95% CI, 0.77-0.91). The AUC improved when permeability was assessed within the acute perfusion lesion for the E maps at a threshold of 30% (derivation AUC 0.91, 95% CI, 0.86-0.95, validation AUC 0.89, 95% CI, 0.86-0.95). Previously proposed associations with HT and PH showed lower AUC values than the permeability measure.

METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies including trial cohorts. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and trial registries up to March 2019. Eligible studies assessed potential predictors of clinically important GI bleeding (CIB; primary outcome) or overt GI bleeding (secondary outcome), had > 20 events, and presented adjusted effect estimates. Two reviewers assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE. We meta-analysed adjusted effect estimates if data from  2 studies were available. RESULTS We included 8 studies (116,497 patients). 4 studies (including 74,456 patients) assessed potential predictors of CIB, and we meta-analysed 12 potential predictors from these. Acute kidney injury (relative effect [RE] 2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-5.28, moderate certainty) and male gender (RE 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.50, low certainty) were associated with increased incidence of CIB.

However, quantitative assessment of the ablation margin by comparing pre- and post-procedural images remains challenging. We developed and tested a novel method for three-dimensional quantitative assessment of ablation margin based on non-rigid image registration and 3D distance map. METHODS Our method was tested with pre- and post-procedural MR images acquired in 21 patients who underwent image-guided percutaneous liver ablation. The two images were co-registered using non-rigid intensity-based registration. After the tumor and ablation volumes were segmented, target volume coverage, percent of tumor coverage, and Dice similarity coefficient were calculated as metrics representing overall adequacy of ablation. In addition, 3D distance map around the tumor was computed and superimposed on the ablation volume to identify the area with insufficient margins. For patients with local recurrences, the follow-up images were registered to the post-procedural image. Three-dimensional minimum distance between the recurrence and the areas with insufficient margins was quantified. RESULTS The percent tumor coverage for all nonrecurrent cases was 100 %. Five cases had tumor recurrences, and the 3D distance map revealed insufficient tumor coverage or a 0-mm margin. It also showed that two recurrences were remote to the insufficient margin. CONCLUSIONS Non-rigid registration and 3D distance map allow us to quantitatively evaluate the adequacy of the ablation margin after percutaneous liver ablation.

DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, up to 15 February 2019. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA Articles discussing indoor tanning and health were eligible for inclusion, with no article type restrictions (original research, systematic reviews, review articles, case reports, editorials, commentaries, and letters were all eligible). Basic science studies, articles describing only indoor tanning prevalence, non-English articles, and articles without full text available were excluded. RESULTS 691 articles were included in analysis, including empiric articles (eg, original articles or systematic reviews) (357/691; 51.7%) and non-empiric articles letters (eg, commentaries, letters, or editorials) (334/691; 48.3%). Overall, 7.2% (50/691) of articles had financial links to the indoor tanning industry; 10.7% (74/691) articles favored indoor tanning, 3.9% (27/691) were neutral, and 85.4% (590/691) were critical of indoor tanning. Among the articles without industry funding, 4.4% (27/620) favored indoor tanning, 3.5% (22/620) were neutral, and 92.1% (571/620) were critical of indoor tanning. Among the articles with financial links to the indoor tanning industry, 78% (39/50) favored indoor tanning, 10% (5/50) were neutral, and 12% (6/50) were critical of indoor tanning. Support from the indoor tanning industry was significantly associated with favoring indoor tanning (risk ratio 14.3, 95% confidence interval 10.0 to 20.4). CONCLUSIONS Although most articles in the indoor tanning literature are independent of industry funding, articles with financial links to the indoor tanning industry are more likely to favor indoor tanning. Public health practitioners and researchers need to be aware of and account for industry funding when interpreting the evidence related to indoor tanning.

Their worldwide epidemiologic evolution and distribution are mostly unknown. OBJECTIVE: To explore the evolution and geographic distribution of common cutaneous infestations and arthropod bites through an analysis of Google Trends. METHODS: Search trends from 2004 through March 2021 for common cutaneous infestations and arthropod bites were extracted from Google Trends, quantified, and analyzed. RESULTS: Time series decomposition showed that total search term volume for pubic lice decreased worldwide over the study period, while the interest for ticks, pediculosis, insect bites, scabies, lice, and bed bugs increased (in increasing order). The interest for bed bugs was more pronounced in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics countries, interest for lice in Near East and Middle East countries, and interest for pubic lice in South American countries. Internet searches for bed bugs, insect bites, and ticks exhibited the highest seasonal patterns. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective analysis limits interpretation. CONCLUSION: Surveillance systems based on Google Trends may enhance the timeliness of traditional surveillance systems and suggest that, while most cutaneous infestations increase worldwide, pubic lice may be globally declining.","output":"Epidemiologic evolution of common cutaneous infestations and arthropod bites: A Google Trends analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors may continue experiencing diverse symptoms. This study portrays the clinical and laboratory profile of patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19(PASC) at a tertiary care hospital in India. Methodology: This cross-sectional study enrolled patients visiting the post-COVID-19 clinic three weeks after their acute COVID-19 illness. Their clinical, serological, and radiological characteristics were collected and analyzed. Results: Of the 259 participants (age: 48.0215.27 years; 62.25% men), 168 had PASC manifestations. The most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (n=71(42.26%)), breathlessness (n=38(22.61%)), and cough (n=35(20.83%)). Patients with PASC had higher body mass index (28.245.02 vs. 26.263.65; p=0.002), history of hypertension (52 (30.95%) vs. 17 (18.6%); p=0.039), uncontrolled systolic blood pressure (37 (22.03) vs. 14 (15.38); p=0.042), and persistent chest x-ray abnormalities (34 (20.23) vs. 10 (10.98); p=0.048). Conclusion: Fatigue, breathlessness, and cough are common PASC symptoms. Hypertension, obesity, and abnormal chest x-ray findings at follow-up are potential risk factors for developing PASC.","output":"Clinical and Laboratory Profile of Patients Visiting the Post-COVID-19 Clinic at a Tertiary Care Hospital: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Philippines is the largest Christian-majority country in Asia. With church gatherings playing a vital role in the nature of Christianity in the Filipino culture, the advent of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the Philippines posed challenges to public religious practices amid efforts to mitigate COVID-19 community transmission. Various policy pronouncements from both the government-led Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Diseases and the church-led Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) were issued. These guidelines were implemented in order to address the two-pronged problem on healthcare and religious obligations. While these guidelines were initially contributory to the mitigation of disease transmission, varied compliance by Filipinos was observed through the progression of the pandemic. Considering the value that church gatherings and religion play in the lives of the Filipino people, further studies on COVID-19 transmission in the church should be conducted in order to develop more efficient policies and guidelines on the practice of religion, particularly for religious gatherings. Furthermore, a more synergistic state and church cooperation must be encouraged in order to arrive at solutions that will mutually address the concomitant problems of the COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2021 Center for Health in Mission.

Healthy workers are considered to be the more productive labourers leading to a countrys positive economic growth over time. Several research studies have modelled disease transmission and its economic impact on a single country in isolation. We developed a two-country disease-economy model that explores disease transmission and cross-border infection of disease for its impacts. The model includes aspects of a worsening and rapid transmission of disease juxtaposed by positive impacts to the economy from tourism. We found that high friction affects the gross domestic product (GDP) of the lower-income country more than the higher-income country. Health aid from one country to another can substantially help grow the GDP of both countries due to the positive externality of disease reduction. Disease has less impact to both economies if the relative cost of treatment over an alternative (e.g. vaccination) is lower than the baseline value. Providing medical supplies to another country, adopting moderate friction between the countries, and finding treatments with lower costs result in the best scenario to preserve the GDP of both countries.","output":"Mitigating the externality of diseases of poverty through health aid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are affected by viral infections each year, and yet, several of them neither have vaccines nor effective treatment during and post-infection. This challenge has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, showing how viruses can quickly spread and how they can impact society as a whole. Novel techniques that bring in different disciplines must emerge to provide forward-looking strategies to combat viral infections, as well as possible future pandemics. In the past decade, an interdisciplinary area involving bioengineering, nanotechnology and information and communication technology (ICT) has been developing, known as Molecular Communications. This new emerging area uses elements of classical communication systems and maps it to molecular signalling and communication found inside and outside the body, where the aim is to develop new tools that can serve future medicine. In this paper, we provide an extensive and detailed discussion on how Molecular Communications can be integrated into the research on viral infectious diseases modelling, and how possible treatment and vaccines can be developed considering molecules as information carriers. We provide a literature review on the existing models of Molecular Communications for viral infection (in-body and out-body), a deep analysis on their effects on the host and subsequent communication process for other systems within the body (e.g., immune response), sources of experimental data on known viral infections and how it can be used by the Molecular Communications community, as well as open issues and future directions. Since the development of therapeutics/vaccines needs an interdisciplinary approach centred around ICT, we are confident that Molecular Communications can play a central role here by providing a detail characterisation and manipulation of the propagation of molecules in different media.","output":"Molecular Communications in Viral Infections Research: Modelling, Experimental Data and Future Directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: On June 19, 2020, the Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a public meeting on Data Needs to Monitor the Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR/HHS) and other agencies are seeking to track and correlate viral genome sequences with clinical and epidemiological (CE) data A crucial part of that framework is obtaining detailed CE data from frontline facilities In response, we sought to contribute by creating a registry of detailed CE data from SARS-COV -2 infected patients at five hospitals, spanning eleven counties in Western New York Methods: In addition to the usual demographics, comorbidities, and categories of outpatient prescriptions, the registry has 75 laboratory, 2 imaging, 19 therapeutic, and 4 outcome-related parameters Mann-Whitney U Test for continuous variables and Chi-squared and Fisher Exact Test for categorical variables were performed in R and Minitab Results: The registry currently includes data from 399 patients: 236 ambulatory and 163 inpatient Several comorbidities were associated with requirement for admission compared to ambulatory status, including obesity and kidney, liver, and cardiovascular disease (all p &lt; /= 0 01) (Table 1) Use of angiotensin inhibitors and receptor blockers, statins, and acid suppressants was higher in admitted vs ambulatory patients (all p &lt; /=0 001) (Table 1 and Figure) Diabetes mellitus and statin use were more common in patients who required intensive care, p=0 04 and 0 01 respectively (Table 2) Conclusion: The registry captures detailed clinical information from SARSCOV- 2 infections, providing a valuable resource for researchers, planners, and policy makers It also provides a framework for surge planning, predictive modeling, and linking CE data to whole genome sequencing data for precision epidemiology As SARS-COV-2 reports from China, Italy, and New York City may not be fully generalizable to other regions, especially those not as severely affected or those in suburban and rural settings, reports from other areas are needed To our knowledge, this is one of the largest U S case series outside of New York City (Table Presented)","output":"The rochester regional COVID-19 registry: One small step toward a unified national action plan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Oxytocin (OXT), a neuropeptide involved in mammal reproductive and prosocial behaviors, has been reported to interact with various stressor-provoked neurobiological changes, including neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, and inflammatory processes. In view of disturbances in psychosocial relationships due to social isolation and physical distancing measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic, being one of the triggering factors for the recent rise in depression and anxiety, OXT is a potential candidate for a new antidepressant. METHODS: In this present study, we have aimed to investigate the effects of oral administration of Rosmarinus officinalis extract (RE), extracted from distillation residue of rosemary essential oil, on central OXT level in the context of other stress biomarkers and neurotransmitter levels in mice models. Tail suspension test (TST) and elevated plus maze test (EPMT) following LPS injection were employed to assess depressive- and anxiety-like behavior in mice, respectively. FINDINGS: Pretreatment with RE for seven days significantly improved behavior in TST and EPMT. Whole-genome microarray analysis reveals that RE significantly reversed TST stress-induced alterations in gene expressions related to oxytocinergic and neurotransmitter pathways and inflammatory processes. In both models, RE significantly increased central Oxt and Oxtr expressions, as well as OXT protein levels. RE also significantly attenuated stress-induced changes in serum corticosterone, brain and serum BDNF levels, and brain neurotransmitters levels in both models. INTERPRETATION: Altogether, our study is the first to report antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like activities of RE through modulating oxytocinergic system in mice brain and thus highlights the prospects of RE in the treatment of depressive disorders of psychosocial nature.","output":"Antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like activities of Rosmarinus officinalis extract in rodent models: Involvement of oxytocinergic system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused immense psychological and physical stress to almost everyone in the world.

Family members being at home for most of the time of the day, is a new phenomenon for these homemakers. It is not very easy for them to deal with this new situation emotionally and physically. It means a lot of compromises are expected to be made by the homemaker in terms of time, energy and privacy, as she is most often taken for granted by our male dominated society. She has lost the only ME time that she used to get during the day while her family members were out attending their daily chores. Being at home for most of the time by family members has also increased her work at home as it is assumed by most of the family members that while they are busy attending to their professional and educational commitments, she is relatively free to take care of all their needs.

Bilateral court meetings are essential for judicial diplomacy, encompassing jurisprudential (e.g., discussion of case law) and aims of strategic (e.g., maximising influence). This study presents a novel approach to assess such meetings. It analyses the German Federal Constitutional Court meeting reports between 1998C2019, using content and semantic network analysis. The content analysis shows that court meetings focus on jurisprudential aspects; however, strategic considerations also play a role in discussions with interlocutors from emerging democracies. These findings are substantiated by the semantic network analysis, which discloses that recent case law, Europeanisation, and globalisation are the main issues discussed. Hence, this study presents an analysis of a novel data source.

Data from both Internet use and age of first exposure were retrieved and used to conduct metanalyses with random effects. Adolescents reporting an age of first exposure of Internet usage at  13 years old had the lowest odds for heavy Internet use (> 2 h/day) (reference group:  9 years) during weekends (odds ratio, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.35C0.48]), weekdays (odds ratio, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.37C0.56]), and during school time (odds ratio (odds ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77C0.96]) even when adjusted for sex, socioeconomic status, and country.

Sorting nexin 10 (SNX10) has been reported to be an important regulator in embryonic development and human diseases, however, little is known about its role in cardiac disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of SNX10 expression in AF. METHODS: Nineteen valvular heart disease patients with AF and nine valvular heart disease patients with sinus rhythm (SR) were enrolled. Atrial tissue samples from patients undergoing open heart surgery were examined. Atrial tissues of normal hearts were obtained from two cases' autopsies. The SNX10 expression and its associations with the degree of fibrosis were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Masson's trichrome staining. RESULTS: SNX10 expression was detected in the cytoplasm of cardiac cells in human myocardial tissue. The SNX10 expression level was higher in the SR group than in the AF group (P=0.023). SNX10 expression was negatively associated with the degree of fibrosis (P=0.017, Spearman rho=-0.447), the New York Heart Association degree (P=0.003, Spearman rho=-0.545), left atrial diameter (P=0.038, Spearman rho=-0.393), right atrial diameter (P=0.043, Spearman rho=-0.386), and the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level 24 hours after surgery (P=0.030, Spearman rho=-0.426), but not the BNP level before surgery and 72 hours after surgery.

METHODS The Premier Healthcare Database was utilized to identify adults undergoing primary elective THA or TKA from January 2017 to December 2020. The National Inpatient Sample was cross-referenced to provide nationwide representative sampling weights. Patients undergoing revision total joint arthroplasty (TJA) or non-elective surgery were excluded. Two quantitative models were created from both databases to estimate TJA case volume in 2020. Descriptive statistics were utilized to report monthly changes in elective TJA utilization throughout 2020. Univariate analyses were performed to compare differences between subgroups. RESULTS From 2017 to 2019, it was estimated that 1,006,000 elective inpatient TJAs (64.2% TKA and 35.8% THA) were performed annually. In 2020, an estimated 526,000 to 538,000 cases (62.0% TKA and 38.0% THA) were performed, representing a 46.5% to 47.7% decrease in nationwide volume from the prior 3-year average. Moreover, the elective TJA case volume for April 2020 was 1.9% of the average for that month from 2017 through 2019. Subsequently, case volumes for May and June increased compared with the volumes for those months from 2017 through 2019. There was then a decrease in cases for July, corresponding with the \\"second wave\\" of COVID-19, followed by an additional steady monthly decline through December, corresponding with the \\"third wave.\\" Finally, the elective TJA cases for December 2020 represented only 41.0% of the average case volume for that month from 2017 through 2019. CONCLUSIONS In the midst of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 526,000 to 538,000 elective inpatient TJA cases were performed, representing a 46.5% to 47.7% decrease compared with the 3 previous years.

This study aimed at exploring nursing students' perception of clinical teaching and learning in Ghana. In particular, this study sought to (1) describe the factors that promote clinical teaching, (2) examine students' perception of clinical teaching, (3) describe the impact of clinical learning on students, and (4) explore ways of improving clinical teaching and learning. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study was conducted with 16 final-year nursing students using telephone-based interviews. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with a semistructured interview guide, and data were analysed by the qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that being taught new things, being supervised, and having autonomy were the most significant factors that promoted clinical learning. Participants also reported that clinical experience created learning opportunities that helped develop clinical competence. They described learning experiences in the clinical setting as good, albeit gaps in practice. Poor staff attitude, lack of equipment, poor student attitude, inadequate learning opportunities, and lack of clinical supervisors were perceived as challenges in the clinical environment. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to consciously teach, supervise, and challenge students to have independence in the clinical area will promote clinical teaching and learning. Therefore, nursing educational institutions and all other stakeholders need to collaborate in eliminating the numerous challenges students encounter in the clinical environment.","output":"Nursing Students' Perception of Clinical Teaching and Learning in Ghana: A Descriptive Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic imposes new challenges on the capability of governments in intervening with the information dissemination and reducing the risk of infection outbreak. To reveal the complexity behind government intervention decision, we build a bi-layer network diffusion model for the information-disease dynamics that were intervened in and conduct a full space simulation to illustrate the trade-off faced by governments between information disclosing and blocking. The simulation results show that governments prioritize the accuracy of disclosed information over the disclosing speed when there is a high-level medical recognition of the virus and a high public health awareness, while, for the opposite situation, more strict information blocking is preferred. Furthermore, an unaccountable government tends to delay disclosing, a risk-averse government prefers a total blocking, and a low government credibility will discount the effect of information disclosing and aggravate the situation. These findings suggest that information intervention is indispensable for containing the outbreak of infectious disease, but its effectiveness depends on a complicated way on both external social/epidemic factors and the governments internal preferences and governance capability, for which more thorough investigations are needed in the future.","output":"Re-Thinking the Role of Government Information Intervention in the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Agent-Based Modeling Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to investigate if/how the presence of lymphedema affects the sensation of the upper limb and to assess whether complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP) has a favorable impact on sensory testing. METHODS: A total of 27 patients with unilateral stage 2 breast cancerCrelated lymphedema (BCRL) were included in the study. Bilateral circumferential measurements were taken with a tape measure at different levels. Based on these measurements, limb volumes were determined by summing segment volumes derived from the truncated cone formula. Circumferential measurements and ultrasonographic evaluations (epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat thicknesses) were performed at 10 cm distal to the elbow crease. The SemmesCWeinstein monofilament (SWM), static and moving two-point discrimination, pressure pain threshold (PPT), and tactile localization tests were also applied at the same site. After an initial evaluation, all patients underwent CDP phase 1 program. All the evaluations were repeated at the end of the treatment period. RESULTS: Before CDP, affected sides had significantly higher values than the unaffected sides in terms of SWM (p < 0.001), static (p = 0.002) and moving (p = 0.011) two-point discrimination, PPT (p = 0.001), and tactile localization (p < 0.001) values. After CDP, SWM (p = 0.002), static (p = 0.009) and moving (p = 0.024) two-point discrimination, PPT (p = 0.014), and tactile localization (p < 0.001) values decreased significantly on the affected sides. CONCLUSION: BCRL seems to reduce light touch, static and moving two-point discrimination, PPT, and tactile localization sensations, whereas CDP seems to improve these sensory perceptions in women with BCRL. Ultrasonographic measurements also appear to be promising for prompt and convenient follow-up in the management of BCRL.

Academic neurosurgery has increased adoption to promote individual and departmental accomplishments, engage with patients, and foster collaboration. We sought to quantitatively evaluate the adoption of one of the most used social media platforms, Twitter, within academic neurosurgery. METHODS: A quantitative and qualitative analysis of Twitter use across 118 academic neurosurgery departments with residency programs in the United States was performed in March 2019 and March 2021. We collated Twitter handles, Doximity residency ranking (a peer-determined ranking system), geographic location, and Twitter demographics (tweets, followers, likes, and tweet content) from before and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Tweet content was characterized by reviewers over a predetermined 6-month period. Linear regression and parametric/nonparametric tests were used for analysis. RESULTS: Departmental accounts grew 3.7 accounts per year between 2009 and 2019 (R2 = 0.96), but 43 accounts (130%) were added between 2019 (n = 33) and 2021 (n = 76). This growth, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, changed the model from linear to exponential growth (R2 = 0.97). The highest-ranking programs based on Doximity were significantly more likely to have an account (P < 0.001) and have more followers (P < 0.0001). Tweet content analysis revealed prioritization of faculty/resident activity (mean 49.9%) throughout the quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate rapid uptake in Twitter use among U.S. academic neurosurgical departments, accelerated by COVID-19. With the impact of COVID-19, it is clear that there will be continued rapid adoption of this platform within neurosurgery, and future studies should explore the outcomes of peer collaboration, patient engagement, and dissemination of medical information.","output":"#Neurosurgery: A Temporal and Content Analysis of Academic Neurosurgery on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM: COVID-19 started to spread as a pandemic in December 2019 and COVID-19 vaccination has been initiated worldwide. The efficacy of vaccination has been scientifically proven, but it might cause axillary lymph node swelling. To diagnose patients with axillary lymph node swelling caused by COVID-19 vaccination, we herein reviewed existing literature on this symptom. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 70-year-old woman with a breast tumour. She had undergone cecum cancer surgery and regular computed tomography (CT). During breast tumour follow-up, she received scheduled CT that indicated severe axillary lymph node swelling mimicking breast cancer metastasis. We performed aspiration biopsy cytology of that lymph node, and determined this was not cancer metastasis but an effect of the COVID-19 vaccine. We confirmed this diagnosis at one month after computed tomography showed that the lymph node swelling had improved. CONCLUSION: Axillary lymph node swelling can occur after COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, it is important to consider the effect of the COVID-19 vaccination on axillary lymph node swelling when diagnosing breast tumours.","output":"Axillary Lymph Node Swelling Mimicking Breast Cancer Metastasis After COVID-19 Vaccination: A Japanese Case Report and Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MAIN FINDINGS A 22-year-old woman with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) presenting with primary amenorrhea and normal female external genitalia was referred for laparoscopic gonadectomy.

Additionally, digital solutions are used for remote consulting during the pandemic, in creating COVID-19 related awareness, for distribution of the vaccine, and so on. Therefore, this study aimed to assess digital health literacy to share COVID-19 related information and associated factors among healthcare providers who worked at COVID-19 treatment centers in the Amhara region, Northwest Ethiopia. METHOD: An institutional-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from April 4 to May 4, 2021. The study included 476 healthcare providers who worked at COVID-19 treatment centers in the Amhara region. A pretested, structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. EpiData 4.6 and SPSS version 26 were used for data entry and analysis respectively. Bi-variable and Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the dependent variable. A P-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. RESULT: A total of 456 respondents were participated in the study, with 95.8% response rate. Digital health literacy to share COVID-19 related information found to be 50.4% (95% CI: 46C55).

All patients exhibited respiratory or hemodynamic instability that required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. Forty-four patients received emergency operations between 24 to 72 h due to stabilization of the patients condition. Stable hemodynamics were achieved, and a stable internal milieu was maintained before the operation. These patients comprised the Stable group (SG). Rather than being subjected to efforts to obtain stable hemodynamics and maintain a stable internal milieu, ten patients received emergency operations immediately within 24 h of diagnosis or an emergency operation is performed immediately due to uncorrectable acidosis or progressive cardiovascular collapse. These patients comprised the Unstable group (UG). The hospital course, operative data, and outpatient records were reviewed. RESULTS: In SG group, there were 23 exhibited the supracardiac type, 15 exhibited the cardiac type, 4 exhibited the cardiac type, and 2 exhibited the mixed cardiac type,3 patients were premature, the rest was term infant, PDA was the most common comorbidities (28 patients), the next is severe tricuspid valve regurgitation (21 patients).

Early and effective predictors of disease severity are needed to improve the management of the patients affected with COVID-19. Copeptin, a 39-amino acid glycopeptide, is known as a C-terminal unit of the precursor pre-provasopressin (pre-proAVP). Activation of AVP system stimulates copeptin secretion in equimolar amounts with AVP. This study aimed to determine serum copeptin levels in the patients with COVID-19 and to examine the relationship between serum copeptin levels and the severity of the disease. METHODS: The study included 90 patients with COVID-19. The patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups according to disease severity as mild/moderate disease (n=35) and severe disease (n=55). All basic demographic and clinical data of the patients were recorded and blood samples were collected. RESULTS: Copeptin levels were significantly higher in the patients with severe COVID-19 compared with the patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 (p<0.001). Copeptin levels were correlated with ferritin and fibrinogen levels positively (r=0.32, p=0.002 and r=0.25, p=0.019, respectively), and correlated with oxygen saturation negatively (r=-0.37, p<0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, it was revealed that copeptin (OR: 2.647, 95%CI 1.272-5.510;p=0.009) was an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 disease.

A soluble form of EPCR (sEPCR) circulates in plasma and inhibits activated protein C (APC) activities. The clinical impact of sEPCR and its involvement in COVID-19 has not been explored. In this study, we investigated whether sEPCR levels were related to COVID-19 patients requirement for hospitalization. METHODS: Plasma sEPCR levels were measured on hospital admission in 84 COVID-19 patients, and in 11 non-hospitalized SARS-CoV2-positive patients approximately 6 days after reported manifestation of their symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for hospitalization and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess their value. RESULTS: In our cohort, hospitalized patients had considerably higher sEPCR levels upon admission compared with outpatients [107.5 (76.7C156.3) vs. 44.6 (12.1C84.4) ng/mL; P < 0.0001)]. The ROC curve using hospitalization as the classification variable and sEPCR levels as the prognostic variable generated an area under the curve at 0.845 (95% CI = 0.710C0.981, P < 0.001).

Methods: A systematic review of the all published papers was conducted with a comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library database using keywords COVID-19, Coronavirus, trauma?and fracture from JanuaryCApril 2020. Results: The searches yielded a total of ten studies with 112 Patients who were positive for COVID-19 associated with fractures was performed for six studies, reporting data separately for 44 patients with COVID 19 and an associated fracture. A diagnosis of COVID 19 was made on the basis of positive Computed Tomography scan in 39 patients and 30 patients had a positive Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction test. Overall, there were 29 proximal femoral fractures, 8 spine fractures, 7 fractures of the other bones. The fractures were treated surgically in 30 cases (68.18%) and the remaining 14 cases (31.82%) were managed conservatively. There were 16 patients (36.36%) who died, mostly due to respiratory failure with a median age of 82 years. Conclusion: COVID-19 has led to a significant reduction in a load of fracture patients globally, though the incidence of fragility fractures continues to be unaffected. There is a significantly higher risk of mortality in elderly patients with fractures and hence they should only be operated in a facility with a robust intensive care. Conservative treatment should be adopted as far as possible in non-obligatory fractures and in lesser equipped centers.

The success of delivering mass vaccination, on the scale of what would be applied to contain COVID-19, largely depends on the compliance of the public to programs mandated by public health officials. This study was aimed to evaluate the perception and possible hesitance of people in Jordan toward a tentative COVID-19 vaccine using self-administrated online survey. During the study period, a total of 1287 agreed to participate in the study. More than half of the participants (n = 734, 57%) were females and the majority (n = 893, 69%) had a University degree. Most of the participants (n = 871, 68%) believed that scientists have adequate tools to develop a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine and two-third of them (n = 861, 67%) believed that developing vaccines would end the pandemic. However, around half of them (n = 665, 52%) reported not having adequate information on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. Preference of study participants to achieve immunity against COVID-19 using natural way was the most commonly reported reason to refuse vaccination (n = 826, 64%), followed by their concern about adverse effects associated with the vaccine (n = 781, 61%). In conclusion, the sampled participants showed an overall positive attitude toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.

The main concerns include a lack of quality control, drug side effects, drug interactions, diversion and possible pathway to drug dependence. The internet offers increased availability and accessibility of these medicines through both legal routes obtaining pharmaceuticals on prescription and illegal routes via websites on both the surface and Dark Web. The impact of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic reduced face-to face access for non-COVID-19 related health conditions and to drug treatment services. This study provides an overview of the extent of online sourcing of UK controlled medicines (opioids, sedatives and GABA drugs) from unregulated suppliers and estimates of customer interest, in particular focusing on the COVID-19 lockdown period in the UK, where access to some healthcare services was limited. Whilst it was not possible to identify an increase for online searches for controlled medicines over the past five years, or during the COVID-19 period, searches remained plentiful, in particular for oxycodone, morphine and diazepam. This study highlights the need for enhanced pharmacovigilance of non-regulated online suppliers and the imperatives of continued health messaging around the potential abuse of these controlled drugs and the dangers of using sites purporting to be regulated pharmacies.","output":"Internet sourcing and UK end consumer trend interest in the controlled medicines (opioids, sedatives and GABA drugs) in pre and post COVID-19 timeframes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a persons everyday activities. Nowadays, we are in COVID-19 pandemic. From practice after COVID-19 illness resolves, some of the recovering patients return back smoothly to their pre-illness life. Others experience different mood changes. Anxiety and depression are the most common. Those patients with improving general health, radiology, and oxygenation have different somatic complaints such as sensation of dyspnoea. Psychological support and psychiatric evaluation can help them to overcome this situation and get rid of dyspnoea sensation. This work aimed to evaluate the relation between COVID-19 survivors and depression and to how extent this could affect functional status of the study participants. RESULTS: This work recruited 102 adult patients as a sample of Egyptians who were positive PCR for SARS-COV2, turned negative and free of symptoms for 1 month or more which include physicians, nurses, employees, and literate health care workers of Ain Shams University hospitals attending chest outpatient clinic for follow-up. The majority were 47.1% in age group (35C55 years), sixty two (60.8%) participants were females, 74.5% had high education, and 24.5% were smokers. The most frequent symptom reported by study participants as the most annoying COVID-19 symptom was fever (32.4%). Beck depression inventory score showed that 59 (57.8%) participants had no depression, 24 (23.5%) had mild depression, 16 (15.7%) had moderate depression, and only 3 (2.9%) participants had severe depression. Logistic regression analysis was done to measure effect of steroid use and grade of dyspnoea on development of moderate or severe post-COVID depression and showed that higher grades of dyspnoea were associated with higher probability of development of moderate or severe post-COVID depression (p value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: As predicted, COVID-19 survivors presented a high prevalence of psychiatric sequelae. Age, sex, and education level were important association factors. Higher educational level was associated with higher score of depression due to increased awareness of the current pandemic issue. Steroids use was proposed as a cause of depression since the majority of moderate or severe depression group were on steroids. Higher grades of dyspnoea were associated with higher probability of development of moderate or severe post-COVID depression. It is suggested that COVID-19 survivors should be assessed, to properly diagnose and treat any psychiatric conditions, to reduce the disease burden.","output":"Post-COVID depression among a sample of Egyptian patients and its associated factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neste artigo as metforas nominais que fazem alus?o  COVID-19 s?o analisadas, as quais s?o denominadas covitforas-19.

Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding. METHODS: In this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from 2 hospitals outside Wuhan. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 (13-22) days as measured from illness onset. When comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late (&#8805;15 days after illness onset) viral RNA clearance, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (P = .009), old age (P = .033), concomitant hypertension (P = .009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (P = .001), severe illness at admission (P = .049), invasive mechanical ventilation (P = .006), and corticosteroid treatment (P = .025). Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (P < .001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (P < .001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. Male sex (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.31-8.02), delayed hospital admission (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10-1.54), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR, 9.88; 95% CI, 1.11-88.02) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.

To elucidate responses to early HIV-1 replication, we studied blood pDCs in 29 HIV-infected participants who initiated antiretroviral therapy during acute infection and underwent analytic treatment interruption (ATI). An increased frequency of partially activated pDCs was observed in the blood prior to detection of HIV RNA. Concurrent with peak pDC frequency, there was a transient decline in the ability of pDCs to produce IFN in vitro, which correlated with decreased interferon regulatory factory 7 (IRF7) and NF-kB phosphorylation. Levels of phosphorylated IRF7 and NF-kB inversely correlated with plasma IFN2 levels, implying that pDCs were refractory to in vitro stimulation after IFN production in vivo. After ATI, decreased expression of IFN genes in pDCs inversely correlated with time to viral detection, suggesting that pDC IFN loss is part of an effective early immune response. These data, from a limited cohort, provide a critical first step in understanding the earliest immune response to HIV-1 and suggest that changes in blood pDC frequency and function can be used as an indicator of viral replication before detectable plasma viremia.","output":"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells sense HIV replication before detectable viremia following treatment interruption."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered global panic.

Interim results of a phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated favorable safety profile and immunogenicity and the vaccine has been authorized for use in Taiwan. However, waning antibody levels after immunization and variants of concern (VoC) could negatively impact vaccine-induced neutralization of virus. In this extension to the phase 1 clinical study we investigated a three-dose regimen of MVC-COV1901 for durability of antibody levels and virus neutralization capacity, including neutralization of the Omicron variant. METHODS: Forty-five healthy adults from 20 to 49 years of age were divided into three groups of 15 participants receiving two doses of either low dose (LD), medium dose (MD), or high dose (HD) of MVC-COV1901. Six months after the second dose (day 209), a third MD dose of MVC-COV1901 was administered to the LD and MD groups and a HD dose was given to the HD group. Safety was followed for up to 28 days after the booster dose by monitoring incidences of adverse events (AE). Immunogenicity and antibody persistence for up to 6 months after the booster dose were assessed by neutralizing assay with the wild-type (Wuhan) SARS-CoV-2 virus. To examine the immunogenicity of booster dose against variants, neutralizing assays were carried out with the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variant viruses and the Omicron variant pseudovirus using samples from 4 weeks after the booster dose. RESULTS: Adverse reactions after the booster dose were mostly mild and comparable to that of the first two doses. Compared to day 209, neutralizing antibodies were increased by 10.3C28.9 times at 4 weeks after the booster. During the 6-month follow-up after the booster, the rate of decline of neutralizing antibody level was much less than that after the second dose. Three doses of MVC-COV1901 also improved antibody-mediated neutralization of Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants as well as the Omicron variant pseudovirus. CONCLUSION: Our data showed increased persistence of neutralizing antibodies and enhancement of immunogenicity against VoCs offered after a third dose of MVC-COV1901.

Using bioinformatic approaches we tested the potential interactions of human miRNAs, expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells, with the available coronavirus genomes. Putative miRNA binding sites were then compared between pathogenic and non pathogenic virus groups. The pathogenic group shares 6 miRNA binding sites that can be potentially involved in the sequestration of miRNAs already known to be associated with deep vein thrombosis. We then analyzed 100k SARS-CoV-2 variant genomes for their potential interaction with human miRNAs and this study highlighted a group of 97 miRNA binding sites which is present in all the analyzed genomes. Among these, we identified 6 miRNA binding sites specific for SARS-CoV-2 and the other two pathogenic viruses whose down-regulation has been seen associated with deep vein thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, one of these miRNAs, namely miR-20a-5p, whose expression decreases with advancing age, is involved in cytokine signaling, cell differentiation and/or proliferation.

Total pericardiectomy is the most effective treatment and is traditionally performed via median sternotomy. With the increasing use of minimally invasive techniques, there have been reports of partial pericardiectomy via thoracoscopy but with suboptimal exposure and difficulty identifying both phrenic nerves. Robotic surgery offers both small incisions and enhanced visualization. We present four cases of robotic endoscopic off-pump total pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis. METHODS Four patients underwent off-pump total pericardiectomy with robotic assistance for constrictive pericarditis. All had constrictive physiology demonstrated by right heart catheterization and/or echocardiogram. One was also found to have coronary artery disease and underwent concurrent totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery. Ports were placed in the left second, fourth, and sixth intercostal spaces. The left lung was isolated and deflated with CO2 insufflation, aiding in exposure. With the use of electrocautery, the pericardium was removed first posterior to the left phrenic nerve, then anteriorly all the way to the right phrenic nerve, and caudally from the diaphragmatic reflection to the great vessel cephalad. A stabilizer in the subcostal fourth robotic arm was used to assist in the dissection. RESULTS Two of four patients were extubated within 6 hours after surgery and transferred to the floor on postoperative day 1. Both were discharged home by postoperative day 5. Two of four patients had preoperative sequelae from chronic constriction and necessitated longer hospital and intensive care unit stays but had improvement in symptoms and were discharged home within 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Total pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis can be performed using a robotic approach. In contrast to thoracoscopy, it offers better visualization of both phrenic nerves, avoids injury, and allows a thorough pericardial dissection. In our experience, the robotic left chest approach has proven more efficacious in removing the posterior pericardium than is allowed with median sternotomy.","output":"Robotic Endoscopic Off-Pump Total Pericardiectomy in Constrictive Pericarditis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not available.","output":"Temperature should not be measured on forearm with infrared thermometers for Covid-19 screening."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) uses about 800 times the diagnostic ultrasound power, which converges at a focal point to deliver energy above 60 degrees Celsius resulting in cell death by means of coagulation necrosis and cavitation destruction.

The most important and challenging problem here is to design an effective and robust diagnosis model. To this end, there are three challenges to overcome: (1) The lack of training samples limits the success of existing deep-learning-based methods. (2) Many public COVID-19 data sets contain only a few images without fine-grained labels. (3) Due to the explosive growth of suspected cases, it is urgent and important to diagnose not only COVID-19 cases but also the cases of other types of pneumonia that are similar to the symptoms of COVID-19. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Unsupervised Meta-Learning with Self-Knowledge Distillation to address the problem of differentiating COVID-19 from pneumonia cases. During training, our model cannot use any true labels and aims to gain the ability of learning to learn by itself. In particular, we first present a deep diagnosis model based on a relation network to capture and memorize the relation among different images. Second, to enhance the performance of our model, we design a self-knowledge distillation mechanism that distills knowledge within our model itself. Our network is divided into several parts, and the knowledge in the deeper parts is squeezed into the shallow ones. The final results are derived from our model by learning to compare the features of images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher performance than other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we construct a new COVID-19 pneumonia data set based on text mining, consisting of 2696 COVID-19 images (347 X-ray?+?2349 CT), 10,155 images (9661 X-ray?+?494 CT) about other types of pneumonia, and the fine-grained labels of all.

METHODS: The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test, Standard&#8482; Q COVID-19 Ag kit (SD Biosensor?, Republic of Korea), was compared with the real-time RT-PCR test, Allplex&#8482; 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene?, Korea) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens. Four hundred fifty-four respiratory samples (mainly nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were obtained from COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individuals, including pre-operative patients at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during March-May 2020. RESULTS: Of 454 respiratory samples, 60 (13.2%) were positive, and 394 (86.8%) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR assay. The duration from onset to laboratory test in COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individuals ranged from 0 to 14 days with a median of 3 days.

Seventy-five Japanese white rabbits were randomly divided into the control, model, and GSLC groups. The rabbits in the model group and the GSLC group received injection of prednisolone acetate. Meanwhile, rabbits in the GSLC group were treated by gavage at a therapeutic dose of GSLC once a day. The control group and the model group received the same volume of normal saline gavage. Three groups of serum samples were collected at different time points, and the changes in the metabolic spectrum were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The resulting data set was analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers related to GSLC treatment. The metabolic pathway was analyzed by MetaboAnalyst 4.0 and a heatmap was constructed using the HEML1.0.3.7 software package. In addition, histopathological and radiography studies were carried out to verify the anti-GIONFH effects of GSLC. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plots revealed a significant separation trend between the control group and the model group and the GSLC group (1C3 weeks), but there were no significant differences in the GSLC group (4C6 weeks).

The timely, safe, and efficient emergency disposal of MW is critical to prevent the epidemic spread. Therefore, this review presents the current status of MW generation and disposal in China and analyzes the characteristics and applicability of emergency disposal technologies. The results show that movable disposal facilities can dispose of infectious MW on site, even though most of their disposal capacity is at a low level (<5 t/day). Co-disposal facilities need to be reformed completely for emergency MW disposal, in which separate feeding systems should be taken seriously. Specifically, municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration facilities have great potential to improve emergency MW disposal capacities. For hazardous waste incineration facilities, compatibility of the wastes must be matched to the composition and calorific value of the waste. As for cement kiln, MW can only be used as an alternative fuel instead of a raw material for cement. Based on the environmental risk and technical adaptability, the six emergency MW disposal technologies are recommended to be prioritized as follows: movable microwave sterilization, movable steam sterilization, movable incineration, co-incineration with hazardous waste, co-incineration with MSW and co-disposal in cement kilns. Infectious MW, especially COVID-19 MW, should be prioritized for disposal by centralized and movable disposal facilities, while non-infectious MW can be disposed of using co-disposal facilities. All stakeholders should strengthen the delicacy management of the end-of-life stage of MW, including collection, classification, packaging identification, transportation, and disposal. Currently, it is necessary for centralized disposal enterprises to follow the emergency disposal operation flowchart.

More specifically, the study focused on prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, the extent to which individuals with existing symptoms recovered or not, the prevalence of subtypes of loneliness, and the extent to which loneliness before and during this pandemic was associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. METHODS: Data was extracted from the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a probability sample of the Dutch population, with assessments on loneliness in October 2019 (T1) and June 2020 (T4), and anxiety and depression symptoms in November 2019 (T2), March 2020 (T3) and June 2020 (T4; N(total) = 4,084). Loneliness was examined with the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and anxiety and depression symptoms with the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). RESULTS: Repeated measures multivariate logistic regression analyses (RMMLRA) showed a statistical significant lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms after the outbreak (T4 = 15.3%) than before (T2 = 16.8%) and during the COVID-19 outbreak (T3 = 17.2%). According to the Reliable Change Index, the distribution of recovery categories (remission, improvement, unchanged and worsening symptoms) after the outbreak did not differ significantly from the distribution of these categories before the outbreak. RMMLRA revealed that the prevalence of emotional loneliness increased significantly after the outbreak (T1 = 18.4%, T4 = 24.8%). Among individuals who were not lonely before and after the outbreak the prevalence of symptoms decreased significantly (T2 = 7.0%, T4 = 4.4%) and, likewise, among those who were not lonely anymore after the outbreak (T2 = 21.5%, T4 = 14.5%). However, the prevalence of symptoms increased significantly among those who became lonely during the pandemic (T2 = 17.9%, T4 = 26.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that this pandemic did not negatively affect the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms nor the normal recovery of symptoms among the general population during the first four months, but that emotional loneliness increased.","output":"Anxiety and depression symptoms, the recovery from symptoms, and loneliness before and after the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population: Findings from a Dutch population-based longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we evaluated the mitigative role of phosphorus (P) in terms of manganese (Mn) toxicity in peach (Prunus persica L.) plants. Ten-day-old seedlings were treated with excess Mn (1 mM MnSO4) alone and in combination with different P levels (100, 150, 200 and 250 M KH2PO4) in half-strength Hoagland medium. The results demonstrated that Mn toxicity plants accumulated a significant amount of Mn in their tissues, and the concentration was higher in roots than in leaves. The accumulated Mn led to a considerable reduction in plant biomass, water status, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, and disrupted the chloroplast ultrastructure by increasing oxidative stress (H2O2 and O2a?-). However, P supplementation dramatically improved plant biomass, leaf relative water and chlorophyll contents, upregulating the ascorbate-glutathione pool and increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase; peroxidase dismutase; ascorbate peroxidase; monodehydroascorbate reductase; dehydroascorbate reductase), thus reducing oxidative damage as evidenced by lowering H2O2 and O2a?- staining intensity. Moreover, P application markedly restored stomatal aperture and improved chloroplast ultrastructure, as indicated by the improved performance of photosynthetic machinery. Altogether, our findings suggest that P (250 M) has a great potential to induce tolerance against Mn toxicity by limiting Mn accumulation in tissues, upregulating antioxidant defense mechanisms, alleviating oxidative damage, improving chloroplast ultrastructure and photosynthetic performance in peach plants.","output":"Phosphorus confers tolerance against manganese toxicity in Prunus persica by reducing oxidative stress and improving chloroplast ultrastructure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Overcoming pandemics, such as the current Covid-19 outbreak, requires the manufacture of several billion doses of vaccines within months.

Treatment and evolution in octogenarians are not well defined. Our objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, the treatments and its clinical evolution. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted in the period between March 23 and April 12, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with pneumonia by radiological study or chest tomography, whith STC criteria and who received treatment. We classified patients as those who received only glucocorticoid (GC) pulses, or GC and tocilizumab pulses. We determined serum levels of ferritin, CRP and D-dimers. The final variable was survival. RESULTS: 21 patients, (80-88 years). The mean ferritin was 1056 microg/L (317-3,553), CRP 115.8mg/dL (22-306) and D-dimers 2.9m/L (0.45-17.5). All patients received GC pulses and in 2 cases simultaneously tocilizumab. The mean follow-up time was 13.7 days (8-21). The overall mortality was 38.1% (8/21 patients). The 2 patients who received tocilizumab died. The deceased had significantly higher levels of ferritin (1,254 vs. 925microg/L; P=.045) and CRP (197.6 vs. 76mg / dL; P=.007). At the end of the follow-up, a decrease in the biochemical parameters was observed with ferritin of 727microg/L, CRP of 27mg/dl and D-dimers of 1.18mg/L. In 13/21 patients (61.9%), the CTS was controlled without the need to add other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: STC mortality from SARS-CoV-2 is high despite treatment. A greater inflammatory response was associated with a higher mortality. Although it seems that the early use of GC pulses could control it, and the use of other treatments such as tocilizumab shouldo be, with the study design and its limitations, this conclusion cannot be stablished.","output":"Tratamiento y evolucin del sndrome de tormenta de citoquinas asociados a infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 en pacientes octogenarios./ [Evolution and treatment of storm cytoquine syndrome associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection among octogenarians]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus outbreak, physical distancing restrictions led to the cancellation of live, large-group events worldwide.

Standing body height, arm span, menarchal status, Risser staging, distal radius and ulna (DRU) classification, Sanders staging (SS), Cobb angles (major and minor curves), and Lenke curve types at initial presentation were examined. Patients with/without curve deterioration were compared. Multiple linear regression was used for predicting final body height (cm), and remaining height increase (%). RESULTS Baseline body height was 152.1  7.1 cm and major curve Cobb angle was 27.1  7.4, whereas at maturity they were 159.5  5.4 cm and 32.5  9.3, respectively. For patients presented at Risser stage 0 or 1, radius grade (R) 6, ulnar grade (U) 5, or SS3, those with curve deterioration exhibited greater height increase potential at initial presentation (P < .05) than those without deterioration. No intergroup difference was found for patients presented at Risser 2, R7, U6, SS4. Predictive baseline parameters were age, body height, Cobb angle (major curve), curve type, and DRU grades.

As such, the purpose of this study was to examine walking pattern variability by way of lower extremity coordination and spatio-temporal characteristics in children with autism compared with individuals with typical development during over-ground walking. METHODS: Bilateral continuous relative phase variability was computed for the thigh-leg, leg-foot, and thigh-foot segment couples for 11 children with autism and 9 children with typical development at each gait sub-phase. Furthermore, left and right stride lengths and stride width were computed and compared. The Model Statistic was utilized to test for statistical differences in variability between each child with autism to an aggregate group with typical development. Effect sizes were computed to determine the meaningfulness between responses for children with autism and typical development. Coefficient of variation and effect sizes were computed for stride lengths and stride width. FINDINGS: Analysis revealed that children with autism exhibited differences in variability in each gait sub-phase. Notably, all but two children with autism exhibited lesser variability in all segment couples during terminal swing. Differences in stride lengths were relatively minimal, however, greater coefficient of variation magnitudes in stride width were observed in children with autism. INTERPRETATION: This finding reveals that children with autism may have limited or a preferred movement strategy when preparing the foot for ground contact.

Contrary to type I IFNs, the effect of IFN- cytokines is largely limited to epithelial cells due to the restricted pattern of expression of their specific receptor. Several genome-wide association studies have established a strong correlation between polymorphism in the region of IL-28B gene (encoding for IFN-3) and both spontaneous and therapeutic IFN-mediated clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the mechanism(s) underlying this enhanced viral clearance are not fully understood. IFN-3 directly inhibits HCV replication, and in vitro studies suggest that polymorphism in the IFN-3 and its recently identified overlapping IFN-4 govern the pattern of ISGs induced upon HCV infection of hepatocytes. IFN- can also be produced by dendritic cells, and apart from its antiviral action on hepatocytes, it can regulate the inflammatory response of monocytes/macrophages, thus acting at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity.

METHODS: In this surveillance cohort, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided consultation to public health and healthcare professionals to identify PUI for SARS-CoV-2 testing by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics of PUI were reported by public health and healthcare professionals during consultation with on-call CDC clinicians and subsequent submission of a CDC PUI Report Form. Characteristics of laboratory-negative and laboratory-positive persons were summarized as proportions for the period of January 17?February 29, and characteristics of all PUI were compared before and after February 12 using prevalence ratios. RESULTS: A total of 36 PUI tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were classified as confirmed cases. Confirmed cases and PUI testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 had similar demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics.

Our objective is to assess patients self-reported impact of health care lockdown measures on their fears and anxieties during the crisis period of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. METHODS: We conducted a digital, self-reported, patient care survey distributed by an e-mail at Columbia Universitys Department of Ophthalmology outpatient faculty practice. Inclusion criteria were age greater than or equal to 18 years, a diagnosis of either retinal disease or glaucoma, and a canceled or rescheduled ophthalmology established patient appointment during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Patients without an e-mail address listed in their electronic medical records were excluded. The survey occurred between March 2, 2020, to May 30, 2020. Primary measures were survey responses to assess key areas of patient anxiety or concern during the pandemic including the safety of care delivery in a COVID pandemic, difficulties contacting or being seen by their ophthalmologist, concern of vision loss or disease progression, and concern over missed or access to treatments. Secondary measures were correlating survey response to factors such as visual acuity, intraocular pressure, diagnosis, disease severity, follow-up urgency, recent treatments, and diagnostic testing data. RESULTS: Of the 2594 surveys sent out, 510 (19.66%) were completed. Over 95% of patients were at least as concerned as in normal circumstances about their ocular health during the peak of the pandemic. Overall, 76% of respondents were more concerned than normal that they could not be seen by their ophthalmologist soon enough. Increased concern over ocular health, disease progression, and access to care all showed positive correlations (P<0.05) with worse disease severity as measured with testing such as visual fields and optical coherence tomography.

DESIGN: We conducted an international prospective study across Europe on liver transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by microbiological assay during the first outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, management of immunosuppressive therapy and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 57 patients were included (70% male, median (IQR) age at diagnosis 65 (57C70) years). 21 (37%), 32 (56%) and 21 (37%) patients had one cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, respectively. The most common symptoms were fever (79%), cough (55%), dyspnoea (46%), fatigue or myalgia (56%) and GI symptoms (33%). Immunosuppression was reduced in 22 recipients (37%) and discontinued in 4 (7%). With this regard, no impact on outcome was observed. Forty-one (72%) subjects were hospitalised and 11 (19%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Significant changes have had to be made to the way in which non-COVID-19-related care has been delivered. Our objective was to understand, from the perspective of patients with a chronic, life-long condition (congenital heart disease, CHD) and their parents/carers, the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of care, how changes were communicated and whether healthcare providers should do anything differently in a subsequent wave of COVID-19 infections. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study involving a series of asynchronous discussion forums set up and moderated by three patient charities via their Facebook pages. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with CHD and parents/carers of patients with CHD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative responses to questions posted on the discussion forums. RESULTS: The forums ran over a 6-week period and involved 109 participants. Following thematic analysis, we identified three themes and 10 subthemes related to individual condition-related factors, patient-related factors and health professional/centre factors that may have influenced how patients and parents/carers experienced changes to service delivery as a result of COVID-19. Specifically, respondents reported high levels of disruption to the delivery of care, inconsistent advice and messaging and variable communication from health professionals, with examples of both excellent and very poor experiences of care reported. Uncertainty about follow-up and factors related to the complexity and stability of their condition contributed to anxiety and stress. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of clear, consistent communication cannot be over-estimated. Our findings, while collected in relation to patients with CHD, are not necessarily specific to this population and we believe that they reflect the experiences of many thousands of people with life-long conditions in the UK. Recommendations related to communication, service delivery and support during the pandemic may improve patients experience of care and, potentially, their outcomes.","output":"What was the impact of the first wave of COVID-19 on the delivery of care to children and adults with congenital heart disease?

A very strict lockdown at home was imposed with a tough restriction of mobility. We aimed to evaluate the impact of this exceptional scenario on glucose profile of patients with T1D prone to hypoglycemia using standalone continuous glucose monitoring. Methods Patients with T1D prone to hypoglycemia using multiple daily injections and either a Dexcom G5? or a Free Style Libre? CGM systems for at least 6 months under the funding of National Health Service were included in an observational, retrospective study. Data were collected in two periods: pre-lockdown (PL), February 23rd-March 7th and within lockdown (WL), April 1st-14th 2020. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of time in target glucose range of 70C180 mg/dL (TIR). Additional glucometric data were also analysed. Results 92 patients were included: 40 women, age 42.83.9 years, disease duration of 23.112.6 years. Seventeen patients used Dexcom G5? and 75 Free Style Libre?. TIR 70C180 mg/dL (59.316.2 vs 62.615.2%), time >180 (34.418.0 vs 30.716.9%), >250 (11.110.6 vs 9.2  9.7%) and Glucose Management Indicator (7.20.8 vs 7.00.8%) significantly improved (PL vs WL, respectively, p<0.05).

RECENT FINDINGS: Combining mechanistic models and machine learning algorithms has led to improvements in the treatment of Shigella and tuberculosis through the development of novel compounds. Modeling of the epidemic dynamics of malaria at the within-host and between-host level has afforded the development of more effective vaccination and antimalarial therapies. Similarly, in-host and host-host models have supported the development of new HIV treatment modalities and an improved understanding of the immune involvement in influenza.

DESIGN: Open label, parallel arm, phase II, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 39 public and private hospitals across India. PARTICIPANTS: 464 adults (&#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital (screened 22 April to 14 July 2020) with confirmed moderate covid-19 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio between 200 mm Hg and 300 mm Hg or a respiratory rate of more than 24/min with oxygen saturation 93% or less on room air): 235 were assigned to convalescent plasma with best standard of care (intervention arm) and 229 to best standard of care only (control arm). INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the intervention arm received two doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma, transfused 24 hours apart. The presence and levels of neutralising antibodies were not measured a priori; stored samples were assayed at the end of the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Composite of progression to severe disease (PaO2/FiO2 <100 mm Hg) or all cause mortality at 28 days post-enrolment. RESULTS: Progression to severe disease or all cause mortality at 28 days after enrolment occurred in 44 (19%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (18%) in the control arm (risk difference 0.008 (95% confidence interval -0.062 to 0.078); risk ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.54).

Several meta-analyses have since presented associated risk ratios (RR) over the baseline per-act transmission probability (PATP) usually in the range of 2C5. Here we review all relevant observational studies and meta-analyses, and show that the estimation of RRs was, in most cases, biased by assuming the presence of GUD at any time during long follow-up periods, while active genital ulcers were present in a small proportion of the time. Only two studies measured the GUD co-factor effect in PATPs focusing on acts in which ulcers were present, and both found much higher RRs (in the range 11C112). We demonstrate that these high RRs can be reconciled with the studies on which currently accepted low RRs were based, if the calculations are restricted to the actual GUD episodes. Our results indicate that the effect of genital ulcers on the PATP of HIV might be much greater than currently accepted.

In January 2021 three asynchronous online focus groups were held using MRQual, a web-based platform, which included 46 MDs from all three levels of the healthcare system in Croatia. NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software package, was used for the thematic analysis of collected data. The participants expressed a high level of support for the Croatian immunization program and vaccines in general. However, some skepticism was expressed regarding new vaccines and the regulatory processes of their approval. A significant number of participants raised concerns over the approval of COVID-19 vaccines, especially given their rapid development. The results also revealed that the process of communication with patients is often based on the very elaborate categorizations of patients based on previous experience, which leads to prioritizing and a communication breakup when dealing with problematic patients. MDs find themselves in a delicate situation where a fine balance between time-consuming communication with patients and the demands for maintaining satisfying vaccination uptake is needed. The situation arises from a social roles conflict that is embedded in wider social values and expectations, since communication problems do not arise in the doctors office, and therefore cannot be solved without addressing the social forces that cause trust deficiencies.

This constituted the first study to report on the variability in physicochemical properties of ?-glucans extracts from the same edible mushroom Lentinus edodes on the reduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Specifically, the impact on the immunomodulatory and cytoprotective properties of our novel in 'house' (IH-Lentinan, IHL) and a commercial (Carbosynth-Lentinan, CL) Lentinan extract were investigated using in vitro models of lung injury and macrophage phagocytosis. CL comprised higher amounts of &#945;-glucans and correspondingly less ?-glucans. The two lentinan extracts demonstrated varying immunomodulatory activities. Both Lentinan extracts reduced cytokine-induced NF-&#954;B activation in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, with the IHL extract proving more effective at lower doses. In contrast, in activated THP-1 derived macrophages, the CL extract more effectively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-&#945;, IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, IL-22) as well as TGF-? and IL-10. The CL extract attenuated oxidative stress-induced early apoptosis, while the IHL extract attenuated late apoptosis.

For example, even when under strict stay-at-home orders, numerous jurisdictions granted exceptions and/or were in close proximity to locations with entirely different regulations in place. Here, we investigate the impact of such geographic inconsistencies in epidemic control policies by coupling search and mobility data to a simple mathematical model of SARS-COV2 transmission. Our results show that while stay-at-home orders decrease contacts in most areas of the US, some specific activities and venues often see an increase in attendance. Indeed, over the month of March 2020, between 10 and 30% of churches in the US saw increases in attendance; even as the total number of visits to churches declined nationally. This heterogeneity, where certain venues see substantial increases in attendance while others close, suggests that closure can cause individuals to find an open venue, even if that requires longer-distance travel. And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churches in the US rose by 13% over the same period. Strikingly, our model reveals that across a broad range of model parameters, partial measures can often be worse than none at all where individuals not complying with policies by traveling to neighboring areas can create epidemics when the outbreak would otherwise have been controlled.

METHODS: We investigated the viral loads, therapies, clinical features, and immune responses in a 70-year patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 3 months. FINDINGS: The patient exhibited the highest prevalence of abnormal indices of clinical features and immune responses at the first admission, including fever (38.3 ), decreased lymphocytes (0.83  10(9)/L) and serum potassium (3.1 mmol/L), as well as elevated serum creatinine (115 mol/L), urea (8.6 mmol/L), and C-reactive protein (80 mg/L). By contrast, at the second and the third admission, these indices were all normal. Through three admissions, IL-2 increased from 0.14 pg/mL, 0.69 pg/mL, to 0.91 pg/mL, while IL-6 decreased from 11.78 pg/mL, 1.52 pg/mL, to 0.69 pg/mL, so did IL-10 from 5.13 pg/mL, 1.85 pg/mL, to 1.75 pg/mL.

The patient also showed substantially improved acute exudative lesions on the chest CT scanning images. CONCLUSIONS: The patient displayed declining immune responses in spite of the viral shedding for 3 months.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a brief online Mindfulness and Compassion-based Intervention to promote mental health among first year university students during COVID-19 home confinement. Methods: Participants (n=66) were first-year psychology students from a university in Spain with no prior meditation experience. Intervention lasted for 16 days and was designed ad-hoc. Using a pre-post within-subjects design, feasibility was assessed in five domains (acceptability, satisfaction, implementation, practicality, and limited efficacy testing). Participants completed both baseline and post-intervention assessments of perceived stress, anxiety, and self-compassion. Results: The intervention showed to be feasible in all domains evaluated. It was implemented as planned with constrained resources, and limited efficacy testing showed promising results. After the intervention, stress and anxiety levels decreased significantly (p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.5146; p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.6068, respectively) whereas self-compassion levels were augmented significantly (p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.6968). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a brief online mindfulness and compassion intervention may be a feasible way of promoting mental health among university students during COVID-19 lockdown. Further studies are required to address the limitations of the present study. We conclude that online interventions may constitute a promising pathway to buffer the mental health burden derived from the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Feasibility of a Brief Online Mindfulness and Compassion-Based Intervention to Promote Mental Health Among University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading around the world.

Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AMSTAR 2) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 6 SRs published between 1999 and 2018 were identified and included in the overview. The SRs included between 1 and 37 primary studies representing between 140 to 908 patients. All of the primary studies included in the SRs were carried out in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and examined pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or combined interventions. One high quality SR found mixed results for the effectiveness of hand hygiene to prevent infection (2 studies statistically significant positive results, 1 study non-statistically significant results). One moderate quality SR with meta-analysis found a moderate non-statistically significant effect for personal protective equipment (PPE) in preventing infection and found no statistically significant results for the effectiveness of social isolation. One moderate quality SR reported statically significant evidence for the effectiveness of amantadine and amantadine + PPE to prevent infection with respiratory illness in LTCF.

AIMS: To evaluate the role of BCAA in improving muscle mass in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with cirrhosis having sarcopenia. METHODS: Consecutive patients with cirrhosis with ChildCPugh score < 10 and sarcopenia were randomized to receive either 12 g/day of BCAA orally or a placebo (1:1) for 6 months in addition to a home-based exercise program (30 min/day), dietary counselling and standard medical therapy. Sarcopenia was defined according to gender-specific axial skeletal muscle index (SMI) cut-offs. The primary endpoint was a change in muscle mass based on CT scan (SMI) after 6 months of supplementation. RESULTS: Sixty patients [mean age 41.6  9.9 years; males (66.6%) of predominantly viral (40%) and alcohol-related (31.7%) cirrhosis] were randomized. Baseline clinical and demographic characters were similar except MELD score (10.2  2.8 vs. 12.2  3.5, p = 0.02) and calorie intake (1838.1 kcal  631.5 vs. 2217.5 kcal  707.3, p = 0.03), both being higher in the placebo arm.

However, only a minority of them will have an HLA-identical sibling donor; unrelated donors, matched or partially mismatched, have been used successfully for patients lacking a related donor. Even though results with allogeneic transplants using unrelated donors are encouraging, the incidence of complications including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection or late graft failure is increased compared to identical sibling transplants. The combination of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) has been used as an effective preparative regimen for allogeneic transplants, however, the total dosage and dosing schedule of both the cyclophosphamide and TBI has varied significantly among studies. To decrease the rate of graft rejection and late graft failure with volunteer donors, we evaluated a preparative regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg over 4 consecutive days, days ?8, ?7, ?6, ?5) followed by fractionated TBI (1400 cGy administered in eight fractions over 4 days, days ?4, ?3, ?2, ?1). GVHD prophylaxis included FK506 and methotrexate. From July 1993 to January 1996, 43 adult patients, median age 38 years (range 18C58 years), were treated with this preparative regimen. Seventeen patients had low-risk disease and 26 had high-risk disease. Thirty-one donor/recipient pairs were matched for HLA-A, -B, and -DR by serology and molecular typing. Seven additional pairs were minor mismatched at the HLA-A or HLA-B loci. Four other donor/recipient pairs were HLA-A,-B, and -DR identical by serology but allele mismatched at either DRB1 or DQB. Forty patients were evaluable for myeloid engraftment. Engraftment occurred in all 40 patients at a median of 19 days. There were no cases of graft rejection or late graft failure. Nephrotoxicity was the primary adverse event with 26 patients (60%) experiencing a doubling of their creatinine. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease occurred in seven patients, six of whom had high-risk disease. All patients who had relapsed or refractory disease prior to BMT achieved a complete remission following BMT. Six patients transplanted for high-risk disease relapsed a median of 377 days post-BMT. None of the patients with low-risk disease have relapsed following transplant; the KaplanCMeier survival for those patients with low-risk disease is 62% and 37% for those patients transplanted with high-risk disease (P = 0.0129). The median Karnofsky performance status is 100% (range 70C100%). Therefore, a preparative regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide and fractionated TBI is an acceptable regimen for patients receiving an allograft from unrelated donors.","output":"Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with matched unrelated donors for patients with hematologic malignancies using a preparative regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide and fractionated total body irradiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This randomized clinical study compared the feasibility and safety of the shortest suture for bidirectional knotless barbed versus standard sutures, with either extracorporeal or intracorporeal knots, for vaginal cuff closure following total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and lymph node dissection for early endometrial cancer. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study design was Canadian Task Force Classification I. In tertiary-care university-based teaching hospitals, 61 women underwent TLH and lymph node dissection. In accord with randomization, the vaginal cuff in TLH was closed with either extracorporeal or intracorporeal knots (1-Monocryl(?); Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ) and a bidirectional knotless barbed suture (0-Quill?; Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). All patients were evaluated at 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year follow-up. RESULTS Time required to suture was significantly lower in the group treated with bidirectional suture than in groups with traditional sutures (P<.001). No significant difference was observed in the operative time between the study groups. The degree of surgical difficulty was significantly lower in the bidirectional barbed suture group than in the other groups. At 1-year follow-up all patients presented no wound dehiscence, no bleeding, dyspareunia, and other potential major complications such as ureteric, bladder, or bowel injury.

On the other hand, serological testing for COVID-19 may offer advantages in detecting possibly overlooked infections by NAAT. METHODS: To evaluate seroconversion of NAAT-negative pneumonia patients, immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were semiquantified by an immunofluorescence assay. Seroconversion was confirmed by another serological method, targeting the nucleocapsid protein. RESULTS: Eight suspected but unconfirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients (median age, 39 years; range, 21-55) were included. The median period between symptom onset and NAAT sample collection was 6 days (2-27 days). None of them had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NAAT. In contrast, all eight patients revealed seropositivity with the two serological methods, indicating actual seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2.

While several studies identified specific particle characteristics driving respiratory toxicity of low-solubility and low-toxicity particles such as CNP, the major lung cell type, which initiates and drives that response, remains still uncertain. Since alveolar macrophages (AM) are known to effectively phagocytose inhaled particles and play a crucial role for the initiation of pulmonary inflammation caused by invading microbes, we aimed to determine their role for sterile stimuli such as CNP by profiling the primary alveolar cell compartments of the lung. We exposed C57BL/6 mice to 20 g CNP by intratracheal instillation and comprehensively investigated the expression of the underlying mediators during a time span of 3 to 72 h in three different lung cell populations: CD45- (negative) structural cells, CD45+ (positive) leukocytes, and by BAL recovered cells. RESULTS: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis revealed an acute inflammatory response characterized by the most prominent culmination of neutrophil granulocytes from 12 to 24 h after instillation, which declined to basal levels by day 7. As early as 3 h after CNP exposure 50 % of the AM revealed particle laden. BAL concentrations and lung gene expression profiles of TNF, and the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1,-2 and-5 preceded the neutrophil recruitment and showed highest levels after 12 h of CNP exposure, pointing to a significant activation of the inflammation-evoking lung cells at this point of time. AM, isolated from lungs 3 to 12 h after CNP instillation, however, did not show a pro-inflammatory signature. On the contrary, gene expression analysis of different lung cell populations isolated 12 h after CNP instillation revealed CD45-, mainly representing alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells as major producer of inflammatory CXCL cytokines. Particularly by CD45- cells expressed Cxcl5 proved to be the most abundant chemokine, being 12 h after CNP exposure 24 (11) fold induced. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that AM are noninvolved in the initiation of the inflammatory response. ATII cells, which induced highest CXCL levels early on, might in contrast be the driver of acute neutrophilic inflammation upon pulmonary CNP exposure.

In vitro, rat alveolar macrophages were treated with or without exosomes in the presence of 10 g/ml LPS for 24 h. Cell viability was determined with Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Apoptotic ratio was determined with TUNEL and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. The levels of miR-384-5p and autophagy-associated genes were measured by RT-qPCR and western blot. Autophagy was observed by TEM and assessed by means of the mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus transfection assay. In vivo, we constructed LPS-induced ALI rat models. Exosomes were injected into rats via the caudal vein or trachea 4 h later after LPS treatment. The lung histological pathology was determined by H&E staining. Pulmonary vascular permeability was assessed by wet-to-dry weight ratio and Evans blue dye leakage assay, and inflammatory cytokines in serum and BALF were measured by ELISA. Furthermore, the therapeutic mechanism involved in miR-384-5p and Beclin-1 was determined. The results showed that BMSC-derived exosomes were taken up by the alveolar macrophages and attenuated LPS-induced alveolar macrophage viability loss and apoptosis. Exosomes effectively improved the survival rate of ALI rats within 7 days, which was associated with alleviating lung pathological changes and pulmonary vascular permeability and attenuating inflammatory response. Furthermore, this study for the first time found that miR-384-5p was enriched in BMSC-derived exosomes, and exosomal miR-384-5p resulted in relieving LPS-injured autophagy disorder in alveolar macrophages by targeting Beclin-1.

In this study, we sought to use this signal transduction conduit against them by inhibiting multiple kinases that influence translation. Previous work indicated that several kinases involved in translation, including p70 S6K, p90RSK, ERK, and p38 MAPK, are phosphorylated following Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection. Furthermore, inhibiting p70 S6K through treatment with the FDA approved drug rapamycin prevents RVFV pathogenesis in a mouse model of infection. We hypothesized that inhibiting either p70 S6K, p90RSK, or p90RSKs upstream kinases, ERK and p38 MAPK, would decrease translation and subsequent viral replication. Treatment with the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 resulted in decreased phosphorylation of translational proteins and reduced RVFV titers. In contrast, treatment with the p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870, p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580, or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 alone had minimal influence on RVFV titers.

Ophthalmology features certain specialty-specific red flag signs and symptoms, which pose a challenge for educators in ophthalmology. To support medical students in identifying those red flags we developed and implemented interactive cases for our e?learning platform. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of seven interactive cases with key feature problems regarding potentially dangerous signs and symptoms, such as painless loss of vision or red eye were developed. Medical students were guided through a case and performed formative assessments. The interactive cases were created with e?learning authoring software and were available on the learning management system presence of the department of ophthalmology. They were mandatory for medical students in the ophthalmology course. Students evaluated the cases after the course. RESULTS: The interactive cases were rated on average at 1.51  0.68 (mean  standard deviation; n = 163) on a grade scale (1 = best, 6 = worst). On a Likert scale they were perceived as helpful for individual learning at 1.60  0.81 (1 = very helpful, 7 = not helpful at all; n = 164). The information provided on the cases and selection of scenarios was positively evaluated. CONCLUSION: To support students in identifying and managing ophthalmic emergencies in the context of limited time in tightly packed curricula, interactive key feature cases can be part of corresponding e?learning resources.

This threshold is denoted by  which depends on white and jump noises. The effects of these noises on the dynamics of the model are studied. The numerical experiments show that the random perturbation introduced in the stochastic model suppresses disease outbreak as compared to its deterministic counterpart. In other words, the impact of the noises on the extinction and persistence is high. When the noise is large or small, our numerical findings show that COVID-19 vanishes from the population if &lt;1;whereas the epidemic cannot go out of control if &gt;1. From this, we observe that white noise and jump noise have a significant effect on the spread of COVID-19 infection, i.e., we can conclude that the stochastic model is more realistic than the deterministic one.

Infection is spread by both known cases and hidden, undetected asymptomatic cases. Asymptomatic individuals are people who transmit the virus but display no clinical symptoms. Current evidence reveals that this population is a major contributing factor to the spread of the disease. There is little or no knowledge of the scale of the hidden prevalence of all infections both asymptomatic and symptomatic in Ireland. Furthermore, as governments plan for the roll out of imminent immunisation programmes, the need to know the scale of the hidden prevalence and hence knowledge of the level of immunisation required is essential. We describe and analyse the numbers of reported cases of COVID-19 in Ireland from the first case in February 2020 to mid-December 2020. Using the method of back-calculation we provide estimates of the asymptomatic prevalence of cases from June to December 2020. The descriptive analysis highlighted two epidemic waves of known cases in the time period. Wave two from June to December included twice as many cases as wave one and cases were significantly younger. The back-calculation estimates of asymptomatic prevalence during this time period revealed that for every case known there was an additional unknown case and total prevalence in wave two was estimated to be approximately 95,000 as opposed to the reported 48,390 cases. As prevalence in wave two is known to be spreading within and from younger age groups the role of mixing patterns on spread needs to be disseminated to the wider public to adequately inform them how personal modifications in behaviour can contribute to the control of the epidemic.

Curcumin, a potent dietary anti-oxidant with known anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties, was assessed for therapeutic benefits. However, the major caveat of this polyphenol is its low water solubility and limited bioavailability. Therefore, Self Nano-Emulsifying Curcumin (SNEC30) was used to treat mice exposed to arsenic.

The impact of COVID-19 is due to both its rapid spread and its severity, but the determinants of severity have not been fully delineated. Objective: Identify factors associated with hospitalization and disease severity in a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We analyzed data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati health system from March 13, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Severe COVID-19 was defined as admission to intensive care unit or death. Logistic regression modeling adjusted for covariates was used to identify the factors associated with hospitalization and severe COVID-19. Results: Among the 689 COVID-19 patients included in our study, 29.2% were non-Hispanic White, 25.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 32.5% were Hispanic, and 12.8% were of other race/ethnicity. About 31.3% of patients were hospitalized and 13.2% had severe disease.

COVID-19 has rapidly spread among human populations and other mammals. The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a global challenge. Mathematical models of epidemiological systems enable studying and predicting the potential spread of disease. Modeling and predicting the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in near real-time is a scientific challenge, this requires a deep understanding of the dynamics of pandemics and the possibility that the diffusion process can be completely random. In this paper, we develop and analyze a model to simulate the Coronavirus transmission dynamics based on Reservoir-People transmission network.When faced with a potential outbreak, decision-makers need to be able to trust mathematical models for their decision-making processes. One of the most considerable characteristics of COVID-19 is its different behaviors in various countries and regions, or even in different individuals, which can be a sign of uncertain and accidental behavior in the disease outbreak. This trait reflects the existence of the capacity of transmitting perturbations across its domains. We construct a stochastic environment because of parameters random essence and introduce a stochastic version of theReservoir-Peoplemodel. Then we prove the uniqueness and existence of the solution on the stochastic model. Moreover, the equilibria of the system are considered. Also, we establish the extinction of the disease under some suitable conditions. Finally, some numerical simulation and comparison are carried out to validate the theoretical results and the possibility of comparability of the stochastic model with the deterministic model. ? 2022 Tech Science Press.

The many risks to the wellbeing of HCWs are not well understood. Of the literature, there is a paucity of information around how to best prevent psychological distress, and what steps are needed to mitigate harm to HCWs wellbeing. METHODS: A systematic review using PRISMA methodology was used to investigate the psychological impact on HCWs facing epidemics or pandemics, using three electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE and CINAHL), dating back to 2002 until the 21st of August 2020. The search strategy included terms for HCWs (e.g., nurse and doctor), mental health (e.g., wellbeing and psychological), and viral outbreaks (e.g., epidemic and pandemic). Only studies with greater than 100 frontline HCWs (i.e. doctors or nurses in close proximity to infected patients) were included. RESULTS: A total of 55 studies were included, with 53 using quantitative methodology and 2 were qualitative. 50 of the quantitative studies used validated measurement tools while 5 used novel questionnaires. The studies were conducted across various countries and included people with SARS (13 studies), Ebola (1), MERS (3) and COVID-19 (38). Findings suggest that the psychological implications to HCWs are variable with several studies demonstrating an increased risk of acquiring a trauma or stress-related disorders, depression and anxiety. Fear of the unknown or becoming infected were at the forefront of the mental challenges faced. Being a nurse and being female appeared to confer greater risk. In past epidemics, the perceived stigma from family members and society heightened negative implications; predominantly stress and isolation. Coping strategies varied amongst the contrasting sociocultural settings and appeared to differ amongst doctors, nurses and other HCWs. Implemented changes, and suggestions for prevention in the future consistently highlighted the need for greater psychosocial support and clearer dissemination of disease-related information. CONCLUSION: This review can inform current and future research priorities in the maintenance of wellbeing amongst frontline HCWs. Change needs to start at the level of policy-makers to offer an enhanced variety of supports to HCWs who play a critical role during largescale disease outbreaks. Psychological implications are largely negative and require greater attention to be mitigated, potentially through the involvement of psychologists, raised awareness and better education. The current knowledge of therapeutic interventions suggests they could be beneficial but more long-term follow-up is needed.","output":"The psychological impact of COVID-19 and other viral epidemics on frontline healthcare workers and ways to address it: A rapid systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) epidemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from China.

It is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily during a personal contact via bigger respiratory droplets. These droplets with viruses can be directly inhaled by other people or can lend on the surfaces with the possibility of further spreading. The ocular surface has been suggested as one of possible infection entries. Human eye has its own renin-angiotensin system with present ACE2 receptors, which bind the virus through spike protein.

We are interested in studying the impact of bacterial infection in G6PD-deficient cells. G6PD knock down A549 lung carcinoma cells, together with the common pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, were employed in our cell infection model. Here, we demonstrate that a lower cell viability was observed among G6PD-deficient cells when compared to scramble controls upon bacterial infection using the MTT assay. A significant increase in the intracellular ROS was detected among S. aureus-infected G6PD-deficient cells by observing dichlorofluorescein (DCF) intensity within cells under a fluorescence microscope and quantifying this signal using flow cytometry. The impairment of ROS removal is predicted to enhance apoptotic activity in G6PD-deficient cells, and this enhanced apoptosis was observed by annexin V/PI staining under a confocal fluorescence microscope and quantified by flow cytometry. A higher expression level of the intrinsic apoptotic initiator caspase-9, as well as the downstream effector caspase-3, was detected by Western blotting analysis of G6PD-deficient cells following bacterial infection. In conclusion, we propose that bacterial infection, perhaps the secreted S. aureus -hemolysin in this case, promotes the accumulation of intracellular ROS in G6PD-deficient cells.

Rosemary contains carnosic acid (CA) and carnosol (CS), abietane-type phenolic diterpenes, which account for most of its biological and pharmacological actions, although claims have also been made for contributions of another constituent, rosmarinic acid. This review focuses on the potential applications of CA and CS for Alzheimers disease (AD), Parkinsons disease (PD), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in part via inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. CA exerts antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects via phase 2 enzyme induction initiated by activation of the KEAP1/NRF2 transcriptional pathway, which in turn attenuates NLRP3 activation. In addition, we propose that CA-related compounds may serve as therapeutics against the brain-related after-effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed long-COVID. One factor that contributes to COVID-19 is cytokine storm emanating from macrophages as a result of unregulated inflammation in and around lung epithelial and endovascular cells. Additionally, neurological aftereffects such as anxiety and brain fog are becoming a major issue for both the pandemic and post-pandemic period. Many reports hold that unregulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation may potentially contribute to the severity of COVID-19 and its aftermath. It is therefore possible that suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activity may prove efficacious against both acute lung disease and chronic neurological after-effects. Because CA has been shown to not only act systemically but also to penetrate the bloodCbrain barrier and reach the brain parenchyma to exert neuroprotective effects, we discuss the evidence that CA or rosemary extracts containing CA may represent an effective countermeasure against both acute and chronic pathological events initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as other chronic neurodegenerative diseases including AD and PD.","output":"Potential Therapeutic Use of the Rosemary Diterpene Carnosic Acid for Alzheimers Disease, Parkinsons Disease, and Long-COVID through NRF2 Activation to Counteract the NLRP3 Inflammasome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis (MF) is characterized by cytopenias, marrow fibrosis, constitutional symptoms, extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly, and shortened survival. Constitutive activation of the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway in MF leads to cell proliferation, inhibition of cell death, and clonal expansion of myeloproliferative malignant cells. Fedratinib is a selective oral JAK2 inhibitor recently approved in the United States for treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF. In mouse models of JAK2V617F-driven myeloproliferative disease, fedratinib blocked phosphorylation of STAT5, increased survival, and improved MF-associated disease features, including reduction of white blood cell counts, hematocrit, splenomegaly, and fibrosis. Fedratinib exerts off-target inhibitory activity against bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4); combination JAK/STAT and BRD4 inhibition was shown to synergistically block NF-kB hyperactivation and inflammatory cytokine production, attenuating disease burden and reversing bone marrow fibrosis in animal models of MPNs. In patients, fedratinib is rapidly absorbed and dosed once daily (effective half-life 41 h). Fedratinib showed robust clinical activity in JAK-inhibitor-na?ve patients and in patients with MF who were relapsed, refractory, or intolerant to prior ruxolitinib therapy. Fedratinib is effective regardless of JAK2 mutation status. Onset of spleen and symptom responses are typically seen within the first 1-2 months of treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) with fedratinib are grades 1-2 gastrointestinal events, which are most frequent during early treatment and decrease over time. Treatment discontinuation due to hematologic AEs in clinical trials was uncommon (~3%). Suspected cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy were reported during fedratinib trials in ~1% of patients; thiamine levels should be monitored before and during fedratinib treatment as medically indicated. Phase III trials are ongoing to assess fedratinib effects on long-term safety, efficacy, and overall survival.

Unlike patients with other forms of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, these patients do not exhibit increased lung stiffness or dramatic dyspnea., even in the presence of arterial blood oxygen levels lower than that seen normally in mixed venous blood. Urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation with high inflation pressures and raised inhaled oxygen concentration have proved unhelpful or worse, but why? Our Hypothesis is that sudden opening of a previously undetected probe-patent foramen ovale (PPFO) may explain this mystery. As hypoxemia without acidosis is a rather weak stimulus of dyspnea or increased ventilation, and opening of such an intracardiac shunt would not worsen lung mechanical properties, the absence of dramatic symptom changes would not be surprising. We point out the high frequency of PFO both in life and at autopsy, and the physiological evidence of large shunt fractions found in Covid-19 patients. Published evidence of hypercoagulability and abundant evidence of pulmonary emboli found at autopsy are in accord with our hypothesis, as they would contribute to raised pressure in the pulmonary arteries and right heart chambers, potentially causing a shunt to open. We review the interaction between viral corona spike protein and ACE-2 receptors present on the surface of alveolar lining cells, and contribution to hypercoagulabilty caused by the spike protein. Search for an open PFO after a large drop in arterial oxygen saturation can be performed at the bedside with a variety of well-established techniques including bedside echocardiography, nitrogen washout test, and imaging studies.

METHODS: The authors invited 355 dental trainees at the University of Washington School of Dentistry to complete an 83-item questionnaire in August and September 2020. The outcome analyzed was intention to leave their programs. There were 4 self-reported predictors: anxiety, burnout, depression, and COVID-19 impact on overall mental health. The authors ran multiple variable logistic regression models to evaluate relationships between each predictor and outcome (&#945; = .05) and reported odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 35.5%. Overall, 12.7% of participants reported any intention to leave. In total, 22.2% and 16.7% of participants endorsed clinically significant anxiety or depression symptomatology, respectively; 28.6% reported 1 or more burnout symptoms; and 69.0% reported that COVID-19 affected their overall mental health. Participants reporting anxiety (OR, 8.87; 95% CI, 1.80 to 43.57; P = .007), depression (OR, 11.18; 95% CI, 1.84 to 67.74; P = .009), or burnout (OR, 8.14; 95% CI, 1.73 to 38.23; P = .008) were significantly more likely to report intention to leave than those not reporting mental health problems.

METHODS: An analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19 cohort, in 5-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for estradiol therapy was death. Odds ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15-49 years) and peri-/post-menopausal (> 50 years). RESULTS: The incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is higher in women than men (by about + 15%) and, in contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about + 50%). Interestingly, the relationships between these quantities are linked to age: pre-adolescent girls and boys had the same risk of infection and fatality rate, while adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk of infection than men in the same 5-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This ratio changed again in peri- and postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years, there was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely neglected. Because the hormone 17?-estradiol influences expression of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, propensity score matching was performed for the women's sub-cohort, comparing users vs. non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women > 50 years receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95% CI [0.18, 0.62] and the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15-49 years), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels. CONCLUSIONS: As of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.","output":"Evidence for treatment with estradiol for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present world is lurching under the spread of new SARS-CoV-2 infection The treatment is still elusive despite the relentless effort by the scientists against various viral structures Whereas the 3-Chymotrypsin-like proteases cleave polyproteins and structural proteins help in viral replication At the same time, non-structural proteins stimulate mRNA cap methylation to evade the immune response The present study aims to identify novel dual inhibitor compounds with potential hits simultaneously against any of these three targets, including 3C-like proteases, N-protein, and NSP16 through virtual screening, molecular docking approach, and molecular dynamics Such dual inhibitors may provide the necessary treatment to alleviate the current pandemic We screened 265 FDA approved infectious disease drugs against three types of Covid-19 targets, i e , 3C-like proteinase (6w63), N-protein (6vyo), and Non-structural protein 16 (6w4h) using a computer-assisted drug repurposing approach in this study The Schrodinger suite 2019 is employed for high throughput screening, molecular docking, and binding free energy through the Glide module We sorted 27 drugs, out of which the best common three drugs were suggested based on their virtual statistics parameters We found three drugs that belonged to two main categories as dual inhibitors The Plazomicin (Aminoglycoside) and Cefiderocol (Cephalosporins) are an antibiotic group of drugs, and the Vanganciclovir is antiviral The molecular dynamics simulation studies over 30000ps for Plazomicin against NSP16 was conducted based on their promising docking scores profile The RMSD parameter remained stable at 2 5? for ligands for 30000ps Thus these three compounds can be validated as a SARS-CoV-2 therapy through clinical trials ? 2020 by the authors","output":"Docking of fda approved drugs targeting nsp-16, n-protein and main protease of sars-cov-2 as dual inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most small molecules interact with several target proteins but this polypharmacology is seldom comprehensively investigated or explicitly exploited during drug discovery.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes and determinants of vaccine acceptance among citizens and non-citizens, over time during the pandemic in Kuwait. METHODS: Data were obtained from the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO Kuwait) study that was implemented according to the WHO tool for behavioral insights on COVID-19. Data was collected online, every two weeks throughout the pandemic. Individuals living in Kuwait during the pandemic were surveyed, representing an independent sample of the population during each data collection wave. RESULTS: A total of 7241 adults living in Kuwait participated. Sixty-seven percent of those participating agreed to take a vaccine if it was available and recommended. However, the proportion of vaccine acceptance drastically dropped overtime as COVID-19 related restrictions were eased, among citizens (73 to 47%) and noncitizens (80 to 60%). Some factors associated with increased odds of agreeing to take the COVID-19 vaccine, among citizens and non-citizens, included increased frequency of informing oneself about the virus (OR, 1.34C1.83; 95% confidence interval 1.16C2.55), having high versus low confidence in doctors (OR, 1.79C2.11; CI 1.17C3.80), increased agreement with containment policies (OR, 1.11C1.27; CI 1.05C1.41), expressing more fears and worries (OR, 1.05C1.12; 1.01C1.24), and the increased perceived likelihood of getting infected with influenza (OR, 1.3C1.4; CI 1.03C1.84).

CONCLUSION: Vaccine acceptance was multifactorial, heterogenous among citizens and non-citizens, and changed over time.

This decision will lead to a total reversal of doctors' legal duty from the obligation to refuse abortion services to their requirement to provide them, given the Medical Service Act that states that a doctor may not refuse a request for treatment or assistance in childbirth. I argue, confined to abortion services in Korea that will take place in the near future, that doctors should be granted the legal right to exercise conscientious objection to abortion. MAIN TEXT: Considering that doctors in Korea have been ethically and legally obligated to refrain from abortions for many years, imposing a universal legal duty to provide abortions that does not allow exception may endanger the moral integrity of individual doctors who chose a career when abortion was illegal. The universal imposition of such a duty may result in repudiation of doctors as moral agents and damage trust in doctors that forms the basis of medical professionalism. Even if conscientious objection to abortion is granted as a legal right, most patients would experience no impediment to receiving abortion services because the healthcare environment of Korea provides options in which patients can choose their doctors based on prior information, there are many doctors who would be willing to provide an abortion, and Korea is a relatively small country. Finally, the responsibility to effectively balance and guarantee the respective rights of the two agents involved in abortion, the doctor and the patient, should be imposed on the government rather than individual doctors. This assertion is based on the government's past behaviours, the nature of its relationship with doctors, and the capacity it has to satisfy both doctors' right to conscientious objection and patients' right to legal medical services. CONCLUSION: With regard to abortion services that will be sought in the near future, doctors should be granted the legal right to exercise conscientious objection based on the importance of doctor's moral integrity, lack of impediment to patients, and government responsibility.","output":"Conscientious objection to abortion: why it should be a specified legal right for doctors in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The school lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic pushed teachers to online teaching literally overnight, which put their performance at risk.

Here we investigate this with serial antibody testing. METHODS: We identified haemodialysis patients who had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 between March-May 2020 and measured monthly antibodies (IgG/IgM) in those who survived. We used a semi-quantitative cut-off index (COI) to create a qualitative result and plotted optical density (OD) over time. We used linear regression to examine the slope, as well as noting peak OD and time to peak OD. We correlated these against baseline demographics, markers of illness severity, and comorbidities. RESULTS: 122 patients were analysed. All remained antibody positive during follow-up; for a minimum of 148 days. 71% had a positive gradient indicating increasing antibody positivity over time. We found that age (p = 0.01), duration of PCR positivity (p = 0.06) and presence of symptoms (p = 0.05) were associated with a longer time to peak OD.

There are three subtypes, and the treatment strategies for each are different. Subtype B (multiple fistulas) can be treated by either embolization or surgery. On the basis of a case from our treatment experience, we propose a method for achieving optimal outcome while minimizing nerve injury. CASE DESCRIPTION A 51-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with acute myelopathy caused by a perimedullary AVF. Initially, we treated her by embolization using the chemical agent Onyx. Her symptoms improved immediately but gradually returned beginning 1 week later. Two months later, the symptoms had returned to pretreatment status, so we removed the fistulas surgically. Severe adhesions between nerve and occult venous varices were noted during the operation. Afterward, the patient's symptoms improved significantly. Histopathological sections showed an inflammatory reaction around the varices. CONCLUSIONS We initially considered several possible reasons for the return of symptoms: (a) Hypoperfusion of the spinal cord; (b) mass effect of the occult vein varices; (c) residual AVF or vascular remodeling resulting in recurrent cord hypertension; (d) Onyx-induced perivascular inflammation resulting in nerves adhering to each other and to occult venous varices. Clinical, surgical, and pathological findings ruled out the first three, leaving Onyx-induced perivascular inflammation as the probable reason. Given our treatment experience and the pros and cons of the two methods, we propose that initial embolization followed by surgery after 5 days to remove occult venous varices is the ideal strategy for treating perimedullary AVF of subtype B.","output":"Embolization followed by surgery for treatment of perimedullary arteriovenous fistula causing acute myelopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tourism is a relevant economic activity that provides important resources (income, employment,...) to countries.

In this report, based on in silico modeling, we propose a tertiary structure for the F1 region, which resembles a sialic acid binding domain. Furthermore, using recombinant forms of both HE and F proteins and an in vitro model system, we demonstrate the interaction of F with a cell receptor, the hydrolysis of this receptor by the HE esterase, and a crucial role for F1 in the fusion mechanism.

Due to the particularity of the chest X-ray images of TB patients, there are fewer labeled data, and the deep neural network model is difficult to fully train. We first analyzed the data distribution characteristics of two public TB datasets, and found that the two-stage tuberculosis identification (first divide, then classify) is insufficient.

Therefore, policymakers need to improve their understanding of how crisis events affect the demand for inbound tourism. From the first quarter of 1996 to the second quarter of 2006, Taiwan experienced four major disasters at approximately two-year intervals. These disasters included the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the 21st September 1999 earthquake, the 11th September 2001 attacks in the United States, and the outbreak of SARS in 2003. This paper examines the impact of crisis events on the demand for tourism in order to establish a better understanding of changes and trends in the demand for international tourism. This paper uses the auto-regression distributed lag model by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith [Pesaran, M. H., Shin, Y., & Smith, R. J. (2001).

This paper also explores the influence of variables, such as foreign exchange rates, incomes, relative prices, and transportation costs, on the dynamics of the demand for inbound tourism. This paper finds that a long-term equilibrium exists among all variables, indicating that macroeconomic variables may be used to determine the rise or fall of the number of inbound tourism arrivals. Income and foreign exchange rates are both significant explanatory variables. In terms of incurred losses, the number of inbound tourism arrivals suffered the greatest decline during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), followed by the 21st September 1999 earthquake and the 11th September 2001 attacks. The impact of the Asian financial crisis was relatively mild. This paper finds that any impact on safety, whether domestic or international, negatively affects tourism demand.

Following viral internalization into endosomes, host cysteine proteases cleave the EBOV fusion glycoprotein (GP) to unmask the binding site for its intracellular receptor, the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). GP-NPC1 interaction is required for viral entry. Despite these and other recent discoveries, late events in EBOV entry following GP-NPC1 binding and culminating in GP-catalyzed fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers remain enigmatic. A mechanistic understanding of EBOV membrane fusion has been hampered by the failure of previous efforts to reconstitute fusion in vitro or at the cell surface. This report describes an assay to monitor initial steps directly in EBOV membrane fusiontriggering of GP and virus-cell lipid mixingby single virions in live cells. Fusogenic triggering of GP occurs predominantly in Rab7-positive (Rab7(+)) endosomes, absolutely requires interaction between proteolytically primed GP and NPC1, and is blocked by key GP-specific neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. Unexpectedly, cysteine protease inhibitors do not inhibit lipid mixing by virions bearing precleaved GP, even though they completely block cytoplasmic entry by these viruses, as shown previously. These results point to distinct cellular requirements for different steps in EBOV membrane fusion and suggest a model in which host cysteine proteases are dispensable for GP fusion triggering after NPC1 binding but are required for the formation of fusion pores that permit genome delivery.","output":"Direct Visualization of Ebola Virus Fusion Triggering in the Endocytic Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute scrotal pain in children represents a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

To date, no chicken MHC class I peptide tetramer has been reported. In this report, we describe construction and functional evaluation of a chicken MHC-I (BF2*15)/peptide tetramer. To construct the chicken MHC class I peptide tetramer, genes of the chicken MHC-I  chain (BF2*15) and 2 microglobulin (Ch2m) were synthesized by RT-PCR from the total RNA of PBMCs and the signal sequences were deleted. The BF2*15 was then fused with the BirA substrate peptide (BSP) sequence at the C terminus. Next, the synthesized PCR products of BF2*15 and Ch2m were cloned into the expression vector pET-28a (+) and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Highly purified BF2*15-BSP heavy chain and Ch2m were obtained by a Ni(2+) NTA column affinity purification, yielding approximately 1.6 mg of BF2*15-BSP and 2.4 mg of Ch2m per 1 g of the pelleted bacteria. The purified BF2*15-BSP heavy chain and Ch2m were refolded with synthetic peptide originated from infectious bronchitis virus nucleoprotein (IBV N(71C78)) in refolding buffer to generate the monomer of BF2*15/peptide complex. The monomer was then biotinylated and tetramerized using PE-labeled streptavidin. Upon functional evaluation of the construct by using flowcytometry, we observed that 3.65% of CTLs were specific to IBV nucleoprotein.

Presently, practice variation exists, and the benefits of oral anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy across the entire spectrum of stroke risk profile remain undefined in the postablation population. To date, there are no randomized trials to inform clinicians on this therapeutic question. OBJECTIVE The objective was to assess whether rivaroxaban is superior to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in reducing the risk of clinically overt stroke, systemic embolism, or covert stroke among patients without apparent recurrent atrial arrhythmias for at least 1 year after their most recent AF ablation procedure. METHODS/DESIGN A prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial with blinded assessment of outcomes is under way (NCT02168829). Atrial fibrillation patients with at least 1 stroke risk factor (as defined by the CHA2DS2-VASc score) and without known atrial arrhythmia recurrences for at least 12 months after ablation are randomized to rivaroxaban 15 mg or ASA 75-160 mg daily. The primary outcome is a composite of clinically overt stroke, systemic embolism, and covert stroke based on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Key secondary outcomes include major bleeding outcomes, intracranial hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, neuropsychological testing, quality of life, and an economic analysis. Subjects will be followed for 3 years. The estimated overall sample size is 1,572 subjects (786 per arm). DISCUSSION The OCEAN trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial evaluating 2 antithrombotic treatment strategies for patients with risk factors for stroke after apparently successful AF ablation.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the costs of leaks after LSG. SETTING Private hospital, France. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted on a prospective cohort of 2012 cases of LSG between September 2005 and December 2014. Data were collected on all diagnostic and therapeutic measures necessary to manage leaks, ward, and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Additional outpatient care was also analyzed. RESULTS Twenty cases (0.99%) of gastric leak were recorded. Fifteen patients had available data for cost analysis. Of these, 13 patients were women (86.7%) with a mean age of 41.4 years (range 22-61) and mean BMI of 43.2 kg/m2 (range 34.8-57.1). The leaks occurred after 7.4 days (2.3) postoperatively. Only one gastric leak was recorded for the last 800 cases in which absorbable staple line reinforcement was used. Mean intra-hospital cost was 34398  (range 7543-91,632 ). Prolonged hospitalization in ICU accounted for the majority of hospital costs (58.9%). Mean additional outpatient costs for leaks were 41,284  (range 14,148-75,684).

The remote monitoring function allows the physician to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) in these patients and to prevent thromboembolic complications by prescribing anticoagulants. Under quarantine conditions, such patients can receive fully remote consultation and treatment, which will protect them from the risk of infection, and also reduce the burden on medical institutions. CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old man presented to the clinic with shortness of breath when climbing the second floor, moderate non-specific fatigue, general weakness, and a decrease in exercise tolerance. The patient received standard treatment for HF for at least 3 months (ACEI, beta blockers, MR antagonists, and loop diuretics) in individually selected adequate doses. ECG on admission showed a QRS of 150 ms, left bundle branch block (LBBB). Echo showed dilatation of all heart chambers, diffuse hypokinesis of the walls with akinesis of the apical, middle anterior LV segments, as well as hypokinesis of the basal, middle apical, and anterior septal segment of the LV. The ejection fraction was reduced to 35%. RV function is reduced. After a detailed discussion with the team, it was decided to do implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator with resynchronization function, equipped with remote monitoring (Biotronik, and Home monitoring). Date of implantation is June 19, 2014. Due to the fact that the patient was connected to the remote monitoring system, May 5, 2020, he was diagnosed with asymptomatic AF. The episode lasted 1 min 22 s. On the following days of monitoring, episodes of AF were also recorded. The duration of the episodes ranged from a few seconds to 12 h/day. The patient received a doctors consultation through phone call, his risk of stroke was four when assessed using the CHA2 DS2 VASc scale. In treatment, it was recommended to add antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone 600 mg a day) and oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban 20 mg  1 time/day). Later, periodic IEGM showed absence of AF. CONCLUSION: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, health-care providers should rethink their approach to managing patients with implanted heart devices. Modern cardiovascular implantable electronic devices allow the physician to monitor the status of patients and immediately respond to situations requiring a change in treatment.

In addition it can be noticed that this dip was followed by a birth rebound a few months later. However having made this observation, Bertillon did not explore it further. Since that time the phenomenon was not revisited in spite of the fact that in the meanwhile there have been several new cases of massive death spikes. The aim here is to analyze these new cases to get a better understanding of this death-birth coupling phenomenon. The largest death spikes occurred in the wake of more recent influenza pandemics in 1918 and 1920, others were triggered by the 1923 earthquakes in Tokyo and the Twin Tower attack on September 11, 2001.

Design/methodology/approach In this study, the systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach. In total, 24 articles were selected and analysed with using PRISMA steps. Findings Despite a significant increase in usage of the internet and other ICTs around the world, women, especially in developing countries, tend to be on the wrong side of the digital divide. The results indicate that while there are still gender differences in access to ICT in developing countries, second-level digital divide issues are more of a concern in developed countries. In the literature, several important factors have been identified as being associated with the gender digital divide.

Methods: In this phase II open-label, investigator-initiated, multicenter trial, patients with unresectable locally advanced or mTNBC treated with 0-1 prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting were randomized 1:1 to carboplatin (AUC 6) with or without nivolumab (360 mg) IV every 3 weeks. Stratification factors included: germline BRCA (gBRCA) status, prior neo/adjuvant platinum, and number of prior lines of metastatic therapy. After approval of PD-L1 inhibition for mTNBC, the study was amended to include first-line mTNBC only and PD-L1 status was added as a stratification factor. Patients randomized to carboplatin alone were allowed to crossover at progression to receive nivolumab (+ nab-paclitaxel post-amendment). The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 criteria of carboplatin with or without nivolumab in first-line mTNBC in the S intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Key secondary objectives were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate, and duration and time to objective response.

Three patients did not receive protocol treatment, and the safety analysis was conducted among the 75 that received any treatment;37 received carboplatin + nivolumab (Arm A), 38 received carboplatin alone (Arm B). Median age was 59.1 yrs (range: 25.4-75.8). Four patients (5.3%) had a known gBRCA1/2 mutation. Sixty-two (82.7%) patients received 0 prior lines (ITT population) and 13 (17.3%) 1 prior line of metastatic therapy. Sixty-seven patients (89.3%) experienced any grade 2 treatment-related adverse event (AE). The most frequent AE were platelet count decrease (n=40;53.3%), anemia (n=36;48.0%), neutrophil count decrease (n=33;44.0%) and fatigue (n=24;32.0%). Grade 3/4 AE were observed in 46 (61.3%) patients, and there was one grade 5 AE (COVID19 pneumonia). Any grade 2 immune-related AE (irAE) were observed in 25 of the 37 (67.6%) patients treated with carboplatin + nivolumab. Grade 3/4 irAE were observed in 11 (29.7%) patients. In the ITT population (32 on Arm A;30 on Arm B), median PFS was 4.2 months with carboplatin + nivolumab, and 5.5 months with carboplatin (stratified HR 0.98, 95% CI [0.51-1.88];p=0.95). ORR was 25% vs. 23.3%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 23.5 months, median OS was 17.5 months vs. 10.7 months (stratified HR 0.63, 95% CI [0.32-1.24];p=0.18). In patients with PD-L1+ mTNBC (13 on Arm A;11 on Arm B), median PFS was 8.3 months and 4.7 months, respectively (stratified HR 0.63, 95% CI [0.21-1.89];p=0.41). ORR was 23.1% vs. 27.3%, respectively. Median OS was 17.5 months vs. 9.6 months (stratified HR 0.59, 95% CI [0.20-1.75];p=0.34). Conclusions: Addition of nivolumab to carboplatin in patients with previously untreated mTNBC, unselected by PD-L1 status, did not significantly improve PFS. A trend toward improved PFS and OS was observed in patients with PD-L1+ mTNBC. Tissue, blood and intestinal microbiome biomarker analyses are planned;bulk tumor and single-cell sequencing, and TCR sequencing in peripheral blood are ongoing.","output":"A randomized phase II trial of carboplatin with or without nivolumab in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In November, dozens of nations and the WHO will draft the international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response.

Seeing the vast impact of the pandemic and knowing its roots as a zoonotic disease, he realized this approach was critical to his medical education and for preparation against future novel infectious diseases. Zoonotic diseases have been emerging into human populations with increasing frequency, leading to public health emergencies such as Ebola, Avian Influenza, and SARS. The SARS-CoV-2 narrative, starting in bats then mutating through an intermediate host into humans, is another striking example of the interconnectedness between human, animal, and ecosystem health that underlies these infections. Preventing future pandemics will require a transdisciplinary One Health approach, and physicians should be prepared to participate in these discussions while advocating for One Health initiatives for the benefit of their current and future patients. Integration of One Health education into medical school curricula will also prepare future physicians for other complex and urgently important health issues such as climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and the impact of biodiversity loss. As the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic persist, education in One Health must become a priority; it is essential to break down the conventional disciplinary silos of human medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental health, public health, and the social sciences, so that future health crises can be prevented and mitigated collaboratively.","output":"A Call for One Health in Medical Education: How the COVID-19 Pandemic Underscores the Need to Integrate Human, Animal, and Environmental Health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a multi-layer network model for the spread of an infectious disease that accounts for interactions within the family, between children in classes and schools, and casual contacts in the population.

We perform our analysis by means of a campaign of Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings suggest that transmission in schools may play a key role in the spreading of a disease. Interestingly, we show that childrens testing might be an important tool to flatten the epidemic curve, in particular when combined with enacting temporary online education for classes in which infected students are detected. Finally, we test a vaccination strategy that prioritizes the members of large families and we demonstrate its good performance.

It is predominantly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on chronic dialysis. There is no definitive standard of care for calciphylaxis, and the overall prognosis for patients, particularly those with ulcerated lesions, is bleak. One important role of wound care clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic is to ensure that the continuity of care of an at-risk population is maintained while limiting the patient's potential exposure to the virus. Innovative therapies paired with alternative treatment sites of service are one such method. CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old female with ESRD on at-home peritoneal dialysis (PD) presented to the outpatient wound clinic with a punch biopsy-proven calciphylaxis lesion. Within days, state-wide \\"shelter-at-home\\" orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic went into effect. To prevent disruption in care and to minimize risk to the patient, the lesion was treated with bi-weekly self-application of a continuous topical oxygen therapy (cTOT) device paired with weekly telemedicine visits. The wound completely resolved after 9 weeks of topical oxygen therapy with no complications or device malfunctions. CONCLUSIONS: This case, to the authors' knowledge, is the first to document healing in a calciphylaxis wound with the use of cTOT. Topical oxygen therapy may be a beneficial adjunctive therapy in the treatment of wounds caused by calciphylaxis. Finding creative ways to navigate this current health care crisis is essential to help mitigate risk for vulnerable patients with advanced comorbidities.","output":"The Use of Topical Oxygen Therapy to Treat a Calciphylaxis Wound During a Global Pandemic: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For prevention of the coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, an effective vaccine is critical.

Key features of SARS-CoV-2 induced pulmonary complications include an overexpression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that contribute to a 'cytokine storm.' In the current study an inflammatory state in Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells was characterized in which significantly elevated transcripts of the immunostimulatory chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were present.

It is freely available, and since its inception in 2015, the database has become an important resource to several studies. Its content has been: used as training data for machine learning models; incorporated to larger databases; and utilized in drug discovery studies for hit identifications. DESCRIPTION: Here, we report the updated version of SANCDB. The new version includes 412 additional compounds that have been reported since 2015, giving a total of 1012 compounds in the database. Further, although natural products (NPs) are an important source of unique scaffolds, they have a major drawback due to their complex structure resulting in low synthetic feasibility in the laboratory. With this in mind, SANCDB is, now, updated to provide direct links to commercially available analogs from two major chemical databases namely Mcule and MolPort. To our knowledge, this feature is not available in other NP databases. Additionally, for easier access to information by users, the database and website interface were updated. The compounds are now downloadable in many different chemical formats. CONCLUSIONS: The drug discovery process relies heavily on NPs due to their unique chemical organization. This has inspired the establishment of numerous NP chemical databases. With the emergence of newer chemoinformatic technologies, existing chemical databases require constant updates to facilitate information accessibility and integration by users. Besides increasing the NPs compound content, the updated SANCDB allows users to access the individual compounds (if available) or their analogs from commercial databases seamlessly.

There are limited data on other infectious disease comorbidities in patients with PN. OBJECTIVE To characterize infectious disease hospitalizations among patients with PN and the associated cost burden. METHODS We searched the 2016-2017 National Inpatient Sample, a cross-sectional sample of 20% of all U.S. hospitalizations, for infectious disease hospitalizations among patients with PN. Associations of PN with infections and related costs were determined using multivariable logistic and linear regression adjusting for age, race, sex, and insurance type. RESULTS PN was associated with any infection overall (OR 2.98, 95% CI: 2.49 - 3.56), as well as sepsis, HIV, cutaneous, hepatobiliary, CNS, bacterial, viral, and fungal/parasitic infections. PN patients had a higher mean cost of care ($11,667 vs. $8,893, P<0.001) and length of stay (5.5 days vs. 4.2 days, P<0.001) for any infection overall and 7 of 13 other infections. Adjusting for age, race, sex, and insurance coverage, PN was associated with higher cost (+30%, 95% CI: +17% - +44%) and higher length of stay (+30%, 95% CI: +18% - +44%) for any infection overall, as well as several other infections. These associations remained with alternate regression models adjusting for severity of illness.

Upon analysis of published and proprietary data, we concluded that these three medical gases can manipulate the neuroendocrine system, by modulating the production or release of hormones via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid, hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes, or the gastrointestinal pathway. With repeated administration of the gases over time, these modulations become a predictable consequence of conditioned homeostatic reflexes, resulting in regulation of physiological activity. For example, the regular activation of the unconditioned defense reflex in response to repeated intoxication by ozone leads to the formation of an anticipatory stable conditioned response, which counteracts the toxic action of O(3). The concept of a Pavlovian conditioned reflex (or hormoligosis) is a brief metaphor for the understanding the therapeutic effect of systemic ozone therapy.","output":"Homeostatic and endocrine responses as the basis for systemic therapy with medical gases: ozone, xenon and molecular hydrogen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 79-year-old gentleman presented with spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema with pneumonia but no pre-existing lung disease.

This paper describes specific scenarios of IPV reported by women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria to provide insight for policy and programmatic efforts. METHODS: This paper draws on seven de-identified case reports from organisations serving women experiencing IPV as well as media coverage of IPV cases in Nigeria, between April and May, 2020. RESULTS: In most cases, reports identified IPV that was occurring prior to the lockdown, but increased in severity or involved new types of violence during the lockdown. The case scenarios included descriptions of many forms of IPV commonly reported, including physical, economic, psychological and sexual violence, often concurrently. Several women also reported threats of being thrown out of their homes by perpetrators, which threatens women's ability to protect themselves from exposure to COVID-19, but could also leave women stranded with no access to transportation, social services, or other resources during the lockdown. Several women also reported IPV that involved custody of children, as well as IPV that disrupted women's income generation. IPV was also reported in relation to economic stressors associated with the lockdown. Reports highlight how the lockdown disrupted women's social support, hindering accessibility of formal and informal sources of help. CONCLUSION: The lockdowns in Nigeria may have inadvertently placed women already experiencing partner violence at risk for experiencing more severe violence, new challenges to cope with violent experiences, and other forms of violence, including violence that used the lockdown as a way to threaten women's security and ability to protect themselves from the virus. Hence, there is need for innovative approaches to support victims, with emphasis on ways in which perpetrators of IPV may be using the threat of COVID-19 to further gain power and control over partners.","output":"Home was not a safe haven: women's experiences of intimate partner violence during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has affected 28,584,158 people world-wide as of 13th September 2020 (WHO, 2020b) This crisis has created an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear Due to the unavailability of the evidence based medical treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the best options at the present moment Lockdown was one of such measures to control the spread of the Covid-19 disease Due to lockdown measures, many countries across the globe followed the complete closure of shopping malls, transport networks, schools, universities, etc This study aims to investigate the behavioural psychological changes among university students due to covid-19 crises and lockdown Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model has been adopted to develop a theoretical foundation for the research Qualitative research methodology including a combination of personal interviews and focus groups has been adopted in the study to develop the themes with the help of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software, Atlas ti 7 It has been found that students are suffering from academic anxiety, fear, Mysophobia, etc As far as behavioural responses are concerned following behavioural changes have been found;Panic buying, e-learning, community support, support for prime-minister, etc","output":"Psychological impact of covid-19 crises on students through the lens of stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To rapidly deploy a digital patient-facing self-triage and self-scheduling tool in a large academic health system to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

Symptomatic patients were triaged into 1 of 4 categories-emergent, urgent, nonurgent, or self-care-and then connected with the appropriate level of care via direct scheduling or telephone hotline. RESULTS: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was designed and implemented in under 2 weeks. During the first 16 days of use, it was completed 1129 times by 950 unique patients. Of completed sessions, 315 (28%) were by asymptomatic patients, and 814 (72%) were by symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patient triage dispositions were as follows: 193 emergent (24%), 193 urgent (24%), 99 nonurgent (12%), 329 self-care (40%). Sensitivity for detecting emergency-level care was 87.5% (95% CI 61.7-98.5%). DISCUSSION: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool has been widely used by patients and is being rapidly expanded to other populations and health systems. The tool has recommended emergency-level care with high sensitivity, and decreased triage time for patients with less severe illness. The data suggests it also prevents unnecessary triage messages, phone calls, and in-person visits. CONCLUSION: Patient self-triage tools integrated into electronic health record systems have the potential to greatly improve triage efficiency and prevent unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Rapid design and implementation of an integrated patient self-triage and self-scheduling tool for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This special issue presents the outcomes from Designing sustainable and circular agricultural systems for the year 2100, the joint scientific workshop of ISOFAR, the Thnen-Institute, and INRA-Morocco, which was held from November 14 to 16, 2019 in Marrakesh, Morocco. Nineteen scientists from a broad array of background and nationalities came together with the understanding that food security globally is at risk, especially in the post-2050 timeframe. Current concepts, strategies, measures, and scientific efforts carried out by governments, NGOs, businesses, and societies do not deliver satisfying solutions for how to sustainably produce enough healthy and affordable food to support the global population. With the economic and social impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, it became even more evident that food security is a challenge. This workshop took an innovative approach to addressing the challenges of future agriculture by considering sustainable, circular agricultural systems. Participants presented research results on algae-based food, edible insects, mushrooms, novel concepts for nutrient management, bioreactor-based farming, sustainable food culture, as well as sensor- and remote-controlled automatic food production.

However, its applications are plagued due to the absence of a suitable, safe, efficient, selective, and universal vector, which could help in delivering the desired nucleic acid cargo to the site of action. Though viral vectors are efficient, they pose various health risks. Different types of synthetic agents have been tried as nucleic acid vectors by researchers but with limited success. Gemini amphiphiles (GAs) are a class of synthetic surfactants having biscationic heads with attached hydrophilic and lipophilic groups. Herein, we synthesized two classes of GAs differing in the chemical nature and length of the linkers, head groups, and lipophilic chains. The resulting compounds were evaluated for their efficiency to transfect A549 and HeLa cell lines with a -galactosidase reporter plasmid. A 3-oxypentyl linker, a monohydroxyethyl head group, and a tetradecyl moiety as the lipophilic chain offered the best transfection efficiency (compound 10BIII). Dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) as the helper lipid improved the transfection efficacy of the GAs in the absence of serum. In the presence of serum, DOPE and cholesterol, as the helper lipids, improved the transfection efficacy of the resulting formulations. The synthesized GAs showed concentration-dependent toxicity in the MTT assay. Biodistribution studies using 99(m)Tc-labeled lipoplexes indicated that the lipoplexes got concentrated in some vital organs such as the spleen, liver, and lungs.","output":"Further Studies on Cationic Gemini Amphiphiles as Carriers for Gene DeliveryThe Effect of Linkers in the Structure and Other Factors Affecting the Transfection Efficacy of These Amphiphiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Dans un contexte associant des divergences entre experts quant au niveau de risque admissible, et des dcisions sanitaires prises dans lincertitude, limpact de la crise de la COVID-19 sur les enfants soulve de nombreuses questions Linadquation entre prsomption de faible contagiosit et importance des mesures sanitaires en milieu scolaire interroge, notamment quant au rapport bnfice sanitaire/risques collatraux Le retour  lcole tait  la fois logique et important pour le lien social, primordial au bien-tre de lenfant Mais, le port du masque peut avoir un impact pdagogique sur les apprentissages, mais aussi motionnel avec un risque de non-reconnaissance de lautre, professeur ou alter ego Le retentissement potentiel des contraintes sanitaires sur les composantes de la qualit de vie (physique, psychique et social) incite  accompagner les rgles imposes, pour les adapter aux besoins des enfants Lcole, qui permet de crer de lquit, peut se trouver dstructure  ce niveau Les vulnrabilits existantes ont t exacerbes et les ingalits sont devenues plus visibles, notamment concernant lducation Ladaptation des professionnels de lenfance est essentielle afin de veiller au bien-tre des enfants Dvelopper la responsabilit individuelle, pour trouver un quilibre entre dmarche personnelle et action collective ncessite dtre expliqu  la fois par nos instances et par les mdias Il manque peut-tre la communication sur les fondements de lincertitude et la volont dabandonner le sensationnalisme pour davantage dexplications, en acceptant soi- mme de ne pas savoir Summary In a context of uncertain sanitary decisions and disagreement among experts as to the level of acceptable risk, the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 crisis on children raises many questions The mismatch between the presumption of low contagiosity and the strictness of the health measures imposed raises questions about the health benefit/collateral risk ratio Returning to school was both logical and important for the social link that is paramount to the child's well-being But wearing the mask has both an educational and emotional impact, with a risk of non-recognition and mistrust feelings for children The potential impact on all components of the quality of life (physical, psychological and social) encourages to contextualise and adapt the rules imposed to the needs of the children The school, which helps to create equity, is today destructured for doing so Existing vulnerabilities have been exacerbated and inequalities have become more visible, particularly with regard to education The adaptation of child care professionals is essential to ensure children welfare Developing individual responsibility, with a balance between individual and collective approaches, needs to be explained by both our authorities and the media Perhaps, what is missing is communication on the foundations of uncertainty, the willingness to abandon sensationalism for more explanations, which requires a self-acceptance of one's ignorance","output":"Contagiosit en pdiatrie et mesures sanitaires en milieu scolaire : quel impact chez les enfants ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Characterizing immunological response following COVID-19 vaccination is an important public health issue. The objectives of the present analysis were to investigate the proportion, level and the determinants of humoral response from 21 days to three months after the first dose in vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: We abstracted data on level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibodies (IgG) and sociodemographic characteristics of 17,257 HCWs from public hospitals and public health authorities from three centers in Northern Italy who underwent COVID-19 vaccination (average 70.6 days after first dose). We fitted center-specific multivariate regression models and combined them using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: A humoral response was elicited in 99.3% of vaccinated HCW. Female sex, young age, and previous COVID-19 infection were predictors of post-vaccination antibody level, and a positive association was also detected with pre-vaccination serology level and with time between pre- and post-vaccination testing, while a decline of antibody level was suggested with time since vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: These results stress the importance of analyzing retrospective data collected via occupational health surveillance of HCWs during the COVID-19 epidemic and following vaccination.

Among various causes of disease spread, airborne dispersion has previously been considered to be an important factor that could not be controlled by preventive measures to stop the spread of disease that focus on direct and indirect contact. Forecasting and predicting airborne virus spread are important to make time for developing strategies and to minimise the damage of the disease. To predict the airborne spread of the disease a modelling approach is important since field experiments using sensors are ineffective because of the rarefied concentrations of virus in the air. The simulation of airborne spread during past outbreaks required improvement both for farmers and for policy decision makers. In this study a free license computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was used to simulate airborne virus spread. Forecasting data from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) was directly connected in the developed model for real-time forecasting for 48 h in three-hourly intervals. To reduce computation time, scalar transport for airborne virus spread was simulated based on a database for the CFD computed airflow in the investigated area using representative wind conditions.

Finally, life satisfaction does not depend much on geographical characteristics such as urbanity or insularity, highlighting that the lockdown had an impact on the Greek population regardless of the physical isolation.","output":"First-Wave COVID-19 Pandemic in Greece: The Role of Demographic, Social, and Geographical Factors in Life Satisfaction during Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As of today, more than 8 million people have been infected and around 440,000 of them have lost their lives due to complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Mexico was on February 28, 2020, and currently, there are more than 150,300 confirmed cases and more than 17,500 deaths have been reported, this work presents the characteristics of the first cases on a tertiary care center with special focus on common comorbidities in Mexicans Methods: We conducted a case series of patients with the diagnosis of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 virus admitted to a tertiary care center in Mexico City, between March 14th and May 4th, 2020 Data collected included demographic information, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and outcomes Regarding clinical outcomes, we measured the need of admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), mortality during hospitalization, discharge, and patients that remained hospitalized Results: 85 patients were included, median age 53 5 years;69 4% were male Most common clinical manifestations at admission were fever (61, 71 8%), cough (29, 34 1%), headache (25, 29 4%) and dyspnea (22, 25 9%) Most common comorbidities were overweight (44/82, 53 6%), obesity (25/82, 30 5%), hypertension (18, 21 2%), and diabetes (17, 20%) 31 of 85 (36 5%) patients were diagnosed with critical disease, whereas 54 of 85 (63 5%) were classified as non-critical In the 31 critically ill patients, the length of invasive mechanical ventilation was 13 days [range {2-45}];5 patients (16 1%) required tracheostomy The mean of mechanical ventilation prior to tracheostomy was 19 8 days [range {14-25}] In all patients, the total length of hospitalization was 12 1 days [range {2-52}], 14 8 days [range {3-52}] in ICU patients, and 6 7 days [range {2-30}] in floor unit patients No readmissions were documented Global mortality was 4 7% (9 6% in ICU, 1 8% in floor unit) Of the 4 deceased patients, 3 presented comorbidities (75%), while 1 was previously healthy, documenting massive pulmonary embolism as the cause of sudden death Conclusion: This study shows that the clinical characteristics in this initial cohort are not different that described elsewhere Mortality is low but it is mainly related to prevalent comorbidities in the Mexican population","output":"Clinical characteristics and mortality of an initial cohort of COVID-19 patients in Mxico City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The innate immune response is the first line of defense against pathogens and consists of physical, chemical and cellular defenses. The adaptive immune response is the second line of defense and is specific to the pathogen. Innate immunity occurs immediately while adaptive immunity develops upon pathogen exposure, and is long-lasting, highly specific, and sustained by memory T cells. Respiratory virus infection typically induces effective immunity but over-exuberant responses are associated with pathophysiology. Cytokines expressed in response to viral infection can enhance biological responses, activate, and trigger signaling pathways leading to adaptive immunity that involves B cell-mediated humoral and T cell-mediated cellular immune responses. Vaccines induce immunity, specifically B cell and T cell responses. Vaccination targeting respiratory viruses like influenza is generally efficacious, but for many viruses, our understanding of vaccination strategies and immunity is incomplete or in its infancy. Studies that examine innate and adaptive immune responses to respiratory virus infection will aid vaccine development and may reduce the burden of respiratory viral disease. AREAS COVERED A literature search was performed using PubMed, a search engine maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) bibliographic database. The areas of search covered: innate, adaptive, respiratory virus, vaccine development, B cell, and T cell. EXPERT OPINION Immunity rests on two pillars, i.e. the innate and adaptive immune system, which function together on different tasks to maintain homeostasis. A better understanding of immunity is necessary for disease prevention and intervention.","output":"Innate and adaptive immune responses in respiratory virus infection: implications for the clinic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused most waste recycling activities to be terminated due to several factors, such as concerns about the spread of coronavirus through the collected solid waste. This study investigates the socio-economic impact of the situation of the closed-loop system of solid waste recycling. Several recommendations for tackling this problem are presented in this research. Primary data collection for the waste bank and informal recycling sector was carried out in the eastern part of Surabaya during large-scale social restrictions. In-depth interviews were conducted with waste bank customers, waste bank unit representatives and the informal recycling sector to understand the pandemic's socio-economic impact on the closed-loop system. Results show that this pandemic has significant impacts on individuals and stakeholders engaged in waste recycling activities. Customers of waste banks, who mostly belong to low-income communities, mentioned that the waste bank closure gave rise to social and economic problems, such as increasing unmanaged solid waste and decreasing income. This result also applied to the informal recycling sector. The government can use the recommendations in this study to generate related policies, such as enforcing the health protocol within solid waste management to keep the recycling system in place and the business alive.","output":"Socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on waste bank closed-loop system in Surabaya, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the five year outcomes of a two-stage approach for infected total hip replacement.

Sera were analyzed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay including a neutralization test as a confirmatory assay. A total of 12,419 individuals participated (5984 LEAD participants; 6435 household members), 163 (1.31%; 59 LEAD cohort members) of whom were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. The estimated number of COVID-19 cases projected from our findings by age and sex for Vienna was 21,504 (1.13%).

Enzymatic treatment reduced the content of antinutrient phytic acid by 32%. Extrusion also degraded phytic acid by up to 18%, but the effect depended on the material. Differences in physicochemical, sensorial, and textural properties between untreated and phytase-treated extruded meat analogs were small. In contrast, fermented material was more difficult to texturize due to degradation of macromolecules; physicochemical and textural properties of extrudates were markedly different; sensory analysis showed enhancement of flavor, but also detected an increase in some unwanted taste attributes (bitterness, cereal and off-taste).

Method: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), and undifferentiated arthritis (UA), participating in the Northern Savo 2010 Study, were evaluated for metabolic syndrome (MetS), metabolic and inflammatory markers, antibodies to MAA-LDL, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Results: Among 135 newly diagnosed untreated patients, of whom 53 (39%) were diagnosed to have RA, 44 (33%) SpA, and 38 (28%) UA, 49%, 30%, and 47%, respectively, had MetS. After adjusting for age and gender, anti-MAA-LDL immunoglobulin (Ig)A (p = 0.009), IgG (p = 0.031), and IgM (p = 0.001) levels differed between the diagnostic categories, but not in patients with MetS present or absent. All antibody classes to MAA-LDL correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and IgA and IgG antibodies with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). IgA antibodies to MAA-LDL correlated with rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), fasting plasma glucose, IgA antibodies to A. actinomycetemcomitans, and in IgA and IgG antibodies to P. gingivalis. Conclusion: Among various arthritis groups, antibodies to MAA-LDL were most common in RA. Antibodies to modified lipoproteins were associated with inflammation measured by ESR and hs-CRP. IgA antibodies to MAA-LDL correlated with age, antibodies to periodontal bacteria, RF, ACPA, and fasting glucose.

Risk assessments are the cornerstone of protecting vulnerable groups of individuals. The QCovid risk calculator is a newly developed tool to predict the risk of death or hospitalisation from COVID-19. It has not been applied in SMI populations. We aimed to use the QCovid risk calculator in an inpatient rehabilitation setting to identify and mitigate risk for people with SMI with personalised COVID-19 prevention plans. Method Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained for 22 inpatients. Firstly, the QCovid risk calculator was used to ascertain the absolute and relative risks to patients (Odds Ratios (OR) of mortality and/or hospitalisation) from COVID-19. Patients were stratified as high (OR > 10), moderate (OR 5-10) and low (OR < 5) risk. Secondly, personalised COVID-19 prevention plans were coproduced by patients and clinicians addressing 1) risk factors contributing to increased QCovid risk, 2) patient's personal goals, concerns, and preferences 3) maximizing patient engagement in COVID-19 infection prevention strategies. Finally, uptake of personalised COVID-19 prevention plans was evaluated after four weeks using a customised patient feedback questionnaire. Result Of the 22 inpatients (68% male), 14 patients (64%) had schizophrenia and 3 patients (14%) had schizoaffective disorder as primary diagnosis. 13 (59%) patients were prescribed clozapine. QCovid risk stratification showed 10% of patients as high risk, 29% as moderate risk, and 61% as low risk. Apart from SMI in all 22 inpatients, the most common QCovid risk factors were increased body mass index (64%, n = 14;23% overweight and 41% obese), diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 (27%, n = 6) and epilepsy (n = 4, 18%). 19 of the 22 patients provided feedback on their personalised COVID-19 prevention plans. Most patients (79%) felt they had contributed significantly to their COVID-19 prevention plans, and their individual goals and concerns were valued. 79% were satisfied with their COVID-19 prevention plans. Subjective perception of safety from COVID-19 was high, with 95% of patients feeling safe and well-protected from COVID-19. Conclusion Comprehensive assessment of COVID-19 risks in vulnerable groups enables personalised risk mitigation, both at an individual and service level. Our findings show the importance of applying current knowledge to protect vulnerable patients with SMI through personalised prevention plans. This approach can be scaled up to understand risks for services and teams, while allowing clinicians to adapt their use for individualised COVID-19 prevention.","output":"It's a risky business: use of the QCovid risk calculator in a psychiatric rehabilitation population to enhance prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To trace the prevalence of canine distemper virus (CDV) in diarrhoetic dogs, a total of 201 stool samples were collected in the Heilongjiang province of northeastern China from May 2014 to April 2015.

Methods: We developed the standard DA based on international standards. The literacy-sensitive version included simple language, supporting images, white space and a lifestyle action plan. A randomised trial included 859 people aged 45-74 using a 3 (DA: standard, literacy-sensitive, control) x 2 (heart age: heart age + percentage risk, percentage risk only) factorial design, with outcomes including prevention intentions/behaviours, gist/verbatim knowledge of risk, credibility, emotional response and decisional conflict. We iteratively improved the literacy-sensitive version based on end user testing interviews with 20 people with varying health literacy levels. Results: Immediately post-intervention (n=859), there were no differences between the DA groups on any outcome. The heart age group was less likely to have a positive emotional response, perceived the message as less credible, and had higher gist/verbatim knowledge of heart age risk but not percentage risk. After 4 weeks (n=596), the DA groups had better gist knowledge of percentage risk than control. The literacy-sensitive decision aid group had higher fruit consumption, and the standard decision aid group had better verbatim knowledge of percentage risk. Verbatim knowledge was higher for heart age than percentage risk amongst those who received both.

The pandemic had not yet spread to most of the country, and there was a relative deficit of knowledge regarding treatments, prognosis, and prevention of the virus, making this experience relatively unique and challenging. As part of a surge plan, our institution converted nonclinical spaces, such as conference rooms, to inpatient care settings and placed elective surgeries on hold to free up resources. A central deployment office suspended anesthesiology resident rotations and instead assigned them to intensive care settings based on need. For the Montefiore Medical Center Department of Anesthesiology, preserving its academic mission and commitment to Graduate Medical Education was essential. Adaptations included changing the residency rotation structure to biweekly, converting didactics online, ensuring adequate case numbers for graduating residents, actively pursuing wellness interventions, and prioritizing the safety of the residents caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Here, we provide a comprehensive description of all the conditions that must be fulfilled to successfully accomplish this transformation. Strong support from all hospital departments was crucial, as their activity was modified by the change. Healthcare workers from various units, notably the paediatric anaesthesiology department, worked in the adult ICU to ensure sufficient staffing. The number of physiotherapists and psychologists was increased. A support system for both healthcare workers and patients' relatives was set up with the help of the mobile paediatric palliative care and support team. Supplies suitable for adults were ordered. Protocols for numerous procedures were written within a few days. Video tutorials, checklists, and simulation sessions were circulated to the entire staff. The head nurses guided and supported the new staff and usual PICU staff. The transformation was achieved within a week. The main difficulties were healthcare worker stress, changes in recommendations over time, absence of visits from relatives, and specific adult issues that paediatricians are unfamiliar with.Conclusion: For the staff, caring for adult patients was made easier by working in their familiar unit instead of being moved to an adult hospital with unfamiliar staff members and equipment. Strong support from the hospital and the assistance of consultants from adult hospital departments were crucial. What is Known: a? The dramatic spread across the world of coronavirus disease 2019 generated critical care needs that drastically exceeded resources in many countries worldwide. a? Paediatric ICU activity during this period decreased due to lockdown measures and the fact that children rarely required ICU for coronavirus disease 2019. What is New: a?

IoT has the potential to provide visibility and improve manufacturing systems through data collection, analysis, and subsequent actions based on insights generated from large amounts of manufacturing data. Even though comparatively newer equipment come readily equipped with embedded sensors and industrial connectivity necessary to connect to the IoT environment, there are many manufacturers (equipment users) who rely on long standing legacy systems that offer no or very limited connectivity. In this context, solutions mostly result in the development of low-cost retrofit or upgrade kits that allow integrating legacy equipment into Industry 4.0 environment and thus enable digital servitization. Servitization is a transformation journey that involves firms developing the capabilities they need to provide technical and data-driven services that supplement traditional product offerings. However, retrofitting solutions of legacy equipment rarely involve Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who may otherwise leverage the opportunity to create and capture unique value by retrofitting and then provisioning data-driven value-added services for the manufacturers. Hence, the primary objective of this paper is to identify and analyze the available literature on retrofitting and upgrading of the legacy equipment for Industry 4.0 integration. In doing so, this study also investigates the potential opportunities and challenges of OEMs in supporting the Industry 4.0 transition of legacy equipment in a servitization context.","output":"Enabling servitization by retrofitting legacy equipment for Industry 4.0 applications: benefits and barriers for OEMs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has ravaged the global society as we know it.

The equilibrium optimizer (EO) is a recent MH that has been used to tackle several real world problems. Despite the robustness of the EO algorithm, it suffers of the unbalance between the exploration and exploitation phases, this situation causes that the search process be trapped in local optimal values. In this study, an improved version of the EO that combines the standard operators with the dimension learning hunting (DLH) is introduced. The proposed method called I-EO is tested over the CEC2020 benchmark functions. Quantitative and qualitative results confirmed the robustness and superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to a set of well-known optimization methods.

It is well recognized that membrane lipoproteins are immunostimulants exerting as LPS and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory responses upon M. pneumoniae infection. Here, we report that the M. pneumoniae-derived lipids are another proinflammatory agents. Using an antibody-neutralizing assay, RNA interference, or specific inhibitors, we found that TLR4 is essential for M. pneumoniae lipid-induced TNF-&#945; and IL-1? production. We also demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome, autophagy, and NF-&#954;B-dependent pathways are critical for the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, while inhibition of TLR4 significantly abrogates these events. Further characterisation revealed that autophagy-mediated inflammatory responses involved the activation of NF-&#954;B. In addition, the activation of NF-&#954;B also promoted lipid-induced autophagosome formation, as revealed by assays using pharmacological inhibitors, 3-MA and Bay 11-7082, or silencing of atg5 and beclin-1. These findings suggest that, unlike the response to lipoprotein stimulation, the inflammation in response to M. pneumoniae lipids is mediated by the TLR4 pathway, which subsequently initiates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and formation of a positive feedback loop between autophagy and NF-&#954;B signalling cascade, ultimately promoting TNF-&#945; and Il-1? production in macrophages.","output":"Mycoplasma pneumoniae lipids license TLR4 for activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy to evoke a proinflammatory response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in 2019, called COVID-19, Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO) implemented the new deferrals.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected from the integrated blood donor database between Feb-Apr 2019 and 2020. Deferral reasons of COVID-19 were categorized as: those who have symptoms or live with a symptomatic family member, have direct exposure with a confirmed case, have travelled from the outbreak affected areas, and have fully recovered from confirmed COVID-19. The z-test analysis was used, and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated to compare the sample proportions. RESULTS: The blood donations dropped to 26.09 % in 2020. The percent change of first-time blood donors, female donors, and donors within the age group of 45?54 years old was significantly greater in 2020 than the same time frame in 2019 (p < 0.05).

PATIENTS AND METHODS The expression levels of circTMBIM6, miR-27a and MMP13 in cartilage of osteoarthritis patients and normal human cartilage were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Osteoarthritis cell model was induced by IL-1 and TNF-, and the expression changes of circTMBIM6, miR-27a and MMP13 in the in vitro model were detected. In addition, the in vitro regulation of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a in osteoarthritis was verified by transfection of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a plasmids, and the regulation of miR-27a on MMP13 was also verified. The dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) method was used to analyze the secretion and formation of soluble glycosaminoglycan sulfate (sGAG), and the effects of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a chondrocytes were evaluated. RESULTS The expression levels of circTMBIM6 and MMP13 in cartilage tissue of patients with osteoarthritis were higher than that of normal group, while the expression level of miR-195 in cartilage tissue of patients with osteoarthritis was lower. After IL-1 and TNF- treatment, the expression of circTMBIM6 and MMP13 in chondrocytes increased, while the expression of miR-27a decreased.

In this study, we describe the technique and review outcomes of our institution's initial 6-year experience. METHODS An institutional database query identified 278 consecutive patients who underwent Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy using an STS esophagogastric anastomotic technique from 2009 through 2015. A retrospective review was conducted to assess outcomes with a focus on anastomotic complications. RESULTS There were a total of 8 (2.9%) anastomotic leaks in patients who underwent STS esophagogastric anastomosis, 3 of which were grade I/II leaks and required no intervention. There was a leak rate of 6.3% (2 of 32) after esophagectomy for benign conditions (both leaks occurring in 8 total patients (25%) who received surgery for end-stage achalasia) compared with a 2.4% leak rate (6 of 246) in whom esophagectomy was performed for malignancy (P = .22).

So far, chloroquine, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, favipiravir, ribavirin, darunavir, remdesivir, and umifenovir have been tested in COVID-19 clinical trials. Here we validated our hypothesis by comparing the pharmacokinetics profiles of these drugs and their capabilities of reducing viral load in clinical trials. According to bulk RNA and single cell RNA sequencing analysis, we found that high expression of both angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) makes the lung and intestine vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and favipiravir, which were highly distributed to the lung, were reported to reduce viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, drugs with poor lung distributions, including lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir and remdesivir, were insufficient to inhibit viral replication. Lopinavir/ritonavir might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract according to their distribution profiles.

It is believed that globally there are about five million cases of ABPA, with India alone accounting for about 1.4 million cases. The occurrence of ABPA among asthmatic patients in special clinics may be as high as 13 per cent. Thus, a high degree of suspicion for ABPA should be entertained while treating a patient with bronchial asthma, particularly in specialized clinics. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can delay (or even prevent) the onset of bronchiectasis, which suggests that all patients of bronchial asthma should be screened for ABPA, especially in chest clinics.

However, patients face the challenge of adapting and maintaining a good quality of life, thus it is important to consider complex interventions related not only to medical treatment. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind study. Twenty-one (21) patients diagnosed with PAH were included and randomly assigned to training or control group. All participants continued target medical therapy. Furthermore, TG underwent the individually tailored 12-week remote physiotherapy program. As a primary outcome measurement, the Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPA) was used. Secondary outcome included aerobic capacity (6MWT), accelerometery and general self-efficacy (GSE). Data were collected at baseline, after 12 weeks and at follow-up 6 months after the beginning of the intervention. Results: A significant difference between the groups was found in the follow-up assessment on three of the four IPA subscales analyzed, AO, RF, and AI. The total IPA score decreased significantly in TG after the program, indicating an improved participation. In addition, in TG a significant increase in 6MWT results, daily time in low- or moderate-intensity physical activities, and GSE was observed. Conclusions: In summary, the individually tailored physiotherapy program investigated added to stable target medical therapy in patients with PAH encourages improvement and prevents possible deterioration of perceived participation of patients in activities of their everyday life in the context of ones health condition in the long term, along with improved exercise capacity and increased time spent in low- or moderate-intensity physical activities. Future studies are needed to develop and evaluate long-term intervention to support patients living with this rare, chronic, and life-threatening disease.","output":"Individually Tailored Remote Physiotherapy Program Improves Participation and Autonomy in Activities of Everyday Life along with Exercise Capacity, Self-Efficacy, and Low-Moderate Physical Activity in Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: A Randomized Controlled Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The frequency of new-onset HIV-associated seizure in the HIV-infected patient is estimated to be between 2 and 11%. Identifying the underlying etiology of new-onset seizure will have a vital impact on the mortality and morbidity of patients living with HIV infection. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 34-year old newly diagnosed HIV+ male patient presented with abnormal body movement (ABM) involving his right hemibody associated with loss of consciousness lasting few minutes of two weeks duration. The ABM occurred frequently (> five times per week) and associated with frothy and excessive salivation. He reported headache following each spells. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral frontal T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity; post contrast study showed bilateral small ring enhancing lesion with perilesional oedema, the biggest one on the left hemisphere, with a 10 mm diameter; considering patient advanced immunosuppression and underlying HIV infection, the brain MRI findings were consistent with cerebral toxoplasmosis. Bipolar montage electroencephalography (EEG) study showed generalized background slowing, prominent in the left fronto-centeral region. Patient was managed with combination antiretroviral therapy, anti-toxoplasmosis medication, and anticonvulsant. On follow up, the frequency of seizure attack has significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Considering the high prevalence of HIV infection and associated seizure among people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, this case fairly highlights on the importance of utilizing advanced imaging techniques such as MRI and EEG in identifying the underlying causes of HIV-associated seizures.","output":"New-onset focal seizure as a presenting feature of HIV infection: a case report and mini review to the challenge in resource-limited settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) rates have increased substantially in the recent decades worldwide, with Germany being one of the leading countries in the prevalence of TKA. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of treatment changes during the last decade and to project the expected burden of primary and revision TKA (rTKA) for the next 30 years. METHODS: Comprehensive nationwide data from Germany was used to quantify primary and revision TKA rates as a function of age and gender. Projections were performed with use of a Poisson regression models and a combination of exponential smoothing and autoregressive integrated moving average models on historical procedure rates in relation to official population projections from 2020 to 2050. RESULTS: The incidence rate of primary TKAs is projected to increase by around 43% to 299 per 100,000 inhabitants [95% CI 231C368], leading to a projected total number of 225,957 primary TKAs in 2050 (95% CI 178,804C276,442). This increase has been related to a growing number of TKA performed in male patients, with the highest increase modelled in patients between 50 and 65 years of age. At the same time, the annual total number of revision procedures is forecast to increase even more rapidly by almost 90%, accounting for 47,313 (95% CI 15,741C78,885; IR = 62.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 20.8C104.5) procedures by 2050. Those numbers are primarily associated with a rising number of rTKAs secondary to periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). CONCLUSIONS: Using this country- specific forecast approach, a rising number of primary TKA and an even more rapidly growing number of rTKA, especially for PJI, has been projected until 2050, which will inevitably provide a huge challenge for the future health care system. As many other industrialized nations will face similar demographic and procedure-specific developments, these forecasts should be alarming for many health care systems worldwide and emphasize the tremendous need for an appropriate financial and human resource management in the future.

Currently, inflammation and coagulation are recognized as the two drivers that promote organ dysfunction in sepsis and septic shock. The ISTH has published new diagnostic criteria for improved management, namely sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), in 2017. SIC is a pragmatic scoring system composed of platelet count, prothrombin time, and organ dysfunction score to detect the early-stage of sepsis-associated DIC. Since overt DIC represents an uncompensated coagulation disorder, a two-step approach using SIC and overt DIC criteria is a novel strategy to evaluate the severity and manage this challenging complication. Although there is no globally agreed on anticoagulant therapy for DIC, the Japanese Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines 2020 recommend using antithrombin and recombinant thrombomodulin for sepsis associated DIC.

Here we compare the effectiveness of two full-length Spike protein-encoding mRNA vaccines from Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) in the Mayo Clinic Health System over time from January to July 2021, during which either the Alpha or Delta variant was highly prevalent. We defined cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals from Minnesota (n = 25,589 each) matched on age, sex, race, history of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and date of full vaccination. Both vaccines were highly effective during this study period against SARS-CoV-2 infection (mRNA-1273: 86%, 95%CI: 81-90.6%; BNT162b2: 76%, 95%CI: 69-81%) and COVID-19 associated hospitalization (mRNA-1273: 91.6%, 95% CI: 81-97%; BNT162b2: 85%, 95% CI: 73-93%). In July, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization has remained high (mRNA-1273: 81%, 95% CI: 33-96.3%; BNT162b2: 75%, 95% CI: 24-93.9%), but effectiveness against infection was lower for both vaccines (mRNA-1273: 76%, 95% CI: 58-87%; BNT162b2: 42%, 95% CI: 13-62%), with a more pronounced reduction for BNT162b2. Notably, the Delta variant prevalence in Minnesota increased from 0.7% in May to over 70% in July whereas the Alpha variant prevalence decreased from 85% to 13% over the same time period. Comparing rates of infection between matched individuals fully vaccinated with mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 across Mayo Clinic Health System sites in multiple states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Iowa), mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64). In Florida, which is currently experiencing its largest COVID-19 surge to date, the risk of infection in July after full vaccination with mRNA-1273 was about 60% lower than after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (IRR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24-0.62). Our observational study highlights that while both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines strongly protect against infection and severe disease, further evaluation of mechanisms underlying differences in their effectiveness such as dosing regimens and vaccine composition are warranted.","output":"Comparison of two highly-effective mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 during periods of Alpha and Delta variant prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on morbidity and mortality is significant in that it causes bronchiolitis in infants, exacerbations in patients with obstructive lung disease, and pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. RSV activates protein kinase R (PKR), a cellular kinase relevant to limiting viral replication (Groskreutz, D. J., Monick, M. M., Powers, L. S., Yarovinsky, T. O., Look, D. C., and Hunninghake, G. W. (2006) J. Immunol. 176, 1733-1740). It is activated by autophosphorylation, likely triggered by a double-stranded RNA intermediate during replication of the virus. In most instances, ph-PKR targets the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) protein via phosphorylation, leading to an inhibition of translation of cellular and viral protein. However, we found that although ph-PKR increases in RSV infection, significant eIF2alpha phosphorylation is not observed, and inhibition of protein translation does not occur. RSV infection attenuates eIF2alpha phosphorylation by favoring phosphatase rather than kinase activity. Although PKR is activated, RSV sequesters PKR away from eIF2alpha by binding of the kinase to the RSV N protein. This occurs in conjunction with an increase in the association of the phosphatase, PP2A, with eIF2alpha following PKR activation. The result is limited phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and continued translation of cellular and viral proteins.","output":"Respiratory syncytial virus limits alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation to maintain translation and viral replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces frequently touched by COVID-19 patients, and assess the scope of contamination and transmissibility in facilities where the outbreaks occurred.

METHODS: Using Australian workers' compensation and census data, we calculated weeks of compensated time off work per 1000 labor force, an indicator of work disability burden, at Statistical Area Level 4, the smallest level of labor force data produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Records included all claims with at least 1 day of compensated time off work lodged between 2010 and 2015. Work disability burden was z-transformed by state and territory and mapped across Australia. Statistical Areas that were more than 1 standard deviation from the state or territory mean were considered hotspots and coldspots. We tested several sociodemographic factors as predictors of work disability burden. RESULTS: Work disability burden hotspots were concentrated in lower socioeconomic suburbs and exurbs of state capitals, in addition to several regional areas. Coldspots were primarily in wealthy central urban and suburban areas. Factors associated with greater work disability burden include higher area socioeconomic disadvantage, rurality, lower labor force participation, higher unemployment, higher proportion of work in production industries and in blue-collar occupations, and higher numbers of those with core activity limitations, those aged 65+ years, and foreign-born residents.

METHODS We propose a novel, integrative, and neural network-based literature-based discovery (LBD) approach to identify drug candidates from both PubMed and COVID-19-focused research literature. Our approach relies on semantic triples extracted using SemRep (via SemMedDB). We identified an informative subset of semantic triples using filtering rules and an accuracy classifier developed on a BERT variant, and used this subset to construct a knowledge graph. Five SOTA, neural knowledge graph completion algorithms were used to predict drug repurposing candidates. The models were trained and assessed using a time slicing approach and the predicted drugs were compared with a list of drugs reported in the literature and evaluated in clinical trials. These models were complemented by a discovery pattern-based approach. RESULTS Accuracy classifier based on PubMedBERT achieved the best performance (F1= 0.854) in classifying semantic predications. Among five knowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed others (MR = 0.923, Hits@1=0.417). Some known drugs linked to COVID-19 in the literature were identified, as well as some candidate drugs that have not yet been studied. Discovery patterns enabled generation of plausible hypotheses regarding the relationships between the candidate drugs and COVID-19. Among them, five highly ranked and novel drugs (paclitaxel, SB 203580, alpha 2-antiplasmin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and butylated hydroxytoluene) with their mechanistic explanations were further discussed.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Maryland statewide EMS electronic medical records and daily COVID-19 hospitalizations from March 13, 2020 through July 31, 2020. All unique EMS patients who were identified as COVID-19 PUIs during the study period were included. Descriptive analysis was performed. The Box-Jenkins approach was used to evaluate the relationship between EMS transports and daily new hospitalizations. Separate Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were constructed to transform the data into a series of independent, identically distributed random variables. Fit was measured using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Box-Ljung white noise test was utilized to ensure there was no autocorrelation in the residuals. Results: EMS units in Maryland identified a total of 26,855 COVID-19 PUIs during the 141-day study period. The median patient age was 62 years old, and 19,111 (71.3%) were 50 years and older. 6,886 (25.6%) patients had an abnormal initial pulse oximetry (<92%).

IgG antibodies were detected at 3, 7, and 26 weeks, respectively. At 6 months, blood samples were tested by two different interferon- release assays to determine responses to spike protein antigen and nucleocapsid protein antigen of the novel coronavirus. Results were stratified by gender and body mass index (BMI). Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. The medical records of 94 respondents (71 females) were analyzed. The mean age was 40.2 years and the mean BMI was 26.4 kg/m(2). At 6 months after double vaccination, effectiveness was 97.9%. The side effects of the BNT162b2 vaccine were similar after both doses, with no serious adverse events or new safety signals recorded.

Food insecurity, which entails having limited or uncertain access to a sufficient quantity of nutritious food, is a key pandemic-related consequence. We examined how people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have been affected by the pandemic, particularly Black participants and participants residing in food deserts. METHODS Using survey data from a longitudinal cohort study of predominantly Black low-income adults aged 18 residing in urban food deserts in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we examined changes in food insecurity and SNAP participation before COVID-19 (2018) and early in the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020). We modeled changes in food insecurity from 2018 to 2020 via covariate-adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS Food insecurity increased significantly among participants enrolled in SNAP and surveyed in both 2018 and 2020 (from 25.9% in 2018 to 46.9% in 2020; P < .001). Compared with cohort participants not enrolled in SNAP at both points, cohort participants enrolled in SNAP in 2018 and 2020 had the highest rates of using a food bank in 2020 (44.4%) and being newly food insecure in 2020 (28.9%) (ie, they were food insecure in 2020 but not in 2018). CONCLUSIONS Food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic increased among low-income Black households enrolled in SNAP and residing in a food desert.

Understanding burnout, compassion fatigue, and potential protective factors, such as compassion satisfaction, will be important in supporting the vital healthcare workforce. The goal of the current study was to understand the key factors of burnout, compassion fatigue, and compassion satisfaction among healthcare employees during the pandemic within the U.S. in April 2020. Methods: The authors conducted a single-center, cross-sectional online survey using the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) Questionnaire and three open-ended questions around stress and responses to stress during COVID-19 at a large Midwestern academic medical center with nearly 16,000 employees. Results: Healthcare employees (613) representing over 25 professions or roles and 30 different departments within the health system were surveyed. Participants reported low levels of compassion fatigue and burnout, but moderate levels of compassion satisfaction. Compassion satisfaction was notably higher than prior literature. Key areas of stress outside of work included family, finances and housing, childcare and homeschooling, and personal health. Conclusions: This was a cross-sectional survey, limiting causal analyses. Also, based on the qualitative responses, the ProQOL was somewhat insufficient in assessing the breadth of stressors, particularly outside of work, that healthcare employees faced due to the pandemic. Although compassion satisfaction was elevated during the initial phases of the pandemic, providing some possible protection against burnout, this may change as COVID-19 continues to surge. Healthcare systems are encouraged to assess and address the broad range of work and non-work-related stressors to best serve their vital workforce.","output":"Burnout and Compassion Satisfaction: Survey Findings of Healthcare Employee Wellness During COVID-19 Pandemic using ProQOL"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of a healthcare improvement initiative to improve provider compliance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis in patients with gynecologic cancer receiving chemotherapy. METHODS A healthcare improvement initiative was implemented at our institution to improve compliance with American Society of Clinical Oncology venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis guidelines in patients receiving chemotherapy with a Khorana score 2. Baseline Khorana score and venous thromboembolism data were retrospectively collected for chemotherapy-na?ve patients with gynecologic cancer initiating chemotherapy between December 2018 and November 2019. Data for the post-intervention period from December 2019 to December 2020 were captured prospectively. Primary outcome was compliance with American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines. Secondary outcomes were incidence of venous thromboembolism and complications surrounding venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis. RESULTS We identified 62 patients in the pre-implementation cohort. Approximately half had a Khorana score of 2 (52%). Median Khorana score was 2 (range 1-4). None of these patients received prophylactic chemoprophylaxis. Seven (11%) of these patients were diagnosed with venous thromboembolism. Multivariate logistic regression showed increasing Khorana score was associated with increased venous thromboembolism risk (OR 4.9, p=0.01). With cut-off Khorana score of 2, there was no significant increase in venous thromboembolism. However, with a cut-off Khorana score of 3, patients were 15 times more likely to have venous thromboembolism (OR 15.2, p=0.04). In the post-intervention cohort, 22 patients were eligible for chemoprophylaxis and 11 patients were given anticoagulation (50% compliance with guidelines), with no incidence of venous thromboembolism or adverse effects of therapy noted among those receiving chemoprophylaxis.

During this period, there has been an increased demand in mental health-care services, whose prepandemic access was lower than necessary in many developing countries and is currently limited by international social distancing recommendations and protocols. AIM: This study aims to determine the effectiveness of teleconsultation use to increase access to mental health services, provided by volunteer staff during the quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Dominican Republic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A special telephone service was enabled, organized by different governmental and private entities, in addition, it was published a list of telephone numbers of a team of volunteers consisting of 598 psychologists and seventy psychiatrists, who interacted from March 25 to May 17 with people who needed their help using calls, video calls, and electronic messaging services. After providing mental healthcare, each volunteer completed an online form to record relevant consultation data provided with a total of 6800 interventions to date. RESULTS: Nearly 67.3% of the interventions were requested by women. About 77.8% were adults between the ages of 18 and 59. 27.1% of the interventions were requested by people who worked as health personnel. Forty-six percent of the interventions were requested by people living in the province of Santo Domingo and 4.8% by people living outside the country. Of the interventions, 43% reported anxiety, 26%, sleep problems, 15%, depression, and 2% reported behaviors related to suicide. Of all the interventions, 5.3% required referral to a crisis intervention unit for face-to-face follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The enablement of this teleconsultation model and the number of interventions made during this period of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests that access to mental healthcare in the Dominican Republic has increased. Problems with anxiety, sleep, and depression are common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Only a small group of patients have needed to be referred for face-to-face care, demonstrating that teleconsultation has been an effective tool.","output":"Effectiveness of teleconsultation use in access to mental health services during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the Dominican Republic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Complex systems require rigorous analysis using effective method, in order to handle and interpret their information.

For the study, questionnaires were prepared and data from 50 faculties were collected and analyzed. The study focused on the challenges of remote assessment in general and academic dishonesty in particular. The main challenges identified in remote assessment were academic dishonesty, infrastructure, coverage of learning outcomes, and commitment of students to submit assessments. To minimize academic dishonesty, preparing different questions to each student was found to be the best approach. Online presentation was also found to be good option to control academic integrity violations. Combining various assessment methods, for instance report submission with online presentation, helps to minimize academic dishonesty since the examiner would have a chance to confirm whether the submitted work is the work of the student.","output":"Challenges of remote assessment in higher education in the context of COVID-19: a case study of Middle East College"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This contribution draws from the experience of intensive care unit psychologists at 2 frontline hospitals in Milan, Italy, during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first line of therapy is usually based on oral or intravenous iron supplementation; however, many patients remain anemic and do not respond. The key might lie in the pathogenesis of the anemia itself. Cancer-related anemia (CRA) is characterized by a decreased circulating serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation despite ample iron stores, pointing to a more complex problem related to iron homeostatic regulation and additional factors such as chronic inflammatory status. This review explores our current understanding of iron homeostasis in cancer, shedding light on the modulatory role of hepcidin in intestinal iron absorption, iron recycling, mobilization from liver deposits, and inducible regulators by infections and inflammation. The underlying relationship between CRA and systemic low-grade inflammation will be discussed, and an integrated multitarget approach based on nutrition and exercise to improve iron utilization by reducing low-grade inflammation, modulating the immune response, and supporting antioxidant mechanisms will also be proposed.

The World Health Organization is attempting to develop and distribute effective vaccines to prevent/reduce key viral respiratory diseases. METHODS The goals of a vaccination program for viral respiratory infections include the prevention of lower respiratory tract infections and prevention of infection-associated morbidities, hospitalization and mortality. This article explores influenza and RSV vaccine developments. RESULTS There are 2 influenza vaccines, trivalent inactivated and live, cold-adapted, attenuated. Trivalent inactivated vaccine is indicated for persons older than 6 months of age. Currently <10%, <30% and <30% of healthy children, healthy adults and high risk children, respectively, are vaccinated. Efficacy is from 70 to 90% in healthy adults younger than 65 years of age and 30-90% in children, with lower efficacy in younger children. Live, cold-adapted, attenuated vaccine is indicated for healthy persons 5-49 years of age and usually is 70-90% effective. Various RSV vaccine formulations are being investigated. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends influenza vaccination for children 6-23 months old. Studies support immunization of all children, not only those at high risk. Current ACIP recommendations focus on high risk persons and do not include school age children. A universal immunization program for all children could benefit the entire community. CONCLUSION Effective vaccines are available for some viral respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza virus), but not for most mucosally restricted respiratory viral pathogens. Research should continue into safe and effective vaccines for all childhood viral illnesses.","output":"Immunization against viral respiratory disease: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection induced by SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgG antibody positivity resulting from natural infection was evaluated.

Neutralizing serum titers were analyzed in seropositive subjects with or without secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: During the 6-month survey, 1.78% seropositive subjects developed secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection while 6.63% seronegative controls developed primary infection (odds ratio: 0.26; 95% confidence interval: 0.17-0.38).

We validated the WHO-recommended SARS-CoV-2-assay and analyzed the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and CARVs. METHODS: Naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) from 7663 patients were prospectively tested by Basel-S-gene and WHO-based E-gene-assay (Roche) in parallel using Basel-N-gene-assay for confirmation. CARVs were prospectively tested in 2394 NOPS by multiplex-NAT, including 1816 (75%) simultaneously for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Basel-S-gene and Roche-E-gene-assays were concordant in 7475 cases (97.5%) including 825 (11%) SARS-CoV-2-positives. In 188 (2.5%) discordant cases, SARS-CoV-2-loads were significantly lower than in concordant positive ones and confirmed in 105 (1.4%). Adults were more frequently SARS-CoV-2-positive, while children tested more frequently CARV-positive. CARV co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 1.8%. SARS-CoV-2 replaced CARVs within 3 weeks reaching 48% of all detected respiratory viruses followed by rhino/enterovirus (13%), influenzavirus (12%), coronavirus (9%), respiratory syncytial (6%) and metapneumovirus (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Winter CARVs were dominant during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impacting infection control and treatment decisions, but were rapidly replaced suggesting competitive infection.

However, in animal models, especially cats (a common model of spinal cord injury and associated bladder pathology), anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research confounder. This study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, propofol, isoflurane, and -chloralose) on urodynamic (pressure, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart rate [HR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated cystometrograms across five adult male cats. pressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with -chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with -chloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller HR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine.

Instead, synthetic peptides, even with higher stability and easily adapted amino acid sequences, still remain largely unexplored in this field.

Pronounced differences have been observed in the interactions between the virus and cell surfaces, suggesting that influenza C virus attaches to the receptors different from those recognized by other myxoviruses. While influenza A and B viruses agglutinate erythrocytes from many species, including humans, the spectrum of erythrocytes agglutinated by influenza C virus is much more restricted. Erythrocytes from rats, mice, and adult chickens are suitable for hemagglutination and hemadsorption tests; cells from other species, however, react not at all or only poorly with influenza C virus. Differences are also observed so far as hemagglutination inhibitors are concerned. A variety of glycoproteins have been shown to prevent influenza A and B viruses from agglutinating erythrocytes. In the case of influenza C virus, rat serum was for a long time the only known hemagglutination inhibitor. A difference in the receptors for influenza C virus and other myxo-viruses was also suggested by studies on the receptor-destroying enzyme. The ability of influenza C virus to inactivate its own receptors was reported soon after the first isolation of this virus from a patient. However, the influenza C enzyme did not affect the receptors of other myxoviruses and, conversely, the receptor-destroying enzyme of either of the latter viruses was unable to inactivate the receptors for influenza C virus on erythrocytes. While the enzyme of influenza A and B virus was characterized as a neuraminidase in the 1950s, even with refined methodology no such activity was detectable with influenza C virus. It is now known that both the receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities, as well as the fusion activity of influenza C virus are mediated by the only glycoprotein present on the surface of the virus particle.

We summarize the evidence, which supports the routine use of antenatal corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate and low-dose aspirin where clinically indicated, and if not contraindicated for medical reasons. We highlight that decision-making about initiation, dose and duration of prophylactic anticoagulation for pregnant patients with COVID-19 should be made by a multidisciplinary team and must consider disease severity, timing of delivery in relation to disease onset, inpatient versus outpatient status, underlying comorbidities, and contraindications to the use of anticoagulation.

We examined the clinical courses of 45 PLWH who required hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study in which ICD-10 codes were used to identify PLWH who were admitted to three large hospital systems in Memphis, TN with COVID-19. We included all patients  18 years of age with HIV and a documented positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. After manual ion from the electronic health records, chi-squared and T-tests were performed to evaluate associations between patient-level factors and outcomes. Results A total of 45 patients with HIV who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were admitted to Memphis, TN area hospitals between March 2020 and October 2020. 18 (40%) were female, 43 (95.6%) were Black, and the average age was 50.3 years (SD 12.6). The average BMI was 30.2 (SD 8.6). 40 (88.9%) patients admitted had at least one comorbidity with the most common being hypertension (28 patients, 62.2%) and diabetes (14 patients, 31.1%). 24 (46.7%) patients had a Charlson Comorbidity Index > 3. 15/43 (48.4%) patients had a CD4 count < 200, and 35 (77.8%) were on ART. 30 (66.7%) patients met SIRS criteria within 24 hours of admission, and 27 (60%) required some form of oxygen supplementation during hospitalization, including 4 (8.9%) who required intubation. The average length of stay was 10.4 days (SD 12.5). 9 (20%) patients required an ICU stay, and 3 (6.7%) died. BMI > 30, CD4 count < 200, and viral load > 1000 were not associated with worse outcomes. Both a Charlson Comorbidity Index > 3 and the absence of ART were associated with need for ICU-level care. Conclusion Viral load, CD4 count, and BMI were not correlated with differences in mortality or oxygen use in our study. Patients with higher Charlson Comorbidity Indices and patients who were not on ART at presentation were significantly more likely to require the ICU.

We also identified classical monocytes as the first immune cell type to recover by restoring HLA-DR-positivity and by reducing the immunosuppressive CD163+ monocyte population, followed by the recovery of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell, and mDC populations. The identified immunotypes also correlated to aberrant cytokine and acute-phase reactant levels.

Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.","output":"L'optimisme et COVID-19 : une ressource pour soutenir les personnes en situation de confinement ?/ [Optimism and COVID-19: A resource to support people in confinement?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small molecule inhibitors have previously been investigated in different studies as possible therapeutics in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In the current drug repurposing study, we identified the leukotriene (D4) receptor antagonist Montelukast as a novel agent that simultaneously targets two important drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. We initially demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of Montelukast through multiscale molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro experiments including the Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T / hACE2, and virus neutralization assay using xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitro results confirmed the dual potential effect of the Montelukast both on virus entry into the host cell (Spike/ACE2) and on the main protease enzyme inhibition. The virus neutralization assay results showed that while no cytotoxicity of the Montelukast was observed at 12 M concentration, the cell index time 50 (CIT50) value was delayed for 12 hours. Moreover, it was also shown that Favipiravir, a well-known antiviral used in COVID-19 therapy, should be used by 16-fold higher concentrations than Montelukast in order to have the same effect of Montelukast. The rapid use of new small molecules in the pandemic is very important today. Montelukast, whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well characterized and has been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently be completed in clinical phase studies and if its effect is proven in clinical phase studies, it should be used against COVID-19.","output":"The neutralization effect of Montelukast on SARS-CoV-2 is shown by multiscale in silico simulations and combined in vitro studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first case of COVID-19 reported in late December of 2019 in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused approximately 20 million infections and 732 thousand deaths around the world by 11 August 2020. Although the pathogen generally infects the respiratory system, whether it is present in the bloodstream and whether it poses a threat to the blood supply during the period of the outbreak is of serious public concern. In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2199 blood donors, who had donated blood at the Guangzhou Blood Center during the epidemic. The Ig-reactive samples were further characterized for IgA, IgG, and IgM subtypes by ELISA and viral nucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among the 2199 plasma samples, seven were reactive under total antibodies' screening. Further testing revealed that none of them had detectable viral nucleic acid or IgM antibody, but two samples contained IgA and IgG. The IgG antibody titers of both positive samples were 1:16 and 1:4, respectively. Our results indicated a low prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in our blood donors, as none of the tests were positive for viral nucleic acid and only 2 out of 2199 (0.09%) of samples were positive for IgG and IgA. There would be a limited necessity for the implementation of such testing in blood screening in a COVID-19 low-risk area.","output":"Low prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among voluntary blood donors in Guangzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug repurposing has the advantage of identifying potential treatments on a shortened timescale. In response to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we took advantage of a high-content screen of 3,713 compounds at different stages of clinical development to identify FDA-approved compounds that reduce mucin-1 (MUC1) protein abundance. Elevated MUC1 levels predict the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. Our screen identifies fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, as a repurposing candidate for the treatment of ALI. In vivo, fostamatinib reduces MUC1 abundance in lung epithelial cells in a mouse model of ALI. In vitro, SYK inhibition by the active metabolite R406 promotes MUC1 removal from the cell surface.

Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R 0 Without self-isolation, when R 0 = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R 0 = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The advisory of postponing or canceling elective surgeries escalated a worldwide debate regarding the safety and feasibility of performing elective surgical procedures during this pandemic. Limited data are available on gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 undergoing surgery. METHODS: Clinical data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Surgically resected specimens of the cases with confirmed COVID-19 were obtained to detect the expression of ACE2 and the presence of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients (male, 34) with a median age 62.5 years were enrolled. All the patients presented no respiratory symptoms or abnormalities on chest computed tomography before surgery. Six patients (11.5%) experienced symptom onset and were confirmed to be COVID-19. All were identified to be preoperatively pre/asymptomatic, as 5 were with SARS-CoV-2 presenting in cytoplasm of enterocytes or macrophages from the colorectal tissues and 1 had symptom onset immediately after surgery. The case fatality rate in patients with COVID-19 was 16.7%, much higher than those without COVID-19 (2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 were at high risk of postoperative onset and death. At current pandemic, elective surgery should be postponed or canceled. It highlights the need for investigating the full clinical spectrum and natural history of this infection. The early colorectal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 may have major implications on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Postoperative Onset and Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Surgically Resected Specimens From Gastrointestinal Cancer Patients With Pre/Asymptomatic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Boomerang employment has become an increasingly significant third way to obtain employees, yet little research has focused on why does ex-employee want to come back.

The cooperative relationship between the former organization and the current organization could enhance these effects. Results from a two-time points survey of 202 Chinese employees showed that legacy identification could increase boomerang intention, perceived corporate prestige could increase boomerang intention via legacy identification, psychological contract violation could decrease boomerang intention via legacy identification. Besides, the positive effect of legacy identification on boomerang intention, the positive indirect effect of corporate prestige on boomerang intention via legacy identification, and the negative indirect effect of psychological contract violation on boomerang intention via legacy identification are all stronger when there is a cooperative relationship.

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic the human brain. It uses machine learning methods such as supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised learning strategies to learn automatically in deep architectures and has gained much popularity due to its superior ability to learn from huge amounts of data. It was found that deep learning approaches can be used for big data analysis successfully. Applications include virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri, facial recognition, personalization, natural language processing, autonomous cars, automatic handwriting generation, news aggregation, the colorization of black and white images, the addition of sound to silent films, pixel restoration, and deep dreaming. As a review, this paper aims to categorically cover several widely used deep learning algorithms along with their architectures and their practical applications: backpropagation, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, capsnets, transformer, embeddings from language models, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, and attention in natural language processing. In addition, challenges of deep learning are also presented in this paper, such as AutoML-Zero, neural architecture search, evolutionary deep learning, and others. The pros and cons of these algorithms and their applications in healthcare are explored, alongside the future direction of this domain. This paper presents a review and a checkpoint to systemize the popular algorithms and to encourage further innovation regarding their applications. For new researchers in the field of deep learning, this review can help them to obtain many details about the advantages, disadvantages, applications, and working mechanisms of a number of deep learning algorithms. In addition, we introduce detailed information on how to apply several deep learning algorithms in healthcare, such as in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. By presenting many challenges of deep learning in one section, we hope to increase awareness of these challenges, and how they can be dealt with.

Background: The problem of outpatient healthcare expenses incurred by citizens in countries with limited resources has received little attention. Thus, this study aimed to determine the predictors of household spending on outpatient expenses in Kenya. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis on households in Kenya using data from the 2018 Kenya Household Health Expenditure and Utilization Survey. We applied the generalized estimating equations method to determine the best subset of predictors of outpatient care cost. Findings: The best predictors of outpatient care expenses in Kenya are age, wealth index, and education level of the household head. Conclusions: There were no differences regarding age in the mean spending on outpatient care. Moreover, we found that the cost of outpatient care changes with age in a sinusoidal manner. We observed that rich households spent more on outpatient care, mostly owing to their financial ability. Households whose heads reported primary or secondary school education level spent less on outpatient costs than households headed by those who never went to school.","output":"What Drives Outpatient Care Costs in Kenya?

Approximately two-thirds of these additional deaths were linked to disruptions in the provision of malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to carry the heaviest malaria burden, accounting for about 95% of all cases and 96% of all deaths in 2020, with around 80% of deaths in the region among children under five years old.

In contrast, we find no evidence on adverse health effects as measured by hospitalizations and mortality. The impact on utilization is heterogeneous along several dimensions. In particular, we find geographic disparities between regions with high and low availability of primary care. We also observe that patients with chronic conditions substitute more strongly toward other providers. Our results have potential implications for health policy in at least two dimensions: first, practice closures lead to more fragmented care which may entail inefficiencies, and second, closures deteriorate access to primary care in regions with low physician density.","output":"Who cares when you close down?

This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services, which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients' symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution. OBJECTIVE: In order to establish a contactless method of recommending the appropriate medical specialty, this study aimed to construct a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and to develop an AI chatbot that can be used on a smartphone. METHODS: We collected 118,008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty), conducted data cleansing, and finally constructed a pipeline of 51,134 sentences for this study. Several deep learning models, including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer, as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP, were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called \\"Alpha\\" to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones. RESULTS: The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F1-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F1-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones. CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning-based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner, based on their symptoms, thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers.","output":"Medical Specialty Recommendations by an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot on a Smartphone: Development and Deployment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction A record number of influenza outbreaks in aged care facilities (ACFs) in New South Wales (NSW) during 2017 provided an opportunity to measure the health impact of those outbreaks and assess the quality of routinely available surveillance data. Methods Data for all ACF influenza outbreaks in NSW in 2017 were extracted from the Notifiable Conditions Information Management System. The numbers of outbreaks, residents with influenza-like illness (ILI), hospital admissions and deaths were assessed. For each outbreak the attack rate; duration; timeliness of notification; resident and staff influenza vaccination coverage; and antiviral use for treatment or prophylaxis were analysed. Data were considered for NSW in total and separately for seven of the state's local health districts. Data completeness was assessed for all available variables. Results A total of 538 ACF outbreaks resulted in 7,613 residents with ILI, 793 hospitalisations and 338 deaths. NSW outbreaks had a median attack rate of 17% and median duration of eight days. Data completeness, which varied considerably between districts, limited the capacity to accurately consider some important epidemiological and policy issues. Discussion Influenza outbreaks impose a major burden on the residents and staff of ACFs. Accurate assessment of the year-to-year incidence and severity of influenza outbreaks in these facilities is important for monitoring the effectiveness of outbreak prevention and management strategies.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has infected more than 7.7 million people and caused more than 423,000 deaths. PATIENTS: Adult hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients with mechanical ventilation from 557 hospitals from China. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From a nationwide cohort, 141 coronavirus disease 2019 cases with mechanical ventilation were extracted from 1,590 cases. Cigarette smoke, advanced age, coexisting chronic illness, elevated systolic blood pressure, high body temperature, and abnormal laboratory findings are common in these ventilated cases. Multivariate regression analysis showed that higher odds of in-hospital death was associated with invasive mechanical ventilation requirement (hazard ratio: 2.95; 95% CI, 1.40C6.23; p = 0.005), and coexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio, 4.57; 95% CI, 1.65C12.69; p = 0.004) and chronic renal disease (hazard ratio, 5.45; 95% CI, 1.85C16.12; p = 0.002).

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA We constructed a canine model of anorectal transplantation, evaluated the long-term outcomes, and controlled rejection and infection in allotransplantation. METHODS In the pudendal nerve function study, 6 dogs were randomly divided into 2 groups, transection and anastomosis, and were compared with a control using anorectal manometry, electromyography, and histological examination. In the anorectal transplantation model, 4 dogs were assigned to 4 groups: autotransplant, allotransplant with immunosuppression, allotransplant without immunosuppression, and normal control. Long-term function was evaluated by defecography, videography, and histological examination. RESULTS In the pudendal nerve function study, anorectal manometry indicated that the anastomosis group recovered partial function 6 months postoperatively. Microscopically, the pudendal nerve and the sphincter muscle regenerated in the anastomosis group. Anorectal transplantation was technically successful with a 3-stage operation: colostomy preparation, anorectal transplantation, and stoma closure. The dog who underwent allotransplantation and immunosuppression had 2 episodes of mild rejection, which were reversed with methylprednisolone and tacrolimus. The dog who underwent allotransplantation without immunosuppression had a severe acute rejection that resulted in graft necrosis. Successful dogs had full defecation control at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS We describe the critical role of the pudendal nerve in anorectal function and the first long-term success with anorectal transplantation in a canine model. This report is a proof-of-concept study for anorectal transplantation as a treatment for patients with an ostomy because of anorectal dysfunction.","output":"Anorectal Transplantation: The First Long-Term Success in a Canine Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]there is an urgent requirement for conducting academic research on several aspects The Editorial Board and the Editors are appointed by the Allied Academies, Inc , a non-profit association of scholars whose purpose is to encourage and support the advancement and exchange of knowledge, understanding and teaching throughout the world The journal focuses on disseminating the latest innovative research in the fields of marketing, including but not limited to foreign market network, market opportunities, network competence, branding strategies, personalized e-commerce, e-satisfaction and e-loyalty buying attributes, e-marketing and online fraud, marketing in banking sector, efficient marketing plan, consumer satisfaction and eccentric business communication for study","output":"Letter from the Editorial Board for Academy of Marketing Studies Journal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Supportive parenting is critical for promoting healthy child development in the face of stressors, such as those occurring during COVID-19. Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. METHODS: Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the \\"Parenting During the Pandemic\\" survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5-8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic- linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. FINDINGS: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. INTERPRETATIONS: Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent- child relationship disruptions. Focused efforts are needed to address caregiver mental health to protect child health as part of the pandemic response.","output":"Supporting families to protect child health: Parenting quality and household needs during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade or so, African countries have on average experienced an annual five percent Gross Domestic Product growth rate, even during the 2007-2009 economic recession in the West Sadly, the international economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 virus pandemic and a fall in oil prices are likely to reverse this economic growth trend [ ]Africa is ill-prepared to deal with the devastating impact of the pandemic on its health, economic and political systems Rapid population growth has huge implications for the continent, causing a \\"youth-bulge\\" that leads to greater political instability and provides foot soldiers for terrorist groups USAID's Feed the Future and Global Food Security Strategy initiatives focus on boosting agricultural productivity","output":"Living with Africa for a Lifetime"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is rapidly evolving and remains a major health challenge worldwide.

The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Farm size, and policies related to anti-scour vaccination, offering free-choice water and minerals to calves, methods of feeding, and the use of medicated feeds significantly altered the odds of a farm experiencing above-median pneumonia rates. Farm policies with regard to anti-scour vaccination, offering free-choice salt to calves, age at teat removal, type of calf housing, and use of preventive antimicrobials significantly altered the odds of a farm experiencing above-median scours rates. Scours and pneumonia were significantly associated with each other at both the farm and the calf level. No significant associations were found between individual calf management practices and the odds of being treated for scours.

While the lungs are the major site of infection, the brain is also infected in some patients. Brain infection may result in long-term neurological sequelae, but little is known about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in this organ. We previously showed that the brain was a major target organ for infection in mice that are transgenic for the SARS-CoV receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Herein, we use these mice to show that virus enters the brain primarily via the olfactory bulb, and infection results in rapid, transneuronal spread to connected areas of the brain. This extensive neuronal infection is the main cause of death because intracranial inoculation with low doses of virus results in a uniformly lethal disease even though little infection is detected in the lungs. Death of the animal likely results from dysfunction and/or death of infected neurons, especially those located in cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla. Remarkably, the virus induces minimal cellular infiltration in the brain. Our results show that neurons are a highly susceptible target for SARS-CoV and that only the absence of the host cell receptor prevents severe murine brain disease.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection causes neuronal death in the absence of encephalitis in mice transgenic for human ACE2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a growing concern around the world. They contribute to increasing mortality and morbidity rates and are an economic threat. All hospital patients have the potential to contract an HAI, but those with weakened or inferior immune systems are at highest risk. Most hospital patients will contract at least one HAI, but many will contract multiple ones. Bacteria are the most common cause of HAIs and contribute to 80C90% of all HAIs, with Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae accounting for the majority. Each of these bacteria are highly resistant to antibiotics and can produce a protective film, known as a biofilm, to further prevent their eradication. It has been shown that by detecting and eradicating bacteria in the environment, infection rates can be reduced. The current methods for detecting bacteria are time consuming, non-specific, and prone to false negatives or false positives. Aptamer-based biosensors have demonstrated specific, time-efficient and simple detection, highlighting the likelihood that they could be used in a similar way to detect HAI-causing bacteria.","output":"Novel Detection of Nasty Bugs, Prevention Is Better than Cure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Qualitative and quantitative detection of nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) plays a significant role in COVID-19 diagnosis surveillance prevention and control. Methods A total of 117 samples from 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 61 patients without COVID-19 were collected. Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) were used for qualitative and quantitative analyses of these samples to evaluate the diagnostic performance and applicability of the two methods. Results The positive detection rates of RT-qPCR and ddPCR were 93.3% and 100% respectively. Among the 117 samples 6 samples were tested single-gene positive by RT-qPCR but positive by ddPCR and 3 samples were tested negative by RT-qPCR but positive by ddPCR. The viral load of samples with inconsistent results were relatively low (3.1C20.5 copies/test). There were 17 samples (37%) with a viral load below 20 copies/test among the 46 positive samples and only 9 of them were successfully detected by RT-qPCR. A severe patient was dynamically monitored. All 6 samples from this patient were tested negative by RT-qPCR but 4 samples were tested positive by ddPCR with a low viral load. Conclusion Qualitative analysis of COVID-19 samples can meet the needs of clinical screening and diagnosis while quantitative analysis provides more information to the research community. Although both ddPCR and RT-qPCR can provide qualitative and quantitative results ddPCR showed higher sensitivity and lower limit of detection than RT-qPCR and it does not rely on the standard curve to quantify viral load.

In skeletal muscle, recent studies have demonstrated that eIF3f plays a central role in skeletal muscle size maintenance. Accordingly, eIF3f overexpression results in hypertrophy through modulation of protein synthesis via the mTORC1 pathway. Importantly, eIF3f was described as a target of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MAFbx/atrogin-1 for proteasome-mediated breakdown under atrophic conditions. The biological importance of the MAFbx/atrogin-1-dependent targeting of eFI3f is highlighted by the finding that expression of an eIF3f mutant insensitive to MAFbx/atrogin-1 polyubiquitination is associated with enhanced protection against starvation-induced muscle atrophy. A better understanding of the precise role of this subunit should lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to prevent or limit muscle wasting that prevails in numerous physiological and pathological states such as immobilization, aging, denervated conditions, neuromuscular diseases, AIDS, cancer, diabetes.

Key issues among patient research partners with psoriatic disease expressed in the premeeting survey and panel discussion/question-and-answer period included: vaccine efficacy and safety, the need to continue safe social habits and masking, how to assess efficacy of vaccination, how to deal with vaccine hesitancy among social contacts, medication management relative to vaccination, and concerns about the adequacy of ongoing telehealth visits vs the convenience of that technology.","output":"COVID-19 Update for the GRAPPA 2021 Annual Meeting: Focus on COVID-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still raging worldwide. Efficient, fast and low-cost severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid detection methods are urgently needed. Methods: A rapid PCR temperature change mode was explored by moving the reaction tube between the independent temperature modules with large temperature differences and a portable ultra-fast real-time PCR instrument were developed. We established a rapid SARS-CoV-2 test method using the ultra-fast real-time PCR instrument, a China Food and Drug Administration-certified SARS-CoV-2 reagent and optimized reaction condition. The analytical and clinical performances of the rapid tests were evaluated by comparing with the standard SARS-CoV-2 tests. Results: The new temperature change mode can effectively shorten the amplification reaction time and be successfully used in the development of the ultra-fast real-time PCR instrument. The rapid SARS-CoV-2 test method was established and the time to yield results were greatly shortened from 81 min of the standard test to 31 min. Specificity of the rapid test was assessed and no non-specific amplification (0/63) was observed. The limits of detection of the rapid and standard tests were similar. Clinical performance was evaluated using 184 respiratory specimens from patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The positive agreement between the rapid and standard tests was 100% (67/67), the negative agreement was 97.4% (114/117), and the kappa statistic was 0.965 (P<0.001). No significant differences in the Ct values for each target gene were observed between the rapid test and the standard test (P>0.05).

However, not all the tools used are considered clear enough to demonstrate those practical contents, in the same way that they occurred in the pre-pandemic period, which can cause the demotivation of some students. The objective of this investigation is to present the development of an Augmented Remote Lab (ARL) and to verify if such resources are able to motivate students in the acquisition of knowledge of Physics during the period of social isolation imposed by the pandemic of Covid-19. In this regard an ARL was developed and used by students of the technical course in Electromechanics of a Brazilian educational institution for the teaching of basic concepts of electricity, in the discipline of Electronics. From this research, it was possible to identify the motivational levels of students regarding attention, relevance, satisfaction and confidence. The results showed a positive trend in the items of attention, relevance and satisfaction, showing that the ARL has the potential to promote interesting levels of motivation. However, the results regarding confidence remained in a neutral to negative trend, demonstrating that although they are satisfied with learning from ARL, it would not be sufficient to obtain satisfactory results in tests on the topic. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Analysis of student motivation in the use of a physics augmented remote lab during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dermatomyositis (DM) is a strikingly heterogenous disease characterized by a broad and ever-evolving spectrum of cutaneous manifestations that transcend the classic \\"hallmarks\\" defined by Peter and Bohan in 1975. Despite the increasing preponderance and ubiquity of autoantibody, radiologic, and electrophysiologic testing, the diagnosis of DM still hinges largely on prompt detection of cutaneous manifestations of this condition. While pathognomonic cutaneous features of DM are more readily recognizable, many patients present with subtle and/or atypical skin manifestations, and diagnosis of DM may require clinician identification of these cutaneous clues. In this review, we highlight several of the lesser-known skin manifestations of DM, specifically, panniculitis, diffuse subcutaneous edema, erythroderma, calcinosis, ulceration, flagellate erythema, Wong-type DM, gingival telangiectasias, and the ovoid palatal patch. We describe the clinical and histopathologic presentation of these cutaneous findings. While manifesting less frequently than the heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules, and Gottron's sign, these cutaneous clues are equally important for clinicians to recognize in order to facilitate timely diagnosis and early intervention.","output":"Covert clues: the non-hallmark cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19) is an infectious disease also known as an acute respiratory syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2. Although in children and adolescents SARS-CoV-2 infection produces mostly mild or moderate symptoms, in a certain percentage of recovered young people a condition of malaise, defined as long-COVID-19, remains. To date, the risk factors for the development of long-COVID-19 are not completely elucidated. Neurotrophins such as NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) and BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) are known to regulate not only neuronal growth, survival and plasticity, but also to influence cardiovascular, immune, and endocrine systems in physiological and/or pathological conditions; to date only a few papers have discussed their potential role in COVID-19. In the present pilot study, we aimed to identify NGF and BDNF changes in the serum of a small cohort of male and female adolescents that contracted the infection during the second wave of the pandemic (between September and October 2020), notably in the absence of available vaccines. Blood withdrawal was carried out when the recruited adolescents tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 (post-infected COVID-19), 30 to 35 days after the last molecular test. According to their COVID-19 related outcomes, the recruited individuals were divided into three groups: asymptomatics, acute symptomatics and symptomatics that over time developed long-COVID-19 symptoms (future long-COVID-19). As a control group, we analyzed the serum of age-matched healthy controls that did not contract the infection. Inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-, TGF-), MCP-1, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12) were also analyzed with the free oxygen radicals presence as an oxidative stress index. We showed that NGF serum content was lower in post-infected-COVID-19 individuals when compared to healthy controls; BDNF levels were found to be higher compared to healthy individuals only in post-infected-COVID-19 symptomatic and future long-COVID-19 girls, leaving the BDNF levels unchanged in asymptomatic individuals if compared to controls. Oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers were unchanged in male and female adolescents, except for TGF- that, similarly to BDNF, was higher in post-infected-COVID-19 symptomatic and future long-COVID-19 girls. We predicted that NGF and/or BDNF could be used as early biomarkers of COVID-19 morbidity in adolescents.","output":"Serum NGF and BDNF in Long-COVID-19 Adolescents: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented changes to all facets of the healthcare system, including the diagnostic industry.

Here, we investigated patterns of intraspecific variation in male reproductive investment in the terrestrial-breeding frog Pseudophryne guentheri. Like most anurans, breeding activity in P. guentheri is cued by precipitation, and therefore the timing and duration of breeding seasons differ among geographically separated populations, potentially leading to differences in the level of sperm competition. We, therefore, anticipated local adaptation in sperm traits that reflect these phenological differences among populations. Our analysis of six natural populations across a rainfall gradient revealed significant divergence in testes and ejaculate traits that correspond with annual rainfall and rainfall seasonality; males from the northern and drier edge of the species range had significantly smaller testes containing fewer, smaller and less motile sperm compared with those from mesic central populations. These findings may reflect spatial variation in the strength of postcopulatory sexual selection, likely driven by local patterns of precipitation.","output":"Extensive geographical variation in testes size and ejaculate traits in a terrestrial-breeding frog."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As remdesivir, the first FDA-approved drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be used only for hospitalized patients due to intravenous administration, there is an urgent need of effective oral antiviral formulations to be used at early stage of infection in an outpatient setting.

The treatments of anti-tumor chemo-agents recruit more tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) which are highly implicated in the chemoresistance development, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF1&#945;) in GC cells is activated upon 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment and results in much more accumulation of M2-type TAMs which protect tumor cells from chemo-agents. Mechanistically, in the GC cells under the 5-FU treatment, reactive oxygen species is accumulated and then induces the activation of HIF1&#945; signaling to drive the expression of high-mobility group box 1, which leads to more macrophage's infiltration into GC tumor. In turn, the recruited TAMs exhibit tumor-protected M2-type phenotype and promote the chemoresistance of GC cells via producing growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) to exacerbate the fatty acid ?-oxidation in tumor cells. Blocking GDF15 using antibody or inhibiting FAO of tumor cells by etomoxir efficiently gave rise to the tumor cell sensitivity to 5-FU. Therefore, our study demonstrates a novel insight in understanding the cross talking between tumor cells and immune microenvironment and provides new therapeutic targets for clinic treatments of gastric cancer.","output":"Activated HIF1 of tumor cells promotes chemoresistance development via recruiting GDF15-producing tumor-associated macrophages in gastric cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deterioration is sometimes unexpected in SARS-CoV2 infection.

Cut-off points were established, and finally a risk score was built. 893 patients were included. Median age was 68.2  15.2 years. 87(9.7%) were admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 72(8.1%) needed mechanical ventilation support. 171(19.1%) patients died.

Disease activity and treatment response may be difficult to assess but unlike adults outcome measures have not been developed in children. METHODS The study was performed in children (0-18 years) at the neuromuscular center of a pediatric hospital over a 3-year period. Patients were recruited prospectively as part of their routine clinical care. Demographic data, diagnosis (JMG/CMS), and the following scales were recorded at each visit: Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America class (MGFA), Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and Pediatric Myasthenia Quality of Life 15(PM-QOL15). RESULTS 33 patients (24 JMG, 9 CMS) were included in the study, 22 had two or more visits. We established known-groups validity of the MGC and PM-QOL15 scores as compared to the MGFA class. To establish concurrent validity, we constructed a ROC curve and calculated threshold values of MGC and PM-QOL15 with optimal sensitivity and specificity for identifying a patient with more severe (MGFA III or higher) disease. Finally, we demonstrated the concordance between the MGC and PM-QOL15 by their statistically significant positive Pearson's and Spearman correlations.

Social upheavals throughout the history of mankind were accompanied by many concomitant factors, one of which was an appeal to the patterns included in the ethnocultural memory of peoples. At the beginning of the 21st century, the ideas and customs of the Old Believers were updated, which helped them to survive earlier during periods of epidemics (for example, the plague of 1771).

Focusing on teacher education, it is worth considering the practices adopted to inform the development of future curricula that cultivate teaching competencies for e-learning. This paper examines microteaching, a well-established practice realised in teacher education as a learning-to-teach experience. As was the case with other teacher education practices, the forced online transition heavily compromised the vividness of microteaching-a technique inherently connected to face-to-face interaction-. On the other hand, this online relocation can be an opportunity to capitalise on online microteaching as a fulfilling e-learning experience in teacher education. The paper has two parts. In the first part, we conceptualise the potential of microteaching while applying Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL). The second part reports our experience relocating online a mature technology-enhanced microteaching practice (successfully implemented in face-to-face settings for seven years) due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our research design utilises two implementations of microteaching practice. One was conducted in a typical face-to-face context pre-pandemic, and another was conducted in an online context during a lockdown imposed by the pandemic. On a first level, collecting qualitative data from both contexts allowed us to observe common TEL-related challenges. On a second level, we focused on identifying challenges distinct at the online context to infer and highlight the implications of the online relocation. These implications relate to (i) the organisational changes, as experienced from the instructors perspective, (ii) the technologies adopted for applying TEL, and (iii) the challenges that pre-service teachers (PSTs) face in the online environment. Our findings extend the previous research scope on face-to-face microteaching practice. New challenges of relocating technology-enhanced microteaching online include technical difficulties in handling technologies and reduced participation in whole-class discussions. However, challenges that remain relatively unaffected concerning the typical face-to-face practice are (i) the PSTs immersion in the roleplaying character of microteaching, (ii) the misconceptions on the principles and methods of teaching techniques roleplayed, (iii) the adoption of digital tools for applying TEL, (iv) the selection of suitable digital tools, and (v) the burden of time limitation. In conclusion, we argue that these insights reveal an unexplored potential for technology-enhanced microteaching in an online context. We discuss how the implications of shifting microteaching practise online may model future microteaching implementations in teacher education post-pandemic. We support that online microteaching, apart from providing an alternative method when circumstances impose it, should be integrated within the typical teacher education curriculum to cultivate teaching competencies for e-learning. ? 2022, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the association between CKD and adverse pregnancy outcomes, by cause and severity of CKD where reported. Protocol registration (PROSPERO, CRD:42020211925). DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched until May 24, 2021, supplemented with reference list checking. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies that compared pregnancy outcomes in women with or without CKD were included. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles according to a priori defined inclusion criteria. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS Data extraction and quality appraisal were performed independently by three reviewers. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall certainty of the evidence. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled estimates using the generic inverse variance method. Primary outcomes included pre-eclampsia, Caesarean section (CS), preterm birth (PTB) [<37 wk. gestation] and small for gestational age (SGA). RESULTS Of 4,076 citations, 31 studies were included. Pre-pregnancy CKD was associated significantly with a higher risk of pre-eclampsia [pooled crude odds ratio (OR)= 8.13 (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.41-15), and adjusted OR (aOR)=2.58 (1.33-5.01)], CS [aOR=1.65 (1.21-2.25)], PTB [aOR=1.73 (1.31-2.27)] and SGA [aOR= 1.93 (1.06-3.52)]. The association with stillbirth was not statistically significant [aOR=1.67 (0.96-2.92)]. Subgroup analyses indicated that different causes of CKD might confer different risks and that severity of CKD is associated with risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, as pregnancies with later stages CKD, compared to earlier stages, had higher odds of pre-eclampsia, PTB and SGA. The GRADE certainty of the evidence was 'very low' across all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis quantified associations between pre-pregnancy CKD, overall and according to cause and severity, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. These findings might support clinicians aiming to counsel women with CKD, by allowing them to tailor their advice according to cause and severity of CKD. We identified gaps in the literature and further studies examining the effect of specific kidney diseases, and other clinical characteristics (e.g. proteinuria, hypertension), on adverse pregnancy outcomes are warranted.","output":"Chronic Kidney Disease and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Outcomes from intervention in patients with ACS are time dependent Patients admitted to non-PCI hospitals often experience inequitable access to PCI and poor timelines Elderly patients in particular are at higher risk following ACS We audited outcomes in two rural hospitals with and without onsite PCI access Method: Retrospective data was collected for patients presenting with ACS to Hawke's bay hospital (HB) and PCI-capable Nelson hospital (NM) between February 2017 - Jan 2018 Patients were divided by age group Percentage of intervention, door-to-intervention time in days (DIT), length of stay in days (LOS) and adverse outcomes were analysed Results: There was no significant difference in mean age (683 6 vs 703 3) and GRACE score (1169 5 vs 1248 6) between HB (n=249) and NM (n=256) HB patients had less intervention (65% vs 71%, &lt;75 and 38% vs 45%, 75), longer DIT (6 03 0 vs 1 00 5, &lt;75 and 4 83 3 vs 1 31 0, 75) and longer LOS (7 83 2 vs 3 01 2, &lt;75 and 7 13 4 vs 4 73 0 75) compared to NM patients (p&lt;0 001) Overall MACCE in HB (18% vs 13%, &lt;75 and 35% vs 31%, 75) and mortality at 18 months (9% vs 6%, &lt;75 and 29% vs 20%, 75) was also higher Conclusion: On-site PCI availability improves timely access to PCI and was associated with significantly lower mortality and MACCE in this unadjusted raw data The elderly appeared to benefit more with an associated substantially lower mortality","output":"Comparison of Post Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Outcomes in Two Peripheral Centres With and Without Onsite Access to Percutaneous Intervention (PCI) by Age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding the risk factors for poor outcomes among COVID-19 patients could help identify vulnerable populations who would need prioritisation in prevention and treatment for COVID-19. We aimed to critically appraise and synthesise published evidence on the risk factors for poor outcomes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, medRxiv and the WHO COVID-19 literature database for studies that reported characteristics of COVID-19 patients who required hospitalisation. We included studies published between January and May 2020 that reported adjusted effect size of any demographic and/or clinical factors for any of the three poor outcomes: mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation. We appraised the quality of the included studies using Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools and quantitatively synthesised the evidence through a series of random-effect meta-analyses. To aid data interpretation, we further developed an interpretation framework that indicated strength of the evidence, informed by both quantity and quality of the evidence. RESULTS: We included a total of 40 studies in our review. Most of the included studies (29/40, 73%) were assessed as good quality, with assessment scores of 80 or more. We found that male sex (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18-1.48; 20 studies), older age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04-1.07, per one year of age increase; 10 studies), obesity (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.02-2.48; 4 studies), diabetes (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11-1.40; 11 studies) and chronic kidney diseases (6 studies; OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.27-1.93) were associated with increased risks for mortality with the greatest strength of evidence based on our interpretation framework. We did not find increased risk of mortality for several factors including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (5 studies), cancer (4 studies), or current smoker (5 studies); however, this does not indicate absence of risk due to limited data on each of these factors. CONCLUSION: Male sex, older age, obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney diseases are important risk factors of COVID-19 poor outcomes. Our review provides not only an appraisal and synthesis of evidence on the risk factors of COVID-19 poor outcomes, but also a data interpretation framework that could be adopted by relevant future research.","output":"Risk factors for poor outcomes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several systemic disorders of childhood are characterized by cutaneous stigmata, and these skin signs can serve as important diagnostic clues.

Through this study, we wanted to assess the various procedures implemented during the lockdown period between March 17 and May 10. METHODS: A monocentric retrospective cohort study was conducted in Cochin Hospital (Paris, France). Patients included were those who had surgery during the lockdown period. To take care of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, various procedures have been set up: reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for all hospitalized patients, a specific unit for COVID-positive patients, a specific surgical room, and use of protective personal equipment. To allow the effectiveness of the procedures implemented, we evaluated the number of complications attributed to SARS-CoV-2 and the number of patients who became COVID positive during hospitalization. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, there were 199 procedures of three types of procedures in our centre: 79 traumatology procedures (39.7%), 76 of bone and soft tissues tumours (38.2%), and 44 procedures related to infection (22.1%). We observed 13 complications (6.5%) during hospitalization, and only one patient became COVID-19 positive during the hospitalization. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic has been a challenge for organization and adaptation to manage all COVID-19 positive and COVID negative.

Lack of protection by transfer of unprimed adult spleen cells was not related to immunosuppression by the host. Moreover, resistance of adult mice could not be abrogated by application of lymphocytes from suckling mice, although immune suppression by other means did affect the resistance of adult animals. On the other hand, spleen cells from nonimmunized mice could be primed with inactivated JHM virus in suckling mice and protected these mice from death due to a subsequent virus infection.

To date, most studies have been inadequately powered to explore differences in the infrequent post-operative complications following thyroidectomy. This study is designed to compare the outcomes of sutureless thyroidectomy and conventional thyroidectomy for recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury, permanent hypoparathyroidism, and haematoma formation. METHODS A cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing total thyroidectomy using conventional versus sutureless techniques was performed. Sutureless thyroidectomy was performed using either Ligasure Precise (Covidien) or Harmonic Focus (Johnson and Johnson) devices. The primary outcome measures were post-operative haemorrhage, permanent RLN injury and hypoparathyroidism. Secondary outcome measures were operative time, temporary hypoparathyroidism and vocal cord dysfunction. A cost minimization analysis comparing the two techniques was performed. RESULT From January 2006 to July 2009, 1935 consecutive patients underwent total thyroidectomy. Of these, 772 underwent conventional thyroidectomy and 1163 were performed using a sutureless technique. The mean operative time was significantly lower in the sutureless group (71 versus 86 min, P = 0.02). There was no difference in the post-operative complications of haematoma (0.78% conventional versus 1.12% sutureless, P = 0.46), permanent hypoparathyroidism (1.30% conventional versus 0.52% sutureless, P = 0.06) or permanent RLN injury (0.26% conventional versus 0.52% sutureless, P = 0.39). There was an overall cost saving of AUD$14,300 per 100 total thyroidectomy cases performed using the sutureless technique.

Understanding how risk factors changed over time can enhance the coordination of healthcare resources and protect the vulnerable. Objective: To investigate the overall trend of severe COVID-19-related outcomes over time since the start of the pandemic, and to evaluate whether the impacts of potential risk factors, such as race/ethnic groups, changed over time. Design: This retrospective cohort study included patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine (MM) from March 10, 2020, to September 2, 2020. According to the quarter in which they first tested positive, the COVID-19-positive cohort were stratified into three groups: Q1, March 1, 2020 - March 31, 2020; Q2, April 1, 2020 - June 30, 2020; Q3, July 1, 2020 - September 2, 2020. Settings: Large, academic medical center. Participants: Individuals tested or treated for COVID-19. Exposure: Examined potential risk factors included age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes included COVID-19-related hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality, which were identified from the electronic health records from MM. Results: The study cohort consisted of 53,853 patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at MM, with mean (SD) age of 44.8 (23.1), mean (SD) BMI of 29.1 (7.6), and 23,814 (44.2%) males. Among the 2,582 patients who tested positive, 719 (27.8%) were hospitalized, 377 (14.6%) were admitted to ICU, and 129 (5.0%) died. The overall COVID-positive hospitalization rate decreased from 41.5% in Q1 to 12.6% in Q3, and the overall ICU admission rate decreased from 24.5% to 5.3%. Black patients had significantly higher (unadjusted) overall hospitalization rate (265 [41.1%] vs 326 [23.2%]), ICU admission rate (139 [21.6%] vs 172 [12.2%]), and mortality rate (42 [6.5%] vs 56 [4.0%]) than White patients. Each quarter, the hospitalization rate remained higher for Black patients compared to White patients, but this difference was attenuated over time for the (unadjusted) odds ratios (Q1: OR=1.9, 95% CI [1.25, 2.90]; Q2: OR=1.42, 95% CI [1.02, 1.98]; Q3: OR=1.36, 95% CI [0.67, 2.65]). Similar decreasing patterns were observed for ICU admission and mortality. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, the racial disparities in hospitalization between White and Black patients were not significant in each quarter of the year (Q1: OR=1.43, 95% CI [0.75, 2.71]; Q2: OR=1.25, 95% CI [0.79, 1.98]; Q3: OR=1.76 95% CI [0.81, 3.85]), in contrast to what was observed in the full cohort (OR=1.85, 95% CI [1.39, 2.47]). Additionally, significant association of hospitalization with living in densely populated area was identified in the first quarter (OR= 664, 95% CI [20.4, 21600]), but such association disappeared in the second and third quarters (Q2: OR= 1.72 95% CI [0.22, 13.5]; Q3: OR=3.69, 95% CI [0.103, 132]). Underlying liver diseases were positively associated with hospitalization in White patients (OR=1.60, 95% CI [1.01, 2.55], P=.046), but not in Black patients (OR=0.49, 95% CI [0.23, 1.06], P=.072, Pint=.013). Similar results were obtained for the effect of liver diseases on ICU admission in White and Black patients (White: OR=1.75, 95% CI [1.01, 3.05], P=.047; Black: OR=0.46, 95% CI [0.17, 1.26], P=.130, Pint=.030). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that the COVID-19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality rates were decreasing over the course of the pandemic. Although racial disparities persisted, the magnitude of the differences in hospitalization and ICU admission rates diminished over time.","output":"Changes in COVID-19-related outcomes and the impacts of the potential risk factors over time: a follow-up analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many youth with mental health needs cannot access treatment, with multiply-marginalized youth, such as sexual minority youth of Color (SMYoC), experiencing both structural and identity-related barriers to care.

However, little large-scale research has examined access to mental health care among SMYoC across the United States, either during or prior to the pandemic. Such work is critical to understanding and ameliorating barriers in this domain. Using data from adolescents who self-identified as SMYoC and who endorsed a desire for mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 470, ages 13-16, from 43 U.S. states), we examined associations between state-level, structural factors (income inequality; mental health-care provider shortage; anti-Black racism; homophobia; and the interaction between anti-Black racism and homophobia) and SMYoC mental health treatment access. Multinomial logistic regressions revealed state-level mental health-care provider shortage as the only significant predictor of SMYoC reporting they never (versus always) accessed mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic. SMYoC living in areas with both lower homophobia and lower anti-Black racism were more likely to report always (versus sometimes) accessing mental health treatment. Results highlight the critical importance of considering diverse structural factors and applying an intersectional lens when exploring barriers to mental health treatment among multiply-marginalized youth. In locations where provider shortages are less severe, cultural stigma - including anti-Black racism and homophobia - may still pose challenges for SMYoC in need of mental health care.","output":"Structural Correlates of Mental Health Support Access among Sexual Minority Youth of Color during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract To examine the genetic control of acute and late disease induced by a murine coronavirus, strain JHM (JHMV), BALB/cHeA, STS/A, F1 hybrids and 13 recombinant inbred (RI) strains between BALB/cHeA and STS/A mouse strains were inoculated intracerebrally with 100 pfu of JHMV. All the BALB/cHeA mice died within 2 weeks from acute encephalitis.

The bulk tissue RNA sequencing analysis indicated that digestive tract organs had higher ACE2 expression levels compared to the lung, and the expression of ACE2 in the lung increased with age. Single-cell RNA-Seq results showed that the ACE2-positive-cell ratio in digestive tract organs was significantly higher compared to the lung. ACE2 expression was higher in tumor cells compared to normal control (NC) tissues. While in gastric tissues, ACE2 expression gradually increased from chronic gastritis to metaplasia, to early cancer.

In this overview, various exogenous and endogenous causes of different types of alveolitis, and the cellular events in their pathogenesis are briefly discussed to illustrate the complex mechanisms involved. Particular emphasis is placed on the possible transition from diffuse exudative to fibrosing alveolitis. It appears that pulmonary fibrosis, which is usually patchy rather than truly diffuse, does not have a uniform pathogenesis. Besides the possibility of a certain degree of a diffuse fibrosis three major pathways are evident: (1) granulation tissue budding into alveolar lumina (luminal fibrosis) (2) exudate incorporation into alveolar walls (mural fibrosis) and  at least equally important-(3) so-called collapse (atelectatic) induration (obliterative-interseptal fibrosis), a process that has largely been neglected so far.","output":"Cellular events in alveolitis and the evolution of pulmonary fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) disease incidence has decreased steadily since 1993 (1), a result of decades of work by local TB programs to detect, treat, and prevent TB disease and transmission. During 2020, a total of 7,163 TB cases were provisionally reported to CDC's National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS) by the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (DC), a relative reduction of 20%, compared with the number of cases reported during 2019.* TB incidence per 100,000 persons was 2.2 during 2020, compared with 2.7 during 2019. Since 2010, TB incidence has decreased by an average of 2%-3% annually (1). Pandemic mitigation efforts and reduced travel might have contributed to the reported decrease. The magnitude and breadth of the decrease suggest potentially missed or delayed TB diagnoses. Health care providers should consider TB disease when evaluating patients with signs and symptoms consistent with TB (e.g., cough of >2 weeks in duration, unintentional weight loss, and hemoptysis), especially when diagnostic tests are negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In addition, members of the public should be encouraged to follow up with their health care providers for any respiratory illness that persists or returns after initial treatment. The steep, unexpected decline in TB cases raises concerns of missed cases, and further work is in progress to better understand factors associated with the decline.","output":"Tuberculosis - United States, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The combination of machine learning (ML) and electronic health records (EHR) data may be able to improve outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients through improved risk stratification and patient outcome prediction. However, in resource constrained environments the clinical utility of such data-driven predictive tools may be limited by the cost or unavailability of certain laboratory tests. We leveraged EHR data to develop an ML-based tool for predicting adverse outcomes that optimizes clinical utility under a given cost structure. We further gained insights into the decision-making process of the ML models through an explainable AI tool. This cohort study was performed using deidentified EHR data from COVID-19 patients from ProMedica Health System in northwest Ohio and southeastern Michigan. We tested the performance of various ML approaches for predicting either increasing ventilatory support or mortality. We performed post hoc analysis to obtain optimal feature sets under various budget constraints. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a significant reduction in cost at the expense of a small reduction in predictive performance. For example, when predicting ventilation, it is possible to achieve a 43% reduction in cost with only a 3% reduction in performance. Similarly, when predicting mortality, it is possible to achieve a 50% reduction in cost with only a 1% reduction in performance. This study presents a quick, accurate, and cost-effective method to evaluate risk of deterioration for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of clinical evaluation.","output":"Budget constrained machine learning for early prediction of adverse outcomes for COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with various systemic diseases. However, its association with diabetes mellitus (DM) was discussed controversially. Few researchers reviewed the association of these two common morbid disorders. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the relationship between AD and DM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed including Epub and ahead of print (198 articles identified) and Cochrane (13 articles) databases. The searching engine was set to include case-control, prospective and retrospective cohorts, and cross-sectional studies from the first published up to February 12, 2021. Two hundred and eleven were identified, eighteen full texts were screened; of them, six were included in the final meta-analysis. The keywords used were AD, diabetes mellitus, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. A datasheet was used to record the author's name, year of publication, country and type of the studies, number of events, and total number in the two arms (patients and controls). Results: Out of the 211 references identified, six studies were pooled to test the association between diabetes mellitus and AD. The studies showed that AD is lower among patients with DM, odds ratio, 0.69, 95% CI, and 0.67-0.72. No heterogeneity was observed (Chi-Square, 4.12, degree of freedom (df.)= 5, and I(2 )= 0%, P-value), 0.53 and P-value for overall effect, <0.001. The included studies were published in Europe (five) and Canada (one study) and included 162,882 patients and 12,164 events, four of the studied articles were case-control studies, one retrospective, and one cross-sectional. Conclusion: AD was lower among patients with DM compared to their counterparts without the disease.

This narrative review focuses primarily on the major bioactive RAS peptide, Angiotensin II (Ang II), and its receptors, namely type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R). Both receptors are involved in the development of NP and represent potential therapeutic targets. We first discuss the potential role of Ang II receptors in modulation of NP in the central nervous system. Ang II receptor expression is widespread in circuits associated with the perception and modulation of pain, but more studies are required to fully characterize receptor distribution, downstream signaling, and therapeutic potential of targeting the central nervous system RAS in NP. We then describe the peripheral neuronal and nonneuronal distribution of the RAS, and its contribution to NP. Other RAS modulators (such as Ang (1-7)) are briefly reviewed as well. AT1R antagonists are analgesic across different pain models, including NP. Several studies show neuronal protection and outgrowth downstream of AT2R activation, which may lead to the use of AT2R agonists in NP. However, blockade of AT2R results in analgesia. Furthermore, expression of the RAS in the immune system and a growing appreciation of neuroimmune crosstalk in NP add another layer of complexity and therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway. A growing number of human studies also hint at the analgesic potential of targeting Ang II signaling. Altogether, Ang II receptor signaling represents a promising, far-reaching, and novel strategy to treat NP.","output":"Angiotensin receptors and neuropathic pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the enormous generation of contaminated disposed face masks raises many environmental concerns. The present study provides a novel route for efficient crude bio-oil production from disposed masks through co-hydrothermal liquefaction (Co-HTL) with Spirulina platensis grown in wastewater. Ultimate and proximate analysis confirmed that S. platensis contains relatively high nitrogen content (9.13%dw), which decreased by increasing the mask blend ratio. However, carbon and hydrogen contents were higher in masks (83.84 and 13.77%dw, respectively). In addition, masks showed 29.6% higher volatiles than S. platensis, which resulted in 94.2% lower ash content. Thermal decomposition of masks started at a higher temperature (330 C) comparing to S. platensis (208 C). The highest bio-oil yield was recorded by HTL of S. platensis and Co-HTL with 25% (w/w) masks at 300 C, which showed insignificant differences with each other. GC/MS analysis of the bio-oil produced from HTL of algal biomass showed a high proportion of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds (3.6% and 11.9%, respectively), with relatively low hydrocarbons (17.4%). Mask blend ratio at 25% reduced the nitrogen-containing compounds by 55.6% and enhanced the hydrocarbons by 43.7%. Moreover, blending of masks with S. platensis enhanced the compounds within the diesel range in favor of gasoline and heavy oil. Overall, the present study provides an innovative route for enhanced bio-oil production through mask recycling coupled with wastewater treatment.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 30 patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020, were selected as the research subjects. All cases were examined by lung ultrasound and CT. Lung lesions were reviewed by blinded observers, with imaging scores being used to analyze the ultrasound findings of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and with chest CT being used as the reference standard. The clinical value of ultrasound in the noninvasive assessment of lung lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: Lung ultrasound signs in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 were mainly manifested as interstitial pulmonary edema (90.0a??%, 27/30) and pulmonary consolidations (20.0a??%, 6/30). The lung lesions were mainly distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones. The lower lobe and the dorsal region had a greater tendency to be involved. There was moderate agreement (Kappaa??=a??0.529) between the noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound for lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and CT. The ultrasound scores to evaluate mild, moderate and severe lung lesions exhibited sensitivity of 68.8a??% (11/16), 77.8a??% (7/9), 100.0a??% (2/2), specificity of 85.7a??% (12/14), 76.2a??% (16/21), 92.9a??% (26/28), and diagnostic accuracy of 76.7a??% (23/30), 76.7a??% (23/30), 93.3a??% (28/30), respectively.

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 52 356 women in nine hospitals to assess the disruption of institutional delivery care during the pandemic (comparing March to August in 2019 with the same months in 2020). We also conducted a nested follow up cohort study with 2022 women during the pandemic to assess their provision and experience of respectful care. We used linear regression models to assess the association between provision and experience of care with volume of hospital births and women's residence in a COVID-19 hotspot area. Results: The mean institutional births during the pandemic across the nine hospitals was 24 563, an average decrease of 11.6% (P < 0.0001) in comparison to the same time-period in 2019. The institutional birth in high-medium volume hospitals declined on average by 20.8% (P < 0.0001) during the pandemic, whereas in low-volume hospital institutional birth increased on average by 7.9% (P = 0.001).

During the initial coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, Northwell Health rapidly expanded to greater than 1,000 ICU beds. The surge in patients required redeployment of noncritical care providers to the ICU bedside. The Tele-ICU program expanded from covering 176 beds pre pandemic to assisting with care for patients in approximately 450 beds via deployment of Wi-Fi-enabled mobile telehealth carts to the newly formed ICUs. Patients: Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients hospitalized at Northwell Health, NY, at any point from March 2020 to June 2020. Interventions: To offset the shortage of critical care physicians, Northwell Health established a collaboration with the Tele-ICU program of Providence, St. Joseph Health in the state of Washington, which enabled the critical care physicians of Providence, St. Joseph Health to participate in virtual rounding on critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients at Northwell Health. Main Results: We developed an innovative hybrid model that allowed for virtual rounding on an additional 40-60 patients per day by a remote critical care physician at Providence, St. Joseph Health.

In concert with its metabolizing enzymes, particularly sphingomyelinases, it has key roles in regulating the physical properties of biological membranes, including the formation of membrane microdomains. Thus, ceramide and its related molecules have been attributed significant roles in nearly all steps of the viral life cycle: they may serve directly as receptors or co-receptors for viral entry, form microdomains that cluster entry receptors and/or enable them to adopt the required conformation or regulate their cell surface expression. Sphingolipids can regulate all forms of viral uptake, often through sphingomyelinase activation, and mediate endosomal escape and intracellular trafficking. Ceramide can be key for the formation of viral replication sites. Sphingomyelinases often mediate the release of new virions from infected cells. Moreover, sphingolipids can contribute to viral-induced apoptosis and morbidity in viral diseases, as well as virus immune evasion. Alpha-galactosylceramide, in particular, also plays a significant role in immune modulation in response to viral infections.

RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple randomized controlled studies have embedded supervised, structured exercise therapy as a class IA recommended therapy for those with symptomatic PAD. More recently, there is interest in non-facility-based exercise training as an alternative. The current literature is mixed on the effectiveness of non-facility-based training and is influenced by the amount of contact with clinical staff providing some supervision (e.g., occasional facility-based exercise or coaching phone calls), and the intensity (e.g., performed intermittently by inducing pain or continually and not inducing pain) and frequency (e.g., 12-week common supervised exercise program or those longer than 24 weeks) of exercise. Certainly, the data suggests non-facility-based exercise, while possibly improving walking performance, is inferior to facility-based supervised exercise training. Comprehensive data is lacking on utilization of supervised exercise therapy in those with symptomatic PAD, but is likely <2% of those eligible who participate. This suggests a possible important role for alternatives including non-facility-based (e.g., home, fitness center). SUMMARY: Exercise training in the supervised, facility-based setting appears to be greatly underutilized. Non-facility-based exercise may help to overcome some of the most common barriers to participating in facility-based exercise including those related to motivation, transportation, and proximity. However, facility-based training is considered the gold standard so decisions about allowing a patient to exercise train at home must take into account issues including disease severity, patient motivation and available exercise resources, mobility and balance, cognitive function, and other medical concerns (e.g., symptomatic coronary artery disease or heart failure).","output":"Decision Aids for Determining Facility Versus Non-Facility-Based Exercise in Those with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ultralight bosonic fields are compelling dark-matter candidates and arise in a variety of beyond standard model scenarios. These fields can tap energy and angular momentum from spinning black holes through superradiant instabilities, during which a macroscopic bosonic condensate develops around the black hole. Striking features of this phenomenon include gaps in the spin-mass distribution of astrophysical black holes and a continuous gravitational-wave (GW) signal emitted by the condensate. So far these processes have been studied in great detail for scalar fields and, more recently, for vector fields. Here we take an important step forward in the black hole superradiance program by computing, analytically, the instability timescale, direct GW emission, and stochastic background, in the case of massive tensor (i.e., spin-2) fields. Our analysis is valid for any black hole spin and for small boson masses. The instability of massive spin-2 fields shares some properties with the scalar and vector cases, but its phenomenology is much richer, for example, there exist multiple modes with comparable instability timescales, and the dominant GW signal is hexadecapolar rather than quadrupolar. Electromagnetic and GW observations of spinning black holes in the mass range M&#8712;(1,10^{10}) M_{a??} can constrain the mass of a putative spin-2 field in the range 10^{-22}a?2m_{b} c^{2}/eVa?210^{-10} .

The demonstration of in vitro infectiousness of respiratory specimens is an informative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 transmission from patients with COVID-19; accordingly, viral isolation assays in cell culture are an important aspect of laboratory diagnostics for COVID-19. METHODS: We developed a simple and rapid protocol for isolating SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory specimens using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, a cell line that is highly susceptible to the virus. We also investigated a correlation between isolation of SARS-CoV-2 and viral load detected by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using N2 primer/probe set that has been developed for testing of COVID-19 in Japan. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 isolation protocol did not require blind passage of inoculated cells and yielded the results of viral isolation within 7 days after inoculation. Specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) values of <20.2, determined by rRT-PCR, were predicted to be isolation-positive. On the other hand, 6.9% of specimens with Ct values >35 were virus isolation-positive, indicating that low viral loads (high Ct values) in upper respiratory specimens do not always indicate no risk of containing transmissible virus. CONCLUSION: In combination with rRT-PCR, the SARS-CoV-2 isolation protocol provides a means for assessing the potential risk of transmissible virus in upper respiratory specimens.","output":"Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of upper respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients by virus isolation using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Asian and Latinx individuals have a high burden of untreated depression Under-recognition of depressive symptoms may contribute to existing disparities in depression treatment The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether physicians recognize and treat depressive symptoms for Chinese and Latinx patients during routine primary care visits Methods: We analyzed data from 1171 Chinese and Latinx patients who were interviewed within 1 week after a primary care visit in a large academic practice, which had not yet implemented universal depression screening We included participants with depressive symptoms (defined as a Patient Health Questionaire-2 score 3) and no prior history of depression (N=118) We investigated whether patients perceived having a mental health need in the prior year and conducted chart reviews to assess provider recognition of depressive symptoms, defined as documentation of symptoms, antidepressant initiation, or mental health referral within 30 days of the visit We further examined differences by race/ethnicity and language preference Results: Among the 118 patients with depressive symptoms and no prior depression diagnosis (mean age 68), 71 (61%) reported a mental health need in the prior 12 months;however, providers recognized depressive symptoms in only 8/118 patients (7%) The number of patients with recognized symptoms was small across race/ethnicity and language preference groups and we found no significant differences Conclusion: Physicians recognized and documented depressive symptoms for 1 in 10 Chinese and Latinx patients during routine primary care visits Targeted efforts are needed to address under-recognition of symptoms and improve depression care for these populations","output":"Primary Care Physician Recognition and Documentation of Depressive Symptoms Among Chinese and Latinx Patients During Routine Visits: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Many family members struggle to negotiate their aging relative's care with nursing home staff, potentially leading to depression and other negative outcomes for residents' families.

RESULTS Overall, FIND was feasible and acceptable. Family members who received the FIND intervention were more likely to experience decreased depressive symptoms than those who did not. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS FIND is a promising approach to reduce depression among family members of nursing home residents. Findings support the need for a follow-up clinical trial.","output":"A Pilot Study of An Intervention to Increase Family Member Involvement in Nursing Home Care Plan Meetings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) offers a highly sensitive and convenient approach for electrochemical mapping of interleukin-6 (IL-6), an oral cancer protein biomarker In this study, we utilized the SECM to map the distribution of IL-6 for imaging different cancer stages on the tissue sections The SECM results indicated that IL-6 was expressed higher in cancer tissues as compared to normal tissue and hence, SECM can be employed to improve oral cancer diagnosis Also, IL-6 analysis can be beneficial for predicting the severity of COVID-19 at an early stage to eliminate the potential risks of serious respiratory complications in affected patients ? 2020 The Author(s) Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited","output":"Communication - Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy Analysis of Interleukin-6 in Oral Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endothelium has a rich vesicular network that allows the exchange of macromolecules between blood and parenchymal cells. This feature of endothelial cells, along with their polarized secretory machinery, makes them the second major contributor, after platelets, to the particulate secretome in circulation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by the endothelial cells mirror the remarkable molecular heterogeneity of their parent cells. Cargo molecules carried by EVs were shown to contribute to the physiological functions of endothelium and may support the plasticity and adaptation of endothelial cells in a paracrine manner. Endothelium-derived vesicles can also contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease or can serve as prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers. Finally, endothelium-derived EVs can be used as therapeutic tools to target endothelium for drug delivery or target stromal cells via the endothelial cells. In this review we revisit the recent evidence on the heterogeneity and plasticity of endothelial cells and their EVs. We discuss the role of endothelial EVs in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis along with their contributions to endothelial adaptation and dysfunction.

As it is becoming increasingly clear that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause immunological alterations, we investigated the expression of the inhibitory checkpoint PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 to explore the potential role of this axis in the break of self-tolerance. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in colon tissue was demonstrated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical localization of the nucleocapsid protein. Expression of lymphocyte markers, PD-1, and PD-L1 in colon tissue was investigated by IHC. SARS-CoV-2-immunoreactive cells were detected both in the ulcerated and non-ulcerated mucosal areas. Compared to healthy tissue, where PD-1 is weakly expressed and PD-L1 is absent, PD-1 and PD-L1 expression appears in the inflamed mucosal tissue, as expected, but was mainly confined to non-ulcerative areas. At the same time, these markers were virtually undetectable in areas of mucosal ulceration. Our data show an alteration of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and suggest a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and an aberrant autoinflammatory response due to concomitant breakdown of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction leading to early death of the patient.","output":"Case Report: A Peculiar Case of Inflammatory Colitis After SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article investigates the lawfulness of isolating residents of care and group homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many residents are mobile, and their freedom to move is a central ethical tenet and human right. It is not however an absolute right and trade-offs between autonomy, liberty and health need to be made since COVID-19 is highly infectious and poses serious risks of critical illness and death. People living in care and group homes may be particularly vulnerable because recommended hygiene practices are difficult for them and many residents are elderly, and/or have co-morbidities. In some circumstances, the trade-offs can be made easily with the agreement of the resident and for short periods of time. However challenging cases arise, in particular for residents and occupants with dementia who 'wander', meaning they have a strong need to walk, sometimes due to agitation, as may also be the case for some people with developmental disability (e.g. autism), or as a consequence of mental illness. This article addresses three central questions: (1) in what circumstances is it lawful to isolate residents of social care homes to prevent transmission of COVID-19, in particular where the resident has a strong compulsion to walk and will not, or cannot, remain still and isolated? (2) what types of strategies are lawful to curtail walking and achieve isolation and social distancing? (3) is law reform required to ensure any action to restrict freedoms is lawful and not excessive? These questions emerged during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and are still relevant. Although focussed on COVID-19, the results are also relevant to other future outbreaks of infectious diseases in care and group homes. Likewise, while we concentrate on the law in England and Wales, the analysis and implications have international significance.","output":"Isolating residents including wandering residents in care and group homes: Medical ethics and English law in the context of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND It is generally accepted that when an ignition source is used the inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) should be <30% in the breathing circuit to help prevent airway fires. The time and conditions required to reduce a high O2% in the breathing circuit to <30% has not yet been systematically studied. METHODS We evaluated the inspired and expired circuit oxygen concentration response times of an Aestiva Avance S/5 anesthesia machine to reach an FIO2 of <30% from a starting FIO2 of 100% and 60% after reducing the FIO2 to 21%. The circuit was connected to a human patient simulator which has a functional residual capacity of 2 L, total lung capacity of 2.8 L, an oxygen consumption of 200 mL/min, and respiratory quotient of 0.8. Fresh gas flow (FGF) inputs of 2 L/min and 5 L/min were chosen to represent a spectrum of typical clinical FGF rates. Minute ventilation was set at 4 L/min. Determining the requisite median time to reach an O2 concentration of <30% in the breathing circuit was the primary aim of the study. RESULTS The median times (1st-99th percent confidence interval) required to achieve inspiratory and expiratory oxygen concentrations of <30% with the extended circuit configuration when starting at 60% for 5 L FGFs were 35 (32-36) and 104 (88-122) seconds, respectively. With 2 L FGF, these median times increased to 303 (291-313) and 255 (232-278) seconds, respectively. A shortened circuit configuration (P = 0.006) and higher FGF flow rate (P < 0.0001) were noted to be factors decreasing the median time required to achieve an oxygen concentration of <30%. CONCLUSIONS Both inspired and expired circuit oxygen concentration may take minutes to decrease to <30% depending on circuit length, FGF rate, and starting circuit oxygen concentration. During the reduction in FIO2, the expiratory oxygen concentration may be >30% for a considerable time after the FIO2 is in a \\"safe\\" range. An increased expired oxygen concentration should also be considered an airway fire risk, and patient care protocols may need to be modified based on future studies.","output":"Prevention of airway fires: do not overlook the expired oxygen concentration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the role that restaurant practices play on tourists choices and specifically on city branding It examines whether sustainability practices are considered by customers to be part of what they perceive as overall quality, leading to customer satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat business It examines whether sustainability practices become part of the customer experience and perceived quality, and if they could work as another key predictor of customer dining satisfaction effecting their decisions to revisit a destination Several studies focused on sustainability practices from the restaurant owners perspective, but there is no study investigating the viewpoint of international tourists and consumers of common restaurants, and the influence of green practices on visiting a major European capital during the COVID19 pandemic Our research was conducted using a sample of 204 international consumers after completing meals at local restaurants in Athens This study offers insights on the role that sustainable and green practices of restaurants play in customer satisfaction as it relates to a potential re-visit of a destination;however, it still shows a path worth investigating Restaurateurs, tourism experts (DMO), and local government should monitor what influences the satisfaction of potential global tourists while taking their sensitivity on sustainability issues into account when shaping their branding strategy during the COVID-19 era ? 2021 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"The role of sustainable restaurant practices in city branding: The case of athens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical challenges exist in the management of hospitalized patients returning to the UK with potential Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, particularly with its clinical overlap with influenza, as demonstrated in this case-series and cost-analysis review of returning Hajj pilgrims.

We observed that COVID-19 and HLH share immunological pathways (cytokine/chemokine signaling and neutrophil-mediated immune responses), including gene signatures that stratify COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and COVID-19_nonICU patients. Of note, among the common differentially expressed genes (DEG), there is a cluster of neutrophil-associated genes that reflects a generalized hyperinflammatory state since it is also dysregulated in patients with KD and bacterial pneumonia. These genes are dysregulated at the protein level across several COVID-19 studies and form an interconnected network with differentially expressed plasma proteins that point to neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. scRNAseq analysis indicated that these genes are specifically upregulated across different leukocyte populations, including lymphocyte subsets and immature neutrophils.

Here, using bleomycin-induced fibrosis model combined with myeloid-specific RBP-J disruption (RBP-JcKO ) mouse, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in macrophages during PF. Compared with the control, RBP-JcKO mice exhibited alleviated lung fibrosis as manifested by reduced collagen deposition and inflammation, and decreased TGF-? production. FACS analysis suggested that decreased Ly6clo MHCIIhi AMs might make the major contribution to attenuated fibrogenesis in RBP-JcKO mice, probably by reduced inflammatory factor release and enhanced matrix metalloproteinases expression. Using clodronate-mediated macrophage depletion in RBP-JckO mice, we demonstrated that embryonic-derived AMs play negligible role in lung fibrosis, which was further supported by adoptive transfer experiments. Moreover, on CCR2 knockout background, the effect of RBP-J deficiency on fibrogenesis was not elicited, suggesting that Notch regulated monocyte-derived AMs. Co-culture experiment showed that monocyte-derived AMs from RBP-JcKO mice exhibit reduced myofibroblast activation due to decreased TGF-? secretion. In conclusion, monocyte-derived Ly6clo MHCIIhi AMs, which are regulated by RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling, play an essential role in lung fibrosis.","output":"Myeloid-specific blockade of Notch signaling alleviates murine pulmonary fibrosis through regulating monocyte-derived Ly6clo MHCIIhi alveolar macrophages recruitment and TGF-? secretion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease caused by a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with many neurological symptoms.

MAM analysis allows multiple relative quantifications of several structural attributes of therapeutic mAbs; however, some issues remain to be addressed in its procedures especially for sample preparation. The goal of this study was to optimize the sample preparation method for MAM analysis of mAbs. Using a model mAb, we compared five sample preparation methods based on sequence coverage, peptide redundancy, missed cleavage and chemical deamidation. It was found that low pH buffer and short digestion time reduced artificial deamidation. The desalting process after carboxymethylation was essential to obtaining high sequence coverage by a short digestion time. The generation of missed cleavage peptides was also improved by using a trypsin/lysyl endopeptidase (Lys-C) mixture. Next, we evaluated the usefulness of our method as a part of MAM analysis. Finally, 17 glycopeptides, 2 deamidated peptides and N- and C-terminal peptides of the heavy chain were successfully monitored with acceptable mass accuracy and coef?cient of variation (CV, %) of the relative peak area. On the other hand, 4 oxidated peptides indicated the unavoidable slightly higher inter-assay CV (%) of the peak area ratio due to the instability in the MS sample solution. Collectively, we demonstrated that our method was applicable as an easy and reliable sample preparation method for MAM analysis, and the variation in the relative peak area could be influenced by the modification type rather than by the amount of each peptide.","output":"Establishment of a highly precise multi-attribute method for the characterization and quality control of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a serious inflammatory response to infection with a high death rate. Timely and effective treatment may improve sepsis outcomes resulting in mandatory sepsis care protocol adherence reporting. How the impact of patient-to-nurse staffing compares to sepsis protocol compliance and patient outcomes is not well understood. This study aimed to determine the association between hospital sepsis protocol compliance, patient-to-nurse staffing ratios and patient outcomes. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study examining hospital nurse staffing, sepsis protocol compliance and sepsis patient outcomes, using linked data from nurse (2015C2016, 2020) and hospital (2017) surveys, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Compare (2017) and corresponding MedPAR patient claims. SETTING: 537 hospitals across six US states (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois and New Jersey). PARTICIPANTS: 252 699 Medicare inpatients with sepsis present on admission. MEASURES: The explanatory variables are nurse staffing and SEP-1 compliance. Outcomes are mortality (within 30 and 60 days of index admission), readmissions (within 7, 30, and 60 days of discharge), admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and lengths of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Sepsis protocol compliance and nurse staffing vary widely across hospitals. Each additional patient per nurse was associated with increased odds of 30-day and 60-day mortality (9% (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13) and 10% (1.10, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.14)), 7-day, 30-day and 60-day readmission (8% (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.11, p<0.001), 7% (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.10, p<0.001), 7% (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.10, p<0.001)), ICU admission (12% (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.22, p=0.007)) and increased relative risk of longer LOS (10% (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.12, p<0.001)). Each 10% increase in sepsis protocol compliance was associated with shorter LOS (2% ([OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99, p<0.001)) only.

The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on 11(th) March 2020 due to the sustained risk of further global spread of COVID-19. The high healthcare burden associated with COVID-19 has increased nurses trauma and workload, thereby exacerbating pressure on an already strained workforce and causing additional psychological distress for staff. OBJECTIVES: The Impact of COVID-19 on Nurses (ICON) interview study examined the impacts of the pandemic on frontline nursing staff's psychosocial and emotional wellbeing. DESIGN: Longitudinal qualitative interview study. SETTINGS: Nurses who had completed time 1 and 2 of the ICON survey were sampled to include a range of UK work settings including acute, primary and community care and care homes. Interviewees were purposively sampled for maximum variation to cover a broad range of personal and professional factors, and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, including redeployment. METHODS: Nurses participated in qualitative in-depth narrative interviews after the first wave of COVID-19 in July 2020 (n=27) and again at the beginning of the second wave in December 2020 (n=25) via video and audio platform software. Rigorous qualitative narrative analysis was undertaken both cross-sectionally (within wave) and longitudinally (cross wave) to explore issues of consistency and change. RESULTS: The terms moral distress, compassion fatigue, burnout and PTSD describe the emotional states reported by the majority of interviewees leading many to consider leaving the profession. Causes of this identified included care delivery challenges; insufficient staff and training; PPE challenges and frustrations. Four themes were identified: (1) Deathscapes and impoverished care (2) Systemic challenges and self-preservation (3) Emotional exhaustion and (4) (Un)helpful support. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses have been deeply affected by what they have experienced and are forever altered with the impacts of COVID-19 persisting and deeply felt. There is an urgent need to tackle stigma to create a psychologically safe working environment and for a national COVID-19 nursing workforce recovery strategy to help restore nurse's well-being and demonstrate a valuing of the nursing workforce and therefore support retention.","output":"You can't walk through water without getting wet UK nurses distress and psychological health needs during the Covid-19 pandemic: A longitudinal interview study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an urgent global public health emergency and warrants investigating molecular and structural studies addressing the dynamics of viral proteins involved in host cell adhesion.

The independent variable of interest in this study was the year, divided into binary categories, 2019 and 2020. The dependent variable was depression, measured by the PHQ-9 scale. This dependent variable was also binary, dividing those who are considered depressed or not by a cut-off score of 10. A logistic regression model was employed to examine the association. Our results reveal that compared to participants in 2019, patients from the study sample of 2020 were marginally more likely to be depressed, especially female patients (male OR: 1.092, 95% CI [0.998 to 1.195], female OR: 1.066, 95% CI [1.002 to 1.134]).

Surprisingly, emergency activity also registered a reduction in frequency. METHODS: This multicentre retrospective study aims to investigate eventual changes in ENT surgical emergencies in a highly populated area of southern Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data concerning the period between the February 1 and the May 31, 2020 were collected from the main three hospitals in the district and compared with the same period of 2019. RESULTS: A substantial reduction was found in the number of ENT emergency interventions in 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, particularly in the main lockdown phase and in the tertiary referral centre. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in the absolute number of emergency ENT interventions can be only partially explained by social distancing and home confinement. We have reason to believe that some of these patients may have not sought medical support due to fear of nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infection.

Samples in which no virus was detected using a 16 viral respiratory pathogen real-time PCR panel were barcoded and pyrosequenced using the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium chemistry. The sequences were analysed using the VirusHunter bioinformatic pipeline. Sanger sequencing was used to complete the detected Parainfluenza 4 coding region. RESULTS: A variant Parainfluenza 4 subtype b strain (QLD-01) was discovered in an otherwise healthy adult who presented with influenza like illness. Strain QLD-01 shared genomic similarities with both a and b subtypes. The extent of divergence of this genome from the 5 available whole Parainfluenza 4 genomes impacted the predicted binding efficiencies of the majority of published Parainfluenza 4 PCR assays.

METHODS: Between February 2019 and March 2020, 159 participants (122 female, 75% of Mexican heritage, 31% with non-insulin treated T2D, age 52.5 (13.2) years) were recruited using community outreach materials in English and Spanish, and received prescriptions for 21 servings/week of fresh vegetable for 10 weeks. Pre-post comparisons were made of weight; waist circumference; blood pressure; Hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c), a measure of long-term blood glucose control); self-reported sleep, mood and pain; vegetable, tortilla and soda consumption. After obtaining devices for this study, 66 of 72 participants asked, agreed to wear blinded continuous glucose monitors (CGM). RESULTS: Paired data were available for 131 participants. Over 3 months, waist circumference fell (?0.77 (95% CI ?1.42 to 0.12) cm, p=0.022), as did systolic blood pressure (SBP) (?2.42 (95% CI ?4.56 to 0.28) mm Hg, p=0.037), which was greater among individuals with baseline SBP >130 mm Hg (?7.5 (95% CI ?12.4 to 2.6) mm Hg, p=0.005).

This stemmed initially from the discovery that antigen presenting cells such as macrophages could actively metabolise precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Parallel observation that activated cells from the immune system expressed the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) for 1,25D suggested a potential role for vitamin D as a localised endogenous modulator of immune function. Subsequent studies have expanded our understanding of how vitamin D exerts effects on both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. At an innate level, intracrine synthesis of 1,25D by macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) stimulates expression of antimicrobial proteins such as cathelicidin, as well as lowering intracellular iron concentrations via suppression of hepcidin. By potently enhancing autophagy, 1,25D may also play an important role in combatting intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis and viral infections. Local synthesis of 1,25D by macrophages and DC also appears to play a pivotal role in mediating T cell responses to vitamin D, leading to suppression of inflammatory T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, and concomitant induction of immunotolerogenic T regulatory (Treg) responses. The aim of this review is to provide an update on our current understanding of these prominent immune actions of vitamin D, as well as highlighting new, less well-recognised immune effects of vitamin D.

We review our experience with balloon-augmented Onyx embolization of cerebral AVMs using a dual-lumen balloon catheter technique designed to minimize these challenges. METHODS Retrospectively acquired data for all balloon-augmented cerebral AVM embolizations performed between 2011 and 2014 were obtained from four tertiary care centers. For each procedure, at least one Scepter C balloon catheter was advanced into the AVM arterial pedicle of interest and Onyx embolization was performed through the inner lumen after balloon inflation via the outer lumen. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent embolization with the balloon-augmented technique over 24 discreet treatment episodes. There were 37 total arterial pedicles embolized with the balloon-augmented technique, a mean of 1.9 per patient (range 1-5). The treated AVMs were heterogeneous in their location and size (mean 3.31.6 cm). Mean fluoroscopy time for each procedure was 4826 min (28 min per embolized pedicle). Two Scepter C balloon catheter-related complications (8.3% of embolization sessions, 5.4% of pedicles embolized) were observed: an intraprocedural rupture of a feeding pedicle and fracture and retention of a catheter fragment. CONCLUSIONS This multicenter experience represents the largest reported series of balloon-augmented Onyx embolization of cerebral AVMs. The technique appears safe and effective in the treatment of AVMs, allowing more efficient and controlled injection of Onyx with a decreased risk of reflux and decreased fluoroscopy times.","output":"Balloon-augmented Onyx embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations using a dual-lumen balloon: a multicenter experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schools were the first public institutions in South Africa to be closed when the country recorded its initial cases of Covid-19.

The known decomposition methods in discrete optimization are founded on the difficulties in deriving analytical properties.

Continuous optimization is used to generate a schedule from the assignments found in the discrete optimization models at each time point by extremizing the Hamiltonian function at this time point subject to scheduling objective(s). In addition, the execution of the operations in time can be accurately modeled in continuous time as a continuous state variable; the machine availability and capacity disturbances at the machines are also considered.

Previous studies on its counterparts prove a complex and concomitant interaction between coronaviruses and autophagy. The precise manipulation of this pathway allows these viruses to exploit the autophagy molecular machinery while avoiding its protective apoptotic drift and cellular innate immune responses. In turn, the maneuverability margins of such hijacking appear to be so narrow that the modulation of the autophagy, regardless of whether using inducers or inhibitors (many of which are FDA-approved for the treatment of other diseases), is usually detrimental to viral replication, including SARS-CoV-2. Recent discoveries indicate that these interactions stretch into the still poorly explored noncanonical autophagy pathway, which might play a substantial role in coronavirus replication. Still, some potential therapeutic targets within this pathway, such as RAB9 and its interacting proteins, look promising considering current knowledge. Thus, the combinatory treatment of COVID-19 with drugs affecting both canonical and noncanonical autophagy pathways may be a turning point in the fight against this and other viral infections, which may also imply beneficial prospects of long-term protection.","output":"Canonical and Noncanonical Autophagy as Potential Targets for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to objectify and compare persisting self\\\\reported symptoms in initially hospitalized and non\\\\hospitalized patients after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) by applying clinical standardized measures. METHODS: We conducted a cross\\\\sectional study of adult patients with confirmed SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection including medical history, neurological examination, blood markers, neuropsychological testing, patient\\\\reported outcome measures (PROMs), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: Fifty patients with persisting symptoms for at least 4 weeks were included and classified by initial hospitalization status. Median time from SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 detection to investigation was 29.3 weeks (range 3.3C57.9). Although individual cognitive performance was generally within the normative range in both groups, mostly mild deficits were found in attention, executive functions, and memory. Hospitalized patients performed worse in global cognition, logical reasoning, and processes of verbal memory. In both groups, fatigue severity was associated with reduced performance in attention and psychomotor speed tasks (r (s) = ?0.40, p < 0.05) and reduced quality of life (EQ5D, r (s) = 0.57, p < 0.001) and with more persisting symptoms (median 3 vs. 6, p < 0.01). PROMs identified fatigue, reduced sleep quality, and increased anxiety and depression in both groups but more pronounced in non\\\\hospitalized patients.

Increased risk perception of contracting the virus has been associated with adverse psychological outcomes and reduced life satisfaction. However, susceptibility to psychological distress is influenced by personality-related characteristics. This study focuses on fortitude as a potential protective factor. The aim of this study is to investigate the parallel and serial mediating roles of fortitude, loneliness, and depression in the relationship between risk perception and life satisfaction. The participants were young adults (N?=?337) who have completed five self-report questionnaires: University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale, Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Fortitude Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and COVID-19 Risk Perception Scale. Descriptive statistics were generated, and structural equation modelling was used to examine the parallel and serial mediating roles of loneliness, depression, and fortitude. Positive associations were found between risk perception and loneliness and depression, and fortitude was found to mediate the relationship between risk perception and life satisfaction, between loneliness and life satisfaction, and between depression and life satisfaction. The overall serial mediation was also found to be significant, thereby supporting the hypothesis that those who perceive themselves to be at a risk of contracting COVID-19 have higher loneliness scores, which in turn is associated with higher depression scores. These findings confirm that fortitude is a salient protective factor and suggest that improving the perception of the ability to manage the risk of infection can enhance psychological wellbeing.","output":"The role of fortitude, loneliness, and depression in the association between risk perception of contracting COVID-19 and life satisfaction: serial mediation analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the proposed pathophysiologic mechanism of neurologic injury by SARS CoV-2, the frequency of stroke and henceforth the related hospital admissions were expected to rise. This paper investigated this presumption by comparing the frequency of admissions of stroke cases in Bangladesh before and during the pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of stroke admissions in a 100-bed stroke unit at the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital (NINS&H) which is considerably a large stroke unit. All the admitted cases from 1 January to 30 June 2020 were considered. Poisson regression models were used to determine whether statistically significant changes in admission rates can be found before and after 25 March since when there is a surge in COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: A total of 1394 stroke patients took admission in the stroke unit during the study period. Half of the patients were older than 60 years, whereas only 2.6% were 30 years old or younger. The male to female ratio is 1.06:1. From January to March 2020, the mean rate of admission was 302.3 cases per month, which dropped to 162.3 cases per month from April to June, with an overall reduction of 46.3% in acute stroke admission per month. In those two periods, reductions in average admission per month for ischemic stroke (IST), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and venous stroke (VS) were 45.5%, 37.2%, 71.4% and 39.0%, respectively. Based on weekly data, results of Poisson regressions confirm that the average number of admissions per week dropped significantly during the last three months of the sample period. Further, in the first three months, a total of 22 cases of hyperacute stroke management were done, whereas, in the last three months, there was an 86.4% reduction in the number of hyperacute stroke patients getting reperfusion treatment. Only 38 patients (2.7%) were later found to be RT-PCR SARS Cov-2 positive based on nasal swab testing. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a more than fifty percent reduction in acute stroke admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether the reduction is related to the fear of getting infected by COVID-19 from hospitalization or the overall restriction on public movement or stay-home measures remains unknown.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on hospital admission of acute stroke patients in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract COVID-19 disease is a pandemic disease caused by a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the coronavirus family known as 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2).

METHODS: From 12 December 2020 to 6 January 2021, all IPs and CPs registered by Colognes public health department up to the survey period were surveyed online.

In addition to demographic data, information regarding COVID-19-specific and persistent symptoms or conditions and their association with the amount and type of exercise and screen time before and during the quarantine were collected. RESULTS: Before quarantine, 66.9% of IPs and 69% of CPs were physically active; during quarantine, this decreased by 49.4% in IPs depending on the course of the disease and by 30.6% in CPs. Physically active IPs and CPs felt less exhausted and more fit during their quarantine periods than those who were inactive, with active IPs significantly less likely to report prolonged physical and psychological symptoms than their more sedentary counterparts. CONCLUSION: Given the acute and long-term positive effects of exercise on quarantined individuals, corresponding recommendations should be communicated to those affected, especially CPs.

There is some previous evidence that weather may influence the incidence of COVID-19 infection.

Methods: We retrieved daily counts of COVID-19 in Finland from Jan 1 to May 31, 2020, nationwide and separately for all 21 hospital districts across the country. The meteorological and air quality data were from the monitoring stations nearest to the central district hospital. A quasi-Poisson generalized additional model (GAM) was fitted to estimate the associations between district-specific meteorological factors and the daily counts of COVID-19 during the study period. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results. Results: The incidence rate of COVID-19 gradually increased until a peak around April 6 and then decreased. There were no associations between daily temperature and incidence rate of COVID-19. Daily average RH was negatively associated with daily incidence rate of COVID-19 in two hospital districts located inland. No such association was found nationwide. Conclusions: Weather conditions, such as air temperature and relative humidity, were not related to the COVID-19 incidence during the first wave in the arctic and subarctic winter and spring.

METHODS: We compared the number of JIA reactivations in the period March-July 2020 to the same months of 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: A total of 10 JIA reactivations have been documented on 58 patients (17%) visited in the period March-July 2018; 10 reactivations on 61 patients (16%) in the period March-July 2019; and 19 reactivations on 39 patients (49%) in the period March-July 2020, with a statistically significant increase (p <0.001). The other 19 patients who should have been visited during the same period, contacted by phone, indicated remission. Therefore, we hypothesize that the effective number of reactivations in the period March-July 2020 would be 19/58 patients (33%) which remains significantly greater than in the previous 2 years (p < 0.05). Among the 19 JIA patients reactivated in 2020, 3 spontaneously stopped the basic treatment due to parents' choice for fear of serious complications in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 4 had poor compliance with underlying treatment. In addition, 14/19 reactivated JIA patients did not perform the scheduled check according to the follow-up. In fact, the mean time interval between two follow-up visits was significantly greater in 2020 (157  53 days, p < 0.0001) vs 2018 (108  68 days) and 2019 (107  40 days). CONCLUSIONS: We have found a significant increase in JIA reactivations in the period March-July 2020 compared to the same interval of 2018 and 2019. This increase may have been caused by poor compliance with background treatment, as documented in 7/19 JIA patients reactivated, and by a greater interval in follow-up checks. Therefore, it is necessary, in occasion of a new pandemic and lockdown, to implement greater controls using more appropriate telemedicine tools. Key Points a? COVID-19 pandemic lockdown had a negative effect on the follow-up of JIA patients. a? A significant increase in JIA reactivations was found during the lockdown. a?

This study investigated the emergence of new psychiatric symptoms and the worsening of pre-existing mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, identified factors associated with psychological worsening, and assessed changes in mental health service use. METHODS: An online survey was circulated between April 3 and June 23, 2020. Respondents were asked to complete mental health questionnaires based on 2 time referents: currently (i.e., during the outbreak) and in the month preceding the outbreak. A total of 4,294 Canadians between 16 and 99 years of age were subdivided based on the presence of self-reported psychiatric diagnoses. RESULTS: The proportion of respondents without prior psychiatric history who screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder and depression increased by 12% and 29%, respectively, during the outbreak. Occurrences of clinically important worsening in anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation symptoms relative to pre-outbreak estimates were significantly higher in those with psychiatric diagnoses. Furthermore, 15% to 19% of respondents reported increased alcohol or cannabis use. Worse psychological changes relative to pre-outbreak estimate were associated with female sex, younger age, lower income, poorer coping skills, multiple psychiatric comorbidities, previous trauma exposure, deteriorating physical health, poorer family relationships, and lower exercising. Reductions in mental health care were associated with increased suicidal ideation.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with high infection rates reported from HCWs in hard-hit regions(2,3), raising concerns about nosocomial infections and the effectiveness of personal protective equipment in protecting HCWs. Asymptomatic infection is estimated 17.9% to 33.3%(4) and is a common source of transmission(5). We designed a HCW testing program to address patient and employee concerns about exposures in the healthcare setting at our 808-bed health system. During the time of employee testing, the mean (range) number of inpatients with a diagnosis of COVID was 30 (22C38) of a mean (range) daily census of 560 (492C602) (approximately 5.4%). METHODS: This opt-in program offered SARS-CoV-2 testing of asymptomatic HCWs with paired nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swab for PCR (Roche) and serum IgG antibody testing (Diazyme). While initially designed as a pilot project in the Emergency Departments and COVID-19 units, it was quickly expanded to a health system-wide initiative. RESULTS: From April 22 to June 2, PCR testing was performed on 5826 asymptomatic HCWs with four PCR tests resulting positive (0.09%). Of 5589 serologic tests (anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG) performed, 57 tested positive (1.02 %). All HCW with a positive IgG had a concurrent negative PCR. CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional evaluation, the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in asymptomatic HCWs at UC San Diego was less than 1%, supporting modeling estimations at the San Diego County level of very low levels of community exposure at the time of this testing. Further analyses of incidence rates and potential risk factors such as employee roles within the healthcare system, community and healthcare exposures, and home zip code are underway. Asymptomatic HCW testing is a strategy that can provide the perception of additional safety to both the workforce and patients as the health system reopens, while potentially reduce transmission from asymptomatic persons through active case finding and isolation.

We determined trends over time in incidence of the following outcomes that occurred within 30 days of testing positive: hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and death. RESULTS: Between February and July 2020, there were marked downward trends in the 30-day incidence of hospitalization (44.2% to 15.8%), ICU admission (20.3% to 5.3%), mechanical ventilation (12.7% to 2.2%), and death (12.5% to 4.4%), which subsequently plateaued between July and September 2020. These trends persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, documented symptoms and laboratory tests, including among subgroups of patients hospitalized, admitted to the ICU or treated with mechanical ventilation.

CASE REPORT: We describe a case of 56-year-old postmenopausal, obese woman with hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with fluctuating mental status and left-side weakness for 5 days. She received her first and second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) at 12 and 8 weeks, respectively, prior to presentation. She was found to have multiple hemorrhages and infarcts on a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head. She was intubated in the ED for airway protection and mechanically ventilated. Magnetic resonance angiogram and venogram showed multiple infarcts in right frontal, parietal, and left parietal lobes, along with occlusion of left-side transverse sinus, sagittal sinuses, and left internal jugular vein, suggesting cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Despite anticoagulation, her clinical condition continued to worsen, and she was referred for emergent endovascular thrombectomy.

Methods: We developed a simple likelihood-based framework to estimate the instantaneous asymptomatic proportion of infectious diseases. Taking the COVID-19 epidemics in Hong Kong as a case study, we applied the estimation framework to estimate the reported asymptomatic proportion (rAP) using the publicly available surveillance data. We divided the time series of daily cases into four stages of epidemics in Hong Kong by examining the persistency of the epidemic and compared the rAPs of imported cases and local cases at different stages. Results: As of July 31, 2020, there were two intermittent epidemics in Hong Kong. The first one was dominated by imported cases, accounting for 63.2% of the total cases, and the second one was dominated by local cases, accounting for 86.5% of the total cases. The rAP was estimated at 23.1% (95% CI: 10.8C39.7%) from January 23 to July 31, and the rAPs were estimated at 22.6% (95% CI: 11.1C38.9%) among local cases and 38.7% (95% CI: 9.0C72.0%) among imported cases. Our results showed that the rAPs of local cases were not significantly different between the two epidemics, but increased gradually during the first epidemic period. In contrast, the rAPs of imported cases in the latter epidemic period were significantly higher than that in the previous epidemic period. Conclusion: Hong Kong has a high rAP of imported COVID-19 cases and should continue to strengthen the detection and isolation of imported individuals to prevent the resurgence of the disease.","output":"Estimating the Instantaneous Asymptomatic Proportion With a Simple Approach: Exemplified With the Publicly Available COVID-19 Surveillance Data in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the relationship between the Japanese Yen and the countrys stock returns Using several variants of econometric models and empirical specifications, we unravel that the depreciation of the Yen vis--vis the US dollar led to gains in Japanese stock returns A one standard deviation depreciation of the Yen during the COVID-19 period (equivalent to 0 588%) improved stock market returns by 71% of average returns We see that this relationship was stronger over the COVID-19 period (January 2020 to August 2020) compared to the pre-crisis period","output":"Japanese currency and stock marketWhat happened during the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To identify disparities in the use of telemedicine during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

We identified zip code-level socioeconomic characteristics, which were drawn from the 2019 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The completion of a synchronous video encounter, the completion of a telephone (audio-only) encounter in the absence of any video encounters, or the completion of in-person encounters only. RESULTS: During the study period, 8116 total clinical encounters were completed for 5023 unique patients. Of these patients, 446 (8.9%) participated in a video encounter, 642 (12.8%) completed a telephone encounter, and 3935 (78.3%) attended clinical appointments in person only. In adjusted analysis, patients who were Black (odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52C0.80; P < 0.001) or Hispanic/Latino (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49C0.85; P = 0.002) were significantly less likely to complete a video or telephone appointment. Older patients (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98C0.99; P < 0.001), patients whose primary language was not English (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28C0.82; P = 0.01), Black patients (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32C0.62; P < 0.001), and Hispanic/Latino patients (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37C0.83; P = 0.005) were significantly less likely to complete a video encounter. Finally, among patients completing any type of telemedicine encounter, older age, (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01C1.03; P < 0.001), Medicare insurance (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11C2.17; P = 0.01), and Black race (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.33C2.94; P < 0.001) were associated with using only phone visits. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic/racial minorities, older patients, and nonCEnglish-speaking individuals were significantly less likely to complete a video telehealth encounter. With the expansion of telemedicine and the need to reduce the disparate impact of COVID-19 on minorities, it will be increasingly important to identify barriers to telehealth use and opportunities to improve access.","output":"Socioeconomic and Demographic Disparities in the Use of Telemedicine for Ophthalmic Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the early months of 2020, hospital processes were changed in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic We present one community hospital's experience in conducting a series of interdisciplinary learning reviews (ILRs) on non-COVID-19 patient's journeys during the early months of the pandemic An ILR is a method of reviewing medical records using a system lens to identify system-level opportunities for improvement Using the ILR method, we identified several opportunities for improvement in caring for our patients","output":"Qualitative Interdisciplinary Learning Reviews of Non-COVID-19 Patients' Journeys During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Taiwan's agri-food market has been transforming rapidly over the past few years and is struggling with significant food issues and the impact of COVID-19. These include globalization, trade liberalization, population growth, urbanization, policy changes, food consumption patterns and shifts in dietary patterns. Therefore, food security, livelihoods and productive activities that revitalize rural food production and sustained economic growth need to make important contributions to sustainable rural food development. This study adopts the research method of the Analytic Hierarchy Process, employs agricultural experts as the main research object, focuses on the local cuisine in rural Taiwan, and constructs an index model for the inheritance and sustainable innovation and development of local cuisine culture through the opinions of agricultural experts. Accordingly, this study has two objectives. First, we construct indicators of how farmers use local food culture inheritance and sustainable innovation development. Second, we measure the relative weighting of these indicators by agricultural experts in Taiwan. The research results show that a total of 23 indicators in 5 dimensions of the inheritance and sustainable innovation and development of rural local food culture in Taiwan are obtained, of which education and training are the primary indicators of the inheritance and sustainable innovation and development of farmers' local food culture. The biggest contribution of this study is that, in response to the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic and the changes in the inheritance and sustainable development of rural food in Taiwan, this research constructs an indicator model for the inheritance and sustainable development of rural local food culture. It can be used as an important reference for the inheritance and sustainable innovation and development of rural local food culture in Taiwan.","output":"The Application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process Approach to the Inheritance of Local Delicious Food Culture and Development of Sustainable Innovations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread use of face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic has created communication challenges for many individuals, particularly for those who are deaf or hard of hearing and for those who must speak through masks in suboptimal conditions.

Currently, however, a systematic understanding lacks of how motor skills, in conjunction with other school readiness skills, affect a childs school outcomes. Additionally, little is known about longitudinal associations of school readiness with non-academic (e.g., socioemotional) school outcomes. Therefore, we examined the school readiness skills of a sample of Dutch children (N = 91) with a mean age of 3 years and 4 months (46% girls). We used a multi-informant test battery to assess childrens school readiness in terms of executive functions (EFs), language and emergent literacy, motor skills, and socioemotional behavior. During the spring term of a childs first grade year, we collected academic and non-academic (i.e., EFs, motor skills, socioemotional- and classroom behavior, and creative thinking) school outcomes. A latent profile analysis revealed four distinct profiles. Children in the Parent Positive (29%) profile were rated positively by their parents, and performed variably on motor and language/emergent literacy skills tests. The second profileCMultiple Strengths (13%)Cconsisted of children showing strengths in multiple domains, especially with respect to motor skills. Children from the third profileCAverage Performers (50%)Cdid not show any distinct strengths or weaknesses, rather displayed school readiness skill levels close to, or just below the sample mean. Finally, the Parental Concern (8%) profile was characterized by high levels of parental concerns, while displaying slightly above average performance on specific motor and language skills. Motor skills clearly distinguished between profiles, next to parent-rated EFs and socioemotional behavior, and to a lesser extent emergent literacy skills. School readiness profiles were found to differ in mean scores on first grade academic achievement, parent- and teacher-rated EFs, motor skills, parent-rated socioemotional functioning, and pre-requisite learning skills. The pattern of mean differences was complex, suggesting that profiles could not be ranked from low to high in terms of school outcomes. Longitudinal studies are needed to disentangle the interaction between emerging school readiness of the child and the surrounding context.","output":"Emerging School Readiness Profiles: Motor Skills Matter for Cognitive- and Non-cognitive First Grade School Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a gradual shift in the delivery of physiology laboratory classes over the last 30 years. For many, wet-lab demonstrations using animal tissues have been reduced or replaced with student-led investigations where students are both subjects and researchers. Despite these changes, expectations remain that physiology courses should include a practical component to encourage deeper and higher-order learning. Wet-lab tissue experiments and student-based group research formats can be expensive to run, associated with various ethical constraints, and, as discovered in these times of COVID-19, difficult to operate while adhering to physical distancing. We address the proposition that online and/or remote delivery of laboratory classes using digital technologies may provide a solution to both financial and ethical constraints of on-campus laboratory classes. Our discussions, as an international group of 10 physiologists from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, revealed that although some of the financial and ethical constraints of using animal tissues and student-led investigations were addressed by the introduction of online alternatives, the construction and maintenance of online delivery modes could also be expensive and ethical issues, not previously considered, included digital equity and student data security. There was also a collective perception that if face-to-face laboratory classes were changed to an entirely virtual mode there was a risk that some intended learning outcomes would not be met. It was concluded that the \\"ideal\\" approach is likely a hybrid model whereby student attendance in face-to-face, on-campus classes is supported with interactive digital content either developed in house or obtained through third-party providers.","output":"Virtual delivery: a panacea for the financial and ethical challenges associated with physiology laboratory classes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the globe In light of most COVI","output":"Clinical Findings of 100 Mild Cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan: A Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With each novel infectious disease outbreak, there is scholarly attention to healthcare providers' obligation to assume personal risk while they care for infected patients.

An enormous number of investigations point to the vital importance of various micronutrients in the interactions between the host immune system and viruses, including COVID-19. There are complex and multifaceted links among micronutrient status, the host immune response, and the virulence of pathogenic viruses. Micronutrients play a critical role in the coordinated recruitment of innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections, particularly in the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory host responses. Furthermore, inadequate amounts of micronutrients not only weaken the immune system in combating viral infections, but also contribute to the emergence of more virulent strains via alterations of the genetic makeup of the viral genome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the evidence that suggests the contribution of micronutrients in the spread as well as the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Both the presence of micronutrient deficiencies among infected individuals and the effect of micronutrient supplementation on the immune responses and overall outcome of the disease could be of great interest when weighing the use of micronutrients in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection.

These three factors increase the expression of angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key receptor involved in the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)the etiological agent of COVID-19into respiratory tract epithelial cells. Patients with severe COVID-19 are managed with oxygen support, as are at-risk individuals with chronic lung disease. To date, no study has examined whether an increased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) may affect the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors and co-receptors, including ACE2 and the transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS1, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS11D. To address this, steady-state mRNA levels for genes encoding these SARS-CoV-2 receptors were assessed in the lungs of mouse pups chronically exposed to elevated FiO(2), and in the lungs of preterm-born human infants chronically managed with an elevated FiO(2). These two scenarios served as models of chronic elevated FiO(2) exposure. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression was assessed in primary human nasal, tracheal, esophageal, bronchial, and alveolar epithelial cells, as well as primary mouse alveolar type II cells exposed to elevated oxygen concentrations. While gene expression of ACE2 was unaffected, gene and protein expression of TMPRSS11D was consistently upregulated by exposure to an elevated FiO(2). These data highlight the need for further studies that examine the relative contribution of the various viral co-receptors on the infection cycle, and point to oxygen supplementation as a potential risk factor for COVID-19.","output":"Elevated FiO(2) increases SARS-CoV-2 co-receptor expression in respiratory tract epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to examine how the emotion regulation strategy, cognitive reappraisal, affects the association between perceived stress and anxiety symptoms in COVID-19 isolated people.

We used SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-PCR in respiratory samples to confirm the cases. RESULTS: Of 70 patient enrolled, the mean age was 57.0 years and 29 patients (41%) were men. Median Charlson comorbidity index was 1.70(2.5). Twenty-seven (39%) patients had pneumonia. Fatigue (93% [65]), cough (80% [55]) and fever (77% [54]) were the three main symptoms. Neurologic symptoms were present in more than half of the patients: anosmia (53% [37]) and dysgeusia (48% [34]). The mean duration of anosmia was 7.4 (5, [1C21]) days, 51% (36/70) recovered before 28 days of evolution. Only one patient with anosmia had not recovered at the end of the follow-up. Patients with anosmia had less often a pneumonia (10/37 vs 17/33, p = 0.036), were less often hospitalized (13/37 vs 20/33, p = 0.033) and needed less often oxygen therapy (6/37 vs 17/33, p = 0.002) than patients without anosmia.

Ignoring the ethical impacts of information and communication technology health service delivery creates an unintended risk for patients and can lead to reduced effectiveness, noncompliance, and harm, undermining the best intentions of governments and clinicians. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore how ethical considerations or impacts may be different, greater, or more variable in information and communication technology methods versus face-to-face health care delivery models, and how they may be applied in practice. METHODS: We undertook a systemic literature review to provide a critical overview of existing research into the incorporation of ethical principles into telehealth practice. Six databases were searched between March 2016 to May 2016 and again in December 2020 to provide the benefit of currency. A combination of broad terms (\\"ethics,\\" \\"ethical,\\" \\"health,\\" and \\"care\\") with the restrictive terms of \\"telehealth\\" and \\"telemedicine\\" was used in keyword searches. Thematic analysis and synthesis of each paper was conducted, aligned to the framework developed by Beauchamp and Childress. RESULTS: From the 49 papers reviewed, authors identified or discussed the following ethical principles in relation to telehealth practice: autonomy (69% of authors, 34/49), professional-patient relationship (53% of authors, 26/49), nonmaleficence (41% of authors, 20/49), beneficence (39%, of authors, 19/49), and justice (39% of authors, 19/49). CONCLUSIONS: Although a small number of studies identified ethical issues associated with telehealth practice and discussed their potential impact on service quality and effectiveness, there is limited research on how ethical principles are incorporated into clinical practice. Several studies proposed frameworks, codes of conduct, or guidelines, but there was little discussion or evidence of how these recommendations are being used to improve ethical telehealth practice.","output":"The Value of Applying Ethical Principles in Telehealth Practices: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1.

OBJECTIVE To report the histopathological description of a series of chilblain-like lesions appearing in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. DESIGN The study included 13 patients with cutaneous acral lesions resembling chilblains occurring in the setting of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection with available skin biopsy. RESULTS Two main histopathological patterns were observed: a chilblain-like histopathological pattern (10 cases out of 13, 77%) and a thrombotic vasculopathy pattern (3 cases out of 13, 23% of cases). The chilblain-like histopathological pattern featured a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes of varying intensity. This infiltrate was sometimes peri-eccrine and alterations of eccrine glands were present in most cases. Vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis was found in a majority of patients. Lichenoid interface dermatitis was rarely present. The thrombotic vasculopathy pattern featured an absent or mild inflammatory infiltrate, multiple intraluminal fibrin thrombi and ischemic epidermal necrosis. In both patterns, no true vasculitis was observed. No patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction possibly due to the fact that these lesions may represent late cutaneous manifestations of the disease or are associated with an early effective immune response. CONCLUSION The relationship of chilblain-like lesions to SARS-CoV-2 requires further investigations. Histopathological features mimic chilblains, chilblain lupus and less frequently a thrombotic vasculopathy. Response to viral infection might trigger diverse mechanisms leading to the two histopathological patterns described.","output":"Histopathological features of Chilblain-like lesions developing in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The many carbohydrate chains on Covid-19 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its S-protein form a glycan-shield that masks antigenic peptides and decreases uptake of inactivated virus or S-protein vaccines by APC. Studies on inactivated influenza virus and recombinant gp120 of HIV vaccines indicate that glycoengineering of glycan-shields to present -gal epitopes (Gal1-3Gal1-4GlcNAc-R) enables harnessing of the natural anti-Gal antibody for amplifying vaccine efficacy, as evaluated in mice producing anti-Gal. The -gal epitope is the ligand for the natural anti-Gal antibody which constitutes 1% of immunoglobulins in humans. Upon administration of vaccines presenting -gal epitopes, anti-Gal binds to these epitopes at the vaccination site and forms immune complexes with the vaccines. These immune complexes are targeted for extensive uptake by APC as a result of binding of the Fc portion of immunocomplexed anti-Gal to Fc receptors on APC. This anti-Gal mediated effective uptake of vaccines by APC results in 10-200-fold higher anti-viral immune response and in 8-fold higher survival rate following challenge with a lethal dose of live influenza virus, than same vaccines lacking -gal epitopes. It is suggested that glycoengineering of carbohydrate chains on the glycan-shield of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or on S-protein vaccines, for presenting -gal epitopes, will have similar amplifying effects on vaccine efficacy. -Gal epitope synthesis on coronavirus vaccines can be achieved with recombinant 1,3galactosyltransferase, replication of the virus in cells with high 1,3galactosyltransferase activity as a result of stable transfection of cells with several copies of the 1,3galactosyltransferase gene (GGTA1), or by transduction of host cells with replication defective adenovirus containing this gene. In addition, recombinant S-protein presenting multiple -gal epitopes on the glycan-shield may be produced in glycoengineered yeast or bacteria expression systems containing the corresponding glycosyltransferases. Prospective Covid-19 vaccines presenting -gal epitopes may provide better protection than vaccines lacking this epitope because of increased uptake by APC.","output":"Amplifying immunogenicity of prospective Covid-19 vaccines by glycoengineering the coronavirus glycan-shield to present -gal epitopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) includes invasive monitoring to prevent secondary brain injuries.

Nocturia frequency was examined for predictors. METHODS This retrospective study from 2012-2019 analyzed adult patients referred for urodynamic testing, with nocturia (waking to void 2x/night). Data on baseline characteristics, symptoms, urodynamic parameters, and lower urinary tract pathology were recorded. Males and females were analyzed separately, and univariable analyses were conducted, stratified by lower urinary tract pathology. Multivariable regression models were fit. Nocturia frequency was analyzed for associations with clinical parameters. RESULTS Altogether, 372 patients were included (159 men and 213 women). More men had detrusor overactivity (DO) (p<0.001) and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) (p<0.001). DO was associated with storage symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 5.19, p<0.001), in addition to older age (p=0.009) and being male (p<0.001). Detrusor underactivity (DU) was associated with voiding symptoms (OR 1.92, p=0.004), older age (p<0.001), and being female (p=0.018). BOO was associated voiding symptoms (OR 2.09, p=0.023), younger age (p=0.018), and being male (p<0.001). The quantity of lower urinary tract symptoms was associated with DU and DO. Nocturia frequency was not associated with baseline variables or underlying pathologies. A substantial number of patients were diagnosed with DU alone (n=69, 18.7%) or associated with other diagnoses (n=108, 29.3%). CONCLUSIONS Careful assessment of risk factors and symptoms may help identify underlying lower urinary tract pathology for adults with nocturia.

In a sense, consumers believe that if sugar does not appear as an ingredient on the product label, but is intrinsic in the food (and will appear as a nutrient), it is 'good'. As an ingredient, however, it is viewed as a 'bad chemical' associated with tooth decay and obesity. The reality is that unless processing induced modifications have occurred, the sugar molecule within a plant tissue is the same molecule structure as present in purified sugar. The same calorific value. However, there is an argument that humans eat too refined food and that if sugars were eaten in their natural context (e.g. within a fruit), their presence and concentration would be in harmony (where different nutrients complement and balance the sugar concentration) with the human body. This reflects the process of eating, satiety, presence of other nutrients (including water) and the associated impact of the indigestible components of plant foods on the transit/nutrient bioavailability control and thus benefits through the gut. The authors explore these issues in this article and seek to provide a scientific basis to different sides of the argument - sugar is good or bad depending on how (in which format and how much/how concentrated) it is consumed. More importantly perhaps, how should sugar consumption - an important nutrient - can be managed to optimise the benefits but reduce the disadvantages? This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: Bacillus endophthalmitis was induced in C57BL/6J, CXCL2(?/?), and CXCL10(?/?) mice. At specific times postinfection, eyes were analyzed for Bacillus, retinal function, and inflammation. The efficacies of intravitreal anti-CXCL2 and anti-CXCL10 with or without gatifloxacin in B. cereus endophthalmitis were also assessed using the same techniques. RESULTS: Despite similar Bacillus growth in eyes of C57BL/6J, CXCL2(?/?), and CXCL10(?/?) mice, retinal function retention was greater in eyes of CXCL2(?/?) and CXCL10(?/?) mice compared to that of C57BL/6J mice. Neutrophil migration into eyes of CXCL2(?/?) and CXCL10(?/?) mice was reduced to a greater degree compared to that of eyes of C57BL/6J mice. Infected CXCL2(?/?) and CXCL10(?/?) mouse eyes had significantly less inflammation compared to that of C57BL/6J eyes. Retinal structures in infected eyes of CXCL2(?/?) mice were preserved for a longer time than in CXCL10(?/?) eyes. Compared to untreated eyes, there was less inflammation and significant retention of retinal function in eyes treated with anti-CXCL2 and anti-CXCL10 with or without gatifloxacin.

During Marburg virus (MARV) infection, large quantities of the viral glycoprotein GP are produced in the ER; this may result in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The most conserved pathway to trigger UPR is initiated by IRE1. Activation of IRE1 results in auto-phosphorylation, splicing of the XBP1 mRNA and translation of the XBP1s protein. XBP1s binds cis-acting UPR elements (UPRE) which leads to the enhanced expression of genes which should restore ER homeostasis. XBP1u protein is translated, if IRE1 is not activated. Here we show that ectopic expression of MARV GP activated the IRE1-XBP1 axis of UPR as monitored by UPRE luciferase assays. However, while at 24 h of infection with MARV IRE1 was phosphorylated, expression of XBP1s was only slightly enhanced and UPRE activity was not detected. The IRE1-XBP1 axis was not active at 48 h p.i. Co-expression studies of MARV proteins demonstrated that the MARV protein VP30 suppressed UPRE activation. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed an RNA-dependent interaction of VP30 with XBP1u. Knock-out of IRE1 supported MARV infection at late time points.

METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science and grey literature sources for randomised trials, cluster randomised trials, controlled and uncontrolled before and after studies, interrupted time series studies and qualitative studies of any method of disaster risk communication to at-risk populations. Outcome criteria were disaster-related knowledge and behaviour, and health outcomes. RESULTS Searches yielded 5,224 unique articles, of which 100 were judged to be potentially relevant. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, and two additional studies were identified from other searching.

The investigators compared three groups varying in attribution of paranormal facilities: practitioners (Mediums, Psychics, Spiritualists and Fortune-Tellers), self-professed ability and no ability. Consistent with recent research on cognitive-perceptual factors allied to delusional formation and thinking style, the researchers anticipated that practitioners would score higher on paranormal belief and self-reported executive function disruption. Correspondingly, the investigators also hypothesised that the self-professed ability group would demonstrate greater belief in the paranormal and higher levels of executive function disruption than the no ability group. A sample of 499 (219 males, 279 females) respondents completed the measures online. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) found a large effect size, alongside significant differences on all variables apart from Cognitive Reappraisal. Pairwise comparisons indicated that Paranormal Belief increased as a function of level of ability; practitioners scored higher than self-professed, who in turn scored higher than the no ability group.

However, previous reports indicate that practicing within this expanded scope has remained limited. Therefore, a 26-item, web-based survey was emailed to CA community pharmacists to assess pharmacists' knowledge, intent, and barriers to prescribing and billing for these patient care services. A total of 216 chain, supermarket-based, independent, mass merchant, and health-system outpatient pharmacists were included. The primary services provided and medications prescribed are for vaccinations and naloxone. Most pharmacists agree that engagement in and implementation of new strategies to enhance patients' access to care is important. Common barriers include patient unawareness of pharmacist-provided services, lack of payment for services, and difficulty incorporating services within pharmacy workflow. Pharmacists are confident in their ability to provide patient care services but are less knowledgeable and confident about billing for them.

However, since mid-April 2020, clusters of pediatric cases of severe systemic hyperinflammation and shock epidemiologically linked with COVID-19 have been reported. This condition was named as SARS-Cov-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and showed similarities to Kawasaki disease. Here, we present a narrative review of cases reported in literature and we discuss the clinical acute and follow-up management of these patients. Patients with SARS-Cov-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome frequently presented with persistent fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, polymorphic rash, conjunctivitis, and mucosal changes. Elevated inflammatory markers and evidence of cytokine storm were frequently observed. A subset of these patients also presented with hypotension and shock (20-100%) from either acute myocardial dysfunction or systemic hyperinflammation/vasodilation. Coronary artery dilation or aneurysms have been described in 6-24%, and arrhythmias in 7-60%. Cardiac support, immunomodulation, and anticoagulation are the key aspects for the management of the acute phase. Long-term structured follow-up of these patients is required due to the unclear prognosis and risk of progression of cardiac manifestations.Conclusion: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a novel syndrome related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence is still scarce but rapidly emerging in the literature. Cardiac manifestations are frequent, including myocardial and coronary involvement, and need to be carefully identified and monitored over time. What is Known: a? Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been described associated with SARS-CoV-2. What is New: a? Patients with MIS-C often present with fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and shock. a? Cardiac involvement is found in a high proportion of these patients, including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery dilation or aneurysm, and arrhythmias. a?

In late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and caused the coronaviruses to disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to the ongoing global outbreak. The other pandemic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), share a considerable level of similarities at genomic and protein levels. However, the differences between them lead to distinct behaviors. These differences result from the accumulation of mutations in the sequence and structure of spike (S) glycoprotein, which plays an essential role in coronavirus infection, pathogenicity, transmission, and evolution. In this review, we brought together many studies narrating a sequence of events and highlighting the differences among S proteins from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. It was performed here, analysis of S protein sequences and structures from the three pandemic coronaviruses pointing out the mutations among them and what they come through.

It is similar to influenza viruses and raises concerns through alarming levels of spread and severity resulting in an ongoing pandemic worldwide. Within eight months (by August 2020), it infected 24.0 million persons worldwide and over 824 thousand have died. Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are very helpful in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This work investigates the drone-based systems, COVID-19 pandemic situations, and proposes an architecture for handling pandemic situations in different scenarios using real-time and simulation-based scenarios. The proposed architecture uses wearable sensors to record the observations in Body Area Networks (BANs) in a push-pull data fetching mechanism. The proposed architecture is found to be useful in remote and highly congested pandemic areas where either the wireless or Internet connectivity is a major issue or chances of COVID-19 spreading are high. It collects and stores the substantial amount of data in a stipulated period and helps to take appropriate action as and when required. In real-time drone-based healthcare system implementation for COVID-19 operations, it is observed that a large area can be covered for sanitization, thermal image collection, and patient identification within a short period (2 KMs within 10 minutes approx.) through aerial route. In the simulation, the same statistics are observed with an addition of collision-resistant strategies working successfully for indoor and outdoor healthcare operations.

However, the process of transformation began earlier, with the emergence of new technologies and social and cultural changes.

The importance of tourism in the Balearic Islands makes this region an excellent case study for analyzing the current processes of change and their disparate consequences. Against this background, tourism in the archipelago is directed to follow the tenet of less is more, in a clear commitment to incentivizing exclusivity as a driver of the complex regional renewal of the Balearic Islands. In this article, after debating the paradigm shift in tourism from a qualitative perspective, we will analyze examples of changes in access to the islands and its effects on sun-and-beach tourism. Additionally, we will analyze cases that allow us to begin to define the pillars of a new, more complex view of tourism that encompasses diversification (spatial, practical and economic) and exclusivity realigned with the regional scale (Balearic).

While the level of adjustment made by partners to such activities is thought to contribute to a couple's sense of mutuality, perceptions of time use concerning activity engagement has yet to be considered. As such, this study will determine the level of perceptual congruence between partners with respect to perceived time use in their respective and shared activities. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the IP-COUPLES study is to determine the similarities and differences between partners in terms of their perceptual congruence with respect to independent and jointly performed activities. This study will also examine the association between independent and joint activities in terms of perceptual congruence of time use and the strength of this association. METHODS: This descriptive observational study includes 100 couples from Western Switzerland who are recruited using snowball sampling methods. The Life Balance Inventory (LBI), a self-report questionnaire that captures activity configuration congruence, will measure independent and joint perceptions of both time use allocated to daily activities and corresponding satisfaction. Due to COVID-19, the protocol can be administered virtually by the primary investigator. The mean scores of perceptual congruence variables will be used for analysis, namely perceived congruence of time use in terms of independent and jointly performed activities. For the first objective, an independent t test will be used for each variable to compare the mean score between activities on the LBI. For the second objective, the correlations between the mean scores for these activities will be calculated for each variable using the Pearson correlation. RESULTS: The IP-COUPLES study protocol was developed in 2019 and 2020. Enrollment began in June 2020. Data collection will continue until October 2021 to account for time needed for recruitment due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Analysis and presentation of results are expected in 2022.

While both IDR structures were found in alpha, beta, and gamma-coronaviruses, the second IDR was absent in deltacoronaviruses. Two novel coronaviruses, currently placed in the Gammacoronavirus genus, appeared intermediate in this regard, as the second IDR structure could be barely discerned with a low probability of disorder. Interestingly, these two are the only coronaviruses thus far isolated from marine mammals, namely beluga whale and bottlenose dolphin, two highly related species; the N proteins of the viruses were also virtually identical, differing by a single amino acid. These two unique viruses remain phylogenetic oddities, since gammacoronaviruses are generally avian (bird) in nature. Lastly, both IDRs, regardless of the coronavirus genus in which they occurred, were rich in Ser and Arg, in agreement with their disordered structure.

Its clinical applications are thus limited to particular datasets. Deep learning (DL), which extracts features from convolution layers, can embrace larger datasets that might be deliberately excluded in traditional algorithms. However, DL requires large sets of domain specific labeled data for training. Labeling various tissues of pressure ulcers is a challenge even for experienced plastic surgeons. We propose a superpixel-assisted, region-based method of labeling images for tissue classification. The boundary-based method is applied to create a dataset for wound and re-epithelialization (re-ep) segmentation. Five popular DL models (U-Net, DeeplabV3, PsPNet, FPN, and Mask R-CNN) with encoder (ResNet-101) were trained on the two datasets.

Whether and how the network hierarchy changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. To explore brain network hierarchy alterations in AD and their clinical relevance. Forty-nine healthy controls (HCs), 49 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 49 patients with AD were included. The brain network hierarchy of each group was depicted by connectome gradient analyses. We assessed the network hierarchy changes by comparing the gradient values in each network across the AD, MCI, and HC groups. Whole-brain voxel-level gradient values were compared across the AD, MCI, and HC groups to identify abnormal brain regions. Finally, we examined the relationships between altered gradient values and clinical features. In the secondary gradient, the posterior default mode network (DMN) gradient values decreased significantly in patients with AD compared with HCs. Regionally, compared with HCs, both MCI and AD groups showed that most of the brain regions with increased gradient values were located in anterior DMN, while most of the brain regions with decreased gradient values were located in posterior DMN. The decrease of gradients in the left middle occipital gyrus was associated with better logical memory performance. The increase of gradients in the right middle frontal gyrus was associated with lower rates of dementia. The network hierarchy changed characteristically in patients with AD and was closely related to memory function and disease severity.

METHODS A retrospective review of case records of all pre-adolescent patients with AA treated with oral tofacitinib in a single center between 2018 and 2019. RESULTS Fourteen patients were identified, aged 7 to 11 years. Nine patients experienced clinically significant improvement in their SALT (Severity of Alopecia Tool) score. Three patients achieved complete remission (SALT score of 0), seven (63.6%) achieved over 50% improvement in SALT score from baseline. One patient had no change from baseline, another experienced additional hair loss. After an average of 9 months of treatment, the median SALT score improvement was 67.7%. The improvement was similar in patients with baseline SALT scores greater than 50 and those with baseline SALT scores below 10. Adverse events were mild.

We describe the development of an interdisciplinary rapid message testing model to quickly create, test, and share messages with public health officials for use in health campaigns and policy briefings. METHODS: An interdisciplinary research team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assembled in March 2020 to assist the state health department in developing evidence-based messages to influence social distancing behaviors in the state. We developed and iteratively executed a rapid message testing model; the components of the 4-step model were message creation, survey development, survey administration, and analysis and presentation to health department officials. The model was executed 4 times, each during a 7-day period in April and May, and each subsequent survey included new phrasing and/or messaging informed by the previous week's survey. A total of 917 adults from North Carolina participated in the 4 surveys. RESULTS: Survey participants rated messages focused on protecting oneself and others higher than messages focused on norms and fear-based approaches. Pairing behaviors with motivations increased participants' desire to social distance across all themes and subgroups. For example, adding \\"Protect your grandmother, your neighbor with cancer, and your best friend with asthma,\\" to messaging received a 0.9-point higher score than the base message, \\"Stay 6 feet apart from others when out in public.\\" PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our model to promote social distancing in North Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used for rapid, iterative message testing during public health emergencies.","output":"Development and Application of an Interdisciplinary Rapid Message Testing Model for COVID-19 in North Carolina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Italy has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, reporting the highest death toll in Europe as of April 2020.

Secondary goals included the assessment of anatomical correction, recurrence and complication rates. METHODS This is a prospective, single-center study that included 82 patients between 2009 and 2016. A clinical evaluation took place before surgery, and was repeated at 3, 12, 36 and 60 months postoperatively. Patients routinely received an anterior prosthesis, associated with a posterior prosthesis in case of symptomatic rectocele. Patients included self-administered questionnaires for functional pelvic problems (PFDI-20), quality of life (PFIQ-7), and sexual function (PISQ-12), and a clinical examination with POP-Q staging, at each medical visit. RESULTS Functional pelvic problems derived from prolapse (PFDI-20 scores) and their impact on patients' quality of life (PFIQ-7 score) significantly improved at 3, 12, 36 and 60 months postoperatively. Improvement on sexual activity was significant at 3 and 60 months postoperatively. Effective prolapse anatomical correction (POP-Q score < 2) was found in 94.4% and 97.2% of patients at the anterior and middle stages, respectively, at the end of follow-up, but only in 80.3% at the posterior stage.

We aimed to investigate the potential use of saliva samples as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: From 27 March to 4 April 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared. RESULTS: Two-hundred pairs of samples were collected. Sixty-nine (34.5%) individuals were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28-48) years.

No infectious PEDV was recovered after treatment with evaluated disinfectants. Additionally, all tested disinfectants except for 0.17% sodium hypochlorite dramatically reduced qRT-PCR values.

Despite its crucial role in the liver and HCV life cycle, little is known about the molecular mechanism of miR-122 expression regulation by HCV infection. Here, we show that the HCV core protein downregulates the abundance of miR-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression resulted in the dysregulation of the known functions of miR-122, including its proviral activity for HCV. By high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies, we found that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3 end by 3-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. Remarkably, the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. We found that these single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability over the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and that the 3-terminal extension is catalyzed by the unique terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity of GLD-2, which is capable of adding any single ribonucleotide without preference of adenylate to the miR-122 3 end. The HCV core protein specifically inhibited GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm was found to be responsible for miR-122 downregulation.

The cardiovascular mechanisms of injury are poorly understood and speculative. We aim to use multimodality cardiac imaging including cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) and positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-d-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) to identify the cardiac pathophysiological mechanisms related to COVID-19 infections. METHODS: This is a single-centre exploratory observational study aiming to recruit 50 patients with COVID-19 infection who will undergo cardiac biomarker sampling. Of these, 30 patients will undergo combined CTCA and 18F-FDG-PET/CT, followed by CMR. Prevalence of obstructive and non-obstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease will be assessed using CTCA. CMR will be used to identify and characterise myocardial disease including presence of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, myocardial oedema and myocardial infarction. 18F-FDG-PET/CT will identify vascular and cardiac inflammation. Primary endpoint will be the presence of cardiovascular pathology and the association with troponin levels. DISCUSSION: The results of the study will identify the presence and modality of cardiac injury associated COVID-19 infection, and the utility of multi-modality imaging in diagnosing such injury. This will further inform clinical decision making during the pandemic.

Treatment strategies offer alleviation of symptoms in the absence of commercially available specific antiviral agents. Within this context, the introduction of innovative therapeutic approaches against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a critical need that should be addressed urgently. The anti-inflammatory effect of low dose irradiation has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Consideration of external beam irradiation for management of COVID-19 pneumonia has prompted the investigation of alternative methods of irradiation with potentially improved toxicity profiles. Theoretically, targeted radiotherapy may have several advantages over conventional external beam radiotherapy owing to the capability to deliver effective radiation doses without adverse irradiation effects. Since radionuclides are conjugated to targeting vectors, such as antibodies and cell surface receptor binding peptides, irradiation may be focused on targeted cells with optimal sparing of surrounding normal tissues. In the context of COVID-19 management, targeted irradiation is expected to compromise SARS-CoV-2 extracellular virions. Targeted radiotherapy may offer a viable means of combating against SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is room for improvement with the need for efficacy, feasibility, and toxicity studies. Although targeted radiotherapy itself may not achieve absolute eradication of virus or virus-infected cells, it may at least serve as a supplementary therapeutic strategy that could be utilized in combination with other antiviral treatments. Further investigations focusing on nuclear medicine, radiopharmaceuticals, and targeted radiotherapy strategies may pave the way for the development of efficacious antiviral treatments which may be utilized in the battle against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Potential Utility of Radiopharmaceuticals in the Battle Against SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, nanopore technology has become increasingly important in the field of life science and biomedical research.

However, the effect of host metabolic conditions on MSCs in general, and IMT in particular, has largely remained unexplored. This study has identified a molecular pathway that primarily governs the metabolic function and IMT of MSCs. We found underlying mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired mitophagy, and reduced IMT in MSCs derived from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice (MSC-Ob). Mechanistically, MSC-Ob failed to sequester their damaged mitochondria into LC3-dependent autophagosomes due to decrease in mitochondrial cardiolipin content, which we propose as a putative mitophagy receptor for LC3 in MSCs. Functionally, MSC-Ob exhibited diminished potential to rescue metabolic deficits and cell death in stress-induced epithelial cells. In a small molecule screen, we found pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as a regulator of mitophagy and IMT. Long-term culture of MSC-Ob with PQQ (MSC-ObPQQ) restored cardiolipin content and sequestration of mitochondria to autophagosomes with concomitant activation of mitophagy. Upon co-culture, MSC-ObPQQ rescued cell death in stress-induced epithelial cells by enhancing IMT. The beneficial effect of PQQ was also evident in MSCs derived from human subjects in an in vitro model. In two independent mice models, the transplantation of MSC-ObPQQ restored IMT to airway epithelial cells, improved their mitochondrial metabolism and attenuated features of allergic airway inflammation (AAI). However, unmodulated MSC-Ob failed to do so. In summary, we uncover the molecular mechanism leading to the therapeutic decline of obese-derived MSCs and highlight the importance of pharmacological modulation of these cells for therapeutic intervention.","output":"Obesity impairs therapeutic efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells by inhibiting cardiolipin-dependent mitophagy and intercellular mitochondrial transfer in mouse models of allergic airway inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased awareness among investors about environmental and social issues made green bonds a popular investment alternative over the last decade.

Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted over from October 2020 to December 2020, at JSS medical college, Mysuru, Karnataka, India, on 27 COVID19 positive obstetric patients admitted to the ward who had confirmed COVID-19 on the basis of Reverse TranscriptasePolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) or lung opacities. The study period belonged to first wave of COVID-19. The fetomaternal outcomes such as mode of delivery, abortions, foetal admission in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and mortality among the mother and the baby were recorded. The data was collected and tabulated in Microsoft Excel sheet and frequency (n) and percentages (%) were calculated. Results: Total of 27 COVID-19 positive obstetric patients (age 19-37 years;mean gestational age 34.84 +/- 7.75 weeks) formed the sample of the study. The mean age of the study patients were 27.11 +/- 4.5 years. The primary symptoms included cough (18.52%) and breathlessness (11.11%). After diagnosis, 7 cases (25.92%) continued pregnancy and were lost to follow-up while among those who delivered (n=20), the mode of delivery was Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS) 12 (44.44%), normal vaginal 6 (22.22%), emergency laparotomy in 1 (3.7%) and incomplete abortion in 1 (3.7%) women. Among the 20 who delivered, 1 was Intrauterine Death (IUD) and the rest of the 19 foetuses were negative for COVID19. Of the total 20 foetuses delivered, 10 required Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission where one died. Repeat testing was done in 13 female subjects, all of them were negative, while rest of the seven patients did not turn in for repeat testing and were lost. Among the pregnant women, one patient died secondary to COVID-19 bronchopneumonia in the postpartum period.

While it has been widely studied for various contagious diseases, there is still a lack of knowledge about this phenomenon for COVID-19, especially if health workers' hesitancy is considered. METHODS: An extensive review of the literature was conducted to identify the main determinants of vaccine hesitancy in health workers, as well as to find already validated surveys to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors (KAB) of health workers towards vaccination, both in general and with specific regard to COVID-19. Building on the available information, a new survey was developed to assess the KAB of Italian health care workers towards COVID-19 vaccination after validation with a pilot study in a diverse sample of 30 Italian health workers. RESULTS: A new survey was validated to assess the KAB of health workers towards COVID-19 vaccination in Italian health workers. The survey requires about 6 minutes to complete and is composed of 30 questions, investigating different domains: socio-demographic and professional characteristics (6); health status (2); attitudes (11); behaviors (6); knowledge (4). The survey will be administered to a representative sample of at least 385 Italian health workers through the web platform SurveyMonkey in the period June-September 2021. Preliminary results will be available by the end of October 2021. CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing KAB towards COVID-19 vaccination with a new tool, the magnitude and determinants of health worker's COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy will be evaluated to understand how to improve health workers' perception towards COVID-19 vaccination and, consequently, foster their positive influence on the general population. KEY MESSAGES: We explore the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors towards COVID-19 vaccination in all categories of health workers operating on the Italian territory to understand the reasons of vaccine hesitancy.

Optical melting studies indicate that LNA incorporated into an otherwise 2-O-methyl RNA oligonucleotide usually, but not always, enhances the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA. Several trends are apparent, including: (i) a 3 terminal U LNA and 5 terminal LNAs are less stabilizing than interior and other 3 terminal LNAs; (ii) most of the stability enhancement is achieved when LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2-O-methyl nucleotide; and (iii) the effects of LNA substitutions are approximately additive when the LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2-O-methyl nucleotide. An equation is proposed to approximate the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA when at least one 2-O-methyl nucleotide separates LNA nucleotides.

Bioconjugation was based on the carbodiimide activation of the carboxylate of chelator and on further reaction with the amine groups present on the antibody fragments. Radiolabeling was accomplished by replacing the three aqua ligands of the complex precursor [Tc(CO)3(H2O)3] with the tridentate chelator.

To realise the radiobiological advantage of hypofractionation whilst minimising harm, the potential reduction in dose to organs at risk was investigated for biofocused radiotherapy. Patient-specific tumour location and cell density information were derived from multiparametric imaging. Uniform-dose plans and biologically-optimised plans were generated for a standard schedule (78 Gy/39 fractions) and hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy/20 fractions and 36.25 Gy/5 fractions). Results showed that biologically-optimised plans yielded statistically lower doses to the rectum and bladder compared to isoeffective uniform-dose plans for all fractionation schedules. A reduction in the number of fractions increased the target dose modulation required to achieve equal tumour control. On average, biologically-optimised, moderately-hypofractionated plans demonstrated 16.3% (p-value:0.01) and 16.0% (p-value:0.04) reduction in rectal and bladder dose compared with standard fractionation. The tissue-sparing effect was more pronounced in extreme hypofractionation with mean reduction in rectal and bladder dose of 37.4% (p-value:<0.01) and 46.8% (p-value:0.02), respectively. This study suggests that the ability to utilise patient-specific tumour biology information will provide greater incentive to employ hypofractionation in the treatment of localised prostate cancer with radiotherapy.

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey approach was used to collect data. A sample of 300 fulltime employees, having administrative and teaching responsibilities participated using a self-completion questionnaire. The data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), correlation and multiple regressions to determine the impact of external factors on the commitment in use of technology. Findings: Overall, the results provided evidence that organization technical support, organization administrative support, and organization infrastructure and resources have a significant positive impact on the commitment in use of technology. However, organization ICT policy has an insignificant negative impact on the commitment in use of technology. The findings could be generalized on other public sector universities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Research limitations/implications: The data were collected from one public sector university of Hail province, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Only four external factors were taken into consideration in investigating its influence on the commitment in use of technology. There could be other external/environmental factors which might be useful to underpin the theory and advance literature. Practical implications: In-service and trainee faculties should take an advantage of using learning management system. Faculty should create a positive learning environment in their online classes so the learners can take a benefit out of the immense investment on ICT by ministry of higher education. Apart from giving training to teaching staff in use of technology, learners should also be given a platform to increase and improve their digital literacy. Workshops can be conducted frequently for both faculties and learners. Faculty can offer additional and out of the class support to their reluctant and weak students in order to assist them in the use of technology. Originality/value: Technology integration after COVID-19 outbreak has significantly changed the education sector throughout the world. The use of technology now is unavoidable at primary, secondary and at tertiary level. This study provides an exclusive viewpoint concerning the external/environmental evidence based findings that have not been investigated empirically in the Saudi Arabian context. The current study also provides statistically a theoretical five-component model to understand the phenomena in the field of information communication technology. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"The effect of external factors in use of technology among Hail university academic faculty: evidence from Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robot-assisted hepatobiliary surgery has been steadily growing in recent years.

Especially at some monitoring hotspots, NO(2) has been verified to show a significant decrease. However, the diffusion pattern of these hotspots in responding to COVID-19 is not clearly understood at present stage. Hence, we selected Beijing, a typical megacity with the strictest lockdown measures during COVID-19 period, as the studied city and attempted to discover the NO(2) diffusion process through complex network method. The improved metrics derived from the topological structure of the network were adopted to describe the performance of diffusion. Primarily, we found evidences that COVID-19 had significant effects on the spatial diffusion distribution due to combined effect of changed human activities and meteorological conditions. Besides, to further quantify the impacts of disturbance caused by different lockdown measures, we discussed the evolutionary diffusion patterns from lockdown period to recovery period. The results displayed that the difference between normal operation and pandemic operation firstly increased at the cutoff of lockdown measures but then declined after the implement of recovery measures. The source areas had greater vulnerability and lower resilience than receptors areas. Furthermore, based on the conclusion that the diffusion pattern changed during different periods, we explored the key stations on the path of diffusion process to further gain information. These findings could provide references for comprehending spatiotemporal pattern on city scale, which might be help for high-resolution air pollution mapping and prediction.","output":"Spatiotemporal evolution of NO(2) diffusion in Beijing in response to COVID-19 lockdown using complex network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated saliva (SAL) specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing by comparison of 459 prospectively paired nasopharyngeal (NP) or mid-turbinate (MT) swabs from 449 individuals with the aim of using saliva for asymptomatic screening. Samples were collected in a drive-through car line for symptomatic individuals (N=380) and in the emergency department (ED) (N=69). The percent positive and negative agreement of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab were 81.1% (95% CI: 65.8% - 90.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI: 98.7% - 100%), respectively. The percent positive agreement increased to 90.0% (95% CI: 74.4% - 96.5%) when considering only samples with moderate to high viral load (Cycle threshold (Ct) for the NP <=34). Pools of five saliva specimens were also evaluated on three platforms: bioMrieux NucliSENS easyMAG with ABI 7500Fast (CDC assay), Hologic Panther Fusion?, and Roche COBAS? 6800. The average loss of signal upon pooling was 2-3 Ct values across the platforms.

We conclude that although pooled saliva testing, as collected in this study, is not quite as sensitive as NP/MT testing, saliva testing is adequate to detect individuals with higher viral loads in an asymptomatic screening program, does not require swabs or viral transport media for collection, and may help to improve voluntary screening compliance for those individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections.","output":"Pooled Saliva Specimens for SARS-CoV-2 Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Northern England has been experiencing a persistent rise in the number of primary liver cancers, largely driven by an increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) secondary to alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here we review the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary liver cancer services and patients in our region. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with newly diagnosed liver cancer in our region. DESIGN: We prospectively audited our service for the first year of the pandemic (March 2020CFebruary 2021), comparing mode of presentation, disease stage, treatments and outcomes to a retrospective observational consecutive cohort immediately prepandemic (March 2019CFebruary 2020). RESULTS: We observed a marked decrease in HCC referrals compared with previous years, falling from 190 confirmed new cases to 120 (37%). Symptomatic became the the most common mode of presentation, with fewer tumours detected by surveillance or incidentally (% surveillance/incidental/symptomatic; 34/42/24 prepandemic vs 27/33/40 in the pandemic, p=0.013). HCC tumour size was larger in the pandemic year (604.6 mm vs 482.6 mm, p=0.017), with a higher incidence of spontaneous tumour haemorrhage. The number of new cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) fell only slightly, with symptomatic presentation typical. Patients received treatment appropriate for their cancer stage, with waiting times shorter for patients with HCC and unchanged for patients with ICC. Survival was associated with stage both before and during the pandemic. 9% acquired COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: The pandemic-associated reduction in referred patients in our region was attributed to the disruption of routine healthcare. For those referred, treatments and survival were appropriate for their stage at presentation. Non-referred or missing patients are expected to present with more advanced disease, with poorer outcomes. While protective measures are necessary during the pandemic, we recommend routine healthcare services continue, with patients encouraged to engage.","output":"COVID-19 and liver cancer: lost patients and larger tumours"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to warfarin for secondary stroke prevention among adult patients with atrial fibrillation and prior stroke. METHODS Major repositories were screened for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), RCT subgroups, and observational studies (OBSs, divided in claims and non-claims). Occurrences of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, all-cause mortality, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and major bleeding were outcomes of interest. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their confidence intervals (95%CIs) were pooled using random-effects models for each study design. Claims studies were analyzed separately from non-claims, while RCT subgroups were grouped with OBSs (non-claims) as the randomization was broken. RESULTS Of 8647 articles, 20 were included (one RCT, six RCT subgroups, nine claims, and four non-claims). Comparing DOACs to warfarin, pooled HRs (95%CI) were consistently in favor of DOACs although some did not reach statistical significance: for ischemic stroke, 0.84 (0.66-1.07) in claims; 0.90 (0.77-1.06) in non-claims and RCT subgroups; for systemic embolism, 0.77 (0.62-0.96) in claims; 0.86 (0.77-0.96) in non-claims and RCT subgroups; for all-cause mortality, 0.57 (0.33-0.99) in claims; 0.87 (0.79-0.96) in non-claims and RCT subgroups; for ICH, 0.72 (0.39-1.33) in claims; 0.51 (0.38-0.67) in non-claims and RCT subgroups; and for major bleeding, 0.86 (0.71-1.03) in claims; 0.90 (0.76-1.08) for non-claims and RCT subgroups.

The scientific research community has concentrated all possible efforts to understand the pathogenesis of this complex disease, and several groups have recently emphasized recommendations for nutritional support in COVID-19 patients. In this scoping review, we aim at encouraging a deeper appreciation of magnesium in clinical nutrition, in view of the vital role of magnesium and the numerous links between the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and magnesium-dependent functions. METHODS: By searching PubMed and Google Scholar from 1990 to date, we review existing evidence from experimental and clinical studies on the role of magnesium in chronic non-communicable diseases and infectious diseases, and we focus on recent reports of alterations of magnesium homeostasis in COVID-19 patients and their association with disease outcomes. Importantly, we conduct a census on ongoing clinical trials specifically dedicated to disclosing the role of magnesium in COVID-19. RESULTS: Despite many methodological limitations, existing data seem to corroborate an association between deranged magnesium homeostasis and COVID-19, and call for further and better studies to explore the prophylactic or therapeutic potential of magnesium supplementation. CONCLUSION: We propose to reconsider the relevance of magnesium, frequently overlooked in clinical practice. Therefore, magnesemia should be monitored and, in case of imbalanced magnesium homeostasis, an appropriate nutritional regimen or supplementation might contribute to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, reduce severity of COVID-19 symptoms and facilitate the recovery after the acute phase.","output":"The relevance of magnesium homeostasis in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objective To demonstrate a novel technique of office-based polypectomy using universal grasping device under transabdominal ultrasound guidance.

Nevertheless, existing literature has ignored the possibility that the source might strategically modify the network structure (by rewiring links or introducing fake nodes) to escape detection. Here, without restricting our analysis to any particular diffusion scenario, we close this gap by evaluating two mechanisms that hide the source-one stemming from the source's actions, the other from the network structure itself. This reveals that sources can easily escape detection, and that removing links is far more effective than introducing fake nodes.

In our own work, we have examined some basic manifestations of this principle: we stand closer to ingroup members than outgroup members, we are less disgusted by their bodily excretions and odours, we are more likely to share food and drink.789 While this within-group trust is very important in terms of facilitating group cohesion, solidarity, and cooperation (which themselves can improve both physical and mental health), it can also have seriously negative consequences in terms of infection transmission.10 In past pandemics, this has proved to be a key issue. At the height of AIDS epidemic, for instance, people were less likely to use condoms with more familiar partners because they assumed them to be cleaner and unlikely to be infected. [...]linked to this, they found it difficult to find ways of asking such partners to wear condoms insofar as this implied that the partner was dirty physically and/or morally.11 During the current pandemic, we have pointed to the significance of these processes in various waysfor instance the dangers of hospital staff forgetting social distancing and mask wearing protocols when entering the familiar confines of the workplace and specific ingroup spaces such as common rooms.12 We have also stressed their significance in the opening of mass events, such as football matches, where attendees are likely to have strong ingroup ties to others.

Here, we estimate the number of cases captured, quarantining days averted and secondary cases expected to occur with screening interventions. METHODS: To estimate active case exportation risk from 153 countries with recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths, we created a simple data-driven framework to calculate the number of infectious and upcoming infectious individuals out of 100 000 000 potential travellers from each country, and assessed six importation risk reduction strategies; Strategy 1 (S1) has no screening on entry, S2 tests all travellers and isolates test positives where those who test negative at 7 days are permitted entry, S3 the equivalent but for a 14 day period, S4 quarantines all travellers for 7 days where all are subsequently permitted entry, S5 the equivalent for 14 days and S6 the testing of all travellers and prevention of entry for those who test positive. RESULTS: The average reduction in case importation across countries relative to S1 is 90.2% for S2, 91.7% for S3, 55.4% for S4, 91.2% for S5 and 77.2% for S6. An average of 79.6% of infected travellers are infectious upon arrival.

Among these patients, 3 had rheumatoid arthritis and 2 had systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients' age ranged between 38 and 63 years. Only one patient (SLE) had a severe subtype of COVID-19. All the patients were cured of COVID-19 and were subsequently discharged.","output":"Case Series of Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatic Disease Patients Infected by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While ensuring employment opportunities is critical for global progress and stability, workers are now subject to several disruptive trends, including automation, rapid changes in technology and skill requirements, and energy transitions. Yet, these trends seem almost insignificant compared to labor impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While much has been written about the pandemics short-term impacts, this study analyzes anticipated long-term impacts on the labor force of 2029 by comparing original 2029 labor projections to special COVID-adjusted projections recently published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. We find that future demand for nearly every type of labor skill and knowledge increases, while work activities shift from physical to more cognitive tasks. Of the nearly three million jobs projected to disappear by 2029 due to COVID, over 91% are among workers without a bachelors degree. Among workers with a degree demand shifts primarily from business-related degrees to computer and STEM degrees. We further find that the socialness of labor, which is important for both innovation and productivity, increases in many more industries than it decreases. Finally, an examination of how COVID affects trends in automation and teleworking is mixed across industries. Overall, our results suggest that future workers will need to engage more often in training and skill acquisition, requiring life-long learning and skill maintenance strategies.","output":"Long-Term COVID-19 Impacts and the U.S. Workforce of 2029"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Over-the-counter analgesics such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are among the most widely used, and having a good understanding of their safety profile is important to public health. Prior observational studies estimating the risks associated with paracetamol use acknowledge the inherent limitations of these studies. One threat to the validity of observational studies is channeling bias, i.e. the notion that patients are systematically exposed to one drug or the other, based on current and past comorbidities, in a manner that affects estimated relative risk. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether evidence of channeling bias exists in observational studies that compare paracetamol with ibuprofen, and, if so, the extent to which confounding adjustment can mitigate this bias. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In a cohort of 140,770 patients, we examined whether those who received any paracetamol (including concomitant users) were more likely to have prior diagnoses of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or renal disease than those who received ibuprofen alone. We compared propensity score distributions between drugs, and examined the degree to which channeling bias could be controlled using a combination of negative control disease outcome models and large-scale propensity score matching. Analyses were conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. RESULTS: The proportions of prior MI, GI bleeding, renal disease, and stroke were significantly higher in those prescribed any paracetamol versus ibuprofen alone, after adjusting for sex and age. We were not able to adequately remove selection bias using a selected set of covariates for propensity score adjustment; however, when we fit the propensity score model using a substantially larger number of covariates, evidence of residual bias was attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: Although using selected covariates for propensity score adjustment may not sufficiently reduce bias, large-scale propensity score matching offers a novel approach to consider to mitigate the effects of channeling bias.

This study aims to test whether the number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological conditions are associated with the onset week of HRSV epidemic season. The estimation of onset week for 46 prefectures (except for Okinawa prefecture) in Japan for 4-year period (2014-2017) was obtained from previous papers based on the national surveillance data. We obtained data on the yearly number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological (yearly mean temperature and relative humidity) conditions from Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), respectively. Multi-level mixed-effects linear regression analysis showed that every 1 person (per 100,000 population) increase in number of overall inbound overseas travelers led to an earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in the year by 0.02 week (coefficient -0.02; P<0.01). Higher mean temperature and higher relative humidity were also found to contribute to an earlier onset week by 0.30 week (coefficient -0.30; P<0.05) and 0.18 week (coefficient -0.18; P<0.01), respectively. Additionally, models that included the number of travelers from individual countries (Taiwan, South Korea, and China) except Australia showed that both the number of travelers from each country and meteorological conditions contributed to an earlier onset week. Our analysis showed the earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in Japan is associated with increased number of inbound overseas travelers, higher mean temperature, and relative humidity. The impact of international travelers on seasonality of HRSV can be further extended to investigations on the changes of various respiratory infectious diseases especially after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","output":"Shifts in the epidemic season of human respiratory syncytial virus associated with inbound overseas travelers and meteorological conditions in Japan, 2014-2017: An ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High coronavirus incidence has prompted the Netherlands to implement a second lockdown.

An effective response to this pandemic requires health care workers (HCWs) to be present at work, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where they are already in critically low supply. To inform whether and to what degree policymakers in Bangladesh, and LMICs more broadly, should expect a drop in HCW attendance as COVID-19 continues to spread, this study aims to determine how HCW attendance has changed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. METHODS: This study analyzed daily fingerprint-verified attendance data from all 527 public-sector secondary and tertiary care facilities in Bangladesh to describe HCW attendance from January 26, 2019 to March 22, 2020, by cadre, hospital type, and geographic division. We then regressed HCW attendance onto fixed effects for day-of-week, month, and hospital, as well as indicators for each of three pandemic periods: a China-focused period (January 11, 2020 (first confirmed COVID-19 death in China) until January 29, 2020), international-spread period (January 30, 2020 (World Health Organizations declaration of a global emergency) until March 6, 2020), and local-spread period (March 7, 2020 (first confirmed COVID-19 case in Bangladesh) until the end of the study period). FINDINGS: On average between January 26, 2019 and March 22, 2020, 34.1% of doctors, 64.6% of nurses, and 70.6% of other health care staff were present for their scheduled shift. HCWs attendance rate increased with time in 2019 among all cadres. Nurses attendance level dropped by 2.5% points (95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.2% to -1.8%) and 3.5% points (95% CI = -4.5% to -2.5%) during the international-spread and the local-spread periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to the China-focused period. Similarly, the attendance level of other health care staff declined by 0.3% points (95% CI = -0.8% to 0.2%) and 2.3% points (95% CI = -3.0% to -1.6%) during the international-spread and local-spread periods, respectively. Among doctors, however, the international-spread and local-spread periods were associated with a statistically significant increase in attendance by 3.7% points (95% CI = 2.5% to 4.8%) and 4.9% points (95% CI = 3.5% to 6.4%), respectively. The reduction in attendance levels across all HCWs during the local-spread period was much greater at large hospitals, where the majority of COVID-19 testing and treatment took place, than that at small hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: After a year of significant improvements, HCWs attendance levels among nurses and other health care staff (who form the majority of Bangladeshs health care workforce) have declined during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding may portend an even greater decrease in attendance if COVID-19 continues to spread in Bangladesh. Policymakers in Bangladesh and similar LMICs should undertake major efforts to achieve high attendance levels among HCWs, particularly nurses, such as by providing sufficient personal protective equipment as well as monetary and non-monetary incentives.","output":"Healthcare worker attendance during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal analysis of fingerprint-verified data from all public-sector secondary and tertiary care facilities in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based cell transplantation is an effective means of treating chronic liver injury, fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. However, extensive studies have found that only a small number of transplanted cells migrate to the site of injury or lesion, and repair efficacy is very limited. METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) were generated that overexpressed the erythropoietin (EPO) gene using a lentivirus. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to detect the viability of BM-MSCs after overexpressing EPO. Cell migration and apoptosis were verified using Boyden chamber and flow cytometry, respectively. Finally, the anti-fibrosis efficacy of EPO-MSCs was evaluated in vivo using immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: EPO overexpression promoted cell viability and migration of BM-MSCs without inducing apoptosis, and EPO-MSC treatment significantly alleviated liver fibrosis in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced mouse liver fibrosis model. CONCLUSION: EPO-MSCs enhance anti-fibrotic efficacy, with higher cell viability and stronger migration ability compared with treatment with BM-MSCs only.

Therefore, this case report was aimed at the clinical evaluation of the proposed settings and treatment regimen in a very difficult situation of an immunocompromised patient with extensive changes and stagnation of symptoms for many weeks. A 65-year-old man, during his oncological treatment, was diagnosed with oral mucositis grade 3 according to the World Health Organization and National Cancer Institute scales. Due to pain sensation, long-lasting and not healing oral lesions, and problems with solid food intake, he was qualified for laser photobiomodulation therapy. For the management of oral lesions, a diode laser 635 nm (Smart(M)Pro, Lasotronix, Poland) was intraorally applied at an energy density of 4 J/cm(2), the 20 s of irradiation, the output power of 100 mW, and in continuous wave mode. Seven treatment procedures were performed two times a week using the spot technique in contact and non-contact mode. Within 21 days of monotherapy, all ailments disappeared. The patient was also able to reuse dental dentures and return to a solid diet. The obtained results confirm the efficiency of at least 3 PBM protocols.

Community pharmacists may often bethe primary healthcare professional with whom frail olderpeople have most frequent contact due to their convenienceand accessibility. Therefore, it is hypothesised that community pharmacists could play a wider role in frailty identification and medicines optimisation for frail older people.Aim: To explore community pharmacists' knowledge of frailtyand its assessment, their experiences and contact with frail olderpatients in the community pharmacy setting, and their perceptions of their role in optimising medicines for frail older people.Methods:Two strategies were used to recruit community pharmacists registered in Northern Ireland (NI). Community pharmacists were recruited through the Pharmacy Forum NI bi-monthlynewsletter and the School of Pharmacy Undergraduate PlacementNetwork, followed by snowballing. The interview topic guidewas developed based on the published literature, current frailtyguidelines and through discussion within the research team;itwas piloted with four pharmacists. Semi-structured interviewscommenced in March 2020. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic,face-to-face interviews were logistically not possible, thereforetelephone interviews were conducted at a time convenient to participants. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim andanalysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: To date, 14 interviews have been conducted,lasting between 24 and 72 minutes. Apart from one interview, all were conducted over the telephone. Participant characteristics are summarised in Table 1. Analysis of interviewtranscripts is ongoing. Findings to date have highlighted thekey role community pharmacists feel they play in assistingfrail older patients with their medicines (especially duringthe current pandemic). Many saw themselves as a 'point ofcontact' for frail older people and highlighted the holistic approaches they used to care of such patients: \\"It's easier to getin contact with us than other healthcare professionals and wetend to be the first port of call really\\" [CP2]. Interviews highlighted a lack of pharmacist knowledge surrounding frailtyas a condition and its assessment, with participants primarilyfocusing on the physical aspects of frailty (e.g. weight loss,weakness) when observing or 'informally assessing' patients.None of the participants reported formally assessing theirpatients using validated frailty tools or checklists: \\"It's notsomething that I've ever thought about.

We developed a Google form including a questionnaire and psychological inventories and placed it in a medical portal. Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel was used to study burnout; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to determine anxiety and depression.Results: Of all the physicians who took part in the study (n = 599), 31.2 % worked with coronavirus-infected patients. 63.6 % of the medical personnel who treated COVID-19 patients noted increased workload during the pandemic. Comparing to other physicians they more often had a high degree of emotional exhaustion (43.3 % vs 33.0 %, * = 2.404,   0.01) and depersonalization (41.7 % vs 34, 0%, * = 1.803,   0.05).

Research on Labor & Delivery units (L&D) was particularly vulnerable to setbacks due to universal COVID-19 testing policies and asymptomatic infection rates almost 16 times higher than that of other surgical units.(1) We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on L&D research operations and recruitment at a single center. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study, performed at a tertiary care academic center, evaluated temporal trends in research recruitment among women admitted for labor or induction of labor at 37 weeks gestation. This study was IRB exempt. Onsite research recruitment was paused on March 16, 2020 with phased resumption starting July 6, 2020. By August 6, 2020, all L&D studies resumed recruitment. Universal COVID-19 testing on L&D started in May 2020. Upon resuming recruitment, only patients with negative COVID-19 tests were approached by research staff. Patients with pending COVID-19 results at time of active labor or those who declined COVID-19 tests were not approached. We calculated approach rates as the number of women approached for enrollment among all women admitted for delivery and consent rates as the number of women who consented for participation in at least one study among those admitted for delivery. Univariate analyses were used to compare the approach and consent rates pre-research pause (November 2019-March 2020) to the rates post-pause (August-December 2020). A single approach process was used for all studies both pre- and post- research pause. RESULTS: Four studies (3 randomized trials and 1 prospective cohort study) recruited patients pre-research pause. Post-pause, the same four studies resumed recruitment and 2 additional studies (1 randimized trial and 1 prospective cohort study) intiated recruitment. The inclusion criteria for all six studies was singleton pregnancies admitted for spontaneous labor or induction of labor at 37 weeks gestation. More than 75% of the principal investigators for all studies were trainees or pretenure faculty. The number of research staff was the same pre- and post-pause. There were 1213 and 1219 deliveries in the pre- and post-periods respectively, with no differences in patient demographics between periods. The majority of patients who delivered in both periods were Black (53.3% pre vs 52.5% post, p=0.50). The COVID-19 positivity rate was 5% during and after the research pause.There was a lower proportion of women approached for enrollment in the post period (46.1% vs 33.8%, p<0.001). The proportion of women admitted for delivery who consented to research decreased from 35.1% to 24.0% (p<0.001), although the number of women who agreed to participate among all those approached for enrollment remained stable (74.8% vs 71.2%, p=0.08) Figure. In order to investigate whether the changes in approach and consent rates were related to the pandemic and not a consequence of normal seasonal or temporal trends in research recruitment, we assessed approach and consent rates in the two years preceding the pandemic (2017-2019) and found consistent approach and consent rates throughout the year, suggesting minimal seasonal changes in research recruitment. CONCLUSION: The pandemic poses a threat to L&D research recruitment. Despite stable delivery volume and research staff capacity, fewer patients were approached and consented for research participation during the pandemic. These results are likely explained by COVID-19 status and testing protocols as patients with pending, unknown, or positive COVID-19 tests were not approached. An alternate consideration for lower approach rates during the pandemic is research staff apprehension. Decreased research participation during the pandemic is less likely to be attributed to patient apprehension, as the proportion of women who consented among those approached remained stable.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Labor & Delivery Research Operations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To summarize recent evidence on prevalence, risk factors, significance, treatment, and prevention of electrolyte disorders in critically ill with a specific focus on disorders during the initiation of nutrition. RECENT FINDINGS Electrolyte disturbances appear to occur often during critical illness, and most of them seem to be associated with impaired outcome. However, a recent systematic review indicated insufficient evidence to answer clinically relevant questions regarding hypophosphatemia. Similar questions (which thresholds of serum levels are clinically relevant; how serum levels should be corrected and how do different correction regimens/approaches influence outcome) are not clearly answered also for other electrolytes. The most crucial feature of electrolyte disturbances related to feeding is refeeding syndrome. Recent evidence supports that additionally to the correction of electrolyte levels, a temporary restriction of calories (reducing the magnitude of this metabolic feature, including electrolyte shifts) may help to improve outcome. SUMMARY Diverse electrolyte disorders often occur in critically ill patients. Hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia that are encountered after initiation of feeding identify refeeding syndrome. Along with correction of electrolytes, reduction of caloric intake may improve the outcome of the refeeding syndrome.","output":"Electrolyte disorders during the initiation of nutrition therapy in the ICU."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The possibility of immobilizing a protein with antigenic properties on a solid support offers significant possibilities in the development of immunosensors and vaccine formulations. For both applications, the orientation of the antigen should ensure ready accessibility of the antibodies to the epitope. However, an experimental assessment of the orientational preferences necessarily proceeds through the preparation/isolation of the antigen, the immobilization on different surfaces and one or more biophysical characterization steps. To predict a priori whether favorable orientations can be achieved or not would allow one to select the most promising experimental routes, partly mitigating the time cost towards the final product. In this manuscript, we apply a simple computational model, based on united-residue modelling, to the prediction of the orientation of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on surfaces commonly used in lateral-flow devices. These calculations can account for the experimental observation that direct immobilization on gold gives sufficient exposure of the epitope to obtain a response in immunochemical assays.","output":"Orientation of immobilized antigens on common surfaces by a simple computational model: Exposition of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD epitopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of approximately 70 years. The natural course of the disease varies greatly, and patients with non-progressive and asymptomatic leukemia do not require treatment. The results of CLL treatment have improved significantly in recent years, mainly due to the introduction of new, more effective drugs, including BCR inhibitors and BCL2 inhibitors. The new drugs are used continuously, while venetoclax in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies is used for 24 (rituximab) or 12 (obinutuzumab) months, depending on the type of antibody and line of therapy. The choice of treatment protocol should largely depend on the assessment of 17p deletion/TP53 mutation and immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IGVH) mutation status, which correlate with a worse response to immunochemotherapy. The role of immunochemotherapy, which until recently was the mainstay of CLL treatment, has now significantly decreased. In the first-line, it is recommended only in patients without 17p deletion/TP53 mutation, with mutated IGVH. Other patients should receive novel targeted therapies. However, at the time of the preparation of these recommendations, these therapies are not available in the firs-line of treatment in Poland. Novel targeted therapies play a major role in the treatment of refractory/relapsed CLL, and immunochemotherapy is recommended primarily in patients with a long-term response to first-line therapy.

METHODS Real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively analyzed. The presence of hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and pre-existing use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were compared between the groups. RESULTS A total of 103 COVID-19 and 91 non-COVID-19 hospitalized viral pneumonia patients were enrolled. Hypertension and CAD were more common in patients with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia than in patients with COVID-19 (39.6% vs 22.3%, respectively, p=0.012 and 24.2% vs 4.9%, respectively, p<0.001). In our study, 2.9% and 6.8% of patients with COVID-19 were on ACEIs and ARBs, respectively, whereas 13.2% and 19.8% of patients with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia were on ACEIs and ARBs, respectively (p=0.009 and p=0.013). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001) was prominent in patients with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia compared with patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION Our study results indicate that hypertension and CAD are more common among patients with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia than patients with COVID-19.

The reason(s) for this anomalous behavior are not fully understood, but distinct hypotheses have been proposed.

Both have been amply discussed in the recent literature with positive and negative conclusions: we felt that a comprehensive presentation of the data available on them would be useful. The analysis of data for countries with over 1000 reported COVID-19 cases has shown that the incidence and mortality were higher in countries in which BCG vaccination is either absent or has been discontinued, as compared with the countries with universal vaccination. We have performed a similar analysis of the data available for CQ, a widely used drug in the African continent and in other countries in which malaria is endemic; we discuss it here because CQ has been used as the drug to treat COVID-19 patients. Several African countries no longer recommend it officially for the fight against malaria, due to the development of resistance to Plasmodium, but its use across the continent is still diffuse.

In the current study, additional data was generated to determine immunogenic superiority of CORBEVAX vaccine over COVISHIELD vaccine and safety in larger and older population. MethodsThis is a phase III prospective, single blinded, randomized, active controlled study (CTRI/2021/08/036074) conducted at 20 sites across India in healthy adults aged between 18-80 years. This study has two arms; immunogenicity arm and safety arm. Participants in immunogenicity arm were randomized equally to either CORBEVAX or COVISHIELD vaccination groups to determine the immunogenic superiority. Healthy adults without a history of Covid-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection, were enrolled. FindingsThe safety profile of CORBEVAX vaccine was comparable to the comparator vaccine COVISHIELD in terms of overall AE rates, related AE rates and medically attended AEs. Majority of reported AEs were mild in nature, and overall CORBEVAX appeared to cause fewer local and systemic adverse reactions/events. Overall, two grade-3 serious AEs (Dengue fever and femur fracture) were reported and they are unrelated to study vaccine. Neutralizing Antibody titers, against both Ancestral and Delta strain, induced post two-dose vaccination regimen were higher in the CORBEVAX arm as compared to COVISHIELD and the analysis of GMT ratios demonstrated immunogenic superiority of CORBEVAX in comparison with COVISHIELD.

Yet, in most models, R_0 is assumed to be a universal constant for the virus across outbreak clusters and populations -- thus neglecting the inherent variability of the transmission process due to varying population densities, demographics, temporal factors, etc. In fact, it can be shown that the reproduction number is highly variable.

In this perspective, instead of considering a single R_0, we consider a distribution of reproductive numbers R and devise a simple Bayesian hierarchical model that builds upon current methods for estimating the R to integrate its heterogeneity. We then simulate the spread of the epidemic, and the impact of different social distancing strategies using a probabilistic framework that models hospital occupancy. This shows the strong impact of this added variability on the reported results. We emphasize that our goal is not to replace benchmark methods for estimating the basic reproductive numbers, but rather to discuss the importance of the impact of R's heterogeneity on uncertainty quantification for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Modeling the Heterogeneity in COVID-19's Reproductive Number and its Impact on Predictive Scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carceral facilities are high-risk settings for COVID-19 transmission. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among incarcerated individuals are poorly understood, especially among jail residents. Here, we conducted a retrospective review of electronic health record (EHR) data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in custody and additionally administered a survey to assess reasons for vaccine hesitancy, sources of COVID-19 information, and medical mistrust among residents of four Northern California jails. We performed multivariate logistic regression to determine associations with vaccine acceptance. Of 2,564 jail residents offered a COVID-19 vaccine between March 19, 2021 and June 30, 2021, 1,441 (56.2%) accepted at least one dose. Among vaccinated residents, 497 (34.5%) had initially refused. Vaccine uptake was higher among older individuals, women, those with recent flu vaccination, and those living in shared housing. Among 509 survey respondents, leading reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns around side effects and suboptimal efficacy, with cost and the need for an annual booster being other hypothetical deterrents to vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy was also associated with mistrust of medical personnel in and out of jail, although this association varied by race/ethnicity. Television and friends/family were the most common and most trusted sources of COVID-19 information, respectively. Overall, vaccine acceptance was much lower among jail residents than the local and national general population. Interventions to increase vaccination rates in this setting should utilize accessible and trusted sources of information to address concerns about side effects and efficacy, while working to mitigate medical and institutional mistrust among residents.","output":"Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among residents of Northern California jails"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To adapt the scientific evaluation tool for the confusion evaluation of health rumors and to test this tool to the confusion evaluation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related health rumors on Chinese online platforms during the outbreak period of COVID-19in China.

METHODS: We created a one-week virtual urology course utilizing interactive lectures, case-based exercises, and faculty-proctored surgical video reviews. Students were assigned self-study modules and participated in case-based discussions and presentations on a topic of their choice. Students perceptions of urology as a specialty and the utility of the course was evaluated through pre- and post-course surveys. Understanding of urologic content was evaluated with a multiple-choice exam. RESULTS: A total of nine students were enrolled in the course. All students reported increased understanding of the common urologic diagnoses and of urology as a specialty by an average of 2.6 points (standard deviation 1.2) on a 10-point Likert scale (p= 0.0002). Additionally, 56% of students reported increased interest, 22% reported no change and 22% reported a decreased interest in pursuing urology as a specialty following the course. Students self-reported increased knowledge of a variety of urologic topics on a 10-point Likert scale. The average exam score on the multiple-choice exam improved from 50% before the course to 89% after the course. CONCLUSIONS: Various teaching techniques can be employed through a virtual platform to introduce medical students to the specialty of urology and increase clinical knowledge surrounding common urologic conditions.

It has raised questions about recognizing and differentiating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Science Committee used established methods for literature review to present an overview of the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high community prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering. Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.","output":"Global Initiative for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.

An understanding of their nursing experiences, the challenges they encountered and the strategies they used to address them may inform efforts to better prepare and support nurses and public health measures when facing a resurgence of COVID-19 or new pandemics. This study aimed to explore the experiences of nurses caring for people with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 in Hong Kong.DesignA qualitative study was conducted using individual, semistructured interviews. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis.SettingParticipants were recruited from acute hospitals and a public health department in Hong Kong from June 2020 to August 2020.ParticipantsA purposive sample of registered nurses (N=39) caring for people with COVID-19 in Hong Kong were recruited.ResultsTwo-thirds of the nurses had a masters degree and over a third had 6C10 years of nursing experience. Around 40% of the nurses cared for people with COVID-19 in isolation wards and a quarter performed COVID-19-related work for 31-40 hours/week. Most (90%) had training in COVID-19 and three-quarters had experience of working in infection control teams. Six key themes emerged: confronting resource shortages;changes in usual nursing responsibilities and care modes;maintaining physical and mental health;need for effective and timely responses from relevant local authorities;role of the community in public health protection and management;and advanced pandemic preparedness.ConclusionsOur study found that nurses possessed resilience, self-care and adaptability when confronting resource shortages, changing nursing protocols, and physical and mental health threats during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The author was interested in exploring the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining the possible relationship between public anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and an awareness of the need for spirituality which may be achieved by means of performing a Javanese spiritual practice called tapa brata. This practice was then examined in relation to public anxiety that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis has generated several main results. Firstly anxiety among the people during the pandemic is caused by a common awareness of the uncertain and constantly changing reality. Secondly tapa brata is a mental practice of forming a calmer and wiser self which can adapt to all changes. Thirdly tapa brata is an esoteric personal practice that can overcome public anxiety during a pandemic and has a positive physiological effect on people's immunity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vaccine effectiveness against severe omicron disease, on average, is higher, but has shown variability, including rapid apparent waning, in some studies. Assessing vaccine effectiveness against omicron severe disease using hospital admission as a measure of severe disease has become more challenging because of omicrons attenuated intrinsic severity and its high prevalence of infection. Many hospital admissions likely occur among people with incidental omicron infection or among those with infection-induced exacerbation of chronic medical conditions. To address this challenge, the World Health Organization held a virtual meeting on March 15, 2022, to review evidence from several studies that assessed Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness against severe omicron disease using several outcome definitions. Data was shown from studies in South Africa, the United States, the United Kingdom and Qatar. Several approaches were proposed that better characterize vaccine protection against severe Covid-19 disease caused by the omicron variant than using hospitalization of omicron-infected persons to define severe disease. Using more specific definitions for severe respiratory Covid-19 disease, such as indicators of respiratory distress (e.g. oxygen requirement, mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission), showed higher vaccine effectiveness than against hospital admission. Second, vaccine effectiveness against progression from omicron infection to hospitalization, or severe disease, also showed higher vaccine protection. These approaches might better characterize vaccine performance against severe Covid-19 disease caused by omicron, as well as future variants that evade humoral immunity, than using hospitalization with omicron infection as an indicator of severe disease.","output":"Assessing vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 disease caused by omicron variant.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Case series type study. Deaths from various sources were investigated, including the COVID-19 Epidemiological Surveillance and the National System of Deaths. Deaths that met the definition of a confirmed case and had a positive (reactive) result of RT-PCR or rapid test were considered for the analysis. From these sources, epidemiological variables were obtained and a time analysis was performed, defining as the pre-hospital time the time from the onset of symptoms to the date of hospitalization and hospital time from the date of hospitalization to the date of death. RESULTS: 3,244 confirmed deaths were included in the study. Deaths were more frequent in males (71.8%), elders (68.3%), residents of the department of Lima (41.8%), and others from the coast (37.7%). In 81.3% of cases, the death occurred in a public hospital, 16.0% died at home, shelter, penitentiary institution, public highway, or in transit to a hospital, and 31.1% had some comorbidity. Statistical difference was observed in pre-hospital time according to age group (p <0.001) and gender (p = 0.037), being significantly higher in adults, elders, and women. There was a statistically significant difference in hospital time according to geographic area, showing a significantly shorter time in the departments of the coast (p <0.001) and Andean region (p = 0.014) compared to Lima. The cases that were seen in private clinics (p = 0.001) survived longer than those seen in public hospitals. CONCLUSION: Deaths from COVID-19 occur mainly in male, elders, on the coast, with considerable deaths at home, in shelters, penitentiaries, public roads, or in transit to a hospital.

This is used to reveal seasonal changes in the EWM calculation and is especially relevant nearer to the equator where EWM does not reach a peak at the same time each year. In addition to latitude country specific factors determine EWM. Females generally show higher EWM. Differences between the genders are highly significant and seem to vary according to the mix of variables active each winter. The EWM for respiratory conditions in England and Wales ranges from 44% to 83%, which is about double the all-cause mortality equivalent. A similar magnitude of respiratory EWM is observed in other temperate countries. Even higher EWM can be seen for specific respiratory conditions. Age has a profound effect on EWM with a peak at puberty and then increases EWM at older ages. The gap between male and female EWM seems to act as a diagnostic tool reflecting the infectious/metrological mix in each winter. Difference due to ethnicity are also observed. An EWM equivalent calculation for sickness absence demonstrates how other health-related variables can be linked to EWM. Midway between the equator and the poles show the highest EWM since such areas tend to neglect the importance of keeping dwellings warm in the winter. Pandemic influenza does not elevate EWM, although seasonal influenza plays a part each winter. Pandemic influenza and changes in influenza strain/variant mix do, however, create structural breaks in the time series and this implies that comparing EWM between studies conducted over different times can be problematic. Cancer is an excellent example of the usefulness of rolling method since cancer EWM drifts each year, in some years increasing winter EWM and in other years diminishing it. In addition, analysis of sub-national EWM in the UK reveals high spatiotemporal granularity indicating roles for infectious outbreaks.

METHODS: An Internet-based cross-sectional study was conducted where the dental teaching staff of a governmental university in Egypt were targeted using total population sampling. Data was collected on socio-demographics, attitudes towards COVID-19, risk perception, general attitudes towards vaccination, vaccine acceptance, and concerns about COVID-19 vaccines, along with barriers and motivators to vaccination. Multivariate regression was done to determine factors significantly associated with unwillingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: A total of 171 dental faculty members participated in the study. At the time of data collection (August 2021COctober 2021), 45.6% of the dental teaching staff were willing to receive the vaccine, while 46.7% were against vaccination, and 7.6% were vaccine hesitant.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the ability of a revised capnodynamic method, based on short expiratory holds (CO(EPBFexp)), to estimate CO during acute respiratory failure (LI) with high shunt fractions before and after compliance-based lung recruitment. Ten pigs were submitted to lung lavage and subsequent ventilator-induced lung injury. CO(EPBFexp), without any shunt correction, was compared to a reference method for CO, an ultrasonic flow probe placed around the pulmonary artery trunk (CO(TS)) at (1) baseline in healthy lungs with PEEP 5 cmH(2)O (HL(P5)), (2) LI with PEEP 5 cmH(2)O (LI(P5)) and (3) LI after lung recruitment and PEEP adjustment (LI(Padj)). CO changes were enforced during LI(P5) and LI(Padj) to estimate trending. LI resulted in changes in shunt fraction from 0.1 (0.03) to 0.36 (0.1) and restored to 0.09 (0.04) after recruitment manoeuvre. Bias (levels of agreement) and percentage error between CO(EPBFexp) and CO(TS) changed from 0.5 (? 0.5 to 1.5) L/min and 30% at HL(P5) to ? 0.6 (? 2.3 to 1.1) L/min and 39% during LI(P5) and finally 1.1 (? 0.3 to 2.5) L/min and 38% at LI(Padj).

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from children under 2 years of age presenting with ARI to the emergency department were screened by quantitative PCR for 17 respiratory viruses and the bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Associations between pathogen detection and clinical measures of disease severity were investigated. RESULTS: RSV was the most common virus detected, present in 29 of 58 samples from children with ARI (50%). Detection of S. pneumoniae was significantly more frequent during RSV infections compared to other respiratory viruses (adjusted effect size: 1.8, P: 0.03), and co\\\\detection of both pathogens was associated with higher clinical disease severity scores (adjusted effect size: 1.2, P: 0.03).

SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective, observational study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Records of patients with simple (dystrophic) congenital ptosis who were operated and followed for 6 months postoperatively and whose outcomes were deemed as successful were evaluated in the study. Success was defined as a MRD at the last postoperative visit of 3 mm. In all cases, levator resection was performed when LF was >4 mm and frontalis suspension when LF was 4 mm. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: For statistical evaluations, LF was accepted as the gold standard parameter for deciding on the surgical intervention, and the optimum cutoff point for initial MRD was determined as the point at which sensitivity and specificity was highest at the receiving operating curve for the selection of surgical procedure. RESULTS: Of one hundred and three eyes of ninety patients (44 female/46 male), levator resection was used in 44.7% and frontalis suspension in 55.3%. When the optimum cutoff point for MRD was determined as 0.5 mm, the sensitivity was 71%, specificity was 86%, and the area under the curve that represented the discriminative power of this parameter was found to be 0.826.

As of 2010, fewer than 5% of U.S. hospitals had telemedicine critical care, and fewer than 10% of ICU beds were covered. We evaluated recent telemedicine critical care implementation and bed coverage rates in the United States and compared characteristics of hospitals with and without telemedicine critical care. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database. SETTING: U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: None. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We obtained data regarding telemedicine critical care implementation, ICU capability (defined as  1 ICU bed), other hospital characteristics, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, a measure of ICU market competition based on hospital referral regions. Among 4,396 hospitals (response rate 71%), 788 (17.9%) had telemedicine critical care, providing potential coverage to 27,624 (28% of total) ICU beds. Among 306 hospital referral regions, 197 (64%) had a respondent hospital with telemedicine critical care. Telemedicine critical care implementation was associated with being a nonprofit (odds ratio, 7.75; 95% CI, 5.18C11.58) or public (odds ratio, 4.16 [2.57C6.73]) compared with for-profit hospital; membership in a health system (odds ratio, 3.83 [2.89C5.08]; stroke telemedicine presence (odds ratio, 6.87 [5.35C8.81]); ICU capability (odds ratio, 1.68 [1.25C2.26]); and more competitive ICU markets (odds ratio per 1,000-point decrease in Herfindahl-Hirschman Index 1.11 [1.01C1.22]). Notably, rural critical access hospitals had lower odds of telemedicine critical care implementation (odds ratio, 0.49 [0.34C0.70]). Teaching status, geographic region, and rurality were not associated with telemedicine critical care implementation. CONCLUSIONS: About one fifth of respondent hospitals had telemedicine critical care by 2018, providing potential coverage of nearly one third of reported ICU beds. This represents a substantial increase in telemedicine critical care implementation over the last decade. Future expansion to include more rural hospitals that could benefit most may be aided by addressing hospital financial and market barriers to telemedicine critical care implementation.","output":"Characteristics of U.S. Acute Care Hospitals That Have Implemented Telemedicine Critical Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a multisystem disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and the outbreak still keeps its impacts worldwide. Beh?et's disease (BD) is a multi-systemic vasculitis involving the skin, mucosa, eyes, joints, nervous system, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal system. The precise etiopathogenesis of the disorder is unknown but autoimmunity is believed to play a key role. A considerable part of patients with BD are susceptible to immunosuppression and are more predisposed to infections than healthy individuals. Hence, the protection and control measures for patients with BD against the COVID-19 are of the utmost significance. Given the requirement to balance proper treatment of BD with the smallest risk of COVID-19 associated mortality and morbidity, we aimed to review the management of BD in the era of the pandemic with a special focus on treatment considerations. According to current expert recommendations, there is no reason to discontinue topical treatments, colchicine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Systemic steroids can be used at the lowest possible dose if needed. Ongoing treatments can be continued unchanged in patients with no suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In cases with COVID-19 symptoms, immunosuppressive and biological agents can be temporarily stopped but the decision should be made on a case by case basis. Considering their potential beneficial effects on the course of COVID-19, colchicine, pentoxifylline, and dapsone can be considered as safe treatment options in BD.

Since patients are usually observed from hospital admission to discharge and drug initiation starts during hospitalization, advanced statistical methods are needed to account for time-dependent drug exposure, confounding, and competing events. Our objective is to evaluate the observational studies on the three common methodological pitfalls in time-to-event analyses: immortal time bias, confounding bias, and competing risk bias. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on October 23, 2020, in the PubMed database to identify observational cohort studies that evaluated drug effectiveness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We included articles published in four journals: The British Medical Journal (The BMJ), the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), and The Lancet as well as their sub-journals. RESULTS: Overall, out of 255 articles screened, eleven observational cohort studies on treatment effectiveness with drug exposure-outcome associations were evaluated. All studies were susceptible to one or more types of bias in the primary study analysis. Eight studies had a time-dependent treatment. However, the hazard ratios were not adjusted for immortal time in the primary analysis. Even though confounders presented at baseline have been addressed in nine studies, time-varying confounding caused by time-varying treatment exposure and clinical variables was less recognized. Only one out of eleven studies addressed competing event bias by extending follow-up beyond patients discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In the observational cohort studies on drug effectiveness for treatment of COVID-19 published in four high impact journals, the methodological biases were concerningly common.

The health systems of each country are reorganizing to cope with an influx of patients. This crisis reorganization is the source of psychological tension that can lead to symptomatic manifestations in many caregivers. This situation is similar in many points to that encountered by soldiers on external operations (loss of usual bearings, feeling of threat, focusing of attention on the crisis, deterioration of living conditions with limitation of the possibility of taking breaks). The aim of this work is to describe at the hospital level the changes in the professional and personal environment linked to the crisis likely to cause stress and then to describe the clinical manifestations observed both on an individual and collective level. Analysis of the situation: In this chapter, after having described the reorganization of the hospital in which we operate, we try to identify various factors likely to have psychological repercussions such as: the perceived urgency of the situation, the achievement of privacy, the reorganization of the work tool and the exercise of unusual tasks in newly formed teams, but also the fear of lack, the anxiety linked to contamination, the uncertainties linked to the threat. Clinical description: In this chapter, we describe the clinical manifestations observed in the caregivers of the hospital in reaction to the crisis. Rather than decompensations, they are mainly anxious manifestations characterized by an increase in somatic concerns, an accentuation of verification rituals, an increase in snacking and the consumption of certain psychoactive substances (coffee, tobacco) and for certain people a character stiffening. On a collective level, it was mainly the misuse of social networks reflecting the group's anxieties (search for meaning and responsibility, need for certainty) that was observed. Conclusion: We then conclude with a description of the approach that led to the establishment of a support system by offering a graduated response, re-assessable over time, compatible with the maintenance of usual activity while maintaining a therapeutic distance.","output":"Psychopathologie de crise : chronique des tensions ordinaires en situation sanitaire extraordinaire.

However, estimates of incidence values have been derived predominantly from retrospective searches of databases of hospital discharge codes and personal communications with gastroenterologists, and are likely to be incorrect. We performed a cohort study based on esophageal manometry findings to determine the incidence of achalasia in South Australia. METHODS We collected data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the South Australian population. Cases of achalasia diagnosed by esophageal manometry were identified from the 3 adult manometry laboratory databases in South Australia. Endoscopy reports and case notes were reviewed for correlations with diagnoses. The annual incidence of achalasia in the South Australian population was calculated for the decade 2004 to 2013. Findings were standardized to those of the European Standard Population based on age. RESULTS The annual incidence of achalasia in South Australia ranged from 2.3 to 2.8 per 100,000 persons. The mean age at diagnosis was 62.1  18.1 years. The incidence of achalasia increased with age (Spearman rho, 0.95; P < .01). The age-standardized incidence ranged from 2.1 (95% CI, 1.8-2.3) to 2.5 (95% CI, 2.2-2.7). CONCLUSIONS Based on a cohort study of esophageal manometry, we determined the incidence of achalasia in South Australia to be 2.3 to 2.8 per 100,000 persons and to increase with age.

Seventy-one patients were categorized into unstable angina (n=11), Non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI, n=16), and ST-elevation MI (STEMI, n=44). Circulating CD14+HLA-DRneg/low monocytes and normal-density CD16+CD66b+CD10neg neutrophils are expanded in patients with large AMI and strongly correlated with cardiac damage, function and serum levels of S100A9/S100A8, MMP-9 and IL-1?. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis highlighted ability of CD14+HLA-DRneg/low and CD16+CD66b+CD10neg cells in discriminating acute coronary syndromes. CD14+HLA-DRneg/low monocytes did not suppress T-cell proliferation but expressed high amounts of IL1R1 and S100A9. Mechanistically, macrophages differentiated from CD14+HLA-DRneg/low monocytes produced more proinflammatory cytokines upon IFN stimulation as CD14+HLA-DRhigh monocyte-derived macrophages. CD10neg neutrophils expressed MMP9 and S100A9 at higher levels compared to CD10pos neutrophils. IFN production by CD4+ T-cells was increased in presence of CD10neg neutrophils. Remarkably, elevated circulating IFN levels were detected in cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients with expanded CD10neg neutrophils and increased frequency of CD4+CD28null T-cells. Lastly, we showed that murine homologs of human CD10neg neutrophils are Ly6GposCXCR2posCD11bdimCD101neg cells. CD101neg neutrophils are rapidly released into the bloodstream after AMI and migrate to ischemic sites, displaying increased expression of MMP-9 at 3 hours and of IL-1? at 24 hours after reperfusion.

A critical evaluation of a cytokine storm and its mechanistic linkage to COVID-19 requires innovative immunoassay technology capable of rapid, sensitive, selective detection of multiple cytokines across a wide dynamic range at high-throughput. In this study, we report a machine-learning-assisted microfluidic nanoplasmonic digital immunoassay to meet the rising demand for cytokine storm monitoring in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the assay was carried out using a facile one-step sandwich immunoassay format with three notable features: (i) a microfluidic microarray patterning technique for high-throughput, multiantibody-arrayed biosensing chip fabrication; (ii) an ultrasensitive nanoplasmonic digital imaging technology utilizing 100 nm silver nanocubes (AgNCs) for signal transduction; (iii) a rapid and accurate machine-learning-based image processing method for digital signal analysis. The developed immunoassay allows simultaneous detection of six cytokines in a single run with wide working ranges of 1C10,000 pg mL(C1) and ultralow detection limits down to 0.46C1.36 pg mL(C1) using a minimum of 3 L serum samples. The whole chip can afford a 6-plex assay of 8 different samples with 6 repeats in each sample for a total of 288 sensing spots in less than 100 min. The image processing method enhanced by convolutional neural network (CNN) dramatically shortens the processing time 6,000 fold with a much simpler procedure while maintaining high statistical accuracy compared to the conventional manual counting approach. The immunoassay was validated by the gold-standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and utilized for serum cytokine profiling of COVID-19 positive patients. Our results demonstrate the nanoplasmonic digital immunoassay as a promising practical tool for comprehensive characterization of cytokine storm in patients that holds great promise as an intelligent immunoassay for next generation immune monitoring.","output":"Machine-Learning-Assisted Microfluidic Nanoplasmonic Digital Immunoassay for Cytokine Storm Profiling in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A national organized cytology-based cervical cancer screening program was launched in 2018 and rollout is ongoing. Concomitantly, the High Authority for Health (HAS) recently assessed new evidence on primary HPV testing to update screening recommendations. METHODS: The HAS commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of primary HPV screening; accuracy of HPV testing on self-samples; effectiveness of self-sampling to reach underscreened women; and triage strategies to manage HPV-positive women. Recommendations developed by the HAS were reviewed by a multidisciplinary group. RESULTS: Compared with cytology screening, HPV screening is more sensitive to detect precancers but less specific. In women aged 30, if the test is negative, HPV screening greatly reduces the risk of developing precancer and cancer for at least 5 years. HPV testing, using validated PCR-based assays, is as sensitive and slightly less specific on self-samples than on clinician-taken samples. Self-sampling is more effective to reach underscreened women than sending invitations to have a specimen taken by a clinician. Two-time triage strategies ensure a sufficiently high risk if triage-positive to justify referral and low risk if triage-negative allowing release to routine screening. CONCLUSIONS: The HAS recommends three-yearly cytology screening for women aged 25C29 and HPV screening for those aged 30C65 with an extension of the screening interval to 5 years if the HPV test is negative. Self-sampling should be offered to underscreened women aged 30. HPV-positive women should be triaged with cytology.

The utilization of trehalose as a nutrient source by bacteria relies on carbohydrate active enzymes, specifically those of the glycoside hydrolase family 37, to degrade the disaccharide into substituent glucose moieties for entry into metabolism. Environmental bacteria using oligosaccharides for nutrients often possess multiple carbohydrate active enzymes predicted to have the same biochemical activity, and therefore are thought to be functionally redundant. In this study, we characterized trehalose degradation by the biotechnologically important saprophytic bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus This bacterium possesses two predicted --trehalase genes, tre37A and tre37B, and our investigation using mutational analysis found that only the former is essential for trehalose utilization by C. japonicus Heterologous expression experiments found that only the expression of the C. japonicus tre37A gene in an E. coli treA mutant strain allowed for full utilization of trehalose. Biochemical characterization of C. japonicus GH37 activity determined that the tre37A gene product is solely responsible for cleaving trehalose, and is an acidic --trehalase. Bioinformatic and mutational analysis indicate that Tre37A directly cleaves trehalose to glucose in the periplasm, as C. japonicus does not possess a phosphotransferase system. This study facilitates the development of a comprehensive metabolic model for -linked disaccharides in C. japonicus, and more broadly expands our understanding of the strategies that saprophytic bacteria employ to capture diverse carbohydrates from the environment.IMPORTANCE The metabolism of -diglucosides like trehalose is becoming increasingly important due to its inclusion in a number of foods and its prevalence in the environment. Bacteria able to utilize trehalose in the human gut possess a competitive advantage, as do saprophytic microbes in terrestrial environments. While the biochemical mechanism of trehalose degradation is well understood, what is less clear is how bacteria acquire this metabolite from the environment. The significance of this report is that by using the model saprophyte Cellvibrio japonicus we were able to functionally characterize the two predicted trehalase enzymes that the bacterium possesses and determined that the two enzymes are not equivalent and are not functionally redundant. The results and approaches used to understand the complex physiology of -diglucoside metabolism from this study can be applied broadly to other polysaccharide-degrading bacteria.","output":"Trehalose degradation in Cellvibrio japonicus exhibits no functional redundancy and is solely dependent on the Tre37A enzyme."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Previous COVID-19 prognostic models have been developed in hospital settings and are not applicable to COVID-19 cases in the general population. There is an urgent need for prognostic scores aimed to identify patients at high risk of complications at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: The RDT COVID-19 Observational Study (RCOS) collected clinical data from patients with COVID-19 admitted regardless of the severity of their symptoms in a general hospital in India. We aimed to develop and validate a simple bedside prognostic score to predict the risk of hypoxaemia or death. RESULTS: 4035 patients were included in the development cohort and 2046 in the validation cohort. The primary outcome occurred in 961 (23.8%) and 548 (26.8%) patients in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The final model included 12 variables: age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, urea, C-reactive protein, sodium, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. In the validation cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) was 0.907 (95% CI, 0.892C0.922), and the Brier Score was 0.098. The decision curve analysis showed good clinical utility in hypothetical scenarios where the admission of patients was decided according to the prognostic index. When the prognostic index was used to predict mortality in the validation cohort, the AUROCC was 0.947 (95% CI, 0.925C0.97) and the Brier score was 0.0188. CONCLUSIONS: The RCOS prognostic index could help improve the decision making in the current COVID-19 pandemic, especially in resource-limited settings with poor healthcare infrastructure such as India. However, implementation in other settings is needed to cross-validate and verify our findings.","output":"Development and Validation of the RCOS Prognostic Index: A Bedside Multivariable Logistic Regression Model to Predict Hypoxaemia or Death in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While short-term effects of weight loss on quality of life and metabolic aspects appear to be different in metabolically healthy (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO), respective long-term data is still missing. Given the high relevance of long-term changes, we aimed to address these in this post-hoc analysis of the MAINTAIN trial. METHODS: We analyzed 143 overweight/obese subjects (BMI  27 kg/m(2), age  18 years) before and after a 3-month weight loss program ( 8% weight loss), after a 12-month period of a randomized weight maintenance intervention (n = 121), and after another 6 months without intervention (n = 112). Subjects were retrospectively grouped into MHO and MUO by the presence of metabolic syndrome and secondarily by estimates of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR and ISI(Clamp)). Quality of life (QoL), blood pressure, lipids, HOMA-IR, and ISI(Clamp) were assessed and evaluated using mixed model analyses. RESULTS: Despite similar short- and long-term weight loss, weight loss-induced improvement of HOMA-IR was more pronounced in MUO than MHO after 3 months (MHO: 2.4[95%-CI: 1.9C2.9] vs. 1.6[1.1C2.1], p = 0.004; MUO: 3.6[3.2C4.0] vs. 2.0[1.6C2.4], p < 0.001; p = 0.03 for inter-group comparison). After 21 months, the beneficial effect was no longer seen in MHO (2.0[1.5C2.6], p = 1.0), while it remained partially preserved in MUO (2.9[2.4C3.3], p = 0.002). QueryShort-term improvements of lipid parameters were similar in both groups. However, long-term improvements of HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were only seen in MUO (44.4[41.5C47.4] vs. 49.3[46.2, 52.3] mg/dl, p < 0.001; 176.8[158.9C194.8] vs. 138.8[119.4C158.3] mg/dl, p < 0.001, respectively) but not in MHO. Weight loss-induced improvements in the QoL and particularly the physical health status were maintained in MUO until the end of the trial, while benefits disappeared over time in MHO. Group allocation by HOMA-IR and ISI(Clamp) revealed higher benefits for MUO mainly in parameters of the glucose metabolism and QoL.

We examined the relevant prospective cohort studies and before-and-after studies that covered more than two timepoints, searching four databases (PubMed, Ichushi, PsyArticles, and PTSDPub). We identified a total of 35 studies: TMI, n = 11; Chernobyl, n = 6; and Fukushima, n = 18. The smaller numbers of early-phase studies (within 6 months) of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters may also indicate the chaotic situation at those timepoints, as large-scale interviews were conducted in the early phase after the TMI disaster. Although the patterns of effects on mental health outcomes were diverse, more than half of the participants in the studies we evaluated were categorized into low or under-threshold symptom groups in all three disasters. Across the three disasters, the radiation exposure level estimated by the proximity and stigma were the common risk factors for mental health outcomes. Our findings will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the worst nuclear accidents in history on the affected individuals mental health, and our results illustrate the longitudinal consequences of such disasters.","output":"Mental Health Consequences of the Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima Nuclear Disasters: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that has caused a pandemic of severe respiratory disease-COVID-19-within several months of its initial identification.

Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 . We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the closed prefusion S structure, but is accessible in open conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.","output":"Cryptic Site of Vulnerability on the Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV 2 Spike Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To identify factors predicting symptomatic laboratory-positive SARS-COV-2 reinfection.

Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms initiating this exacerbated inflammatory response, thereby contributing to further increases in blood pressure (BP), are still being revealed. While participation of lymphoid-derived immune cells has been well described in the hypertension literature, the mechanisms by which myeloid-derived innate immune cells contribute to T cell activation, and subsequent BP elevation, remains an active area of investigation. In this article, we critically analyze the literature to understand how monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, contribute to hypertension and hypertension-associated end-organ injury. The most abundant leukocytes, neutrophils, are indisputably increased in hypertension. However, it is unknown how (and why) they switch from critical first responders of the innate immune system, and homeostatic regulators of BP, to tissue-damaging, pro-hypertensive mediators. We propose that myeloperoxidase-derived pro-oxidants, neutrophil elastase, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and interactions with other innate and adaptive immune cells are novel mechanisms that could contribute to the inflammatory cascade in hypertension. We further posit that the gut microbiota serves as a set point for neutropoiesis and their function. Finally, given that hypertension appears to be a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, we put forth evidence that neutrophils and NETs cause cardiovascular injury post-coronavirus infection, and thus may be proposed as an intriguing therapeutic target for high-risk individuals. ? 2021 American Physiological Society.

We evaluated the lubricating performance of commercially available products in vivo using a custom-built tribometer. FINDINGS: Most lubricants provide a strong initial friction reduction, but only few products provide lubrication that lasts for four hours. The response of skin to friction is a complex interplay between the lubricating properties and durability of the film deposited on the surface and the response of skin to the lubricating substance, which include epidermal absorption, occlusion, and water retention. INTERPRETATION: Talcum powder, a petrolatum-lanolin mixture, and a coconut oil-cocoa butter-beeswax mixture showed excellent long-lasting low friction.

Productive SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Indeed, viral entry into cells is mostly mediated by the early interaction between the viral spike protein S and its ACE2 receptor. The S/ACE2 complex is, thus, the first contact point between the incoming virus and its cellular target; consequently, it has been considered an attractive therapeutic target. To further characterize this interaction and the cellular processes engaged in the entry step of the virus, we set up various in silico, in vitro and in cellulo approaches that allowed us to specifically monitor the S/ACE2 association. We report here a computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex, as well as its biochemical and biophysical monitoring using pulldown, AlphaLISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding assays. This led us to determine the kinetic parameters of the S/ACE2 association and dissociation steps. In parallel to these in vitro approaches, we developed in cellulo transduction assays using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and HEK293T-ACE2 cell lines generated in-house. This allowed us to recapitulate the early replication stage of the infection mediated by the S/ACE2 interaction and to detect cell fusion induced by the interaction. Finally, a cell imaging system was set up to directly monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a cellular context and a flow cytometry assay was developed to quantify this association at the cell surface. Together, these different approaches are available for both basic and clinical research, aiming to characterize the entry step of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and its variants as well as to investigate the possible chemical modulation of this interaction. All these models will help in identifying new antiviral agents and new chemical tools for dissecting the virus entry step.","output":"In Silico, In Vitro and In Cellulo Models for Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Spike/Human ACE2 Complex, Viral Entry and Cell Fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study identified the risk factors influencing visual fatigue in baggage X-ray security screeners and estimated the strength of correlations between those factors and visual fatigue using structural equation modelling approach.

The most common symptoms in order were fever, cough, dyspnea and diarrhea. The most common computed tomography scan findings were bilateral ground glass and subpleural involvements. The rate of mortality was 7.3%. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test was positive in 22% of the patients. Based on the specialist's diagnosis, 30/25 patients were definite/or suspected to COVID-19 and reminder (79) were negative. O2 saturation <90%, was significantly higher in children with definite/or suspected diagnosis for COVID-19 (46.7% vs. 22.4%, P < 0.05). Dyspnea and shivering were significantly higher in children with definite/or suspected diagnosis for COVID-19 than those negative for COVID-19(P < 0.05). Mean duration of hospitalization was significantly associated with level of lactate dehydrogenase (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of our studied population were similar to other studies, but outcome was not similar which may be due to our studied population (inpatients cases). It is suggested that a better understanding of the infection in children may give important insights into disease pathogenesis, health-care practices, and public health policies.","output":"Clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized children with suspected COVID-19 infection: A report from Isfahan-Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already affected millions of people worldwide. There are reports of SARS-CoV-2 transmission as a consequence of environmental contamination. The SARS-CoV-2 laden infective droplets can actively persist on the surface of different materials for several hours to days. Sunlight can affect the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in these aerosols and thereby have an impact on the decay rate of the virus. Solar radiation might play an important role in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 that persists in different surfaces and the environment. Among the different climatological factors, ultraviolet radiation was found to have an important role in determining the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Although ultraviolet radiation C (UVC), UVB, UVA, visible light, and infrared radiation possess germicidal properties, human CoVs including the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 are inherently sensitive to UVC. However, the successful decontamination using other wavebands requires higher dosages and longer administration times. Furthermore, studies have also identified association between COVID-19 fatalities and the latitude. The intensity of sunlight is highest near the equator, and therefore populations in these regions with more regular exposure to sunlight are less susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. This article has analyzed the potential impact of sunlight in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, morbidity, and mortality. It is evident that there exists an interesting link between sunlight exposure, latitude, and vitamin D status with COVID-19 incidence, fatality and recovery rates that requires further investigation.","output":"COVID-19 and sunlight: Impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, morbidity, and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging data indicate that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells targeting different viral proteins are detectable in up to 70% of convalescent individuals1-5.

The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. To understand the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. This study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. The proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control.","output":"Genotyping coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: Methods and implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In preliminary ELISA studies where released-active forms (RAF) of antibodies (Abs) to interferon-gamma (IFNg) were added to the antigen-antibody system, a statistically significant difference in absorbance signals obtained in their presence in comparison to placebo was observed.

The difference between the analytical signals of RAF Ab samples and those of the placebo was up to 50.8%, whereas the difference between non-specific controls and the placebo was within 5%C6%. Thus, the piezoelectric immunosensor as well as ELISA has the potential to be used for detecting the effects of RAF Abs to IFNg on the antigen-antibody interaction, which might be the result of RAFs ability to modify the affinity of IFNg to specific/related Abs.","output":"Use of Piezoelectric Immunosensors for Detection of Interferon-Gamma Interaction with Specific Antibodies in the Presence of Released-Active Forms of Antibodies to Interferon-Gamma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We are currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While China-where the outbreak started-seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays present in multiple countries. Nonetheless, authorities have taken action and implemented containment measures, even if not everything is known. METHODS: To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work referred initially to the situation in Spain as of February 28, 2020, where a few dozens of cases had been detected, but has been updated to match the current situation as of 13 April. We implemented an SEIR metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. RESULTS: Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which, although might not be sufficient for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Many quantitative aspects of the natural history of the disease are still unknown, such as the amount of possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. However, preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be ready for quick and efficacious deployment globally. The scenarios evaluated here through data-driven simulations indicate that measures aimed at reducing individuals' flow are much less effective than others intended for early case identification and isolation. Therefore, resources should be directed towards detecting as many and as fast as possible the new cases and isolate them.","output":"Evaluation of the potential incidence of COVID-19 and effectiveness of containment measures in Spain: a data-driven approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many changes in the delivery of health service which not only affect the public as well as healthcare workers, and also among medical and nursing students who are currently undergoing their training.

To date, the only available method for activity measurement has been the assignment of an arbitrary score by a blind observer based on pre-defined responsiveness scale. This manual scoring method is subjective and can be prone to bias. In this study, we described a novel video-tracking methodology for determining activity changes in a ferret model of influenza infection. This method eliminates the various limitations of manual scoring, which include the need for a sole blind observer and the requirement to recognise the normal activity of ferrets in order to assign relative activity scores. In ferrets infected with an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, video-tracking was more sensitive than manual scoring in detecting ferret activity changes. Using this video-tracking method, oseltamivir treatment was found to ameliorate the effect of influenza infection on activity in ferret. Oseltamivir treatment of animals was associated with an improvement in clinical symptoms, including reduced inflammatory responses in the upper respiratory tract, lower body weight loss and a smaller rise in body temperature, despite there being no significant reduction in viral shedding.

METHODS This prospective study was carried out between 03.01.2014 and 09.01.2014 in the emergency department of Fatih Sultan Mehmet Education and Research Hospital. The average BIS scores were correlated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) point, the Canadian CT Head Rule major and minor criteria, and the pathologic findings in CT imaging. The patients' demographic features, vital signs at admission, and arrival times at the hospital were investigated. RESULTS In our study, 64 (31.7%) patients were female, and 138 (68.3%) patients were male. The mean BIS scores were 84.9911.20 (86.05) and 93.783.80 (95.05) in patients with and without CT pathologies, respectively. The correlation between CT pathology and BIS scores was statistically significant: BIS scores were lower in patients with CT pathologies (p=0.001; p<0.01). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the BIS and GCS scores (45.6%) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION We showed that most head traumas occur after dangerous accidents, and according to the results, we can predict that males are more frequently affected than females. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between BIS scores and GCS points. In our study, the BIS scores were statistically significantly lower in patients with CT pathology than in patients without.

METHODS: County-level COVID-19 case, death, and population counts were downloaded from USAFacts.org. The 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme was collapsed into two categories called metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan/noncore). Daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates were computed to show temporal trends for each of these two categories. Maps showing the ratio of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates by state identify states with higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas in each of the three 11-week periods. FINDINGS: In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred among people residing in nonmetropolitan counties. The nonmetropolitan incidence and mortality trends steadily increased and surpassed those in metropolitan areas, beginning in early August.

While research has begun to explore the benefits of participating in these groups, there is a lack of work investigating who is likely to engage in this form of aid-giving, although early accounts suggest existing volunteers have played a significant part in the mutual aid phenomena. Taking a social identity approach, the present study sought to identify what social psychological processes predict this continued engagement by exploring predictors of coordinated COVID-19 aid-giving for pre-existing volunteers. A two-wave longitudinal online survey study (N = 214) revealed that volunteer role identity among existing volunteers at T1 (pre-pandemic) positively predicted perceptions of volunteer-beneficiary intergroup closeness at T1, which in turn positively predicted community identification at T1. This in turn positively predicted coordinated COVID-19 aid-giving at T2 (3 months later). This paper therefore reveals the intra- and intergroup predictors of pandemic-related coordinated aid-giving in pre-existing volunteers.

The current COVID-19 pandemic demands an effective vaccine to acquire protection against the infection. Therefore, the present study was aimed to design a multiepitope-based subunit vaccine (MESV) against COVID-19. METHODS: Structural proteins (Surface glycoprotein, Envelope protein, and Membrane glycoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2 are responsible for its prime functions. Sequences of proteins were downloaded from GenBank and several immunoinformatics coupled with computational approaches were employed to forecast B- and T- cell epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 highly antigenic structural proteins to design an effective MESV. RESULTS: Predicted epitopes suggested high antigenicity, conserveness, substantial interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding alleles, and collective global population coverage of 88.40%. Taken together, 276 amino acids long MESV was designed by connecting 3 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), 6 helper T lymphocyte (HTL) and 4 B-cell epitopes with suitable adjuvant and linkers. The MESV construct was non-allergenic, stable, and highly antigenic. Molecular docking showed a stable and high binding affinity of MESV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors-3 (TLR3). Furthermore, in silico immune simulation revealed significant immunogenic response of MESV. Finally, MEV codons were optimized for its in silico cloning into the Escherichia coli K-12 system, to ensure its increased expression. CONCLUSION: The MESV developed in this study is capable of generating immune response against COVID-19. Therefore, if designed MESV further investigated experimentally, it would be an effective vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 to control and prevent COVID-19.","output":"Reverse vaccinology assisted designing of multiepitope-based subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mathematical model has been developed to study the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in France To calibrate the model, data from the French Public Health Agency were examined The spread of the epidemic greatly depends on lockdown measures (referred to in France as 'confinement') The aim of this paper is to predict the expected evolution of the epidemic based on the various possible scenarios for ending the lockdown The spread of the disease, and its re-emergence, will be determined by these scenarios","output":"Lifting the COVID-19 lockdown: different scenarios for France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Self-administered subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) is poised to increase access to contraception; however, governments are concerned about the waste management of used units. Self-injectors in Malawi and Uganda are currently instructed to store used units in containers and return them to health workers for disposal. However, this may not be feasible in low-resource settings, especially for younger or covert self-injectors. We describe adolescent (15-19 years) and adult (20-49 years) self-injectors' disposal experiences in Uganda and Malawi. When possible, we compare covert and overt users' experiences. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional qualitative studies in 2019 with 50 self-injectors in Uganda and 60 in Malawi. We purposively selected approximately half adolescents and included those trained by clinic-based providers and community health workers. We conducted semi-structured interviews and thematic data analysis and compared the findings across settings. RESULTS: Just under half of both samples were adolescents, substantially more of whom were covert users in Uganda (68%) than Malawi (~ 10%). Most participants reported being told to store used units in a container and return them to health workers. About two-thirds of Uganda participants had disposed of at least one unit by the interview, most commonly returning them to health workers. Over one-third of Malawi participants had disposed of at least one unit by the interview, slightly more disposed into latrines compared to returning to health workers. Participants in both settings reported compliance with health workers' disposal instructions as a primary reason for their disposal method. One-fifth of Uganda participants, mostly adolescent covert users, and one-quarter in Malawi said they were told they could dispose into latrines, and often did so. The majority in both settings said they would prefer to dispose units in latrines because they worried about needlestick injuries to others and because it was convenient. Some Uganda adolescent covert users felt returning units to health workers was challenging due to privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: While most self-injectors disposed of used units as instructed, findings from both studies suggest that returning units to health workers is not preferred and may not be feasible for some adolescent covert users.

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a potent antioxidant and reduces oxidative stress and inhibits activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). ALA reduces ADAM17 activity and ACE2 upregulation. ALA is known to have antiviral effects against some viruses. ALA may show antiviral effect by reducing NF-kB activation and alleviating redox reactions. ALA increases the intracellular glutathione strengthens the human host defense. ALA activates ATP dependent K+ channels (Na+, K+-ATPase). Increased K+ in the cell raises the intracellular pH. As the intracellular pH increases, the entry of the virus into the cell decreases. ALA can increase human host defense against SARS-CoV-2 by increasing intracellular pH. ALA treatment increases antioxidant levels and reduces oxidative stress. Thus, ALA may strengthen the human host defense against SARS-CoV-2 and can play a vital role in the treatment of patients with critically ill COVID-19. It can prevent cell damage by decreasing lactate production in patients with COVID-19. Using ALA with insulin in patients with diabetes can show a synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: We performed an international observational cohort study of clinical and outcome data regarding suspected MIS-C that had been uploaded by physicians onto a Web-based database. We used inverse-probability weighting and generalized linear models to evaluate intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) as a reference, as compared with IVIG plus glucocorticoids and glucocorticoids alone. There were two primary outcomes: the first was a composite of inotropic support or mechanical ventilation by day 2 or later or death; the second was a reduction in disease severity on an ordinal scale by day 2. Secondary outcomes included treatment escalation and the time until a reduction in organ failure and inflammation. RESULTS: Data were available regarding the course of treatment for 614 children from 32 countries from June 2020 through February 2021; 490 met the World Health Organization criteria for MIS-C. Of the 614 children with suspected MIS-C, 246 received primary treatment with IVIG alone, 208 with IVIG plus glucocorticoids, and 99 with glucocorticoids alone; 22 children received other treatment combinations, including biologic agents, and 39 received no immunomodulatory therapy. Receipt of inotropic or ventilatory support or death occurred in 56 patients who received IVIG plus glucocorticoids (adjusted odds ratio for the comparison with IVIG alone, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 1.82) and in 17 patients who received glucocorticoids alone (adjusted odds ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.22 to 1.33).

Repurposing of known active compounds against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new effective and time-saving trend in anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Thorough inhibition of the coronaviral-2 proteins (i.e., multitarget inhibition) is a possible powerful favorable strategy for developing effectively potent drugs for COVID-19. In this new research study, I succeeded to repurpose the two antioxidant polyhydroxy-1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the first multitarget coronaviral protein blockers with extremely higher potencies (reach about 65 and 304 times, for CoViTris2020, and 20 and 93 times, for ChloViD2020, more potent than remdesivir and favipiravir, respectively). These two 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were computationally studied (through molecular docking in almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins) and biologically assessed (through a newly established robust in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay) for their anticoronaviral-2 bioactivities. The data obtained from the docking investigation showed that both ligands promisingly exhibited very strong inhibitory binding affinities with almost all docked enzymes (e.g., they displayed extremely lower binding energies of ? 12.00 and ? 9.60 kcal/mol, respectively, with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp). The results of the biological assay revealed that CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 significantly displayed very high anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC(50) = 0.31 and 1.01 M, respectively). Further in vivo/clinical studies for the development of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as anti-COVID-19 medications are required. In brief, the ascent of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the two lead members of the novel family of anti-COVID-19 polyphenolic 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives represents a promising hope in COVID-19 therapy.

Higher levels of serum SP-D have been reported in the patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Studies have suggested the ability of human SP-D to recognise spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV; its interaction with HCoV-229E strain leads to viral inhibition in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Previous studies have reported that a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) composed of 8 Gly-X-Y repeats, neck and CRD region, can act against a range of viral pathogens including influenza A Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. In this context, this study was aimed at examining the likely protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection. rfhSP-D showed a dose-responsive binding to S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor binding domain. Importantly, rfhSP-D inhibited interaction of S1 protein with the HEK293T cells overexpressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection as an entry inhibitor was further validated by the use of pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein; ~0.5 RLU fold reduction in viral entry was seen following treatment with rfhSP-D (10 g/ml).

Thus, this study aimed to analyze the COVID-19 mortality, from March to July 2020, considering the spatio-time architectures, the socio-economic context of the population, and using a fine granular level, in the most populous city in Brazil. For this, we conducted an ecological study, using secondary public data from the mortality information system. We describe mortality rates for each epidemiological week and the entire period by sex and age. We modelled the deaths using spatiotemporal and spatial architectures and Poisson probability distributions in a latent Gaussian Bayesian model approach. We obtained the relative risks for temporal and spatiotemporal trends and socio-economic conditions. To reduce possible sub notification, we considered the confirmed and suspected deaths.

Method We circulated a survey to all psychiatrists on the on-call rota, to gather quantitative and qualitative information on the challenges posed by assessments of under-18s in a POS and assess whether an under-18 specific policy was needed. Result Out of the 50 psychiatrists invited, 27 completed this survey (during February 2021). 33.3% of respondents reported that they had completed a POS assessment of an under 18-year-old when a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist/Registrar was not available to join. 33.3% of respondents had been asked to complete such an assessment as the sole psychiatrist joining the AMHP, with 24% of those respondents reporting feeling uncomfortable doing these assessments without a second doctor present, and an additional 24% feeling comfortable only sometimes. 48.1% of the doctors surveyed did not invite parents or carers to take part in the assessment, despite this being considered best practice, citing reasons such as: being unaware that this was a possibility, assessments conducted at unsociable hours, safeguarding concerns involving the parents, and social distancing in the context of COVID-19. 41% of respondents had assessed vulnerable young people (children looked after or with a diagnosis of an autism spectrum condition) in the POS and reported that these assessments posed significant challenges to safe discharge planning and identifying appropriate placements. 81.5% felt that a tailored policy for young people was needed. Qualitative findings suggest psychiatrists think such a policy should include clear procedures (flowcharts), potential outcome scenarios/options for safe discharge, referral criteria for CAMHS, contact details for key staff members, a handover protocol. Respondents felt a shared policy with all stakeholders (AMHP service, Mental Health Services, police) was required. Conclusion Our survey highlights the challenges for non-CAMHS specialists assessing under 18s in a health-based POS and the need for an under-18 policy to support safe practice. Major themes will be further explored in a focus group to guide policy development.","output":"Experiences of psychiatrists assessing under 18s on an all age rota.

The refeeding process can combine natural feeding (NF) with specific nutritional strategies, including oral nutritional supplements (ONS) and nasogastric feeding (NGF). Aims of the present study were to assess the efficacy of hospital protocol and identify the most effective inpatient nutritional strategies for weight restoration. METHODS All patients hospitalized from April 2015 to April 2020 were enrolled. According to hospital protocol, NF was proposed to all patients; ONS were combined with NF if caloric intake was below 70% of the requirements and NGF was added if caloric intake didn't reach 30% in the first week from admission. RESULTS Overall, 186 patients [M = 20; median age 14 (IQR 13-16)] were included. Nutritional issues were the main indication to admission (56.6%). A significant effect of combination treatment, with a shorter duration of hospitalization when using ONS with NGF in addition to NF was found (: -20.28 [95% CI -34.92:-5.65], p < 0.001). Only one patient showed a significant but limited increase of liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS We provide a safe and effective standardized protocol to treat the malnutrition of teenagers with AN in an inpatient setting. Malnutrition was the most important cause of admission, and more than half of the patients admitted were severely malnourished. The combination of NF, ONS and NGF was the most effective strategy to achieve the weight restoration. However, this result should be validated on larger series of patients treated with NGF and NF.","output":"Five-year Inpatient Management of Teenagers with Anorexia Nervosa: Focus on Nutritional Issues."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nursing and medical students are suffering from high rates of depressive symptoms. Mental health benefits students learning, growth and professional development. Exploring psychological resources to prevent depression is emphasized recently, and self-compassion is shown to be inversely associated with depressive symptoms. However, the mechanism through which self-compassion contributes to decreased depressive symptoms is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to explore and examine a model detailing the potential paths between self-compassion and depressive symptoms. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted and convenient sampling was used. Among the 1800 nursing and medical students targeted from two universities in East and North China, 1341 completed the questionnaires, and 1127 valid questionnaires were analyzed comprising 566 and 561 from medical and nursing students, respectively. Data in May 2020 and July 2020 were collected through Patient Health Questionnaire, self-compassion scale, resilience scale, Life Orientation Test and Perceived Stress Scale. Then, path model analysis was conducted to analyze the data. RESULTS: Finally, this study included 1125 valid questionnaires after excluding two extremes of study variables. Participants consisted of 50.2% medical students and 49.8% nursing students. The model showed an acceptable fit to the data. After controlling for the demographics, self-compassion was directly and indirectly associated with decreased depressive symptoms by increasing resilience and optimism and reducing perceived stress among nursing and medical students. Resilience and optimism were directly and indirectly associated with decreased depressive symptoms by reducing perceived stress among nursing students and indirectly associated with decreased depressive symptoms among medical students. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that self-compassion significantly influences the decrease in depressive symptoms by increasing resilience and optimism and reducing perceived stress. These findings suggested that programs enhancing students self-compassion, resilience, and optimism simultaneously can help decrease depressive symptoms and improve mental health in education and healthcare institutes. These findings may facilitate the designing of educational programs for preventing depressive symptoms and promoting mental health among nursing and medical students.","output":"Path analysis of the association between self-compassion and depressive symptoms among nursing and medical students: a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Paraphimosis is characterized by persistent penile exposure, due to the inability to retract the penis into the prepuce. This persistent exposure of a non-erect penis might result from traumas, infections, neoplasia, anatomic or neurological alterations, or even occur in its idiopathic form. Surgical treatment is indicated when it is not possible to keep the penis covered by the foreskin by trying it manually. The surgical techniques described are efficient in small exposures, however, when these are over 1.5 cm, surgical success might become a challenge. The objective of this study is to report a modified surgical approach to solve a 5 cm recurrent paraphimosis in a dog. Case: A 1-year-old male unneutered mixed-breed dog, weighing 26 kg, was presented for examination with a history persistent paraphimosis background for around 2 months without apparent cause. The animal's tutor reported that it had been submitted to 2 unsuccessful surgical procedures. When the reproductive system was examined, the animal showed a flaccid penis with 5 cm exposure outside the foreskin. A conservative treatment was used, which was also unsuccessful. The next step was a surgical procedure that used the combination of techniques, namely, phallopexy, preputial advancement and reconstruction preputial opening with suture along with orchiectomy. After 10 days, dehiscence of the ostium stitches occurred, which required debridement and new suture. However, it was not efficient and recurrence of the paraphimosis was observed. After 1 month, a new surgery was performed by adapting the phallopexy technique, which was carried out bilaterally and associated to the reconstruction preputial opening with captonated suture, which presented a successful outcome. After 8 months as of the last procedure, the patient is healthy and has no signs of paraphimosis recurrence. Discussion: No consensus has been achieved regarding the paraphimosis treatment, and the resolution of such disorder remains a challenge. For this reason, some parameters should be considered to minimize failure when choosing the surgical technique and, consequently, the recurrence of such condition. Tissue viability, morphological alterations, time of exposure, previous surgeries, and the length of the penis exposure are some of the criteria that must be taken into consideration when choosing the surgical technique. In this case, the first choice was the association of techniques that included preputial advancement, phallopexy and suture preputial opening due to the fact that the exposure was over 1.5 cm and for the existence of a preputial ostium defect, which justified its suture. Despite these associations, paraphimosis recurrence was observed and some of the probable causes include the inadequate position of the penis inside the foreskin flap during the phallopexy and lack of preputial integrity in its ventral aspect. The preputial advancement performed was not sufficient to prevent the exposure or reduce it in the recurrence of the condition, showing that the shortening of preputial muscles and the skin tension might loosen up with time. The second surgery employed bilateral phallopexy without penis exposure to guarantee its correct position, more caudal within the foreskin at the moment of the fixation. The ostium captonated suture also had a relevant role in the tension distribution up to the full tissue healing. New surgical approaches might be needed to achieve success in the paraphimosis treatment. In this report, the length of the penis exposure and the ostium defect were complicating factors. However, the association of the modified surgical techniques resulted in a successful resolution of the condition.","output":"Parafimose canina recidivante: abordagem cirrgica modificada/ Recurrent canine paraphimosis: modified surgical approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives:There has been a notable surge in cycling injuries during the COVID-19(SARS-CoV-2 virus) pandemic Cycling in general increased during lockdown as a leisure & fitness activity along with reduction in the use of public transport for commuting We investigated the bicycle-related maxillofacial injuries & associations presenting through our emergency department(ED) which covers more than 1 6 million of London population Study Design/Methods:A retrospective observational study was undertaken in the Barnet General Hospital (?hub?) which receives all maxillofacial referrals from 6 ?spoke? hospitals & other urgent primary/community care practices in North London area between 16 March 2020 & 16 July 2020 All data corresponding to cycling injuries during the lockdown period was analyzed with the aid of trauma database/trust-wide electronic patient records Results:Twenty-two patients (6 7%) with cycling-related injuries out of a total of 322 patients who attended during the 4 months study period with maxillofacial emergencies were identified Average age of patient cohort was 35 4 years, mainly consisting of adult males (77%) Seven patients had minor head injury and 1 patient suffered traumatic brain injury About 59% patients did not wear a protective helmet & 3 patients had heavy alcohol/recreational drug intoxication during the accidents Four patients needed inpatient admission and treatment under general anesthesia Conclusions:Based on our humble study, we advocate the need for robust road & personal safety measures with mandatory government legislations, policing of drug intoxication & encouragement of physical & mental health improvement measures during these unprecedented times & beyond","output":"Cycling-Related Injuries During COVID-19 Lockdown: A North London Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a broad spectrum of manifestations A variety of dermatological manifestations were described We present a case of an immunocompetent middle-aged man who presented with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and later developed herpes zoster (HZ) The case highlights the possibility of COVID-19-related HZ The highest infection control measures must be abided when managing patients with cutaneous complaints until COVID-19 is ruled out","output":"Herpes Zoster Co-Infection in an Immunocompetent Patient With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rodent malaria parasites are important models for studying host-malaria parasite interactions such as host immune response, mechanisms of parasite evasion of host killing, and vaccine development. One of the rodent malaria parasites is Plasmodium yoelii, and multiple P. yoelii strains or subspecies that cause different disease phenotypes have been widely employed in various studies. The genomes and transcriptomes of several P. yoelii strains have been analyzed and annotated, including the lethal strains of P. y. yoelii YM (or 17XL) and non-lethal strains of P. y. yoelii 17XNL/17X. Genomic DNA sequences and cDNA reads from another subspecies P. y. nigeriensis N67 have been reported for studies of genetic polymorphisms and parasite response to drugs, but its genome has not been assembled and annotated. RESULTS: We performed genome sequencing of the N67 parasite using the PacBio long-read sequencing technology, de novo assembled its genome and transcriptome, and predicted 5383 genes with high overall annotation quality. Comparison of the annotated genome of the N67 parasite with those of YM and 17X parasites revealed a set of genes with N67-specific orthology, expansion of gene families, particularly the homologs of the Plasmodium chabaudi erythrocyte membrane antigen, large numbers of SNPs and indels, and proteins predicted to interact with host immune responses based on their functional domains. CONCLUSIONS: The genomes of N67 and 17X parasites are highly diverse, having approximately one polymorphic site per 50 base pairs of DNA. The annotated N67 genome and transcriptome provide searchable databases for fast retrieval of genes and proteins, which will greatly facilitate our efforts in studying the parasite biology and gene function and in developing effective control measures against malaria.

Methods: This case & ndash;control study enrolled 323 Saudi adults with COVID-19, confirmed by real-time reverse transcription & ndash;polymerase chain reaction. The participants were selected randomly between August 31, 2020, and July 1, 2020, from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network system, which contains the primary data on COVID-19 infections in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. The sample included 108 patients who died due to COVID-19 disease and 215 controls who recovered from it (1:2 ratio). The chi-square test, independent samples t-test, and logistic regression were used to perform the statistical analysis. Results: Mortality was higher in older age patients with COVID-19 (mean = 65.4 years, standard deviation [SD] = 15.6) compared to recovered patients (mean = 39.5 years, SD = 14.8) (p &lt; 0.001) with a moderate effect size (eta squared = 0.06). Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] = 9.4), hypertension (OR = 8.6), cardiovascular disease (OR = 7.4), chronic kidney disease (OR = 3.3), and obesity (OR = 2.0) were significantly associated with death due to COVID-19. Using logistic regression analysis, older age and diabetes mellitus were the primary independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality. However, there was no significant association between a specific ABO blood group and mortality risk (P = 0.07). Conclusion: Older age and the presence of co-morbidities, especially diabetes mellitus, increased the risk of death in patients with COVID-19. Establishing the causality of death in patients with COVID-19 should be a key aim of future studies. (c) 2021 The Author(s).
