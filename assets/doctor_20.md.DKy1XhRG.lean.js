Topics continuously become disconnected from their origin and the justification for the lockdown gets out of focus, i.e. the reduction of mortality in the vulnerable population and age-groups, and the risk of an increased case fatality when the healthcare systemprimarily intensive care capacitywould become overwhelmed. METHODS: On the basis of knowledge which was already available before the current pandemic and knowledge which has been accumulated so far, refocusing and developing of an exit strategy for Germany is attempted. RESULTS: The central goal in pandemics is to overcome the primary infection of the population by wild type infection or vaccination as quickly as possible and to achieve the herd immunity threshold. Only in this way can the virus lose its dangerous potential and a new endemic equilibrium can be achieved. The Russian Flu Pandemic from 1889C1892 by CoV OC43, today a pandemic scar from that time, can function as a role model. The successful vaccine development in unprecedented speed is a grace of historic dimension. CONCLUSIONS: The Russian Flu Pandemic was the most recent and largest coronavirus pandemic. After offering vaccination to all vulnerable groups (target population), the lockdown has to be ended as soon as possible. Vaccinations should continue to be offered to adults without established risk factors and the remaining population should be primed by infection with the wild virus. In spite of the rapid, successful development of a vaccine, time to avoid further disruptions is running out.","output":"Lehren aus der Russischen Grippe fr das Endspiel der derzeitigen Pandemie C die Exitstrategie fr Deutschland: Eine Streitschrift"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was declared a pandemic in March 2020.

This study investigates the changes in indicators of metabolic health around menopause and evaluates whether PA modulates these changes. METHODS: Longitudinal data of 298 women aged 48C55 years at baseline participating in the ERMA and EsmiRs studies was used. Mean follow-up time was 3.8 (SD 0.1) years. Studied indicators of metabolic health were total and android fat mass, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, blood glucose, triglycerides, serum total cholesterol, and high- (HDL-C) and low-density (LDL-C) lipoprotein cholesterol. PA was assessed by accelerometers and questionnaires. The participants were categorized into three menopausal groups: PRE-PRE (pre- or perimenopausal at both timepoints, n = 56), PRE-POST (pre- or perimenopausal at baseline, postmenopausal at follow-up, n = 149), and POST-POST (postmenopausal at both timepoints, n = 93). Analyses were carried out using linear and Poisson mixed-effect models. RESULTS: At baseline, PA associated directly with HDL-C and inversely with LDL-C and all body adiposity variables. An increase was observed in total (B = 1.72, 95% CI [0.16, 3.28]) and android fat mass (0.26, [0.06, 0.46]), SBP (9.37, [3.34, 15.39]), and in all blood-based biomarkers in the PRE-POST group during the follow-up. The increase tended to be smaller in the PRE-PRE and POST-POST groups compared to the PRE-POST group, except for SBP. The change in PA associated inversely with the change in SBP (?2.40, [?4.34, ?0.46]) and directly with the change in WHR (0.72, [0.05, 1.38]). CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged women, menopause may accelerate the changes in multiple indicators of metabolic health. PA associates with healthier blood lipid profile and body composition in middle-aged women but does not seem to modulate the changes in most of the studied metabolic health indicators during the menopausal transition.","output":"Metabolic health, menopause, and physical activitya 4-year follow-up study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Leronlimab, a monoclonal antibody blocker of CCR5 originally developed to treat HIV-1 infection, was administered as an open label compassionate use therapeutic for COVID-19. METHODS: 23 hospitalized severe/critical COVID-19 patients received 700mg leronlimab subcutaneously, repeated after seven days in 17/23 patients still hospitalized. 18/23 received other experimental treatments, including convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, and/or tocilizumab. 5/23 received leronlimab after blinded placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir, sarilumab, selinexor, or tocilizumab. Outcomes and results were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: Mean age was 69.514.9 years. 20/23 had significant co-morbidities. At baseline, 22/23 were receiving supplemental oxygen (3/23 high flow, 7/23 mechanical ventilation). Blood showed markedly elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein) and elevated neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. By day 30 after initial dosing, 17/23 were recovered, 2/23 were still hospitalized, and 4/23 had died. Of the 7 intubated at baseline, 4/7 were fully recovered off oxygen, 2/7 were still hospitalized, and 1/7 had died. CONCLUSIONS: Leronlimab appeared safe and well tolerated. The high recovery rate suggested benefit, and those with lower inflammatory markers had better outcomes. Some but not all patients appeared to have dramatic clinical responses, indicating that unknown factors may determine responsiveness to leronlimab. Routine inflammatory and cell prognostic markers did not markedly change immediately after treatment, although IL-6 tended to fall.

The average diameter of S-GNPs varied from 20.2 to 64.5 nm, which resulted in a decrease in LoD for an LFIA of troponin I from 3.4 to 1.2 ng/mL for covalent immobilization and from 2.9 to 2.0 ng/mL for adsorption. Thus, we obtained an 8-fold decrease in LoD (9.9 to 1.2 ng/mL) by using S-GNPs. This effect can be related to more effective antibody immobilization and improved S-GNP optical properties.

Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27C77%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74% (IQR across countries [49C91%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30% (IQR across countries [12C48%]) post-relaxation.

It was originally thought that interferon could be used as a general anti-viral agent and in anti-cancer therapy. There are many different types of interferons, now known as interferons alpha, beta, gamma and lambda, with different cellular receptors and modes of action, and there are possibly 24 different types of alpha interferon. Independently and simultaneously, a group of Japanese scientists found an interfering factor, which upon subsequent analysis turned out to be interferon, probably of the alpha type. The interferon alpha gene was the first mammalian gene to be cloned in a bacterial system and became the prototype for gene cloning technology. Until the cloning of the interferons in Escherichia coli, and expression of the interferon genes in mammalian cells in culture, it was impossible to obtain enough material for clinical use. Interferon today is predominantly used in the treatment of hepatitis B and C, leukemia and Kaposis sarcoma. As an anti-viral agent, interferon has not lived up to its initial promise, since in vitro most viruses block the activity of interferon and clinical trials have given inconclusive results with severe side effects. Interferon induces hundreds of genes in vivo and in vitro, each interferon producing overlapping and distinct gene profiles. The mechanism of both interferon induction and anti-viral response is complicated and involves the interaction of many regulatory molecules.

However, some effective measures can prevent medical staff from becoming infected. This article introduces those measures and thus provides a reference for other hospitals. OBJECTIVE: In order to reduce the risk of occupational exposure and of the infection of medical staff, this article analyzed the factors, causes and experience of medical personnel on their occupational exposure to COVID-19. Some effective and targeted intervention measures can be implemented in order to avoid the occupational exposure of medical staff to COVID-19. EVIDENCE REVIEW: In this single-center case series involving 196 medical personnel, occupational exposure to COVID-19 was present. Nursing staff accounted for 67.35% of those cases. The relationships with an exposure source were found to be as follows: doctors and patients (87.24%), colleagues (10.20%), and roommates (2.55%). Occupational exposure was found to be present in the clinical department, radiology department, central sterile supply department, as well as in the outpatient clinics and operating rooms. The non-surgical departments accounted for 72.96% and direct contact accounted for 84.69% while failure to wear surgical masks (84.18%) and operating on the patient without wearing goggles/face shield (8.16%) were the main causes of occupational exposure. The occurrence of occupational exposure to COVID-19 declined to 0.19% after an extensive and comprehensive intervention program. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Some effective measures such as hand hygiene, wearing surgical masks in and around the hospital, reasonable use of goggles/face screens, raising awareness of protective measures, minimizing the number of elective operations, strengthening training as well as many other control measures were instrumental in reducing occupational exposure.

The vulnerability of incarcerated populations, and the additional threats posed to the health of prison staff and the people they contact in surrounding communities underline the need to better understand the dynamics of transmission in the inter-linked incarcerated population/staff/community sub-populations to better inform optimal control of SARS-COV-2. METHODS: We examined SARS-CoV-2 case data from 101 non-administrative federal prisons between 5/18/2020 to 01/31/2021 and examined the per capita size of outbreaks in staff and the incarcerated population compared to outbreaks in the communities in the counties surrounding the prisons during the summer and winter waves of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. We also examined the impact of decarceration on per capita rates in the staff/incarcerated/community populations. RESULTS: For both the summer and winter waves we found significant inter-correlations between per capita rates in the outbreaks among the incarcerated population, staff, and the community. Over-all during the pandemic, per capita rates were significantly higher in the incarcerated population than in both the staff and community (paired Students t-test p = 0.03 and p < 0.001, respectively). Average per capita rates of incarcerated population outbreaks were significantly associated with prison security level, ranked from lowest per capita rate to highest: High, Minimum, Medium, and Low security. Federal prisons decreased the incarcerated population by a relative factor of 96% comparing the winter to summer wave (one SD range [90%,102%]). We found no significant impact of decarceration on per capita rates of SARS-COV-2 infection in the staff community populations, but decarceration was significantly associated with a decrease in incarcerated per capita rates during the winter wave (Negative Binomial regression p = 0.015).

The cause is unknown, but it has mostly been linked to cigarette smoking inhalation. We present a unique case of AEP associated with a history of deep inhalation of fragrance oil. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient is a 19-year-old medically free female who presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of acute cough, fever, and dyspnea which started one day after deeply inhaling fragrance oil while trying to open the bottle with her mouth. She was febrile, in respiratory distress with an Oxygen saturation of 51%. The patient was managed as a case of possible COVID infection. She was intubated and admitted to the ICU. She received Dexamethasone for 3 days. Afterward, she was extubated and discharged home on room air the next day. Four days later, she presented to the ED with a similar picture. Chest x-ray (figure 1) showed bilateral patchy opacities. Computed tomography of the chest (CT) showed bilateral areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacities (figure 2). She was started empirically on antibiotics and a single dose of Hydrocortisone intravenously prior to CT scan as premedication protocol for Intravenous Contrast. Clinical, biochemical, and radiological improvement were noticed the next day. On the fourth day of admission, she became febrile and required more oxygen with an increase in neutrophils. At this point, she was started on Methylprednisone for a suspected diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia. The patient's condition improved with steroids. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis showed a WBC count of 614 cells /cumm with eosinophils of 84%. The patient was discharged home on prednisone 50mg which was tapered off within six weeks. On a follow-up clinic visit, the patient had complete resolution of her symptoms and her chest X-ray showed no lung infiltrates (figure 1 and 2). DISCUSSION: Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is a rare disease with few reported cases worldwide. It usually presents similarly to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The cause of AEP is unknown but it has been suggested to be the result of an acute hypersensitivity reaction to an unknown allergen in a previously healthy individual (2) such as smoking. Our patient is the first case of AEP to occur after deep and sudden inhalation of fragrance oi which was made up of essence, scent stabilizer, deionized water, and ethyl alcohol. Our patient fulfills all the clinical criteria for AEP diagnosis.The mainstay of treatment in AEP is corticosteroids and patients usually have a rapid response as clinical recovery happens after 3 days of steroids (3). Prognosis in AEP is excellent with rapid initiation of steroids (1). CONCLUSIONS: We reported a unique case of AEP that occurred post fragrance oil inhalation and was resolved rapidly and completely with steroids.

The aim of this study was to identify clinical and biochemical differences among polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive patients who are either febrile or afebrile. Methods This study was conducted in Rawalpindi Medical University and Allied Hospitals between September and December 2020. All patients who tested positive for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 were included in the study. After evaluation of 146 patients, 100 were selected, and with a response rate of 97%, a total of 97 patients were included in the final analysis. Depending on the presence of fever, the participants were divided into two groups. Both groups were then compared for baselines vitals and laboratory investigations. Data was entered and analyzed in SPSS v23.0 (IBM Inc., Armonk, New York). Results Among the 97 patients, 66 (68%) of the participants were male, and 31 (32%) were females. The mean age of the study participants was 45.2318.08 years. Fever was present in 39 (40.2%) of the participants. When compared with patients with no fever, the patients with fever had greater severity of disease (p<0.001), higher heart rate (p<0.001), decreased oxygen saturation (p<0.001). Among the laboratory investigations, the fever group had a greater tendency of having deranged alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (70.8229.23 vs. 32.8316.22, p=0.010), Lymphocytes (1.560.54 vs. 2.120.94, p=0.003) and serum total bilirubin (1.060.36 vs. 0.550.21, p=0.009). Based on multiple regression analysis, the presence of fever is a predictor of derangement in ALT (OR=1.034, CI=1.001-1.068 p=0.025) and total bilirubin (OR=4.38, CI=2.14-6.78, p=0.021). Conclusion Fever may not be present among all patients presenting with COVID-19 infection, but those who have a fever have a greater risk of having deranged liver function tests. Hence, it is important to monitor liver function tests (LFTs) in COVID-19 patients presenting with fever.","output":"Prevalence and Biochemical Associations of Fever in Adults With Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Proven Coronavirus Disease Presenting at Tertiary Care Hospitals in Rawalpindi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Theaflavins (TFs) are a category of natural compounds characterized with the benzotropolone skeleton.

Here we engineered an immunoglobulin M (IgM) neutralizing antibody (IgM-14) to overcome the resistance encountered by immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based therapeutics. IgM-14 is over 230-fold more potent than its parental IgG-14 in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. IgM-14 potently neutralizes the resistant virus raised by its corresponding IgG-14, three variants of concern-B.1.1.7 (Alpha, which first emerged in the UK), P.1 (Gamma, which first emerged in Brazil) and B.1.351 (Beta, which first emerged in South Africa)-and 21 other receptor-binding domain mutants, many of which are resistant to the IgG antibodies that have been authorized for emergency use. Although engineering IgG into IgM enhances antibody potency in general, selection of an optimal epitope is critical for identifying the most effective IgM that can overcome resistance. In mice, a single intranasal dose of IgM-14 at 0.044 mg per kg body weight confers prophylactic efficacy and a single dose at 0.4 mg per kg confers therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. IgM-14, but not IgG-14, also confers potent therapeutic protection against the P.1 and B.1.351 variants. IgM-14 exhibits desirable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles when administered intranasally in rodents.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of a bicycle training on adolescents cycling skills. In addition, the study investigated whether there is a relationship between school distance, mode of transport, bicycle use and cycling skills. Methods 77 adolescents (Mean age = 17.1  0.8 years) were assigned to the intervention group (n = 48) or control group (n = 29). In both groups, a validated practical cycling skills test was performed at baseline and 2 weeks after baseline. The intervention group performed 2 h of bicycle training one week after the baseline test. A questionnaire was used to determine bicycle use, mode of transportation and distance to school. Due to Covid-19 school closures, only an online questionnaire was administered at 6-month follow-up. To analyze the effects of cycling training on cycling skills, multiple linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, and baseline cycling skills were applied. Results Compared to the control group, the total cycling skills increased in the intervention group ( = 4.54, [0.89 : 8.19], p = 0.02), as well as riding over a wooden plank with a ladder profile ( = 1.14, [0.08 : 2.19], p = 0.04) and controlled riding over a step ( = 1.48, [0.63 : 2.33], p  0.001).

Material and Methods: We counted the number of inpatients and outpatients per month;from January 2018 to September 2020. We defined the data from April 2020 to May 2020, as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that from July 2020 to September 2020, as the second wave. The data from each wave were compared to those in the same period within the previous 2 years. We also analyzed other data;including, inpatients with stroke, outpatients with Parkinsons disease, and outpatients with epilepsy. Results: In the first wave, the overall number of inpatients and outpatients greatly decreased;however, the number of inpatients with stroke increased. The ratio of outpatients with Parkinsons disease, or outpatients with epilepsy to total outpatients also increased. In the second wave, the overall number of inpatients markedly increased, while that of outpatients slightly decreased. Conclusion: All Japanese general hospitals were greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic;especially in the first wave, even if the hospitals did not have in-hospital COVID-19 infection, or were not designated for COVID-19. Three factors;i.e. governmental, hospital, and patient factors, could affect the number of neurological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We investigated whether patients with cryptogenic stroke and echocardiographic features representing risk of stroke would benefit from PFO closure or anticoagulation, as compared with antiplatelet therapy. METHODS In a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, patients 16 to 60 years of age who had had a recent stroke attributed to PFO, with an associated atrial septal aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, to transcatheter PFO closure plus long-term antiplatelet therapy (PFO closure group), antiplatelet therapy alone (antiplatelet-only group), or oral anticoagulation (anticoagulation group) (randomization group 1). Patients with contraindications to anticoagulants or to PFO closure were randomly assigned to the alternative noncontraindicated treatment or to antiplatelet therapy (randomization groups 2 and 3). The primary outcome was occurrence of stroke. The comparison of PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy with antiplatelet therapy alone was performed with combined data from randomization groups 1 and 2, and the comparison of oral anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy alone was performed with combined data from randomization groups 1 and 3. RESULTS A total of 663 patients underwent randomization and were followed for a mean (SD) of 5.32.0 years. In the analysis of randomization groups 1 and 2, no stroke occurred among the 238 patients in the PFO closure group, whereas stroke occurred in 14 of the 235 patients in the antiplatelet-only group (hazard ratio, 0.03; 95% confidence interval, 0 to 0.26; P<0.001). Procedural complications from PFO closure occurred in 14 patients (5.9%). The rate of atrial fibrillation was higher in the PFO closure group than in the antiplatelet-only group (4.6% vs. 0.9%, P=0.02). The number of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the treatment groups (P=0.56).

The virtual imaging trial is a unique framework that can greatly facilitate the assessment and optimization of imaging methods by emulating the imaging experiment using representative computational models of patients and validated imaging simulators. The purpose of this study was to show how virtual imaging trials can be adapted for imaging studies of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), enabling effective assessment and optimization of CT and radiography acquisitions and analysis tools for reliable imaging and management of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We developed the first computational models of patients with COVID-19 and as a proof of principle showed how they can be combined with imaging simulators for COVID-19 imaging studies. For the body habitus of the models, we used the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) model that was developed at Duke University. The morphologic features of COVID-19 abnormalities were segmented from 20 CT images of patients who had been confirmed to have COVID-19 and incorporated into XCAT models. Within a given disease area, the texture and material of the lung parenchyma in the XCAT were modified to match the properties observed in the clinical images. To show the utility, three developed COVID-19 computational phantoms were virtually imaged using a scanner-specific CT and radiography simulator. RESULTS. Subjectively, the simulated abnormalities were realistic in terms of shape and texture. Results showed that the contrast-to-noise ratios in the abnormal regions were 1.6, 3.0, and 3.6 for 5-, 25-, and 50-mAs images, respectively. CONCLUSION.

Nutrients have marked influences on the gastrointestinal tract and manipulation of the diet provides clinicians with a powerful therapeutic strategy to be used alone or concurrently with drug therapy. During acute gastroenteritis a change from the animal's regular food to a diet containing novel protein sources minimizes the likelihood of acquired food allergies to the staple protein components of the diet. Feeding through diarrhea, a method used in human infants, has limited applicability in dogs and cats. The ideal diet for chronic small bowel-type diarrhea is highly digestible, gluten-free, hypoallergenic, isosmolar, low in fat and low in lactose. Dietary protein requirements increase in protein-losing enteropathy. Dietary fat is kept to a minimum during gastrointestinal dysfunction because malabsorbed fatty acids and bile acids cause secretory diarrhea. In diseases of the small bowel, it is traditional to use low fiber diets. This recommendation needs revision because the binding and gelling properties of fiber are of potential benefit in the treatment of small bowel diarrhea. High fiber diets are useful in most large bowel diseases. The specific fiber type used markedly influences the clinical result.","output":"Nutritional Management of Gastrointestinal Tract Diseases of Dogs and Cats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, 50 patients and 30 medical personnel were infected in a psychiatric hospital in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China), which required the Ministry of Health of China to urgently analyze the situation and develop a set of measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus and organizing a full and safe psychiatric care The reasons for this situation could be the lack of reserve beds for psychiatric patients, low awareness of psychiatrists in diagnosing and treating infectious diseases, the separation of the psychiatric care system between the two departments, and the cramped living conditions of patients in psychiatric hospitals More than 500 psychiatrists from across the country were sent to Wuhan to fill staff Psychiatric patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were transferred to temporary psychiatric hospitals organized in gymnasiums and exhibition centers Severely ill psychiatric patients COVID-19 were transferred to hospital infectious diseases A single patient routing system was organized, a shift schedule for doctors was introduced To reduce the burden on public transport, the outpatient unit of psychiatric care was taken to regional hospitals, which had previously dealt only with forensic psychiatry and the control of patients with addictive disorders Based on the experience of Wuhan, psychiatric communities from different countries proposed a list of practical recommendations designed to reduce the risks of spreading the infection and optimize the work of psychiatric care Before admission to the general department of a psychiatric hospital, a fourteen-day observation of incoming patients in a separate room is necessary It is necessary to ensure full remote monitoring of outpatients It is necessary to increase the awareness of staff about infectious diseases, methods for their diagnosis and treatment All hospitals should have a reserve bed capacity, which can be used for the rehabilitation and socialization of patients in quiet times Hospitals must be provided with a sufficient number of tests, drugs, and personal protective equipment Outpatients need to be fully provided with access to medical and psychotherapeutic therapy using telemedicine technologies to minimize the risk of infection It is crucial to restructure the appointment of doctors by introducing work on a shift schedule: two weeks in two weeks, which will not only ensure a good rest but also allow doctors to be quarantined after each shift  ݧӧڧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ COVID-19  ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧ ҧݧߧڧ  ѧߧ (ӧڧߧڧ ҧ, ڧѧ) ڧ٧ݧ ٧ѧѧا֧ߧڧ 50 ѧڧ֧ߧ  30 ާ֧էڧڧߧܧڧ էߧڧܧ,  ֧ҧӧѧݧ  ڧߧڧ֧ӧ ٧էѧӧѧߧ֧ߧڧ ڧѧ ܧ֧ߧߧԧ ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ ڧѧڧ  ѧ٧ѧҧܧ ܧާݧ֧ܧ ާ֧, ߧѧѧӧݧ֧ߧߧ ߧ է֧اڧӧѧߧڧ ѧѧߧ֧ߧڧ ӧڧ  ԧѧߧڧ٧ѧڧ ݧߧ֧ߧߧ  ҧ֧٧ѧߧ ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧ ާ ڧڧߧѧާ ݧاڧӧ֧ۧ ڧѧڧ ާԧݧ ҧ: ӧڧ ֧٧֧ӧߧ ܧ֧ էݧ ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧڧ ҧݧߧ, ߧڧ٧ܧѧ ӧ֧էާݧ֧ߧߧ ӧѧ֧-ڧڧѧ  ӧѧ էڧѧԧߧڧܧ  ݧ֧֧ߧڧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧߧߧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧߧڧ, ѧ٧է֧ݧ֧ߧڧ ڧ֧ާ ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧ ާ ާ֧اէ էӧާ ӧ֧էާӧѧާ, ֧ߧ֧ߧߧ ݧӧڧ ֧ҧӧѧߧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ  ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧڧ ѧڧߧѧѧ ݧ ӧݧߧ֧ߧڧ ѧ էߧڧܧ  ѧߧ ҧݧ ߧѧѧӧݧ֧ߧ ҧݧ֧ 500 ڧڧѧ  ӧ֧ ѧߧ ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ  ݧ֧ԧܧڧ  ֧էߧڧ ֧֧ߧڧ֧ COVID-19 ҧݧ ֧֧ާ֧֧ߧ ӧ ӧ֧ާ֧ߧߧ ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧڧ ҧݧߧڧ, ԧѧߧڧ٧ӧѧߧߧ  ԧڧާߧѧ٧ڧ  ӧѧӧߧ ֧ߧѧ ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ  ا֧ݧ ֧֧ߧڧ֧ COVID-19 ҧݧ ֧֧ӧ֧է֧ߧ  ڧߧ֧ܧڧߧߧ է֧ݧ֧ߧڧ ҧݧߧڧ ݧ ԧѧߧڧ٧ӧѧߧ ֧էڧߧѧ ڧ֧ާ ާѧڧ٧ѧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ, ӧӧ֧է֧ ާ֧ߧߧ ԧѧڧ ѧҧ էݧ ӧѧ֧ ݧ ߧڧا֧ߧڧ ߧѧԧ٧ܧ ߧ ҧ֧ӧ֧ߧߧ ѧߧ ѧާҧݧѧߧ ٧ӧ֧ߧ ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧ ާ ҧݧ ӧߧ֧֧ߧ  ҧݧѧߧ ҧݧߧڧ, ٧ѧߧڧާѧӧڧ֧ է ԧ ݧܧ ӧѧާ է֧ҧߧ ڧڧѧڧ  ܧߧݧ֧ ѧڧ֧ߧ  ѧէէڧܧڧӧߧާ ѧۧӧѧާ ߧӧӧѧ ߧ  ѧߧ, ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧڧ ҧ֧ӧ ѧ٧ߧ ѧ ֧էݧاڧݧ ڧ ѧܧڧ֧ܧڧ ֧ܧާ֧ߧէѧڧ, ڧ٧ӧѧߧߧ ߧڧ٧ڧ ڧܧ ѧѧߧ֧ߧڧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ  ڧާڧ٧ڧӧѧ ѧҧ ڧڧѧڧ֧ܧ ާ  ѧڧߧѧ էݧاߧ ѧݧѧԧѧ ֧٧֧ӧߧ ܧ֧ߧ ߧէ, ܧ  ܧۧߧ ӧ֧ާ ާا֧ ҧ ڧݧ٧ӧѧ  ֧ݧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ  ڧѧݧڧ٧ѧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ ѧڧߧѧ ߧ֧ҧէڧާ ҧ֧֧ڧ էѧߧ ܧݧڧ֧ӧ ֧, ݧ֧ܧѧӧ֧ߧߧ ֧ѧѧ  ֧է ڧߧէڧӧڧէѧݧߧ ٧ѧڧ ާҧݧѧߧ ѧڧ֧ߧѧ ߧ֧ҧէڧާ  ݧߧ ҧ֧ާ ֧էѧӧڧ է  ާ֧էڧܧѧާ֧ߧ٧ߧ  ڧ֧ѧ֧ӧڧ֧ܧ ֧ѧڧ  ڧӧݧ֧֧ߧڧ֧ ֧ߧݧԧڧ ֧ݧ֧ާ֧էڧڧߧ էݧ ާڧߧڧާڧ٧ѧڧ ڧܧ ڧߧڧڧӧѧߧڧ ֧ҧէڧާ ֧ܧڧӧѧ ӧ֧ާ ڧ֧ާ ӧѧ֧, ӧӧ֧է ѧҧ  ާ֧ߧߧާ ԧѧڧܧ - էӧ ߧ֧է֧ݧ ֧֧ էӧ,  ߧ ݧܧ ҧ֧֧ڧ ݧߧ֧ߧߧ է, ߧ  ٧ӧݧڧ ӧѧѧ էڧ ܧѧѧߧڧ ݧ ܧѧاէ ާ֧ߧ","output":"Psychiatric care organization and mental health disorders in people of countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic 2020 (review)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We assessed the preferences and trade-offs for social interactions, incentives, and being traced by a digital contact tracing (DCT) tool post lockdown in Singapore. Methods: We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) among visitors of a large public hospital in Singapore between July 2020 C February 2021. Respondents were sampled proportionately by gender and four age categories (21 C 80 years). The DCE questionnaire had three attributes (1. Social interactions, 2. Being traced by a DCT tool, 3. Incentives to use a DCT tool) and two levels each. The final dataset comprised 3839 respondents after dropping 53 with irrational responses. Panel fixed conditional logit model was used to analyze the data. Results: Respondents were more willing to trade being traced by a DCT tool for social interactions than incentives and unwilling to trade social interactions for incentives. The proportion of respondents preferring no incentives and could only be influenced by their family members increases with age. Among proponents of monetary incentives, the preferred median value for a months usage of DCT tools amounted to S$10 (USD7.25) and S$50 (USD36.20) for subsidies and lucky draw. Conclusions: DCE can be used to elicit profile-specific preferences to optimize the uptake of DCT tools during a pandemic. Social interactions are highly valued by the population, who are willing to trade them for being traced by a DCT tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although a small amount of incentive is sufficient to increase the satisfaction of using a DCT tool, incentives alone may not increase DCT tool uptake.","output":"The Value of Social Interactions and Incentives on the Use of a Digital Contact Tracing Tool Post COVID-19 Lockdown in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smart implementation of novel advanced nanocarriers such as functionalized C24 and B12N12 nanocages is used supplement for antiviral activity 5-Fluoro-2-hydroxypyrazine-3-carboxamide (Favipiravir; Avigan; T-705), as treatment of COVID-19.

This study compares these 2 techniques in female patients who are in need of an elective cholecystectomy. BACKGROUND Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is a surgical concept permitting scarless intra-abdominal operations through natural orifices, such as the vagina. Because of the lack of an adequately powered trial, we designed this first randomized controlled study for the comparison of TVC and NC. METHODS This prospective, randomized, nonblinded, single-center trial evaluates the safety and effectiveness of TVC (intervention), compared with NC (control) in female patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. The primary endpoint was intensity of pain until the morning of postoperative day (POD) 2. Secondary outcomes were among others intra- and postoperative complications, procedural time, amount of analgesics used, pain intensity until POD 10, duration of hospital stay, satisfaction with the aesthetic result, and quality of life on POD 10 as quantified with the Eypasch Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). RESULTS Between February 2010 and June 2012, 40 patients were randomly assigned to the interventional or control group. All patients completed follow-up. Procedural time, length of postoperative hospital stay, and the rate of intra- and postoperative complications were similar in the 2 groups. However, significant advantages were found for the transvaginal access regarding pain until POD 2, but also until POD 10 (P = 0.043 vs P = 0.010) despite significantly less use of peripheral analgesics (P = 0.019). In the TVC group, patients were significantly more satisfied with the aesthetic result (P < 0.001) and had a significantly better GIQLI (P = 0.028).

Leading SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates immunize with the viral spike protein delivered on viral vectors, encoded by injected mRNAs, or as purified protein. Here we describe a different approach to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development that uses exosomes to deliver mRNAs that encode antigens from multiple SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. Approach Exosomes were purified and loaded with mRNAs designed to express (i) an artificial fusion protein, LSNME, that contains portions of the viral spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope proteins, and (ii) a functional form of spike. The resulting combinatorial vaccine, LSNME/SW1, was injected into thirteen weeks-old, male C57BL/6J mice, followed by interrogation of humoral and cellular immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins, as well as hematological and histological analysis to interrogate animals for possible adverse effects. Results Immunized mice developed CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell reactivities that respond to both the SARS-CoV-2 nucelocapsid protein and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These responses were apparent nearly two months after the conclusion of vaccination, as expected for a durable response to vaccination. In addition, the spike-reactive CD4+ T-cells response was associated with elevated expression of interferon gamma, indicative of a Th1 response, and a lesser induction of interleukin 4, a Th2-associated cytokine. Vaccinated mice showed no sign of altered growth, injection-site hypersensitivity, change in white blood cell profiles, or alterations in organ morphology. Consistent with these results, we also detected moderate but sustained anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike antibodies in the plasma of vaccinated animals. Conclusion Taken together, these results validate the use of exosomes for delivering functional mRNAs into target cells in vitro and in vivo, and more specifically, establish that the LSNME/SW1 vaccine induced broad immunity to multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","output":"Exosome-Mediated mRNA Delivery For SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying children with, or at substantial risk of, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (TBI) and providing TB preventive therapy (TPT) represent an important, yet challenging, strategy in curbing the global burden of childhood TB.

Proponents argue that the low cost and near perfect safety profile of vitamin C support its early adoption. Yet, adverse events might be underreported and underappreciated. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 73-year-old non-diabetic white man with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock that was suspected to be due to peritonitis. The patient was enrolled in LOVIT (Lessening Organ Dysfunction with VITamin C; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03680274), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of high-dose intravenous vitamin C. He developed factitious hyperglycemia, as measured with a point-of-care glucometer, that persisted for 6 days after discontinuation of the study drug, confirmed to be vitamin C after unblinding. He also had short-lived iatrogenic coma because of hypoglycemia secondary to insulin administration. These events triggered a protocol amendment. CONCLUSIONS: Although factitious hyperglycemia has been reported before using certain glucometers in patients treated with high-dose vitamin C, the persistence of this phenomenon for 6 days after the discontinuation of the therapy is a distinguishing feature.

The most effective method for precaution of this virus as suggested by WHO is use of PPEs (triple layered face mask, body suits) and social distancing. However, the frontline doctors and medical staff have high risk of exposure to the virus during treatments and removal and discarding of the PPEs. Also the PPEs are of the onetime use and wearing these PPEs in hot and humid seasons is very uncomfortable.

RESULTS Overall, 1381 participants (mean baseline SBP/DBP: 156.5/99.6 mmHg) were randomized. Both N and C contributed independently to SBP/DBP reductions [P < 0.0001 (RSM)]. A positive dose-response was observed, with all combinations providing statistically better blood pressure (BP) reductions from baseline versus respective monotherapies (P < 0.05) and N60C32 achieving the greatest reduction [-23.8/-16.5 mmHg; P < 0.01 versus placebo (-5.3/-6.7 mmHg) and component monotherapies]. Even very low-dose (N20 and C4) therapy provided significant BP-lowering, and combination therapy was similarly effective in different racial groups. N/C combination demonstrated a lower incidence of vasodilatory adverse events than N monotherapy (18.3 versus 23.6%), including headache (5.5 versus 11.0%; P = 0.003, chi-square test) and peripheral oedema over time (3.6 versus 5.8%; n.s.). CONCLUSION N/C combination was effective in participants with hypertension and showed an improved side effect profile compared with N monotherapy.","output":"Nifedipine plus candesartan combination increases blood pressure control regardless of race and improves the side effect profile: DISTINCT randomized trial results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inspired by Fiset-Laniel et al.s (2020) article entitled Public health investments: neglect or wilful omission? Historical trends in Quebec and implications for Canada, we assessed public health investments since the establishment of the Nova Scotia provincial health authority in 2015. We analyzed Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness budgets from 2015?2016 to 2019C2020 and observed that less than 1% of funding was budgeted for public health annually, an amount well below the recommendation that 5C6% of healthcare funding be spent on public health. Healthcare spending has increased annually since 2015C2016, but proportions of funding to different programs and services have remained static. Specifically, we did not observe a change in investment in public health over time, suggesting that while the government does not necessarily spend too much or too little on healthcare, it spends far too little on public health. This chronic under-funding is problematic given the high rates of non-communicable diseases in Nova Scotia and health inequities experienced within the population. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of public health work, and the need for a pandemic recovery plan that prioritizes investment in all areas of public health in Nova Scotia.","output":"Fare well to Nova Scotia?

To understand the impact of COVID-19 on public health, many studies have been conducted for various countries. To complement the available work, in this article we examine Canadian COVID-19 data for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020 with the aim to forecast the dynamic trend in a short term. METHOD: We focus our attention on Canadian data and analyze the four provinces, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, which have the most severe situations in Canada. To build predictive models and conduct prediction, we employ three models, smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models, neural network (NN) models, and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models, to fit time series data of confirmed cases in the four provinces separately. In comparison, we also analyze the data of daily infections in two states of USA, Texas and New York state, for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020. We emphasize that different models make different assumptions which are basically difficult to validate. Yet invoking different models allows us to examine the data from different angles, thus, helping reveal the underlying trajectory of the development of COVID-19 in Canada. FINDING: The examinations of the data dated from March 18, 2020 to August 11, 2020 show that the STAR, NN, and SIR models may output different results, though the differences are small in some cases. Prediction over a short term period incurs smaller prediction variability than over a long term period, as expected. The NN method tends to outperform other two methods. All the methods forecast an upward trend in all the four Canadian provinces for the period of August 12, 2020 to August 23, 2020, though the degree varies from method to method.

Child maltreatment has not been assessed in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We examined the prevalence of child maltreatment and determined their impact on disease severity in patients with PAH. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational multicenter study at two PH centers in Germany was conducted. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PAH were given a self-administered questionnaire. Child maltreatment using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), quality of life (QoL), anxiety, depression, and lifestyle factors were assessed and enhanced by clinical parameters 6-min walk distance (6MWD), WHO functional class (WHO FC), and serum levels of N-terminal fragment of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Prevalence rates of child maltreatment were compared to the general population and impact of child maltreatment on disease severity was calculated by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Two-hundred and seventeen patients, 71% female and a median age of 56 years were enrolled in this study. Patients with PAH had higher rates of emotional abuse and lower rates of physical neglect compared to the German population while rates of emotional neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse did not differ between patients and German population. Patients with any form of child maltreatment were more likely to be active smokers, had a worse QoL and more anxiety or depression. Moderate associations between child maltreatment, mental health, QoL, lifestyle factors and clinical parameters could be observed. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant impact of CTQ-total score on disease severity with an OR of 1.022 (95%-CI: 1.001C1.042, p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: We found a higher rate of child maltreatment in patients with PAH in comparison to the German population. Correlations suggest moderate associations between CTQ-scores and mental health as well as QoL. Child maltreatment had significant impact on disease severity. However, effects were moderate. We conclude that child maltreatment has effects on mental health and quality of life in patients with PAH and may have limited effect on disease severity.","output":"Childhood Trauma in Patients With PAHPrevalence, Impact on QoL, and Mental HealthA Preliminary Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of sample pooling compared to the individual analysis for the diagnosis of COVID-19, by using different commercial platforms for nucleic acid extraction and amplification. METHODS: 3519 nasopharyngeal samples received at 9 Spanish clinical microbiology laboratories were processed individually and in pools (342 pools of 10 samples and 11 pools of 9 samples) according to the existing methodology in each of the centres. RESULTS: We found that 253 pools (2519 samples) were negative, and 99 pools (990 samples) were positive; with 241 positive samples (6.85%), our pooling strategy would have saved 2167 PCR tests. For 29 pools (made out of 290 samples) we found discordant results when compared to their correspondent individual samples: in 22/29 pools (28 samples), minor discordances were found; for seven pools (7 samples), we found major discordances. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for pooling were 97.10% (CI95%; 94.11-98.82), 100%, 100% and 99.79% (CI95%; 99.56-99.90) respectively; accuracy was 99.80% (CI95%; 99.59-99.92) and kappa concordant coefficient was 0.984.

Accordingly, the global economy as well is facing the worst economic catastrophe since the 1930s Great Depression. The case in Egypt is similar to the rest of the world. Despite being threatened by GDP decline and income losses; the Egyptian government has reacted early to restrain the pandemic outbreak. By mid-March, many measures had been undertaken to contain the spread of the virus. More than three months after imposing them, Egypt began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Predictions of the potential spread of Covid-19 based on time series Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and econometric Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) forecasting models are utilized in this paper for designing and/or evaluating countermeasures. The aim of this study is threefold, first using the most recent available data to find the best prediction models for daily cases and death in Egypt and forecast them up to 7 November 2020. Second, to analyze the effect of mobility on the incidence of the pandemic using Google Community Mobility Reports (GCMR) to evaluate the results of easing lockdown restrictions. Finally, providing some recommendations that may help lessen the spread of the virus and eradicate new deaths as possible. The results revealed that mobility of population is affecting the incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly over the period of the study. Additionally, the total number of infections on November 7 2020 is expected to reach 102,352 cases, while the total death toll is predicted to be 5,938 according to the most accurate methods of forecasting. Accordingly, in order to sustain the predicted flat pandemic curve, many restrictions must be continued and emergency mechanisms need to be considered. For instance, adhering to the precautions of social distancing advised by the health minister and the declared hygiene rules to ensure that infection is prevented or transmitted is necessary.

The need to accommodate growing numbers of hospitalized patients has led facilities in affected areas to suspend anew or curtail normal hospital activities, including elective surgery, even as earlier-affected areas normalized surgical services. Backlogged surgical cases now number in the tens of millions globally. Facilities will be hard-pressed to address these backlogs, even absent the recrudescence of COVID-19. This document provides guidance for the safe and effective resumption of surgical services as circumstances permit. Methods: Review and synthesis of pertinent international peer-reviewed literature, with integration of expert opinion. Results: The \\"second-wave\\" of serious infections is placing the healthcare system under renewed stress.

However, recently virus variants have emerged that can evade the immunity in a host achieved through vaccination. Consequently, new therapeutic agents that can efficiently prevent infection from these new variants, and hence COVID-19 spread are urgently required. To achieve this, extensive characterization of virus-host cell interactions to identify effective therapeutic targets is warranted. Here, we report a cell surface entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 that exists in a cell type-dependent manner is TMPRSS2-independent but sensitive to various broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitors such as marimastat and prinomastat. Experiments with selective metalloproteinase inhibitors and gene-specific siRNAs revealed that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) is partially involved in the metalloproteinase pathway. Consistent with our finding that the pathway is unique to SARS-CoV-2 among highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, both the furin cleavage motif in the S1/S2 boundary and the S2 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are essential for metalloproteinase-dependent entry. In contrast, the two elements of SARS-CoV-2 independently contributed to TMPRSS2-dependent S2 priming. The metalloproteinase pathway is involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation and cytopathicity, leading us to theorize that it is also involved in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Thus, targeting the metalloproteinase pathway in addition to the TMPRSS2 and endosome pathways could be an effective strategy by which to cure COVID-19 in the future. Author SummaryTo develop effective therapeutics against COVID-19, it is necessary to elucidate in detail the infection mechanism of the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, including recently emerging variants. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the cell surface receptor ACE2 via the Spike protein, and then the Spike protein is cleaved by host proteases to enable entry. Selection of target cells by expression of these tissue-specific proteases contributes to pathogenesis. Here, we found that the metalloproteinase-mediated pathway is important for SARS-CoV-2 infection, variants included. This pathway requires both the prior cleavage of Spike into two domains and a specific sequence in the second domain S2, conditions met by SARS-CoV-2 but lacking in the related human coronavirus SARS-CoV. The contribution of several proteases, including metalloproteinases, to SARS-CoV-2 infection was cell type dependent, especially in cells derived from kidney, ovary, and endometrium, in which SARS-CoV-2 infection was metalloproteinase-dependent. In these cells, inhibition of metalloproteinases by treatment with marimastat or prinomastat, whose safety was previously confirmed in clinical trials, was important in preventing cell death. Our study provides new insights into the complex pathogenesis unique to COVID-19 and relevant to the development of effective therapies.","output":"Metalloproteinase-dependent and TMPRSS2-independnt cell surface entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 requires the furin-cleavage site and the S2 domain of spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 152 million individuals globally.

METHODS: Following an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in November 2020, a COVID-19 Response Team evaluated the epidemiological data to identify transmission dynamics and develop enhanced protocols to prevent transmission. During the subsequent 18-week study period, incident cases were investigated to identify the likely transmission source; testing, quarantine and isolation recommendations were provided to families in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. RESULTS: Simple but stringent protocols were implemented among 148 youth ice hockey players ages 6C18. Players were required to arrive at the rink in full gear; locker rooms were closed, building entry was limited to one parent per player, and masks were required at all times except for players on the ice. Following implementation of the enhanced protocols, more than 500 practices and games were completed with at least 15 858 athlete-hours of exposure and no within-programme COVID-19 transmission was detected despite high community incidence and sporadic household exposures. CONCLUSION: This study suggests indoor youth sports can operate safely with appropriate protocols in place, even within communities of high COVID-19 transmission, even when athletes are not yet vaccinated or wearing masks during play. Transmission appears to be more likely in congested indoor areas involving adults than on the ice during play. Protocols should be developed in collaboration with programme participants.

Here different symptoms of neurological and/or cardiological origin have been reported. With symptoms, which are very similar to the ones reported but are not caused by SARS-CoV-2, the occurrence of functionally active autoantibodies ((f)AABs) targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR-(f)AABs) has been discussed to be involved. We, therefore investigated, whether GPCR-(f)AABs are detectable in 31 patients suffering from different Long-COVID-19 symptoms after recovery from the acute phase of the disease. The spectrum of symptoms was mostly of neurological origin (29/31 patients), including post-COVID-19 fatigue, alopecia, attention deficit, tremor and others. Combined neurological and cardiovascular disorders were reported in 17 of the 31 patients. Two recovered COVID-19 patients were free of follow-up symptoms. All 31 former COVID-19 patients had between 2 and 7 different GPCR-(f)AABs that acted as receptor agonists. Some of those GPCR-(f)AABs activate their target receptors which cause a positive chronotropic effect in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the read-out in the test system for their detection (bioassay for GPCR-(f)AAB detection).

The COVID-19 pandemic, together with the applied multi-level restrictive measures, has generated a unique combination of an unpredictable and stressful biomedical and socioeconomic environment (i.e., syndemic),2 introducing real-life threat, involuntary and drastic every-day life-style changes with uncertain financial and future prospects, alongside with minimized coping and stress management possibilities.3 This combination of so many different and vital stressors may lead to acute as well as long-term, direct, indirect and even transgenerational unfavourable effects on physical and mental health and functioning, which might even represent the most precarious and still unpredictable public-health-related part of the pandemic.4 Thereby, specific population groups could be at particular risk of poor health outcomes in relation to applied public health measures.4, 5 However, not every individual will experience the same level of negative impact on health and well-being during the pandemic, as several additional national, socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, emotional and cognitive factors can moderate individual resilience and coping.6 Pandemic-related research should, thus, assess as many multidimensional risk and protective factors as possible in a longitudinal, large-scale and multi-national manner, enabling a profound and comprehensive understanding of the complex health and societal impact of the pandemic worldwide.7 Nevertheless, to date, most research findings are cross-sectional, report on small and non- representative samples from individual countries, or on specific population groups (e.g., health care workers, students, clinical populations) and usually assess only a very restricted set of outcomes and time-points. Thereby, only few studies assess coping strategies, medical history or detailed socioeconomic, demographic and environmental data. In addition, most studies leave behind linguistic differences, being available in one or at best two different languages. Such investigations of small outcome subsets within a narrow framework preclude a broader and clear understanding of the multifaceted pandemic impact on the general population and specific subgroups. Acknowledging these gaps in the existing literature, large- scale, collaborative research prospectively collecting and monitoring a broad range of real- time, multi-dimensional health-related, societal and behavioural outcome data from countries across the globe is currently explicitly needed. The Collaborative Outcomes study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times (COH- FIT) envisions to fill this gap. Based on an easy-to-access webpage (www.coh-fit.com), COH- FIT is the currently largest-scale known international collaborative study of over 200 researchers around the globe, prospectively collecting the biggest set of multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary data from 150 high, middle, and low-income countries in over 30 languages and in three different age groups (adults, adolescents, children) of the general population, focusing also on relevant at-risk subgroups. Albeit being a cross-sectional anonymous survey on an individual level, it is a longitudinal study on a population level, as data are collected continuously since April 2020 and until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic. In addition to snowball recruitment, this project also collects information from nationally representative samples. Furthermore, COH-FIT is the first study of this scale investigating pandemic effects on health and functioning measures between family members, while it also specifically assesses a large list of behavioral and coping factors (e.g., screen time, social media usage, physical activity, social interaction, religious practices, etc.) on outcomes of interest. COH-FIT also monitors changes in public health restrictive measures to enhance data harmonization across nations and time, and to better investigate their impact on physical and mental health, while it also collects information on changes in healthcare systems functioning. The COH-FIT project was worldwide first initiated in Greece after the ethics committee approval of the School of Medicine of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and is officially supported by the Hellenic Psychiatric Association, European Psychiatric Association, World Association of Social Psychiatry, ECNP Network on the Prevention of Mental Disorders and Mental Health Promotion, among many other national and international scientific associations. To date, COH-FIT has already collected >115,000 participations worldwide (>8,000 in Greece), but more participants are still needed, both during the second and third wave of the pandemic, as in the future, after the pandemic has ended. Currently, the COH-FIT survey actively collects the largest sample on multifactorial data on the impact of the COVD-19 pandemic on health and functioning not only in Greece, but around the globe. The elaborated design of COH-FIT and similar studies may allow a better identification of key parameters and population groups at increased risk during the pandemic, as well as potential targets for acute and long-term prevention or intervention strategies in the current as in possible future pandemics.

Methods We retrospectively enrolled 85 and 41 patients with COVID-19 in primary and validation cohorts, respectively. A predictive nomogram based on risk factors for severe COVID-19 was constructed using the primary cohort and evaluated internally and externally. Additionally, in the validation cohort, immunological features in patients with severe COVID-19 were analyzed and correlated with disease outcomes. Results The risk prediction nomogram incorporating age, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer for early identification of severe COVID-19 patients showed favorable discrimination in both the primary (AUC 0.807) and validation cohorts (AUC 0.902) and was well calibrated. Patients who died from COVID-19 showed lower abundance of peripheral CD45RO+CD3+ T cells and natural killer cells, but higher neutrophil counts than that in the patients who recovered (P=0.001, P=0.009, and P=0.009, respectively). Moreover, the abundance of CD45RO+CD3+ T cells, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and neutrophil-to-natural killer cell ratio were strong indicators of death in severe COVID-19 patients (AUC 0.933 for all three).

Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of SAEW disinfection followed by CS coating treatment at improving the internal quality of eggs during 6 weeks of storage at 25C. RESULTS Scanning electron microscopy revealed that SAEW-treated eggs had deeper and wider cracks than control eggs stored between 0 d and 21 d. Moreover, the depth and width of the cracks in the uncoated eggs increased as storage time increased. However, the CS coating method was successfully used on SAEW-disinfected eggs to construct a barrier against the negative effects of shell damage.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of EP as a treatment for PDCoV in vivo and elucidate the possible mechanisms. Seven-day-old piglets were infected with PDCoV by oral administration in the presence or absence of EP. Piglets infected with PDCoV were most affected, whereas administration of EP reduced diarrhea incidence, alleviated intestinal lesion, and decreased viral load in feces and tissues. EP reduced PDCoV-induced apoptosis and enhanced tight junction protein expressions in the small intestine, maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier. EP showed immunomodulatory effect by suppressing PDCoV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of IB and NF-B p65, and upregulating IFN-I expression. Knockdown of p38 inhibited PDCoV replication and alleviated PDCoV-induced apoptosis, implying that EP inhibited PDCoV replication and alleviated PDCoV-induced apoptosis via p38/MAPK signaling pathway.

METHODS: All orthopedic surgery patients who partici-pated in telehealth from March 30 to April 30, 2020, were sent a 14-question survey via e-mail. Orthopedic surgeons who used telehealth were sent a separate 14-question survey at the end of the study period. Factors influencing patient satisfaction were determined using univariate proportional odds and multivariate partial proportional odds models. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-two patients and 33 surgeons completed the surveys. On average, patients were \\"satisfied\\" with telehealth (4.25/5.00  0.96), and 37.0% preferred future visits to be conducted using telehealth. Multivariate partial proportional odds modeling determined that patients who found it easiest to arrange the telehealth visit had greater satisfaction (5.00/5.00 vs. 1.00-3.00/5.00: OR = 3.058; 95% CI = 1.621 to 5.768, p < 0.001), as did patients who believed they were able to communicate most effectively (5.00/5.00 vs. 1.00-4.00/5.00: OR = 20.268; 95% CI = 5.033 to 81.631, p < 0.001).

METHODS: This study involves 462 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital from January 11, 2020 to April 26, 2020. A total of 457 patients underwent thin-section chest CT scans during the hospitalization or after discharge to identify the pulmonary lesion. A total of 287 patients were followed up from 90 to 150 days after the onset of the disease, and lung function tests were conducted about three months after the onset. The risk factors affecting the persistence of pulmonary fibrosis were identified through regression analysis and the prediction model of the persistence of pulmonary fibrosis was established. RESULTS: Parenchymal bands, irregular interfaces, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis were the most common CT features in all COVID-19 patients. During the 0C30, 31C60, 61C90, 91C120 and > 120 days after onset, 86.87%, 74.40%, 79.56%, 68.12% and 62.03% patients developed with pulmonary fibrosis and 4.53%, 19.61%, 18.02%, 38.30% and 48.98% patients reversed pulmonary fibrosis, respectively. It was observed that Age, BMI, Fever, and Highest PCT were predictive factors for sustaining fibrosis even after 90 days from onset. A predictive model of the persistence with pulmonary fibrosis was developed based-on the Logistic Regression method with an accuracy, PPV, NPV, Sensitivity and Specificity of the model of 76%, 71%, 79%, 67%, and 82%, respectively. More than half of the COVID-19 patients revealed abnormal conditions in lung function after 90 days from onset, and the ratio of abnormal lung function did not differ on a statistically significant level between the fibrotic and non-fibrotic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent pulmonary fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with older age, higher BMI, severe/critical condition, fever, a longer viral clearance time, pre-existing disease and delayed hospitalization. Fibrosis developed in COVID-19 patients could be reversed in about a third of the patients after 120 days from onset.

In airway epithelial cells (AECs) from children and older adults we compared IFN I/III responses to SARS-CoV-2 and HRV-16, and assessed whether pre-infection with HRV-16, or pretreatment with recombinant IFN- or IFN-, modified SARS-CoV-2 replication. Bronchial AECs from children (ages 6C18 years) and older adults (ages 60C75 years) were differentiated ex vivo to generate organotypic cultures. In a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility, cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or HRV-16, and RNA and protein was harvested from cell lysates 96 h. following infection and supernatant was collected 48 and 96 h. following infection. In additional experiments cultures were pre-infected with HRV-16, or pre-treated with recombinant IFN-1 or IFN-2 before SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a subset of experiments a range of infectious concentrations of HRV-16, SARS-CoV-2 WA-01, SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant were studied. Despite significant between-donor heterogeneity SARS-CoV-2 replicated 100 times more efficiently than HRV-16. IFNB1, INFL2, and CXCL10 gene expression and protein production following HRV-16 infection was significantly greater than following SARS-CoV-2. IFN gene expression and protein production were inversely correlated with SARS-CoV-2 replication. Treatment of cultures with recombinant IFN1 or IFN2, or pre-infection of cultures with HRV-16, markedly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to marked between-donor heterogeneity in IFN responses and viral replication, SARS-CoV-2 (WA-01, Delta, and Omicron variants) elicits a less robust IFN response in primary AEC cultures than does rhinovirus, and heterologous rhinovirus infection, or treatment with recombinant IFN-1 or IFN-2, reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication, although to a lesser degree for the Delta and Omicron variants.","output":"Airway epithelial interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 is inferior to rhinovirus and heterologous rhinovirus infection suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Despite the National Plan for the Elimination of Measles and congenital Rubella (NPEMcR), in 2017, a measles outbreak occurred in Italy, due to sub-optimal vaccination coverage (<95%) for many years.

The virus may bind to corneal and conjunctival angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and potentially to the lipophilic periocular skin and superficial tear film with downstream carriage into the nasopharynx and subsequent access to the lungs and gut. Adenoviruses and influenza viruses share this ocular tropism and despite differing ocular and systemic manifestations and disease patterns, common lessons, particularly in management, emerge. Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists at particular risk of exposure to high viral loads (and poor prognosis) and as for adenoviral epidemics, this may be a setting for disease transmission. Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering. This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration. A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.","output":"The eye as the discrete but defensible portal of coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pot experiments were conducted to evaluate plant contribution during remediation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)-contaminated soil of Dagang Oilfield by Fire Phoenix (a mixture of Festuca L.). The results showed that Fire Phoenix could grow in soil contaminated by high and low concentrations of PAHs. After being planted for 150 days, the total removal rate of six PAHs in the high and low PAH concentrations was 80.36% and 79.79%, significantly higher than the 58.79% and 53.29% of the unplanted control group, respectively. Thus, Fire Phoenix can effectively repair the soil contaminated by different concentrations of PAHs. In high concentrations of PAHs, the results indicated a positive linear relationship between PAH absorption in tissues of Fire Phoenix and the growth time in the early stage. In contrast, the contents of PAHs were just slightly increased in the late period of plant growth. The main factor for the dissipation of PAHs was plant-promoted biodegradation (99.04%-99.93%), suggesting a low contribution of PAH uptake and transformation (0.07%-0.96%). The results revealed that Fire Phoenix did not remove the PAHs in the soil by accumulation but promoted PAH dissipation in the soil by stimulating the microbial metabolism in the rhizosphere.","output":"Plant contribution to the remediation of PAH-contaminated soil of Dagang Oilfield by Fire Phoenix"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We reviewed the background information and previous clinical studies that considered the use of allogeneic amniotic tissue and fluid (granulized amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid) in the treatment of chronic diabetic foot wounds.

Developed to fill soft tissue defects and bone voids and to convey antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory capabilities, granulized amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid does not require fetal death, because its procurement is performed with maternal consent during birth.

Softening reduces hardness, but changes also the overall mineral composition of the water, depending on the technology. A broad spectrum of effects from softening has to be considered in relation to e.g. health and corrosion when selecting softening technology and design, otherwise adverse effects may be overlooked in the attempt to increase consumer convenience. We here provided a framework for evaluating softening technologies using water quality indicators for lime scaling, soap use, corrosion, human health, taste and removal of contaminants. None of the evaluated softening technologies scored positive on all the included water quality indicators. Precipitation technologies (lime/soda-ash softening and pellet softening) reduce the predicted copper and lead release, but negatively affect stainless steel corrosion expressed by the Larson Ratio. Pellet softening does not remove magnesium, which may limit the achievable softening depth, but maintains a protective effect against cardio-vascular diseases. Strong-acid cation exchange is not expected to affect the included corrosion indicators, whereas the effects from membrane separation (nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) and weak-acid cation exchange depend on the specific source water and process design. All the evaluated technologies reduce hardness, calcium carbonate precipitation potential (CCPP) and atopic eczema, but have potential adverse effects on dental carries (expressed by DMF-S). Our framework provides a better understanding of softening and can prepare water utility planners and managers for better decisions that balance the positive and adverse effects from drinking water softening.","output":"Evaluation and comparison of centralized drinking water softening technologies: Effects on water quality indicators."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dementia is a leading cause of disability and dependency in older people worldwide.

We had previously published the results of a survey to the affected patients from 6 institutions. We now present the results of a larger distribution of this survey, through May and June 2020, to electively scheduled patients representing different regions of the United States. Methods: Fifteen centers identified through the AAHKS Research Committee participated in a survey study of THA and TKA patients. Patients scheduled for primary elective THA or TKA but canceled due to the COVID-19 elective surgery stoppage (3/2020-5/2020) were included in the study. Descriptive statistics along with subgroup analysis with Wilcoxon rank were performed. Results: In total, surveys were distributed to 2135 patients and completed by 848 patients (40%) from 15 institutions. Most patients (728/848, 86%) had their surgery postponed or canceled by the surgeon or hospital. Unknown length of surgical delay remained the highest source of anxiety among survey participants. Male patients were more likely to be willing to proceed with surgery in spite of COVID-19. There were minimal regional differences in responses. Only 61 patients (7%) stated they will continue to delay surgery for fear of contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital. Conclusion: Similar to the previous study, the most anxiety-provoking thought was the uncertainty over if and when the canceled joint replacement surgery could be rescheduled.

During this period of crisis, the World Health Organization (WHO) reminds all countries and communities that the spread of this virus can be significantly slowed or even reversed through the implementation of robust containment and control measures. The WHO has also asked the public to be careful while reading and spreading health recommendations from untrustworthy online sources of information. Myths and misbeliefs about the prevention and spread of COVID-19 not only create global panic but also pose risks to people's lives and public health in general. Rampant misinformation on the disease slows down the efforts of public health bodies to contain the outbreak. Therefore, the role of public health bodies in communicating the right message and in the right form to the public is crucial. In our study, we aim to assess the effectiveness of communication strategies used by international and national public health authorities to inform the public on COVID-19 risks and prevention. In particular, we conduct a survey experiment on a large sample (N = 4000) of adults from seven European countries to test the efficacy of public health messages in a form of prevention and corrective information provision. The study seeks to investigate how people's risk perceptions and behaviors change subject to the preventive information provision or treatment with the information countering widely spread misperceptions about the COVID-19 as compared to the control group. The findings of this research will be relevant for policymakers and public health professionals in the development of effective communication strategies during disease outbreaks.

Ocular motility, ocular alignment at distance (6 m) and near (33 cm) by prism alternating cover test and stereoacuity were assessed in all patients before and after surgery. RESULTS A total of five patients (four males and one female; three with right eye and two with left eye congenital dysplasia) were included in this review. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 42y (2113.4y). The main clinical findings were hypertropia and exotropia of the affected eye, along with motility limitations in adduction and depression. Lateral rectus (LR) recession/transposition combined with IR resection was performed in one case. Two scheduled surgeries were performed in four cases, with one involving superior rectus recession and IR resection and the others LR recession and MR resection.

Optimizing initial triage of patients could help decrease adverse health impacts of the disease through better clinical management. At least 6 CT severity score (CTSS) systems have been proposed. We aimed to evaluate triage and prognostication performance of seven different CTSSs, including one proposed by ourselves, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients diagnosed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: After exclusion of 14 heart failure and significant preexisting pulmonary disease patients, 96 COVID-19, PCR-positive patients were included into our retrospective study, admitted from February 20, 2020, to July 22. Their mean age was 63.6  17.4 years (range 21C88, median 67). Fifty-seven (59.4%) were men, and 39 (40.6%) were women. All CTSSs showed good interrater reliability as calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between two radiologists were 0.764C0.837. Those CTSSs with more numerous segmentations showed the best ICCs. As judged by area under curve (AUC) for each receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, only three CTSSs showed acceptable AUCs (AUC = 0.7) for triage of severe/critical patients. All CTSSs showed acceptable AUCs for prognostication (AUCs = 0.76C0.79). Calculated AUCs for different CTSSs were not significantly different for triage and for prediction of severe/critical disease, but some difference was shown for prediction of critical disease. CONCLUSIONS: Men are probably affected more frequently than women by COVID-19. Quantification of lung disease in COVID-19 is a readily available and easy tool to be used in triage and prognostication, but we do not advocate its use in heart failure or chronic respiratory disease patients. The scoring systems with more numerous segmentations are recommended if any future imaging for comparison is contemplated. CTSS performance in triage was much lower than earlier reports, and only three CTSSs showed acceptable AUCs in this regard. CTSS performed better for prognostic purposes than for triage as all 7 CTSSs showed acceptable AUCs in both types of prognostic ROC curves.

We retrospectively reviewed the consent forms of patients scheduled for conventional cholecystecomy but instead undergoing STC between 2011 and 2017. Consent quality was measured as the percentage of components completed. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, setting (elective/nonelective), operation mode (open/laparoscopic), or the responsible surgeon affected consent quality. Results: Across 174 patients, just 9 (5.2%) had been informed about the possibility of undergoing STC, whereas the overall quality of consent was 37.5%.

A clear advantage of magnetic supports is their easy separation due to the magnetic attraction between magnetic NPs and an external magnetic field, facilitating the biocatalyst reuse. This allows for savings of materials and energy in the biocatalytic process. Commonly, magnetic NPs are isolated from enzymes either by polymers, silica, or some other protective layer. However, in those cases when iron oxide NPs are in close proximity to the enzyme, the biocatalyst may display a fascinating behavior, allowing for synergy of the performance due to the enzyme-like properties shown in iron oxides. Another important parameter which is discussed in this review is the magnetic support porosity, especially in hierarchical porous supports. In the case of comparatively large pores, which can freely accommodate enzyme molecules without jeopardizing their conformation, the enzyme surface ordering may create an optimal crowding on the support, enhancing the biocatalytic performance. Other factors such as surface-modifying agents or special enzyme reactor designs can be also influential in the performance of magnetic NP based immobilized enzymes.","output":"Magnetic Nanoparticle-Containing Supports as Carriers of Immobilized Enzymes: Key Factors Influencing the Biocatalyst Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction India has been under four phases of a national lockdown from March 25 to May 31 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic Unmasking the state-wise variation in the effect of the nationwide lockdown on the progression of the pandemic could inform dynamic policy interventions towards containment and mitigation Methods Using data on confirmed COVID-19 cases across 20 states that accounted for more than 99% of the cumulative case counts in India till May 31, 2020, we illustrate the masking of state-level trends and highlight the variations across states by presenting evaluative evidence on some aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak: case-fatality rates, doubling times of cases, effective reproduction numbers, and the scale of testing Results The estimated effective reproduction number R for India was 3 36 (95% confidence interval (CI): [3 03, 3 71]) on March 24, whereas the average of estimates from May 25 - May 31 stands at 1 27 (95% CI: [1 26, 1 28]) Similarly, the estimated doubling time across India was at 3 56 days on March 24, and the past 7-day average for the same on May 31 is 14 37 days The average daily number of tests have increased from 1,717 (March 19-25) to 131,772 (May 25-31) with an estimated testing shortfall of 4 58 million tests nationally by May 31 However, various states exhibit substantial departures from these national patterns Conclusions Patterns of change over lockdown periods indicate the lockdown has been effective in slowing the spread of the virus nationally The COVID-19 outbreak in India displays large state-level variations and identifying these variations can help in both understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and formulating effective public health interventions Our framework offers a holistic assessment of the pandemic across Indian states and union territories along with a set of interactive visualization tools that are daily updated at covind19 org","output":"A Comprehensive Public Health Evaluation of Lockdown as a Non-pharmaceutical Intervention on COVID-19 Spread in India: National Trends Masking State Level Variations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisation in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease (IRD); in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with specific DMARDs; and the incidence of severe COVID-19 infection among hospitalised patients with RA. METHODS: A nationwide cohort study from Denmark between 1 March to 12 August 2020. The adjusted incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisation was estimated for patients with RA; spondyloarthritis including psoriatic arthritis; connective tissue disease; vasculitides; and non-IRD individuals.Further, the incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisation was estimated for patients with RA treated respectively non-treated with TNF-inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine, or glucocorticoids.Lastly, the incidence of severe COVID-19 infection (intensive care, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death) among hospital-admitted patients was estimated for RA and non-IRD individudals. RESULTS: Patients with IRD (n = 58,052) had an increased partially adjusted incidence of hospitalisation with COVID-19 compared with the 4.5 million people in the general population (HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.15 to 1.86) with strongest associations for patients with RA (n = 29,440, HR 1.72, 95%CI 1.29 to 2.30) and vasculitides (n = 4072, HR 1.82, 95%CI 0.91 to 3.64). There was no increased incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisation associated with TNF-inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine nor glucocorticoid use. COVID-19 admitted patients with RA had a HR of 1.43 (95% CI 0.80 to 2.53) for a severe outcome. CONCLUSION: Patients with IRD were more likely to be admitted with COVID-19 than the general population, and COVID-19 admitted patients with RA could be at higher risk of a severe outcome.

Sociodemographic (including age, sex, Index of Multiple Deprivation, ethnicity coded as White/non-White) and clinical variables were described. The primary outcome was timing of referral to palliative care. Associations between ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation with the primary outcome were explored using multivariable regression. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Patients with COVID-19 referred to a hospital palliative care service across two London hospitals February-May 2020. RESULTS A total of 334 patients were included. 119 (36%) were from a non-White ethnic group; most commonly Black British (77, 23%) and Asian British (26, 8%).

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multi-center, observational study of consecutive hospitalized adults in the NYC metropolitan area with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of new neurologic disorders (as diagnosed by a neurologist) was recorded and in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition were compared between COVID-19 patients with and without neurologic disorders. RESULTS: Of 4,491 COVID-19 patients hospitalized during the study timeframe, 606 (13.5%) developed a new neurologic disorder in a median of 2 days from COVID-19 symptom onset. The most common diagnoses were: toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (6.8%), seizure (1.6%), stroke (1.9%), and hypoxic/ischemic injury (1.4%). No patient had meningitis/encephalitis, or myelopathy/myelitis referable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18/18 CSF specimens were RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with neurologic disorders were more often older, male, white, hypertensive, diabetic, intubated, and had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (all P<0.05).

Although stimulated by physiological hypoxia, pulmonary hypoxic patients usually develop anemia, which may ultimately complicate the outcome. To characterize this non-adaptive response, we dissected the interplay among the redox state, iron regulation, and inflammation in patients challenged by either acute (ARDS and COVID-19) or chronic (COPD) hypoxia. To this purpose, we evaluated a panel of redox state biomarkers that may integrate the routine iron metabolism assays to monitor the patients inflammatory and oxidative state. We measured redox and hematopoietic regulators in 20 ARDS patients, 20 ambulatory COPD patients, 9 COVID-19 ARDS-like patients, and 10 age-matched non-hypoxic healthy volunteers (controls). All the examined pathological conditions induced hypoxia, with ARDS and COVID-19 depressing the hematopoietic response without remarkable effects on erythropoietin. Free iron was higher than the controls in all patients, with higher levels of hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor in ARDS and COVID-19. All markers of the redox state and antioxidant barrier were overexpressed in ARDS and COVID-19. However, glutathionyl hemoglobin, a candidate marker for the redox imbalance, was especially low in ARDS, despite depressed levels of glutathione being present in all patients. Although iron regulation was dysfunctional in all groups, the depressed antioxidant barrier in ARDS, and to a lesser extent in COVID-19, might induce greater inflammatory responses with consequent anemia.","output":"Differential Redox State and Iron Regulation in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To inform the field of rehabilitation psychology about the impacts of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on the disability community in the United States and the additional sources of stress and trauma disabled people face during these times.

There is increasing evidence that a combination of inflammation and hypercoagulable state are the main mechanisms of respiratory failure in these patients. This narrative review aims to summarize currently available evidence on the complex interplay of immune dysregulation, hypercoagulability, and thrombosis in the pathogenesis of respiratory failure in COVID-19 disease. In addition, we will describe the experience of anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory strategies that have been tested. Profound suppression of the adaptive and hyperactivity of innate immune systems with macrophage activation appears to be a prominent feature in this infection. Immune dysregulation together with endotheliitis and severe hypercoagulability results in thromboinflammation and microvascular thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature leading to severe respiratory distress. Currently, some guidelines recommend the use of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, with intermediate dose prophylaxis in those needing intensive care, and the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with proven or suspected thrombosis. Strong recommendations cannot be made until this approach is validated by trial results. To target the inflammatory cascade, low-dose dexamethasone appears to be helpful in moderate to severe cases and trials with anti-interleukin agents (e.g., tocilizumab, anakinra, siltuximab) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are showing early promising results. Potential newer agents (e.g., Janus kinase inhibitor such as ruxolitinib, baricitinib, fedratinib) are likely to be investigated in clinical trials. Unfortunately, current trials are mostly examining these agents in isolation and there may be a significant delay before evidence-based practice can be implemented. It is plausible that a combination of anti-viral drugs together with anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulation medicines will be the most successful strategy in managing severely affected patients with COVID-19.","output":"The Interplay Between Coagulation and Inflammation Pathways in COVID-19-Associated Respiratory Failure: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent advances in molecular source tracking make answering questions from residents regarding their exposure to microbial contaminants from industrial hog operations (IHOs) possible. Associations between residential distance to IHOs and exposure can be addressed by measuring livestock-associated (Staphylococcus aureus) and pig-specific bacteria in the air, on household surfaces, and in participants' nasal and saliva swabs. OBJECTIVES: Here we assess the mechanics, feasibility, capacity-building, and lessons learned during a pilot study employing this novel technology in community-based participatory research of bacterial exposure and human health. METHODS: Together, our team of academics and community members designed a field- and laboratory-based pilot study. Air samples, surface and human swabs, and questionnaires from households at varying distances from IHOs were collected. Data were assessed for completeness and quality by two independent reviewers. These metrics were defined as: missingness (completeness), incorrect data type (validity), out of range (validity), and outliers (accuracy). LESSONS LEARNED: While critical field equipment was obtained, and knowledge exchange occurred, leading to an increased capacity for future work, after review, 38 of 49 households were deemed eligible for inclusion in the study. Of eligible participants, 98% of required electronic survey questions were complete and 100% were valid; an improvement over prior work which employed paper surveys.

METHODS A systematic search of the literature was conducted in June 2017 and repeated in December 2020. The systematic review included 13 studies. Analyses of pooled original data were based on the six studies providing data (n = 1594). No studies on forensic psychiatric conditions were eligible. Hours and weeks worked were analyzed using linear regression. Employment, and time to employment was analyzed using logistic regression, and cox-regression, respectively. RESULTS The effects on hours and weeks in employment after 18 months were comparable for participants with schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder but only statistically significant for participants with schizophrenia compared to services as usual (SAU) (EMD 109.1 h (95% CI 60.5-157.7), 6.1 weeks (95% CI 3.9-8.4)). The effect was also significant for participants with any drug use disorder (121.2 h (95% CI 23.6-218.7), 6.8 weeks (95% CI 1.8-11.8)). Participants with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and any drug use disorder had higher odds of being competitively employed (OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.6-2.7); 2.4 (95% CI 1.3-4.4); 3.0 (95% CI 1.5-5.8)) and returned to work faster than SAU (HR 2.1 (95% CI 1.6-2.6); 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-3.1); 3.0 (95% CI 1.6-5.7)).

Considering that older adults are at high risk for COVID-related medical complications and mortality, the present study focuses on the age-related differences on the adoption of protective behaviors during the initial stages of this outbreak, while accounting for the role of sociodemographic, COVID-related, perceived risk, and psychosocial variables (i.e., anxiety, optimism, fear of death, and social isolation) in this relation. The study sample included 1696 participants, aged between 18 and 85 years old, who completed an online survey during the initial stages of the first COVID-19 outbreak in Portugal. Overall, results reveal that the engagement in protective behaviors declines with advancing age and that older adults show a pattern toward lower perceived risk compared with middle-aged adults. Multicategorical mediation analyses show that anxiety, optimism, fear of death, and social isolation significantly mediate age effects on protective behaviors. Specifically, both anxiety and fear of death increase protective behaviors via higher perceived risk in the middle-aged and in the younger groups, respectively. Optimism directly predicts protective behaviors in the middle-aged groups, while social isolation reduces protective behaviors in the younger and older-aged groups.

First, we resolved not only the three main states in the catalytic cycle described before but also eight substates that portray structural and mechanistic changes occurring during a 360 catalytic cycle. Second, a mechanism of auto-inhibition of ATP hydrolysis involves not only the engagement of the C-terminal region of an -subunit in a loop in the -subunit, as proposed before, but also a fail-safe mechanism involving the b-subunit in the peripheral stalk that enhances engagement. A third unreported characteristic is that the fused b-subunit contains a duplicated domain in its N-terminal region where the two copies of the domain participate in similar modes of attachment of the two of three N-terminal regions of the -subunits. The auto-inhibitory plus the associated fail-safe mechanisms and the modes of attachment of the -subunits provide targets for development of innovative antitubercular drugs.

Additionally assessed the reliability of this score and its relationship to the occurrence of infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective comparative analysis included 126 high-risk CABG patients. The patients were randomly assigned into bone wax or vancomycin paste for sternal haemostasis. All patients were submitted to CT examinations 6-months postoperative. Two radiologists independently reviewed all CT scans to assess sternal healing using the 6-point CT score. The CT healing score of the two groups was compared. The kappa statistics were used to calculate the inter-reader agreement (IRA) of the 6-point CT score. RESULTS: The final analysis included 61 patients in each group. The main CT score for sternal healing was 3.90.4 in the vancomycin group and 3.30.8 in the bone wax group. Patients in the vancomycin group had a higher statistically significant improvement in CT healing score than those in the bone wax group (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant relationship (p = 0.79) between the occurrence of infection and the 6-point CT score in the vancomycin group. The overall IRA of the 6-point CT score was good in two groups ( = 0.79 in the vancomycin group and = 0.78 in the bone wax group).

Currently, no specific prophylactic and therapeutic treatment is available. No evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that a treatment may ameliorate the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 exists with the only exception of preliminary evidence from remdesivir trials. Here, we present evidence from the literature and a compelling hypothesis on the potential immunomodulatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant effects of iron chelators in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. Interestingly, iron chelation has been shown in vitro to suppress endothelial inflammation in viral infection, which is the main pathophysiologic mechanism behind systemic organ involvement induced by SARS-CoV-2, by inhibiting IL-6 synthesis through decreasing NF-kB. Iron chelators exhibit iron chelating, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, particularly against RNA viruses. These agents could attenuate ARDS and help control SARS-CoV-2 via multiple mechanisms including: 1) inhibition of viral replication; 2) decrease of iron availability; 3) upregulation of B cells; 4) improvement of the neutralizing anti-viral antibody titer; 5) inhibition of endothelial inflammation and 6) prevention of pulmonary fibrosis and lung decline via reduction of pulmonary iron accumulation. Both retrospective analyses of data in electronic health records, as well as proof of concept studies in humans and large RCTs are needed to fully elucidate the efficacy and safety of iron chelating agents in the therapeutic armamentarium of COVID-19, probably as an adjunctive treatment.","output":"19 treatment regimens?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TEAD4 (TEA Domain Transcription Factor 4) is well recognized as the DNA-anchor protein of YAP transcription complex, which is modulated by Hippo, a highly conserved pathway in Metazoa that controls organ size through regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. To acquire full transcriptional activity, TEAD4 requires co-activator, YAP (Yes-associated protein) or its homolog TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) the signaling hub that relays the extracellular stimuli to the transcription of target genes. Growing evidence suggests that TEAD4 also exerts its function in a YAP-independent manner through other signal pathways. Although TEAD4 plays an essential role in determining that differentiation fate of the blastocyst, it also promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing metastasis, cancer stemness, and drug resistance. Upregulation of TEAD4 has been reported in several cancers, including colon cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer and serves as a valuable prognostic marker. Recent studies show that TEAD4, but not other members of the TEAD family, engages in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and cell metabolism by modulating the expression of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded electron transport chain genes. TEAD4s functions including oncogenic activities are tightly controlled by its subcellular localization. As a predominantly nuclear protein, its cytoplasmic translocation is triggered by several signals, such as osmotic stress, cell confluency, and arginine availability. Intriguingly, TEAD4 is also localized in mitochondria, although the translocation mechanism remains unclear.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 375 subjects are recruited (male: 253;female: 122). In this study, OpenPose converts the photographed 2D images into four body variables, which are compared with those of a tape measure and 3D scanning simultaneously. Then, the recommendation model of the DCU is built by the decision tree. Meanwhile, the Euclidean distance of each size of the DCU in the manufacturing specification is calculated as the best three recommendations. Findings: The recommended size established by the decision tree is only 0.62 and 0.63. However, for the recommendation result of the best three options, the DCU Fitting Score can be as high as 0.8 or more. The results of OpenPose and 3D scanning have the highest correlation coefficient even though the method of measuring body size is different. This result confirms that OpenPose has significant measurement validity. That is, inexpensive equipment can be used to obtain reasonable results.

In this paper, we present feasible solutions for detecting and labeling infected tissues on CT lung images of such patients. Two structurally-different deep learning techniques, SegNet and U-NET, are investigated for semantically segmenting infected tissue regions in CT lung images. METHODS: We propose to use two known deep learning networks, SegNet and U-NET, for image tissue classification. SegNet is characterized as a scene segmentation network and U-NET as a medical segmentation tool. Both networks were exploited as binary segmentors to discriminate between infected and healthy lung tissue, also as multi-class segmentors to learn the infection type on the lung. Each network is trained using seventy-two data images, validated on ten images, and tested against the left eighteen images. Several statistical scores are calculated for the results and tabulated accordingly. RESULTS: The results show the superior ability of SegNet in classifying infected/non-infected tissues compared to the other methods (with 0.95 mean accuracy), while the U-NET shows better results as a multi-class segmentor (with 0.91 mean accuracy). CONCLUSION: Semantically segmenting CT scan images of COVID-19 patients is a crucial goal because it would not only assist in disease diagnosis, also help in quantifying the severity of the illness, and hence, prioritize the population treatment accordingly.

She has been complaining of leg pain for a week but on the day of presentation noted to have stiffening and shortness of breath. There was no history of cough, fever, leg trauma, headache, dysuria, hematuria or dark urine. She had no significant family history. Work up revealed severe hypocalcemia of 4.6 mg/ dL and elevated phosphorus (7.1mg/dl). There was no hypoglycemia and other electrolytes including renal function were normal. Patient also had normal inflammatory markers, normal fibrinogen, and normal ferritin. Urine was positive for trace protein and was positive for myoglobin. Alkaline phosphatase was normal. Urine toxicology screen was negative. Hand X-rays did not showed the shortening of metacarpal bones and kidney ultrasound was normal. After IV calcium bolus, calcium barely increased at 5.0. Interestingly CK was noted to be elevated at 3,794 U/L. Patient physical exam was normal and there was no signs of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). Patient was positive for COVID19. Patient required intensive fluid therapy to correct CK which increased up to 11,223 U/L on 3rd day of admission. It eventually came down back to normal on the 6th day. Creatinine levels remained normal. Patient continued to receive high dose calcium and calcitriol supplement and discharged with calcium of 8.5 mg/dL and phosphorus of 7.8 mg/dL. Additional work up showed PTH of 885 pg/mL consistent with pseudohypoparathyroidism. Vitamin D levels and thyroid function were normal. Genetic testing for pseudohypoparathyroidism is awaited. Conclusion: Psuedohypoparathyroidism type 1 b (PHP 1b) is a rare endocrine disorder presenting with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and increased PTH values due to a variable resistance to target organs. As in our case it was unmasked by COVID 19 infection and rhabdomyolysis. Best of our knowledge there is no such unusual case reported in children. Severe hypocalcemia likely due to combination of factors including tissue calcium deposition, hyperphosphatemia, and skeletal resistance to PTH. As published in some recent reports, this case also illustrates that rhabdomyolysis could be potential complication of SARS- CoV2 infection in early stage with normal renal function, which warrants further research.","output":"A Case of Psuedohypoparathyroidism Unmasked by COVID-19 and Rhabdomyolysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this research is to discuss the state-of-the-art with regard to the influence of COVID-19 in retail, especially in the light of the economic, social and health perspectives.

We evaluated both systemic and mucosal immune responses to PEDV in pigs and assessed if prior exposure to virus protects against re-infection. Three-week-old pigs were infected with PEDV and immune response in blood, intestine, and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) was evaluated. At 30 dpi, virus exposed pigs were challenged with a field isolate of PEDV and immune response at 5 d post challenge was evaluated. We found that PEDV RNA persists in the intestine even after fecal shedding of the virus was stopped at 28 dpi and pigs previously exposed to PEDV are protected from virus shedding after re-infection. PEDV infection induced both humoral and cell mediated immune response with an increase in PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibodies in intestine and serum. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significantly higher frequency of B cells and lower frequency of T cells at 4 dpi. The frequency of CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) memory T cells was significantly increased in the MLN of challenged animals.

In 2019C2020, the Tropical Health and Education Trust undertook a 6-month paediatric capacity building project in Lusaka, Zambia, funded by Health Education England.ObjectivesThe aim of the project was to improve paediatric skills of front-line healthcare workers.MethodsThree volunteers were recruited (2 paediatric registrars and 1 programme and evaluation consultant) to work with first (district) level hospitals in Lusaka. A needs analysis found that there was an under-utilisation of the structured approach to the recognition and stabilisation of unwell children on the front line.The initial suggestion of embedding the Emergency Triage and Treatment (ETAT) course was not an option due to insufficient resources and funding for a five-day course. The volunteers worked with local and international colleagues to design a one-day alternative based on local data, priorities and available resources. The Paediatric Assessment and Stabilisation (PAS) course is based on national Zambia Paediatric Association and international protocols (including ETAT, APLS and WHO).A teach the teacher approach was used with instructors nominated from four first level hospitals and University Teaching Hospital (the local tertiary referral hospital). Two half-day sessions were held to train instructors on course teaching methods, and encourage them to be local PAS Champions to embed their new knowledge and skills amongst their own hospital teams post-course.The pilot was funded by Lusaka Provincial Health Office, with participants recruited from the same four first level hospitals as the instructors. The course was delivered in small groups using Peytons four stage approach and simulation. A simulation test scenario was used at the end of the course to ensure credibility. Impact of the course was measured using a Likert scale questionnaire to assess participant confidence in managing critically ill children before and after the course.ResultsThe pilot ran four separate PAS courses. These were attended by 91 participants (including clinical officers, medical officers and nurses) of which 88 passed. Pre and post course questionnaires showed participant confidence scores increased by 19% in assessment of unwell children, and by 22% in treatment of unwell children. Free text by participants showed a positive impact on individual clinical practice. 25 instructors were trained to teach on the PAS course, as well as 2 course directors and 1 course administrator. Instructors also fed back that critically unwell children were more effectively managed within their facilities after the course. Ownership of the course was handed back to the ZPA and Ministry of Health at the end of the pilot. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic prevented any further impact analysis, and any further PAS courses were put on hold.ConclusionsAt a time where national resources are limited to fund internationally recognised paediatric courses (e.g. ETAT), it is hoped that the structured approach learned on the PAS course can benefit front line paediatric care in Zambia at present, and become an effective stepping-stone to these courses.","output":"Developing a novel one-day paediatric assessment and stabilisation (PAS) course for front line healthcare workers in Lusaka, Zambia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present CRISP (COVID-19 Risk Score Prediction), a probabilistic graphical model for COVID-19 infection spread through a population based on the SEIR model where we assume access to (1) mutual contacts between pairs of individuals across time across various channels (e.g., Bluetooth contact traces), as well as (2) test outcomes at given times for infection, exposure and immunity tests. Our micro-level model keeps track of the infection state for each individual at every point in time, ranging from susceptible, exposed, infectious to recovered. We develop a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer contact-channel specific infection transmission probabilities. Our algorithm uses Gibbs sampling to draw samples of the latent infection status of each individual over the entire time period of analysis, given the latent infection status of all contacts and test outcome data. Experimental results with simulated data demonstrate our CRISP model can be parametrized by the reproduction factor $R_0$ and exhibits population-level infectiousness and recovery time series similar to those of the classical SEIR model. However, due to the individual contact data, this model allows fine grained control and inference for a wide range of COVID-19 mitigation and suppression policy measures. Moreover, the algorithm is able to support efficient testing in a test-trace-isolate approach to contain COVID-19 infection spread. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model with efficient inference for COVID-19 infection spread based on individual-level contact data;most epidemic models are macro-level models that reason over entire populations.

In this study, we assessed the feasibility of a newly developed, piezo actuator-driven pulsed water jet (ADPJ) for liver resection in a surviving swine model. METHODS Ten domestic pigs underwent liver resection. Parenchymal transection and vessel skeletonization were performed using the ADPJ (group A, n = 5) or an ultrasonic aspirator (group U, n = 5). The water jet was applied at a frequency of 400 Hz and a driving voltage of 80 V. Physiological saline was supplied at a flow rate of 7 ml/min. After 7 days, the animals were killed and their short-term complications were examined and compared between the two groups. RESULTS No significant complications, such as massive bleeding, occurred in either group during the surgical procedures. The transection time per transection area was significantly shorter in group A than in group U (1.5  0.3 vs. 2.3  0.5 min/cm(2), respectively, P = 0.03). Blood loss per transection area was not significantly different between groups A and U (9.3  4.2 vs. 11.7  2.3 ml/cm(2), P = 0.6). All pigs in group A survived for 7 days. No postoperative bleeding or bile leakage was observed in any animal at necropsy. CONCLUSION The present results suggested that the ADPJ reduces transection time without increasing blood loss.

We hypothesized that ATT activation and function would have tissue-residentCspecific properties and that obesity would potentiate their inflammatory properties. We assessed ATT activation and inflammatory potential within mouse and human stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Surprisingly, murine and human ATTs from obese visceral white adipose tissue exhibited impaired inflammatory characteristics upon stimulation. Both environmental and cell-intrinsic factors are implicated in ATT dysfunction. Soluble factors from obese SVF inhibit ATT activation. Additionally, chronic signaling from macrophage major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) is necessary for ATT impairment in obese adipose tissue but is independent of increased PD1 expression. To assess intracellular signaling mechanisms responsible for ATT inflammation impairments, single-cell RNA sequencing of ATTs was performed. ATTs in obese adipose tissue exhibit enrichment of genes characteristic of T cell exhaustion and increased expression of coinhibitory receptor Btla.

Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes in patients with diabetes in whom COVID-19 has been confirmed or clinically diagnosed (with typical features on lung imaging and symptoms), and their association with glucose-lowering or blood pressure-lowering medications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications. Logistic regression was used in order to explore risk factors associated with mortality or poor prognosis. RESULTS The proportion of comorbid diabetes is similar between cases of confirmed and of clinically diagnosed COVID-19. Risk factors for higher mortality of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.04, 1.15] per year increase; P = 0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (aOR 1.12 [95% CI 1.00, 1.24]; P = 0.043).

An inadequate understanding of the project status can lead to mistakes and inappropriate actions, causing delays and increased costs. Monitoring and controlling projects via digital tools would reduce the risk of error and enable timely corrective actions. Although there is currently a wide range of technologies for these purposes, these technologies and interoperability between them are still limited. Because of this, it is important to know the possibilities of integration and interoperability regarding their implementation. This article presents a bibliographic synthesis and interpretation of 30 nonconventional digital tools for monitoring progress in terms of field data capture technologies (FDCT) and communication and collaborative technologies (CT) that are responsible for information processing and management. This research aims to perform an integration and interoperability analysis of technologies to demonstrate their potential for monitoring and controlling construction projects during the execution phase.

Previous reports have identified several host proteins related to the interferon response (e.g. OAS1), interleukin-6 signalling (IL-6R), and the coagulation cascade (linked via ABO) that were associated with risk of COVID-19. In the present study, we performed proteome-wide genetic colocalisation tests leveraging publicly available protein and COVID-19 datasets, to identify additional proteins that may contribute to COVID-19 risk. Our analytic approach identified several known targets (e.g. ABO, OAS1), but also nominated new proteins such as soluble FAS (colocalisation probability > 0.9, p = 1 x 10-4), implicating FAS-mediated apoptosis as a potential target for COVID-19 risk. We also undertook polygenic (pan) and cis-Mendelian randomisation analyses that showed consistent associations of genetically predicted ABO protein with several COVID-19 phenotypes. The ABO signal was associated with plasma concentrations of several proteins, with the strongest association observed with CD209 in several proteomic datasets. We demonstrated experimentally that CD209 directly interacts with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a mechanism that could explain the ABO association with COVID-19. Our work provides a prioritised list of host targets potentially exploited by SARS-CoV-2 and is a precursor for further research on CD209 and FAS as therapeutically tractable targets for COVID-19.","output":"A proteome-wide genetic investigation identifies several SARS-CoV-2-exploited host targets of clinical relevance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The consumption of local agricultural products boosts the regional economy and employment whilst preserving the rural landscape and environment.

A simultaneous sanitary-bacteriological control of hospital environment was performed (210 environment samples and 24 air samples). The research was conducted during 12 weeks (6 cycles, one cycle lasted two weeks). Bacteriological assessment was performed via classical method. Identification of isolated pathogens and evaluation of drug-resistant strains were performed with bacteriological analyzer Multiscan. Results Examination of sputum that was obtained from 151 patients with CAP revealed 43 isolates and 8 bacterial species in 32 patients (21.2%). Candida spp. fungi (51.167.62%) and Gramm-positive microflora without drug-resistant strains (39.537.46%) were prevailing in the structure of detected isolates Gramm-negative enterobacteria were presented by one species of Klebsiella pneumoniae with multiple drug-resistance C ESBL (4.653.21%) and non-fermenting Gramm-negative bacteria C one species of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.332.30%). Evaluation of 210 environmental samples showed bacterial microflora in 49 samples (23.3% cases) that was comparable to frequency detection of bacterial pathogens from patients (21.2%). Microflora identified from environment was presented by 12 pathogenic species including Gramm-positive microflora (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, E.faecalis, E.

Cleft lip and palate repair was classified as low acuity, and nasoalveolar molding (NAM) clinics were closed. Anticipating the consequences of delayed cleft care and the additional burden this would cause families, we reassessed our risk-stratification and perioperative algorithms. We hypothesized we could safely optimize nasolabial repair without burdening our care systems and without increasing COVID-19-related morbidity/mortality. METHODS: Our multidisciplinary cleft team reevaluated patient selection to maximize surgical impact. Perioperative protocols were adjusted, and COVID-19 preoperative testing was utilized before nasolabial repair and prior to suture removal under anesthesia. RESULTS: Early in the pandemic, unilateral cleft repair was prioritized and successfully completed on 9 patients. There were no complications related to COVID-19. Nasoalveolar molding clinic was reopened after total patient volume was significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: We offer an approach for surgical management of nasolabial clefts during a global pandemic. Although guidelines have suggested postponing all cleft care, we found that at our dedicated pediatric hospital with low burden of COVID-19 and adequate resources, we could follow a strategy to safely resume cleft care while decreasing burden on our patients' families and care delivery systems.","output":"Interdisciplinary Considerations for Nasolabial Repair During a Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extremely useful and relevant information can be obtained when analysing the position assumed by patients with dyspnoea. Relief of breathlessness in a sitting or standing position compared to the recumbent position is referred to as orthopnoea. While increased venous return in the supine patient is well tolerated in individuals with a preserved heart function, this leads to pulmonary venous congestion, an increase in interstitial lung water and a subsequent reduction of lung capacities with resultant shortness of breath in patients with impaired heart function. Accordingly, patients with heart failure prefer to sit upright (e.g. supporting their back with pillows to achieve a maximum upright position) (Fig. 5.1). Conversely, placing the patient into a supine position may be used as a stress test to exclude respiratory distress due to heart failure or (pulmonary) fluid overload.

RESULTS: As of October 28, 2020, the growth of daily new confirmed cases has stabilized in China, Singapore, and South Korea. In Japan, the daily new confirmed cases increased sharply since it lifted a state of emergency, but case-fatality maintains at a lower level.

Patients with a mental disorder present a unique challenge for doctors with regards to effective communication due to the nature of their illness. This literature review aimed to determine whether medical undergraduates around the world are taught psychiatric communication skills. Method In January 2021, the following electronic databases were searched for articles relating to medical undergraduates, the concept of psychiatric communication skills and the teaching and support of such skill development: ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SAGE and Web of Science. Combinations of keywords focussed the content of papers and truncation obtained alternative word endings. Generated articles were appraised iteratively for suitability against pre-defined inclusion criteria. The bibliographies of eligible articles were then examined to capture any further relevant studies. Ethical approval was not required. Result 1040 citations of potential relevance were initially identified. Following an iterative screening process, 10 articles (from seven different countries) were eligible for inclusion. 70% of papers used the modality of simulated patients to teach psychiatric communication skills and Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) was used to create virtual patients for undergraduates to engage with. Discussing sensitive and emotive topics, such as suicide attempts or substance misuse, was less commonly taught compared to conditions such as anxiety and depression. Only 10% of papers explicitly taught medical undergraduates empathy or written communication skills and the importance placed on psychiatric teaching differed between countries. Conclusion This literature review showed that some medical undergraduates receive psychiatric communication skills teaching, but the format and content of this varies. Increased consideration of incorporating TEL into psychiatric communications skills teaching is pertinent given undergraduates reduced face-to-face patient contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, but further work is needed to validate such technology. Written communication skills are rarely taught but are imperative given the high volume of written correspondence in clinical practice. Delivering such teaching is feasible and should be incorporated into undergraduate curricula. Medical educators need to consider cultural differences when developing psychiatric communication skills teaching. Cultural influences not only affect undergraduate perceptions of psychiatry and mental illness, but also a patient's understanding and interpretation of their illness experience. Medical undergraduates may come from various cultural backgrounds, so actively discussing these differences opportunistically may augment the ability of medical undergraduates to be empathetic and establish therapeutic rapport with patients with mental illness.","output":"A literature review of whether communication skills specific to psychiatry are being taught to medical undergraduates around the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent randomized trials suggest that interleukin-6 inhibitors like tocilizumab have mortality benefit for patients with severe coronavirus disease-2019.

The RBD is highly conserved and is also a potential target for blocking its interaction with human cell surface receptor. We designed short peptides on the basis of our previously reported truncated ACE2 (tACE2) for increasing the binding affinity as well as the binding interaction network with RBD. These peptides can selectively bind to RBD with much higher affinities than the cell surface receptor. Thus, these can block all the binding residues required for binding to cell surface receptor. We used selected amino acid regions (21C40 and 65C75) of ACE2 as scaffold for the de novo peptide design. Our designed peptide Pep1 showed interactions with RBD covering almost all of its binding residues with significantly higher binding affinity (?13.2 kcal mol(?1)) than the cell surface receptor.

In previous laboratory work, we noted that cholera toxin and forskolin markedly potentiated EPEC-induced ATP release from the host cell, and this potentiated release was found to be mediated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. In this study, we examined whether the ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) or the heat-stable toxin (STa, also known as ST) potentiated EPEC-induced ATP release. We found that crude ETEC culture filtrates, as well as purified ETEC toxins, did potentiate EPEC-induced ATP release in cultured T84 cells. Coinfection of T84 cells with live ETEC plus EPEC bacteria also resulted in enhanced ATP release compared to EPEC alone. In Ussing chamber studies of chloride secretion, adenine nucleotides released from the host by EPEC also significantly enhanced the chloride secretory responses that were triggered by crude ETEC filtrates, purified STa, and the peptide hormone guanylin. In addition, adenosine and LT had additive or synergistic effects in inducing vacuole formation in T84 cells. Therefore, ETEC toxins and EPEC-induced damage to the host cell both enhance the virulence of the other type of E. coli.

Although researchers and commentators have explored the nature and drivers of decline, they have paid less attention to its implications. This matters because of the potential impact on contemporary and future public health, as well as on alcohol policy-making. This commentary therefore considers how youth drinking trends may develop in future, what this would mean for public health, and what it might mean for alcohol policy and debate. We argue that the decline in youth drinking is well-established and unlikely to reverse, despite smaller declines and stabilising trends in recent years. Young people also appear to be carrying their lighter drinking into adulthood in at least some countries. This suggests we should expect large short- and long-term public health benefits. The latter may however be obscured in population-level data by increased harm arising from earlier, heavier drinking generations moving through the highest risk points in the life course. The likely impact of the decline in youth drinking on public and policy debate is less clear. We explore the possibilities using two model scenarios, the reinforcement and withdrawal models. In the reinforcement model, a virtuous circle of falling alcohol consumption, increasing public support for alcohol control policies and apparent policy successes facilitates progressive strengthening of policy, akin to that seen in the tobacco experience. In the withdrawal model, policy-makers turn their attention to other problems, public health advocates struggle to justify proposed interventions and existing policies erode over time as industry actors reassert and strengthen their partnerships with government around alcohol policy. We argue that disconnects between the tobacco experience and the reinforcement model make the withdrawal model a more plausible scenario. We conclude by suggesting some tentative ways forward for public health actors working in this space.","output":"Youth drinking in decline: What are the implications for public health, public policy and public debate?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic disease seen exclusively in humans.

We aimed to compare the longer-term efficacy of IRE to the standard thermal technique of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in HCC. METHODS All patients who underwent IRE or RFA for HCC in our centre were identified and demographic and clinical data were analysed up until 1st March, 2020. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was compared between groups after propensity score matching for age, gender, Child-Pugh grade, BCLC stage, lesion size and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. RESULTS A total of 190 HCC ablations (31 IRE and 159 RFA) were identified. After propensity score matching, we compared 25 IRE procedures (76% males, median age 62.4 years, median tumour size 20 mm) to 96 RFA procedures (84.4% males, median age 64.3 years, median tumour size 18.5 mm). LRFS did not differ between groups, with a 1-, 2- and 5-year LRFS of 80.4% (95% CI 55.8-92.2), 69.1% (95% CI 43.3-84.9) and 44.9% (95% CI 18.9-68.1%), respectively for IRE and 84.8% (95% CI 75.2-90.9), 71.3% (95% CI 58.3-81.0) and 52.1% (95% CI 35.4-66.4%), respectively for RFA (p = .63). There were no major procedure-related complications or deaths in either group. CONCLUSIONS Whilst IRE remains a relatively novel therapy for HCC cases where standard thermal ablation is contraindicated, the LRFS in our centre is comparable to that of RFA. IRE should therefore be considered as a treatment option in such cases when available before stage-migration to non-curative therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).","output":"Irreversible electroporation versus radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma: a single centre propensity-matched comparison."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The primary purpose of the present study was to assess whether use of proposed containment sheet (so called a frugal innovation) minimizes the aerosol and splatter dispersion during total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Demographic and epidemiological data, travel and contact history were collected. Eligible cohort was randomly assigned to a study (TKA using containment sheet) group and a control group (TKA without containment sheet). Radiological and functional outcomes before operation and at the final follow-up were assessed using Western Ontario and Mc-master Universities Osteoarthritis Index score (WOMAC) and the visual analog scale (VAS). The primary outcome was the postoperative effectiveness of containment sheet and face shield, defined as the numbers of countable macroscopic aerosols and/or splatters to naked eyes.

There are many causes of rhabdomyolysis, and the etiology is often multifactorial or unclear. Current data suggest that acute COVID-19 may cause muscle injury that can lead to rhabdomyolysis, particularly in cases of severe illness requiring prolonged hospitalization; however, data on the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the musculoskeletal system are lacking. CASE REPORT We present a case of a woman with generalized weakness 1 week following discharge from the hospital after a prolonged admission for severe COVID-19. She was found to have acute kidney injury and elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 1775 U/L (normal 36-234 U/L). Her home medications, including her statin, were held, but her CK continued to rise, peaking at 15 085 U/L, and she developed renal failure necessitating renal replacement therapy. A thorough work-up for the underlying etiology of her rhabdomyolysis was pursued, including testing for autoimmune myositis, statin-associated necrotizing autoimmune myositis, and a muscle biopsy, which were all unrevealing. Ultimately, the patient's rhabdomyolysis was determined to likely be secondary to a post-viral myopathy from COVID-19. A toxic myopathy from medication use or a delayed critical illness myopathy from her recent prolonged hospitalization could have also contributed. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the wide differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis in the setting of recent COVID-19 and prolonged hospitalization.

In biomedical research, regression analysis (RGA) is common. However, with RGA it is challenging to analyse multiple interactions and specific configurations ({approx} combinations) of variables, which could be highly relevant to translation. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is an approach based on set theory and Boolean algebra. It was successfully used to identify specific configurations of factors predicting an outcome in other fields. We reanalysed the data from our preceding review with a QCA. This QCA resulted in the following formula for successful translation: ~Old*~Intervention*~Large*MultSpec*Quantitative Which means that within the analysed dataset, the combination of relative recency (~ means not; >1999), analyses at event or study level (not at intervention level), n<75, inclusion of more than one species and quantitative (instead of binary) analyses always resulted in successful translation (>85%). Other combinations of factors showed less consistent or negative results. An RGA on the same data did not identify any of the included variables as significant contributors.

In subgroup analysis, hyperlipasemia patients had significantly worse LOS (11vs.15 days, P = 0.01), ICU admission rates (44% vs. 66%,OR = 2.5,95%CI = 1.3-5.0,P = 0.008), ICU LOS (12vs.19 days,P = 0.01), mechanical ventilation rates (34% vs. 55%,OR = 2.4,95%CI = 1.3-4.8,P = 0.01), and durations of mechanical ventilation (14 vs. 21 days, P = 0.008). Hyperlipasemia patients were more likely to have a D-dimer value in the highest two quartiles, and had increased mortality (59% vs. 15%,OR = 7.2,95%CI = 4.5-11,P < 0.001) and LOS (10vs.7 days,P < 0.001) compared to those with normal lipase and lower D-dimer levels. CONCLUSION: There is high prevalence of hyperlipasemia without clinical pancreatitis in COVID-19 disease. Hyperlipasemia was associated with higher mortality and ICU utilization, possibly explained by elevated D-dimer.","output":"Hyperlipasemia in absence of acute pancreatitis is associated with elevated D-dimer and adverse outcomes in COVID 19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV) is a rare disease affecting dogs, with a recent apparent increase in prevalence since 2012 in the UK. This disease is characterized by a vasculopathy affecting small vessels of the kidney and skin, leading to thrombotic microangiopathy. The underlying etiology remains unknown although clinicopathological and histological findings resemble features of certain forms of thrombotic microangiopathy in people, for which plasma exchange (PEX) is considered an important component of therapy. The objective of the present study is to describe the use of PEX as adjunctive treatment in dogs diagnosed with CRGV. A retrospective review of dogs diagnosed with CRGV between 2014 and 2016 treated with PEX was performed. Clinical records were reviewed and data relating to signalment, diagnostic tests and management strategies were summarized. Information and complications relating to PEX were recorded. Six dogs were diagnosed with CRGV (n = 2 ante-mortem, n = 4 post-mortem) and underwent PEX as part of their therapy. All dogs had cutaneous lesions and were azotemic with oliguria or anuria. All dogs underwent at least one PEX cycle; one dog had a single cycle PEX, three dogs two cycles PEX, and two dogs had one cycle PEX and one cycle of prolonged intermittent renal replacement treatment. Complications seen during PEX therapy included hypothermia (n = 4), tachycardia (n = 2), hypotension (n = 2), and hypocalcemia (n = 6). Two dogs survived to discharge, the remaining four dogs were euthanized. The positive outcome in two dogs treated with PEX despite the reported high mortality rate once acute kidney injury with oliguria/anuria occurs does not confirm success of this treatment. However, survival in two dogs that were initially oligoanuric highlights that further consideration and evaluation of PEX for this patient group is warranted for this specific disease. Additional studies are urgently needed to identify the underlying etiology of CRGV before more targeted therapies can be developed. Based on our findings, further evaluation of the role of PEX in this specific disease are warranted.","output":"Description of the Use of Plasma Exchange in Dogs With Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases always pose a threat to humans along with plant and animal life. SARS-CoV2 is the recently emerged viral infection that originated from Wuhan city of the Republic of China in December 2019. Now, it has become a pandemic. Currently, SARS-CoV2 has infected more than 27.74 million people worldwide, and taken 901,928 human lives. It was named first 'WH 1 Human CoV' and later changed to 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV).

METHODS: We randomly extracted data of 2100 patients with cancer between Jan. 1, 2017, and Oct. 31, 2019, and 1035 patients who underwent Doppler ultrasonography were enrolled. Univariate analysis and Lasso regression were applied to select important predictors. Model training and hyperparameter tuning were implemented on 70% of the data using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The remaining 30% of the data were used to compare the performance with seven indicators (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, balanced accuracy, Brier score, and calibration curve), among all five ML models (linear discriminant analysis [LDA], logistic regression [LR], classification tree [CT], random forest [RF], and support vector machine [SVM]), and the KS. RESULTS: The incidence of cancer-associated DVT was 22.3%. The top five predictors were D-dimer level, age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), length of stay (LOS), and previous VTE (venous thromboembolism) history according to RF.

METHODS: This was a cross sectional analytical study done at a tertiary care teaching hospital in India including patients with RMDs who were not on biological diseases modifying agents. Assessment of disease status, socioeconomic status and economic impact of COVID-19 was done via tele-consultation. RESULTS: Out of the 680 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 373 completed the study. The format was found easy by 334 (89.6%) of them and 284 (76.1%) considered tele-rheumatology better than in-person consultation. During the pre-COVID months, the median monthly per capita income of the families of our patients and cost of illness was Indian rupees (INR) 2000 (US$ 26) and INR 1685 (US$ 21.91), respectively.

The error of the study representativeness with a probability of 0.95: does not exceed 4%. RESULTS Results:The analysis results indicate that under pandemic conditions informational space of Ukraine is charging with low-quality and diverse information and is getting out of control, which entails adverse effects on societal resilience. Besides, a survey conducted by the SSU Center for Social Studies endorses the availability of communication gaps. The poll claims 38.6% of Ukrainians to be dissatisfied with their awareness level of Covid-19 because the information is contradictory and unreliable. The opinion poll also proves the low level of Ukrainians' trust in state institutions and official details on the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, violations of quarantine restrictions are socially acceptable, and a significant part of the population tends to ignore such violations by others. That is, among Ukrainians, compliance with quarantine restrictions has not become a social norm.

Global equitable access to health technologies is vital to bringing the pandemic under control. Reflecting this, global mechanisms for rightsholders to share intellectual property rights, data and know-how over such health technologies have been developed. Yet, to date, there is limited support from corporate rightsholders for such mechanisms. Instead, health technologies have been licensed largely based on bilateral deals, with vast global inequalities emerging. Given the traditional focus within company law on prioritising shareholders short-term financial value, we argue that it is unsurprising that many corporate rightsholders adopt a protectionist approach to patents, even in the face of health crises. However, we argue that the tide may now be starting to shift, catalysed by an emergence of engaged shareholders petitioning for socially responsible corporate behaviour, including for uses of intellectual property over health technologies in a manner that more clearly aligns with public interests. If harnessed and encouraged, such engaged shareholder behaviour could present an opportunity to reframe the conception of shareholder value towards one that considers a long-term sustainable approach and ultimately to shift corporate behaviour around uses of intellectual property over health technologies to take public interests into account. ?

To understand the impact of host genetics on expression of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) during RNA virus infection we performed a GWAS for ACE2 expression in HCV-infected liver tissue from 195 individuals. We discovered that polymorphisms in the host IFNL region which control expression of IFNL3 and IFNL4 modulate ACE2 expression. ACE2 expression was regulated additionally by age, with a subsidiary effect of co-morbidity. The IFNL locus controlled expression of a gene network incorporating many well-known interferon-stimulated genes which anti-correlated with ACE2 transcript levels. The same anti-correlation was found in the gastrointestinal tract, a site of SARS-CoV-2 replication where inflammation driven interferon-stimulated genes are negatively correlated with ACE2 expression. The interferon dependent regulation of ACE2 was identified in a murine model of SARS-CoV-1 suggesting conserved regulation of ACE2 across species.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether particular cytokine profiles are associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHODS: Cytokine concentrations and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen were measured at hospital admission in serum of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 (N = 115), classified at hospitalization into 3 respiratory severity groups: no need for mechanical ventilatory support (No-MVS), intermediate severity requiring mechanical ventilatory support (MVS), and critical severity requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Principal-component analysis was used to characterize cytokine profiles associated with severity and mortality. The results were thereafter confirmed in an independent validation cohort (N = 86). RESULTS: At time of hospitalization, ECMO patients presented a dominant proinflammatory response with elevated levels of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. In contrast, an elevated type-I interferon response involving IFN-&#945; and IFN-? was characteristic of No-MVS patients, whereas MVS patients exhibited both profiles. Mortality at 1 month was associated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in ECMO patients, higher levels of type-I interferons in No-MVS patients, and their combination in MVS patients, resulting in a combined mortality prediction accuracy of 88.5% (risk ratio, 24.3; P < .0001).

We postulated that treatment success depended on the size of the aneurysm ostium or defect in the parent artery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Flow diverter expansion and deformation were studied in silicone tubes with wall apertures of various sizes. Large and giant canine sidewall aneurysms, featuring a branch located immediately opposite the aneurysm, and a smaller 6- to 8-mm (group A, n = 6) or a larger 10- to 16-mm (group B, n = 6) ostium were created to study the effects of ostium size on aneurysm or branch occlusion by flow diverters. Angiographic results after deployment and at 3 months were scored by using an ordinal scale. The amount of neointima formation on the segment of the device overlying the aneurysm or the branch ostia was determined by specimen photography. RESULTS The fusiform deformation of flow diverters was maximal with larger defects in silicone tubes. At 3 months, group B aneurysms showed worse angiographic results than group A aneurysms, with larger residual aneurysm volumes (P = .002). Neointimal coverage of the aneurysm ostia was more complete in group A compared with group B (P = .002).

They have a high degree of efficacy in humans (70-95%) depending on the type of vaccine. However, little protection is provided against viral replication and shedding in the upper airways due to the lack of a local sIgA immune response, indicating a risk of transmission of virus from vaccinated individuals. A range of novel nasal COVID-19 vaccines are in development and preclinical results in non-human primates have shown a promising prevention of replication and shedding of virus due to the induction of mucosal immune response (sIgA) in upper and lower respiratory tracts as well as robust systemic and humoral immune responses. Whether these results will translate to humans remains to be clarified. An IM prime followed by an IN booster vaccination would likely result in a better well-rounded immune response, including prevention (or strong reduction) in viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts.","output":"Nasal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2: Synergistic or alternative to intramuscular vaccines?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the clinical presentation and risk factors for survival in 175 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and COVID-19, diagnosed between February and June 2020. After a median follow-up of 50 days, mortality was higher than in the general population and reached 48% in myelofibrosis (MF). Univariate analysis, showed a significant relationship between death and age, male gender, decreased lymphocyte counts, need for respiratory support, comorbidities and diagnosis of MF, while no association with essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and prefibrotic-PMF (pre-PMF) was found. Regarding MPN-directed therapy ongoing at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, Ruxolitinib (Ruxo) was significantly more frequent in patients who died in comparison with survivors (p = 0.006). Conversely, multivariable analysis found no effect of Ruxo alone on mortality, but highlighted an increased risk of death in the 11 out of 45 patients who discontinued treatment. These findings were also confirmed in a propensity score matching analysis. In conclusion, we found a high risk of mortality during COVID-19 infection among MPN patients, especially in MF patients and/or discontinuing Ruxo at COVID-19 diagnosis.

However, the effect of the B chromosome on gene expression is still unclear. In addition, it is unknown whether the accumulation of the B chromosome would have a cumulative effect on gene expression. To examine these questions, the global expression of genes, microRNAs (miRNAs), and transposable elements (TEs) of leaf tissue of W22 maize (Zea mays) plants with 0 to 7 copies of the B chromosome was studied. All experimental genotypes with B chromosomes displayed a trend of upregulated gene expression for a subset of A-located genes compared to the control. Over three thousand A-located genes are significantly differentially expressed in all experimental genotypes with the B chromosome relative to the control. Modulations of these genes are largely determined by the presence rather than the copy number of the B chromosome. By contrast, the expression of most B-located genes is positively correlated with B copy number, showing a proportional gene dosage effect. The B chromosome also causes increased expression of A-located miRNAs. Differentially expressed miRNAs potentially regulate their targets in a cascade of effects. Furthermore, the varied copy number of the B chromosome leads to the differential expression of A-located and B-located TEs.

SETTING: UK (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 633 adults belonging to ethnic minority groups who took part in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 vaccine refusal (vs. accepted/waiting/had at least one dose) between 23 December 2020 and 14 June 2021. RESULTS: Nearly 1 in 10 (6.69%) who had refused a COVID-19 vaccine had experienced racial/ethnic discrimination in a medical setting since the start of the pandemic and had experienced twice as many incidents of racial/ethnic discrimination than those who had accepted the vaccine. Structural equation modelling results indicated a nearly four fold (odds ratio = 3.91, 95% confidence interval = 1.40 to 10.92) total effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on refusing the vaccine which was mediated by low trust in the health system to handle the pandemic (odds ratio = 2.49, 95% confidence interval = 1.12 to 5.39).

We present here an overview of dipeptide production by P. gingivalis mediated by dipeptidyl\\\\peptidases (DPPs), e.g., DPP4, DPP5, DPP7, and DPP11, serine exopeptidases localized in periplasm, which release dipeptides from the N\\\\terminus of polypeptides.

METHODS: In this narrative review, we drew upon the experiences of the authors as both life-long learners and educators. We then reviewed literature pertaining to novel teaching methodologies developed in medical education since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Several medical specialties have employed novel teaching methodologies including use of telemedicine, remote teaching, online curricula, virtual rotations, virtual conferences, simulations, and learning consortia to continue engaging trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted at the ED of a pediatric tertiary hospital in Ontario, Canada. Patient outcomes (ie, acute asthma episodes and ED visits) were measured at baseline and at 1- and 6-months post-ED discharge. Time trends in outcomes were assessed using the generalized estimating equations method. Multiple conditional logistic regressions were used to model outcomes at 6 months and examine the impact of drug insurance coverage while adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 269 children recruited, 81.8% completed both follow-ups. ED use significantly reduced from 39.4% at baseline to 26.8% at 6 months (P < .001), whereas the level of acute asthma episodes remained unchanged. Children with drug insurance coverage were less likely to have acute asthma episodes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15C0.85; P < .02) or repeat ED visits (AOR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20C0.99; P < .05) at 6 months. Other risk factors for adverse outcomes included previous adverse asthma events and certain asthma triggers (eg, cold/sinus infection). Washing bed linens in hot water weekly was protective against subsequent acute asthma episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated significant improvements in long-term outcomes in children seeking acute care for asthma in the ED. Future efforts remain in targeting the sustainability of improved outcomes beyond 6 months.

This study evaluated the potential for paper-based request forms to transmit severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to laboratory staff in order to make recommendations for dealing with hospital paperwork in a post-COVID-19 world. Methods: Paper-based forms were tracked from the time of test ordering until the release of the pathology report by calculating the time taken for the forms to reach the laboratory, and the exposure of each staff group to forms received from both high and moderate COVID-19 risk areas. Results: Four hundred and thirty-two (83%) of 520 forms were received in the laboratory within 24 h. The remaining 88 (17%) forms took 24 h to be handled by laboratory personnel.

Objective To know the factors for recanalisation following Deep Vein Thrombosis. Method This is a single institution based retrospective-prospective analytical study encompassing all ultrasonologically diagnosed cases of Deep Vein Thrombosis in adults from January 2015 to November 2017. All the cases were admitted with oral warfarin bridged by Heparin/ Enoxaparin and were discharged once International Normalization Ratio was in therapeutic range. The patients were followed up for three months with minimal of three outpatient followup. Best finding in the doppler ultrasonography (done by Acuson P500, Seimens) in relation to recanalisation was taken for the study. Result There were 67 cases of Deep Vein Thrombosis. Of these cases male to female ratio was 0.91. The mean age was 48.07. Most common extent was up to common femoral vein (47.8%) followed by upto popliteal vein (40.3%). Remaining 11.9% had extension upto iliac veins. There was no recanalisation in 2 cases (3%). Partial recanalisation was seen in 23 cases (34.3%) while complete recanalisation was seen in 42 cases (62.7%).

In transient expression experiments with Sf9 cells, chimeric GP64 proteins containing either a GPI anchor or TM domains from LdMNPV F or HIV-1 GP41 failed to localize to the cell surface and thus appear to be incompatible with either GP64 structure or cell transport. All of the mutant constructs detected at the cell surface mediated hemifusion (outer leaflet merger) upon low-pH treatment, but only those containing TM domains from CD4, GpA, OpMNPV GP64, and thogotovirus GP75 mediated pore formation and complete membrane fusion activity. This supports a model in which partial fusion (hemifusion) proceeds by a mechanism that is independent of the TM domain and the TM domain participates in the enlargement or expansion of fusion pores after hemifusion. GP64 proteins containing heterologous TM domains mediated virion budding with dramatically differing levels of efficiency.

Psychological consequences of historical trauma may contribute to health disparities. PURPOSE: Here, we investigate whether historical trauma predicts changes in psychological stress associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in AI adults. Based on the stress-sensitization theory, we hypothesize that greater historical trauma will predict greater increases in levels of psychological stress from before the onset of the pandemic to after. METHOD: Our analytic sample consisted of 205 AI adults. We measured historical trauma and levels of psychological stress before and after the onset of the pandemic. RESULTS: Using hierarchical regression models controlling for age, biological sex, income, symptoms of depression and anxiety, psychological stress at Time 1, COVID-19 specific stress, and childhood trauma, we found that greater historical trauma preceding the pandemic predicted greater increases in psychological stress (? = 0.38, t = 5.17 p < .01, &#916;R2 = 0.12), and levels of social support interacted with historical trauma to predict changes in psychological stress (? = -0.19, t = -3.34, p = .001, &#916;R2 = 0.04). The relationship between historical trauma and changes in stress was significant for individuals with low levels of social support. CONCLUSIONS: Historical trauma may contribute to AI mental health disparities, through heightened psychological stress responses to life stressors and social support appears to moderate this relationship.","output":"Historical trauma and social support as predictors of psychological stress responses in American Indian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women worldwide and the most common cause of cancer-related death.

We proposed the necessary adjustments in the configuration to improve the dispersion on surfaces and the effectiveness of the developed equipment. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the present technology with a chamber having six nebulizer nozzles were performed and validated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and experimental tests were conducted using the method Water-Sensitive Paper (WSP), with an exposure to the biocidal agent for 10 and 30 s. After evaluation, a new passage procedure for the chamber with six nozzles and a new configuration of the disinfection chamber were proposed. In the chamber with six nozzles, a deficiency was identified in its central region, where the suspended droplet concentration was close to zero. However, with the new passage procedure, there was a significant increase in wettability of the surface. With the proposition of the chamber with 12 nozzles, the suspended droplet concentration in different regions increased, with an average increase of 266%. The experimental results of the new configuration proved that there was an increase in wettability at all times of exposure, and it was more significant for an exposure of 30 s. Additionally, even in different passage procedures, there were no significant differences in the results for an exposure of 10 s, thereby showing the effectiveness of the new configuration or improved spraying and wettability by the biocidal agent, as well as in minimizing the impact caused by human factor in the performance of the disinfection technology.","output":"Numerical and experimental analyses for the improvement of surface instant decontamination technology through biocidal agent dispersion: Potential of application during pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 epidemic grows and there are clinical trials of antivirals. There is an opportunity to complement these trials with investigation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) because an ARB (losartan) was effective in murine influenza pneumonia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our innovative design includes: ARBs; alignment with the WHO Ordinal Scale (primary endpoint) to align with other COVID-19 trials; joint longitudinal analysis; and predictive biomarkers (angiotensins I, 1-7, II and ACE1 and ACE2). Our hypothesis is: ARBs decrease the need for hospitalisation, severity (need for ventilation, vasopressors, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or renal replacement therapy) or mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 infected adults. Our two-pronged multicentre pragmatic observational cohort study examines safety and effectiveness of ARBs in (1) hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 and (2) out-patients already on or not on ARBs. The primary outcome will be evaluated by ordinal logistic regression and main secondary outcomes by both joint longitudinal modelling analyses. We will compare rates of hospitalisation of ARB-exposed versus not ARB-exposed patients. We will also determine whether continuing ARBs or not decreases the primary outcome. Based on published COVID-19 cohorts, assuming 15% of patients are ARB-exposed, a total sample size of 497 patients can detect a proportional OR of 0.5 (alpha=0.05, 80% power) comparing WHO scale of ARB-exposed versus non-ARB-exposed patients.

Here, we studied humoral and cellular immune responses to wild type SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern in a cohort of 121 BNT162b2 mRNA-vaccinated health care workers (HCW). Twenty-three HCW recovered from mild COVID-19 disease and exhibited a recall response with high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific functional antibodies and virus-specific T cells after a single vaccination. Specific immune responses were also detected in seronegative HCW after one vaccination, but a second dose was required to reach high levels of functional antibodies and cellular immune responses in all individuals. Vaccination-induced antibodies cross-neutralized the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the neutralizing capacity and Fc-mediated functionality against B.1.351 was consistently 2- to 4-fold lower than to the homologous virus. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with peptide pools spanning the mutated S regions of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to detect cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with variants. Importantly, we observed no differences in CD4+ T-cell activation in response to variant antigens, indicating that the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins do not escape T-cell-mediated immunity elicited by the wild type S protein. In conclusion, this study shows that some variants can partially escape humoral immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or BNT162b2 vaccination, but S-specific CD4+ T-cell activation is not affected by the mutations in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern partially escape humoral but not T-cell responses in COVID-19 convalescent donors and vaccinees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nasopharyngeal swab is a gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

Although coming from the same family of viruses and sharing certain transmissibility factors, the local health institutions in China had no experience with this new virus, subsequently named SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on their prior experience with the 2003 SARS epidemic, health authorities in China recognized the need for personal protective equipment (PPE). Existing PPE and protocols were limited and reflected early experience with SARS; however, as additional PPE supplies became available, designated COVID-19 hospitals in Hubei Province adopted the World Health Organization guidelines for Ebola to create a protocol specific for treating patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: This article describes the PPE and protocol for its safe and effective deployment and the implementation of designated hospital units for COVID-19 patients.

Israel, similar to all other nations, was forced to cope with the unknown. Flattening the curve of infections has become a common term among specialists and decision makers, while explaining restricting measurements taken toward the population. Israelis, who had previously learned to deal with life under constant security threat, are now facing a new reality. The purpose of the study was to check how Israelis are psychologically affected by and coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 925 Israelis divided into three groups: ages 18C29, 30C59, and 60C88. The data were collected between March 31 and April 8, 2020, when it was already clear that this is a global plague, the country's borders were closed, and the government's directive for citizens was to remain at home while imposing limitations on the public and private sectors. The current study examined psychological distress among the three age groups as well as the associations between levels of distress, resilience, and coping strategies. Levels of distress were measured via the BSI-18 that measures anxiety, depression, and somatization. Resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson CD-RISC scale. Coping was measured by the short version of the COPE. Psychological distress was associated with being in a younger age group, being a woman, having economic concerns, use of emotion and problem focused coping, and lower resilience. The study also found that concern for the health of family members was the strongest concern among all age groups but was highest among the younger age group. It was also found that those in the younger age group suffered from higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatization compared to the older age group. The middle age group suffered from elevated levels of anxiety and somatization compared to the older age group. Although the older age group was the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, in this study age was found to be a protective factor from psychological distress. The results of the study suggest the need to consider the younger age group as a risk group, which hence needs to be addressed as the focus of intervention programs. It appears that the concern for their loved ones takes a heavy toll on the younger generation, and this should be considered a major source of stress.","output":"Mental Health and Coping in the Shadow of the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Israeli Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 threatens global public health, and there is an urgent public health need to assess acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

Four hundred symptomatic healthcare workers will be included in the COVID-SER study. The values obtained from a control cohort included during the prepandemic time will be used as reference. A workflow was set up to study serological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate antibody neutralisation capacity in patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests will be assessed using molecular detection of the virus as a reference.

Emergency medical service (EMS) providers serve a critical role in responding to opioid overdose for individuals living in rural or remote areas who experience opioid overdoses. They are often first at the scene of an overdose and are sometimes the only health care provider in contact with an overdose patient who either did not survive or refused additional care. As such, EMS providers have valuable perspectives to share on the causes and consequences of the opioid crisis in rural communities. METHODS: EMS providers attending a statewide EMS conference serving those from greater Minnesota and surrounding states were invited to take a 2-question survey asking them to reflect upon what they believed to be the causes of the opioid crisis and what they saw as the solutions to the opioid crisis. Results were coded and categorized using a Consensual Qualitative Research approach. RESULTS: EMS providers perceptions on causes of the opioid crisis were categorized into 5 main domains: overprescribing, ease of access, socioeconomic vulnerability, mental health concerns, and lack of resources and education. Responses focused on solutions to address the opioid crisis were categorized into 5 main domains: need for increased education, enhanced opioid oversight, increased access to treatment programs, alternative therapies for pain management, and addressing socioeconomic vulnerabilities. CONCLUSION: Along with the recognition that the opioid crisis was at least partially caused by overprescribing, rural EMS providers who participated in this study recognized the critical role of social determinants of health in perpetuating opioid-related harm. Participants in this study reported that education and increased access to treatment facilities and appropriate pain management, along with recognition of the role of social determinants of health in opioid dependency, were necessary steps to address the opioid crisis.","output":"Rural Emergency Medical Service Providers Perceptions on the Causes of and Solutions to the Opioid Crisis: A Qualitative Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Almost existing anti-viral drugs are only organic molecules that are able to circumvent the system the virus works with, which leaves it facing the immune system of our bodies and then kills it.

This research aims to prepare silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) by the green method depending on the reaction of the silver nitrate (safe for humans) with the phoenix dactylifera extract (safe for humans) and then coated with the hydroxychloroquine (HQ, known antiviral drug).

In addition, (iii) silver nanoparticle is much smaller than the size of the virus which qualifies it to cross into the virus and change the structure of RNA. Furthermore, (iv) it is possible for silver to interact with the amino and carboxylic ends in the virus proteins. The results of TCID50 shows that the prepared nano drug is able to reduce the viability of covid-19 to about 22% using 400 mg/ml of AgNPs/HQ.

Much less attention is paid to worse diagnostics, i.e. a comprehensive assessment of all diseases and general condition. This favors treatment only in lifethreatening situations (mild cases are delayed), and thus palliative treatment dominates over radical one.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Following the German study, the present paper shows significant deviations in TUB decision, where the co-morbidity (including AIDS, tuberculosis or COVID-19) cause the failure of the treatment of the underlying disease. The retrospective analysis especially included patients with two proliferative processes: endogenous (mutant clone / host clones) and exogenous/xenogenic (microbes). RESULTS 100 patients with complete history were enrolled in the study, six of whom were selected with survival-relevant deviations in the TUB decisions. The main issues were poor or late diagnosis of a chronic disease, the lack of proper grading and differentiation of symptoms, and thus distinguishing the most life-threatening process. CONCLUSIONS Infection with SARS-CoV-2, AIDS or even tuberculosis, or the second neoplasm cannot be analyzed in a superficial way and thus be an excuse for disqualification from cancer treatment. On the other hand, as in the German study, the most important causes of deviations were patient expectations, death, comorbidities or treatment side effects.

Moreover, we found that N-GFs co-cultured with exosomes showed a great increase in PCNA and Bcl-2 levels, and a moderate increase in Ki67 levels. By contrast, the levels of Bax were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that exosomes derived from idiopathic gingival fibroma fibroblasts are involved in the regulation of gingival fibroblast proliferation and apoptosis.","output":"Exosomes derived from idiopathic gingival fibroma fibroblasts regulate gingival fibroblast proliferation and apoptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest the recent article of Baig and Sanders1 regarding the neurological manifestations and the possible neuroinvasive routes opted by SARS-CoV-2.

Yet, despite its well-known relationship with survival, it is still unclear as to which health conditions are actually taken into account when making an individual assessment of one's own health. The aim of this paper is to assess the influence of four objective health conditions C IADLs, ADLs, chronic diseases, and depression C in predicting self-perceived health among Europeans by age group (50C64 and 65C79) and by sex. Classification trees (J48 algorithm), which pertains to the emerging Machine Learning techniques, were applied to predict self-perceived health according to the four abovementioned objective health conditions of European individuals in the sixth wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) (n = 55,611). The four variables present different degrees of relevance in establishing predictions of self-perceived health values by age and by sex. Before the age of 65, chronic diseases have the greatest importance, while IADL limitations are more important in the 65C79 age group. Likewise, ADL limitations are more important for women free of chronic diseases in the 50C64 age group; however, these differences disappear among women in the older group. There is an evident degree of interplay between the objective health indicators of chronic diseases, ADLs, IADLs, and depression when predicting self-perceived health with a high level of accuracy. This interplay implies that self-perceived health summarizes different health conditions depending on age. Gender differences are only evident for the younger age group, whereas construction of self-perceived is the same for women and men among the older group. Therefore, none of these four indicators on its own is able to totally substitute self-perceived health.","output":"What influences individual perception of health?

BNT162b2 effectiveness against symptomatic BA.1 infection was highest at 46.6% (95% CI: 33.4-57.2%) in the first three months after the second dose, but then declined to [~]10% or below thereafter. Effectiveness rapidly rebounded to 59.9% (95% CI: 51.2-67.0%) in the first month after the booster dose, but then started to decline again. BNT162b2 effectiveness against symptomatic BA.2 infection was highest at 51.7% (95% CI: 43.2-58.9%) in the first three months after the second dose, but then declined to [~]10% or below thereafter. Effectiveness rapidly rebounded to 43.7% (95% CI: 36.5-50.0%) in the first month after the booster dose, but then declined again. Effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization and death was in the range of 70-80% any time after the second dose, and was greater than 90% after the booster dose. Similar patterns of protection were observed for the mRNA-1273 vaccine. mRNA vaccines provide only moderate and short-lived protection against symptomatic Omicron infections, with no discernable differences in protection against either the BA.1 or BA.2 subvariants.

Their income comes mainly from charges for take-offs and landings of airplanes, passenger charges, and commercial and restaurant activity. In this paper, the authors attempt to estimate the level of losses incurred by six Polish airports in relation to passenger charges. Based on the data for the years 2015C2019, the forecasts of passenger flows for the year 2020 were estimated using the seasonality indicator method, the method of one-name period trends, and models of linear trends with seasonality. Research has shown that the total losses of the examined airports for the year 2020 amounted to approximately 290 million EUR, and these are losses resulting only from the lack of fees charged for servicing passengers at the airports.","output":"COVID-19 PandemicFinancial Consequences for Polish AirportsSelected Aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are living in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, which also treated as 4IR or Industry 4.0.

To limit the rapid spread locally and nationwide, the Chinese government locked down Wuhan city on January 23 and began implementing nationwide intensive community screening on February 16. METHOD: To assess the effectiveness of city lockdown and intensive community screening, we built a modified SIR model by introducing an &#945; value into the classic SIR model. The &#945; value represents the proportion of infected individuals who are not effectively isolated from susceptible individuals at a given time point. RESULTS: The accuracy of the modified SIR model was validated using data from Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. The lockdown of Wuhan city substantially reduced the &#945; value for the rest of China excluding Hubei province, while only slightly reducing the &#945; value for the city itself. Intensive community screening rapidly reduced the &#945; value for Wuhan. CONCLUSION: City lockdown was efficient in controlling the spread of the epidemic from Wuhan to the rest of the country. Nationwide intensive community screening was extremely effective in suppressing the spread locally within Wuhan city. These experiences should urgently be shared with other countries to help halt the progressing worldwide pandemic.","output":"City lockdown and nationwide intensive community screening are effective in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic: Analysis based on a modified SIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogenic New World orthohantaviruses cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), a severe immunopathogenic disease in humans manifested by pulmonary edema and respiratory distress, with case fatality rates approaching 40%. High levels of inflammatory mediators are present in the lungs and systemic circulation of HCPS patients. Previous studies have provided insights into the pathophysiology of HCPS. However, the longitudinal correlations of innate and adaptive immune responses and disease outcomes remain unresolved. This study analyzed serial immune responses in 13 HCPS cases due to Sin Nombre orthohantavirus (SNV), with 11 severe cases requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment and two mild cases. We measured viral load, levels of various cytokines, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). We found significantly elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and PAI-1 in five end-stage cases. There was no difference between the expression of active uPA in survivors and decedents cases. However, total uPA in decedents cases was significantly higher compared to survivors. In some end-stage cases, uPA was refractory to PAI-1 inhibition as measured by zymography, where uPA and PAI-1 were strongly correlated to lymphocyte counts and IFN-. We also found bacterial co-infection influencing the etiology and outcome of immune response in two cases. Unsupervised Principal Component Analysis and hierarchical cluster analyses resolved separate waves of correlated immune mediators expressed in one case patient due to a sequential co-infection of bacteria and SNV. Overall, a robust proinflammatory immune response, characterized by an imbalance in T helper 17 (Th17) and regulatory T-cells (Treg) subsets, was correlated with dysregulated inflammation and mortality.

While the association between elevated SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (VLs) (i.e. upper respiratory tract (URT) and peripheral blood (PB)) and increased COVID-19 severity has been reported, data remain largely unavailable for some disproportionately impacted racial/ethnic groups, particularly for American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. As such, we determined the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 VL dynamics and disease severity in a diverse cohort of hospitalized patients. Results presented here are for study participants (n = 94, ages 21-88 years) enrolled in a prospective observational study between May and October 2020 who had SARS-CoV-2 viral clades 20A, C, and G. Based on self-reported race/ethnicity and sample size distribution, the cohort was stratified into two groups: (AI/AN, n = 43) and all other races/ethnicities combined (non-AI/AN, n = 51). SARS-CoV-2 VLs were quantified in the URT and PB on days 0-3, 6, 9, and 14. The strongest predictor of severe COVID-19 in the study population was the mean VL in PB (OR = 3.34; P = 2.00  10-4). The AI/AN group had the following: (1) comparable co-morbidities and admission laboratory values, yet more severe COVID-19 (OR = 4.81; P = 0.014); (2) a 2.1 longer duration of hospital stay (P = 0.023); and (3) higher initial and cumulative PB VLs during severe disease (P = 0.025).

However, OAHR continues to face several challenges, including high variability of the Arabic script and its intrinsic characteristics such as cursiveness, ligatures, and diacritics, the unlimited variation in human handwriting, and the lack of large public databases. In this paper, we introduce a novel context-aware model based on deep neural networks to address the challenges of recognizing offline handwritten Arabic text, including isolated digits, characters, and words. Specifically, we propose a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that contextually extracts optimal features and employs batch normalization and dropout regularization parameters. This aims to prevent overfitting and further enhance generalization performance when compared to conventional deep learning models. We employ a number of deep stacked-convolutional layers to design the proposed Deep CNN (DCNN) architecture. The model is extensively evaluated and shown to demonstrate excellent classification accuracy when compared to conventional OAHR approaches on a diverse set of six benchmark databases, including MADBase (Digits), CMATERDB (Digits), HACDB (Characters), SUST-ALT (Digits), SUST-ALT (Characters), and SUST-ALT (Names). A further experimental study is conducted on the benchmark Arabic databases by exploiting transfer learning (TL)-based feature extraction which demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model in relation to state-of-the-art VGGNet-19 and MobileNet pre-trained models.

We merge data on EU-28 outward FDI with data on COVID-19 per capita infection and death rates to analyze their association with the topology of the FDI network. Our estimates reveal that countries most exposed to the COVID-19 outbreak are those characterized by a more central role in the global production network. This result is robust to the use of alternative measures of network centrality, and to the possible influence of the 2008 financial crisis on the structure of the global production network.

In the first module, we have used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to extract features from the chest CT images. In the second module, we have used a bi-stage feature selection (FS) approach to find out the most relevant features for the prediction of COVID and non-COVID cases from the chest CT images. At the first stage of FS, we have applied a guided FS methodology by employing two filter methods: Mutual Information (MI) and Relief-F, for the initial screening of the features obtained from the CNN model. In the second stage, Dragonfly algorithm (DA) has been used for the further selection of most relevant features. The final feature set has been used for the classification of the COVID-19 and non-COVID chest CT images using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed model has been tested on two open-access datasets: SARS-CoV-2 CT images and COVID-CT datasets and the model shows substantial prediction rates of 98.39% and 90.0% on the said datasets respectively.

It is not known if the THRIVE score predicts outcomes with the Solitaire endovascular stroke treatment device. AIMS To validate the relationship between the THRIVE score and outcomes after treatment with the Solitaire endovascular stroke treatment device. METHODS The study conducted a retrospective analysis of the prospective SWIFT and STAR trials to examine the relationship between THRIVE and outcomes after treatment with the Solitaire device. We examined the relationship between THRIVE and clinical outcomes (good outcome or death at 90 days) among patients in SWIFT and STAR. Receiver-operator characteristics curve analysis was used to compare THRIVE score performance with other stroke prediction scores. Multivariable modeling was used to confirm the independence of the THRIVE score from procedure-specific predictors (successful recanalization or device used) and other predictors of functional outcome. RESULTS The THRIVE score strongly predicts good outcome and death among patients treated with the Solitaire device in SWIFT and STAR (Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test for trend P < 0001 for good outcome, P = 001 for death). In receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve comparisons, totaled health risks in vascular events score is superior to Stroke Prognostication using Age and NIH Stroke Scale score-100 (P < 0001) and performed similarly to Houston Intra-Arterial Therapy score (HIAT) (P = 098) and HIAT-2 (P = 054). In multivariable models, THRIVE's prediction of good outcome is not altered after controlling for recanalization or after controlling for device used. The THRIVE score remains a strong independent predictor after controlling for the above predictors together with time to procedure, rate of symptomatic haemorrhage, and use of general anesthesia. Of note, use of general anesthesia was not an independent predictor of outcome in SWIFT + STAR after controlling for totaled health risks in vascular events and other factors. CONCLUSIONS The THRIVE score strongly predicts clinical outcome and mortality in patients treated with the Solitaire device in the SWIFT and STAR trials. The lack of interaction between THRIVE and procedure-specific elements such as vessel recanalization or device choice makes the THRIVE score a reasonable candidate for use as a patient selection criterion in stroke clinical trials.","output":"The THRIVE score strongly predicts outcomes in patients treated with the Solitaire device in the SWIFT and STAR trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis is among the leading causes of death from infectious diseases and affects many organ systems, including the skeleton. Skeletal tuberculosis is an extrapulmonary stage of tuberculosis, which occurs after the early and post-primary pulmonary stages of the disease.

These preparations date to the pre-antibiotic era, and were provided by the Pathological-Anatomical Collection in the Fools Tower of the Natural History Museum Vienna (PASiN-NHM). We investigated macerated samples of 20 vertebral bodies, 19 femoral heads, and 20 tibiae of a total of 59 individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis from the nineteenth and early twentieth century. 10 femora and 10 tibiae from body donors that did not exhibit signs of infection and 10 (unaffected) vertebrae kept at the PASiN-NHM were studied as controls. The affected regions of the bone samples (and the corresponding regions of the control bones) were analyzed by microcomputed tomography using a Viscom X 8060 II system. Obtained images were analyzed semi-quantitatively. In samples with tuberculosis, independent of the investigated skeletal region, trabecular defects and decreased trabecular thickness were observed. Cortical porosity was seen in affected vertebrae and tibia; in tuberculous tibiae (but not in the femora) cortical thickness was decreased. In half of the individuals, cortical sclerosis was present; signs of ankylosis were observed mainly at the femoral heads affected with tuberculosis. We conclude that a combination of several alterations at the trabecular compartment could be suggestive of the presence of tuberculosis in historic skeletal remains.

Little, however, is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sustainable supplier selection particularly in the manufacturing sector. In this paper, we present pandemic response strategies as a significant aspect of the COVID-19 pandemics impact and investigate the relative importance of such strategies in SSS implementation. Drawing upon a rich data pool from the Nigerian manufacturing sector, we proposed an integrated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology to analyse the interrelationships between the COVID-19 pandemic response strategies and Triple-Bottom-Line (TBL) criteria for SSS. Our analysis shows that economic criteria and pandemic response strategies are the highest ranked in terms of relative importance and thereby pinpoints the need for manufacturing firms to emphasize such during SSS implementation in the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, quality, cost, use of personal protective equipment and use of information technologies for customer demand prediction are inferred as highly significant in SSS implementation in the COVID-19 pandemic era. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed methodology was validated by a comparative analysis with other MCDM methods.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of AT compared to Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. METHODS: StudyCov is a monocentric cross-sectional study. A SARS-CoV-2 screening facility was set up in the Bordeaux University health campus from October 28th to November 20th 2020. Students willing to have a RT-PCR test (ARGENE SARS-CoV-2 R-GENE, BioMrieux, France) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were also offered the Abbott Panbio&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 antigenic rapid test. All participants attending the screening facility with an AT in addition to RT-PCR and having signed an informed consent were included in the study. The main objective was to assess performance of AT as compared with RT-PCR in the recruited population. Secondary objectives dealt with the analysis of the main objective stratified by current symptoms and risk exposure. A sensitivity analysis with different RT-PCR cycle thresholds was included. RESULTS: RT-PCR and AT results were available for 692 subjects. Overall sensitivity and specificity of AT tests were respectively 63.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 49.0 - 76.4) and 100% (95% CI: 99.4 - 100). In the asymptomatic sub-group, they were respectively 35.0% (95% CI: 15.4% - 59.2%) and 100% (95% CI: 99.3 - 100). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the poor sensitivity of AT in asymptomatic subjects, specificity being however excellent. The performance results fall below the World Health Organization recommendation of 80% sensitivity and question using AT in general population, especially when asymptomatic.","output":"Accuracy of COVID-19 rapid antigenic tests compared to RT-PCR in a student population: The StudyCov study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As if Covid-19 and the trade war hasnt done enough to upend global business between the US and China, yet another major transformation is afoot: the launch of Chinas sovereign (i.e., central-bank offered) digital currency (CBDC).

Emerging results indicate a dysregulated immune response. Given the role of CCR5 in immune cell migration and inflammation, we investigated the impact of CCR5 blockade via the CCR5-specific antibody leronlimab on clinical, immunological, and virological parameters in severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In March 2020, 10 terminally ill, critical COVID-19 patients received two doses of leronlimab via individual emergency use indication. We analyzed changes in clinical presentation, immune cell populations, inflammation, as well as SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia before and 14 days after treatment. RESULTS: Over the 14-day study period, six patients survived, two were extubated, and one discharged. We observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy in all donors by day 7. Compared with the baseline, we observed a concomitant statistically significant reduction in plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and resolution of SARS-CoV2 plasma viremia (pVL). Furthermore, the increase in the CD8 percentage was inversely correlated with the reduction in pVL (r = -0.77, p = 0.0013).

Most recently CoVID-19 has killed about half million people (27th of June, 2020). Susceptibility to this disease appears to differ markedly across different societies but the factors underlying this variability are not known. Given that prevalence of toxoplasmosis in human societies may serve as a proxy for hygiene, and it also exerts both direct and immune-mediated antiviral effects, we hypothesize a negative covariation between toxoplasmosis and measures of the CoVID-19 pandemic across countries. We obtained aged-adjusted toxoplasmosis prevalence of pregnant women from the literature. Since the differences in the CoVID-19 morbidity and mortality may depend on the different timing of the epidemics in each country, we applied the date of first documented CoVID-19 in each country as a proxy of susceptibility, with a statistical control for population size effects. Using these two indices, we show a highly significant negative co-variation between the two pandemics across 86 countries. Then, considering that the wealth of nations often co-varies with the prevalence of diseases, we introduced GDP per capita into our model. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis co-varies negatively, while the date of first CoVID-19 co-varies positively with GDP per capita across countries. Further, to control for the strong spatial autocorrelation among countries, we carried out a Spatial Structure Analyses of the relationships between the date of first CoVID-19, prevalence of toxoplasmosis, and GDP per capita. Results of this analysis did not confirm a direct causal relationship between toxoplasmosis and susceptibility to the CoVID-19 pandemics. As far as an analysis of observational data let us to suggest, it appears that the interaction between CoVID-19 and toxoplasmosis is mediated by GDP per capita and spatial effects.

However, disparities still exist in occurrence and mortality rates among specific racial/ethnic groups in the USA.

We carry out analysis on a secondary dataset (2017 Natality) obtained from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This was analyzed using descriptive, bivariate, and regression analysis. This cross-sectional study obtained sociodemographic information-maternal race, independent and confounder variables (explanatory variables), and the occurrence of Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease (outcome variable) within the reporting States and U.S. territories. There was a report of 3,864,754 live birth out of 325,719,178 USA races and origin populations for the 2017 review year. A total number of 2130 CCHD birth was reported to have occurred out of the 3,8161,947 live births. The Chi-square test showed a statistically significant association between maternal race and the occurrence of CCHD. As well as, the following confounders mother's age, mother's nativity, combined gestation, pre-pregnancy diabetes, pre-pregnancy hypertension, month prenatal care began, smoking status, and Nutrition (WIC) all having a p-value of 0.01 each, respectively. Unadjusted odds ratios at 95 % CI of the association between maternal race and CCHD were 56 % higher among American Indian and Alaska Native women (95% CI 1.13-2.15) than the white racial group. In addition, the Odds were 13% (95% CI 0.78-0.98) and 46% (95% CI 0.43-0.66) less likely amongst Black and Asian or Pacific Islander, respectively. The odds were 402% markedly high for pre-pregnancy diabetes, 159% for pre-pregnancy hypertension, 38 % for smoking status, and 44%, 159%, and 42% respectively for prenatal care from 1st to 2nd months, 4th to 6th months, and 7th to the final month, when compared to no prenatal care. The odds of having a CCHD was 16% less likely for mothers on Nutrition (mothers on WIC) (95% CI 0.77-0.92), 19% (95% CI 0.73-0.90) for mothers age (under 35 years) category, and likewise for mothers born outside of the USA at 39% (95% CI 1.22-1.56). On Adjustment for confounders, the OR for this relationship was on the higher side for many of the variables. The odds of occurrence of CCHD were 59 % higher amongBlack (95% CI 1.27-2.0), 35% among AIAN (95 % CI 1.05-1.74), and 92 % among American Indian and Alaska Native (95 % CI 1.26-2.93) racial categories whencompared to Asian or Pacific Islander categories. The odds of having a CCHD was also elevated on adjustment for mothers born outside of the USA at 39% (95% CI 1.22-1.56), and at from the 7th to final month 94% (95% CI 1.38-2.73). However, the odds were insignificant in other categories and variables. These estimates suggest theoccurrence of a CCHD is associated with the analyzed independent predictor and confounder variables.

CC motive chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), a chemokine originally described as a chemotactic agent for monocytes, is involved in inflammation, coagulation activation and neoangiogenesis. We investigated the association of CCL2 levels with coagulation derangement and respiratory impairment in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 281 patients admitted to two hospitals in Italy with COVID-19. Among them, CCL2 values were compared in different groups (identified according to D-dimer levels and the lowest PaO(2)/FiO(2) recorded during hospital stay, P/F(nadir)) by Jonckheere-Terpstra tests; linear regression analysis was used to analyse the relationship between CCL2 and P/F(nadir). We performed Mann-Whitney test and Kaplan-Meier curves to investigate the role of CCL2 according to different clinical outcomes (survival and endotracheal intubation [ETI]). RESULTS: CCL2 levels were progressively higher in patients with increasing D-dimer levels and with worse gas exchange impairment; there was a statistically significant linear correlation between log CCL2 and log P/F(nadir). CCL2 levels were significantly higher in patients with unfavourable clinical outcomes; Kaplan-Meier curves for the composite outcome death and/or need for ETI showed a significantly worse prognosis for patients with higher (> median) CCL2 levels. CONCLUSIONS: CCL2 correlates with both indices of activation of the coagulation cascade and respiratory impairment severity, which are likely closely related in COVID-19 pathology, thus suggesting that CCL2 could be involved in the thromboinflammatory events characterizing this disease.","output":"C-C motive chemokine ligand 2 and thromboinflammation in COVID-19-associated pneumonia: A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The western mesoregion of the state of Santa Catarina (SC), Southern Brazil, was heavily affected as a whole by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2021.

METHODS Patients with severe maxillary atrophy underwent Le Fort I osteotomy associated to fresh-frozen interpositional bone allografts. At 7 months after reconstructive procedure, 2 biopsies for each patient have been taken, and in the same surgical procedure, endosseous implants were placed. Five months afterward, abutments were connected for the final prosthodontic restauration. Each patient was evaluated at 1-year follow-up after prosthetic loading. RESULTS At 1-year follow-up after functional prosthetic loading, no infection of the allografts or implant failure has been reported. Clinical and radiologic follow-up showed no sign of bone resorption in all the osteotomic sites and in the grafted areas.

However, in physiological education, the effectiveness of combined online teaching and offline teaching models remains poorly assessed. The present study aims at providing an assessment to the hybrid teaching model. METHODS: The study was performed among undergraduate medical students of Class 2017 ~ 2019 in the Physiology course in Harbin Medical University during 2018-2020. Based on established offline teaching model with BOPPPS components in 2018, we incorporated online teaching contents into it to form a hybrid BOPPPS teaching model (HBOPPPS, in brief), preliminarily in 2019 and completely in 2020. HBOPPPS effectiveness was assessed through comparing the final examination scores of both objective (multi-choice and single answer questions) and subjective (short and long essays) questions between classes taught with different modalities. RESULTS: The final examination score of students in Class 2019 (83.9  0.5) who were taught with the HBOPPPS was significantly higher than that in Class 2017 (81.1  0.6) taught with offline BOPPPS and in Class 2018 (82.0  0.5) taught with immature HBOPPPS. The difference mainly attributed to the increase in average subjective scores (41.6  0.3 in Class 2019, 41.4  0.3 in Class 2018, and 38.2  0.4 in Class 2017).

In addition, 73.5% of the students appreciated the reproducibility of learning content and 54.2% valued the flexibility of HBOPPPS. Lastly, 61.7% of the students preferred the HBOPPPS relative to BOPPPS in future learning. CONCLUSIONS: HBOPPPS is likely a more effective teaching model and useful for enhancing effectiveness of Physiology teaching.

Aryl radicals are generated from arylhydrazines in air and captured by diaryl ditellurides, resulting in a selective formation of unsymmetrical diaryl tellurides with high yields.

Not everyone who has a SARS-CoV-2 infection gets symptoms;not everyone with symptoms gets tested;not all tests yield valid results. Therefore, even just estimating the incidence or prevalence of COVID-19 in particular occupational groups is difficult. Moreover, these selection pressures may be different for different occupational groups (e.g. health care workers may be more likely to be tested than some other occupations). In addition, unlike most other occupational exposures, you can get infected at work, or get the same infection at home, potentially yielding quite severe confounding by lifestyle and living conditions. These methodological issues are not insurmountable, but require careful study design and data analysis. In particular: (i) when not everyone is being tested, then comparisons between and within occupations can be biased, but this bias can be minimised using the test-negative design;and (ii) comparisons between occupations require careful and rigorous adjustment for work-related living conditions, i.e. the fact that workers in insecure low-paid jobs may also have a high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infections outside of the workplace.","output":"Methodological issues in studying occupational differences in risk of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in biotechnology have enabled us to assay human tissue and cells to a depth and resolution that was never possible before, redefining what we know as the biomarker, and how we define a disease.

Evidence states that tissue RAAS locally generates mediators with regulatory homeostatic functions, thus contributing, at some extent, to organ dysfunction or disease. Specifically, RAAS can be divided into the traditional RAAS pathway (or classic RAAS) mediated by angiotensin II (AII), and the non-classic RAAS pathway mediated by angiotensin 1C7. Both pathways operate in the heart and lung. In the heart, the classic RAAS plays a role in both hemodynamics and tissue remodeling associated with cardiomyocyte and endothelial dysfunction, leading to progressive functional impairment. Moreover, the local classic RAAS may predispose the onset of atrial fibrillation through different biological mechanisms involving inflammation, accumulation of epicardial adipose tissue, and electrical cardiac remodeling. In the lung, the classic RAAS regulates cell proliferation, immune-inflammatory response, hypoxia, and angiogenesis, contributing to lung injury and different pulmonary diseases (including COVID-19). Instead, the local non-classic RAAS counteracts the classic RAAS effects exerting a protective action on both heart and lung. Moreover, the non-classic RAAS, through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), mediates the entry of the etiological agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells. This may cause a reduction in ACE2 and an imbalance between angiotensins in favor of AII that may be responsible for the lung and heart damage. Drugs blocking the classic RAAS (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) are well known to exert a cardiovascular benefit. They are recently under evaluation for COVID-19 for their ability to block AII-induced lung injury altogether with drugs stimulating the non-classic RAAS. Herein, we discuss the available evidence on the role of RAAS in the heart and lung, summarizing all clinical data related to the use of drugs acting either by blocking the classic RAAS or stimulating the non-classic RAAS.","output":"The Role of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System in the Heart and Lung: Focus on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present work was to evaluate the tolerance of physiotherapy treatment implemented for patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and undergoing hip surgery Case-control study.

The adjusted Exponentially-Modified Gaussian (EMG) model was used to estimate the NOX emission in typical cities under regionally polluted YRD region.

This estimation has a good correlation with Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) emission with R more than 0.9 but lower results mainly due to the underestimation of NO2 VCD by TROPOMI in polluted areas. It was also found that the NOX emissions of Ningbo are higher than expected, which is closely related to massive ship emissions.

Despite the immense importance of such decisions, there remains a lack of understanding in the study of individual differences in police decision-making. Here, using a sample of senior police officers recruited from decision-making training events across the United Kingdom (n = 96), we used the Least-worst Uncertain Choice Inventory For Emergency Responses (LUCIFER) to measure the effect of maximization on both domain-specific (police) and domain-general (military) decisions. In line with a wealth of research on traditional consumer decisions, we found that police officers who were maximizers found decisions more difficult. Gender and previous military experience also influenced the process of decision-making. Specifically, police officers with military experience took more time to assess the situation but were faster to choose a course of action and commit to it. Female police officers also were slower to assess the situation.

We built a telerehabilitation system with virtual pick and place tasks for small scale hand movements, and designed a pilot study to find whether such exergaming as a telerehabilitation service provides comparable outcomes as an outpatient exergaming service. A non-randomized pilot trial was designed. Hospital outpatients (28/40) with Parkinson's disease were recruited. Those meeting the inclusion criteria were divided into two groups; seven outpatients were assigned to the home (H) group and 21 outpatients to the hospital (URI) group. Both groups received 10 days of exergaming over the course of 2 weeks, each daily session lasting a maximum of 1 h. Primary outcomes were clinical tests; Box and Blocks Test (BBT), Jebsen Hand Function Test (JHFT), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS part III) were carried out before and after the study. Secondary outcomes were hand kinematics and exergaming results; number of successfully moved objects and task time. Statistical analysis was carried out to find significant (p < 0.05) differences and Cohen's U3 was used to determine effect sizes. The differences between the groups in gender (p = 0.781), age (p = 0.192), and duration of the disease (p = 0.195) were tested with Bartlett's test and no statistical differences were found with an F test.

The current study further explores the involvement of inflammatory cells, systemic vascular stress, and 4-HNE in lethal COVID-19 using specific immunohistochemical analyses of the inflammatory cells within the vital organs obtained by autopsy of nine patients who died from aggressive SAR-CoV-2 infection. Besides 4-HNE, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) were analyzed alongside standard leukocyte biomarkers (CDs). All the immunohistochemical slides were simultaneously prepared for each analyzed biomarker. The results revealed abundant 4-HNE in the vital organs, but the primary origin of 4-HNE was sepsis-like vascular stress, not an oxidative burst of the inflammatory cells. In particular, inflammatory cells were often negative for 4-HNE, while blood vessels were always very strongly immunopositive, as was edematous tissue even in the absence of inflammatory cells. The most affected organs were the lungs with diffuse alveolar damage and the brain with edema and reactive astrocytes, whereas despite acute tubular necrosis, 4-HNE was not abundant in the kidneys, which had prominent SOD2. Although SOD2 in most cases gave strong immunohistochemical positivity similar to 4-HNE, unlike 4-HNE, it was always limited to the cells, as was MPO. Due to their differential expressions in blood vessels, inflammatory cells, and the kidneys, we think that SOD2 could, together with 4-HNE, be a potential link between a malfunctioning immune system, oxidative stress, and vascular stress in lethal COVID-19.","output":"Post-mortem Findings of Inflammatory Cells and the Association of 4-Hydroxynonenal with Systemic Vascular and Oxidative Stress in Lethal COVID-19 ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: The 2017-2018 influenza season in the US was marked by a high severity of illness, wide geographic spread, and prolonged duration compared with recent previous seasons, resulting in increased strain throughout acute care hospital systems. Objective: To characterize self-reported experiences and views of hospital capacity managers regarding the 2017-2018 influenza season in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted between April 2018 and January 2019 with a random sample of capacity management administrators responsible for throughput and hospital capacity at short-term, acute care hospitals throughout the US. Main Outcomes and Measures: Each participant's self-reported experiences and views regarding high patient volumes during the 2017-2018 influenza season, lessons learned, and the extent of hospitals' preparedness planning for future pandemic events. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and then analyzed using thematic content analysis. Outcomes included themes and subthemes. Results: A total of 53 key hospital capacity personnel at 53 hospitals throughout the US were interviewed; 39 (73.6%) were women, 48 (90.6%) had a nursing background, and 29 (54.7%) had been in the occupational role for more than 4 years. Participants' experiences were categorized into several domains: (1) perception of strain, (2) effects of influenza and influenza-like illness on staff and patient care, (3) immediate staffing and capacity responses to influenza and influenza-like illness, and (4) future staffing and capacity preparedness for influenza and influenza-like illness. Participants reported experiencing perceived strain associated with concerns about preparedness for seasonal influenza and influenza-like illness as well as concerns about staffing, patient care, and capacity, but future pandemic planning within hospitals was not reported as being a high priority. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this qualitative study suggest that during the 2017-2018 influenza season, there were systemic vulnerabilities as well as a lack of hospital preparedness planning for future pandemics at US hospitals.

Results: We observe a comparable reduction in working hours for both men and women during the spring lockdown. However, only the working hours of women recover and return to their pre-crisis level in summer 2020. Most surprisingly, having children has an accelerating effect on recovery for mothers but not for fathers. At the end of the observation period, fathers do not recover as fully as mothers do.

The median days from symptom onset to admission was 1 (IQR 0C2) in treatment and 3(IQR 1C5) in control group. The median days from symptom onset to start of lopinavir/ritonavir was 1(IQR 1C3). The NPS viral load reduction from baseline to day 7 was greater in treatment group. Viral load dropped from mean 6.5 log10 copies/ml (SD 2.1) on admission to mean 4.6 log10 copies/ml (SD 2.1) on day 7 in patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Viral load dropped from mean 6.4 log10 copies/ml (SD 1.8) on admission to mean 5.3 log10 copies/ml (SD 1.5) on day 7 in patient who did not receive lopinavir/ritonavir. However, the difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in viral load on day 10 and day 14 between the two groups. There was also no significant difference in time to symptom resolution, PCR negativity or duration of hospitalization. No patient in the cohort require oxygen or intensive care. Among those received treatment, 7(25.9%) patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms possibly drug adverse effects with self-limited nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, as compared to 9(17%) patients in control group. 1(3.7%) and 3(5.7%) patients in treatment and control group have mild deranged liver function. There was no significant difference in rate of gastrointestinal symptom or liver function derangement among the two groups. There was no QT interval prolongation or serious adverse effect noted in patients received treatment.ConclusionsThere was no statistically significant difference in NPS viral load clearance, time to symptom resolution, PCR negativity and duration of hospitalization between paediatric COVID-19 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and control. Self-limited gastrointestinal symptoms were common but use of lopinavir/ritonavir appeared to be safe in children with no serious side effect noted.","output":"Lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in paediatric patients with covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND New methods for identifying respiratory pathogens have led to several reports of a high yield of mixed infections in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The clinical impact of these findings has, however, not been fully evaluated. We aimed to compare patients with a pure bacterial etiology with those with findings of both bacteria and virus regarding severity of illness and length of hospital stay. METHODS Adults with CAP admitted to Karolinska University Hospital were studied prospectively (N = 184). Microbiological methods included cultures from blood, sputum and nasopharyngeal secretions; sputum samples analyzed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; nasopharyngeal specimens analyzed with polymerase chain reaction and serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and viruses common in the respiratory tract; and urine antigen assays for detecting pneumococcal and Legionella pneumophila antigens. The pneumonia severity index (PSI) was used to assess the severity of illness. RESULTS The likelihood of getting a score corresponding to PSI classes IV or V was higher in patients with findings of both bacteria and virus than in those with a bacterial pathogen alone (odds ratio 4.98, 95% confidence interval 2.09-11.89; p < 0.001). The median length of hospital stay was 7 days among patients with mixed infections and 4 days among those with a bacterial etiology alone (p = 0.018).

Household chaos, characterized by crowding, noise, and disorder in the home, may hinder efforts to obtain adequate amounts of movement behaviors. The COVID-19 outbreak impacted many families, and social distancing during this time may create conditions for more household chaos. Family routines can help establish order in the home and encourage an appropriate balance of movement behaviors, such as less screen-time and more sleep. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between household chaos and young child movement behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, and the role of family routines in this relationship. METHODS: A national online survey including 1836 mothers of preschoolers (3.0C5.9 years) was conducted during May 2020. Mothers reported demographic characteristics, household chaos, family routines, and the preschoolers movement behaviors during the outbreak. Mothers completed a household chaos questionnaire and were grouped into chaos categories (low, moderate/low, moderate/high, and high) for analysis. Linear regression was used to assess the association between chaos category, family routines, and movement behaviors with adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: Mothers were 35.9  4.1 years of age, middle income (47.8%), and preschoolers were 3.8  0.8 years of age. Most mothers reported their preschooler was less physically active (38.9%), slept the same amount of time (52.1%), and increased their screen-time (74.0%) after the COVID-19 outbreak. Preschoolers in the high chaos households performed less total PA ( = ? 0.36 days/week, 95% CI:-0.62 to ? 0.09, p = 0.008), slept less ( = ? 0.42 h, 95% CI:-0.59 to ? 0.25, p = 0.001) and had more screen-time ( = 0.69 h, 95% CI:0.45 to 0.92, p = 0.001) compared to those in low chaos households. In most chaos categories, having a bed-time ritual was related to more child sleep, and mothers who viewed routines as less/not important reported more preschooler screen-time compared to mothers who viewed routines as very important. CONCLUSION: Promoting bed-time rituals and prioritizing routines, even somewhat, may be related to an improved balance of child movement behaviors. Innovative measures are needed to support families during periods of disruption such as that experienced in the COVID-19 pandemic.

DESIGN: A multihospital retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS: All admissions (n=132 737) to paediatric wards of 18 purposely selected public hospitals in Kenya that joined a Clinical Information Network (CIN) between March 2014 and December 2020. OUTCOMES: Pulse oximetry use and oxygen prescription on admission; we performed growth-curve modelling to investigate the association of patient factors with study outcomes over time while adjusting for hospital factors. RESULTS: Overall, pulse oximetry was used in 48.8% (64 722/132 737) of all admission cases. Use rose on average with each month of participation in the CIN (OR: 1.11, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.18) but patterns of adoption were highly variable across hospitals suggesting important factors at hospital level influence use of pulse oximetry. Of those with pulse oximetry measurement, 7% (4510/64 722) had hypoxaemia (SpO(2) <90%). Across the same period, 8.6% (11 428/132 737) had oxygen prescribed but in 87%, pulse oximetry was either not done or the hypoxaemia threshold (SpO(2) <90%) was not met. Lower chest-wall indrawing and other respiratory symptoms were associated with pulse oximetry use at admission and were also associated with oxygen prescription in the absence of pulse oximetry or hypoxaemia. CONCLUSION: The adoption of pulse oximetry recommended in international guidelines for assessing children with severe illness has been slow and erratic, reflecting system and organisational weaknesses. Most oxygen orders at admission seem driven by clinical and situational factors other than the presence of hypoxaemia. Programmes aiming to implement pulse oximetry and oxygen systems will likely need a long-term vision to promote adoption, guideline development and adherence and continuously examine impact.","output":"Pulse oximetry adoption and oxygen orders at paediatric admission over 7 years in Kenya: a multihospital retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Food systems at all levels are experiencing various states of dysfunction and crisis, and in turn their governance contributes to other intensifying crises, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and the rapid expansion of dietary-related non-communicable diseases. In many jurisdictions governments at local, state and national levels are taking action to tackle some of the key challenges confronting food systems through a range of regulatory, legislative and fiscal measures. This article comprises a narrative review summarising recent relevant literature with a focus on the intersection between corporate power and public health. The review sought to identify some of the principal barriers for the design and support of healthy food systems and environments, as well as key reforms that can be adopted to address these barriers, with a focus on the role of local governments. RECENT FINDINGS: The review found that, where permitted to do so by authorising legislative and regulatory frameworks, and where political and executive leadership prioritises healthy and sustainable food systems, local governments have demonstrated the capacity to exercise legislative and regulatory powers, such as planning powers to constrain the expansion of the fast food industry. In doing so, they have been able to advance broader goals of public health and wellbeing, as well as support the strengthening and expansion of healthy and sustainable food systems. SUMMARY: Whilst local governments in various jurisdictions have demonstrated the capacity to take effective action to advance public health and environmental goals, such interventions take place in the context of a food system dominated by the corporate determinants of health. Accordingly, their wider health-promoting impact will remain limited in the absence of substantive reform at all levels of government.","output":"Barriers and Enablers for Healthy Food Systems and Environments: The Role of Local Governments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant morbidity and mortality across the US.

Determining which patients are at high risk of severe illness or mortality is essential for appropriate clinical decision making. We propose a novel severity score specifically for COVID-19 to help predict disease severity and mortality. Methods: 4,711 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. We derived a risk model using the first half of the cohort (n=2,355 patients) by logistic regression and bootstrapping methods. The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). The severity score was validated in a second half of 2,356 patients. Results: Mortality incidence was 26.4% in the derivation cohort and 22.4% in the validation cohort. A COVID-19 severity score ranging from 0 to 10, consisting of age, oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, blood urea nitrogen, C-Reactive protein, and the international normalized ratio was developed. A ROC curve analysis was performed in the derivation cohort achieved an AUC of 0.824 (95% CI 0.814-0.851) and an AUC of 0.798 (95% CI 0.789-0.818) in the validation cohort.

Our data demonstrate the exocytosis of virions from the trophoblast after exposure to HBV where the endocytosed HBV virions co-localized with an S100A10/AnxA2 complex and LC3, an autophagosome membrane marker.

Hence, at the scale of individual bivalves, we studied whether this advantage occurs in optimizing food intake over native bivalves. We investigated feeding current characteristics, in which potential differences may ultimately lead to a differential food intake. We compared feeding currents of the invasive epibenthic non-siphonate Pacific oyster to those of two native bivalve suspension feeders: the epibenthic siphonate blue mussel Mytilus edulis and the endobenthic siphonate common cockle Cerastoderma edule. Inhalant flow fields were studied empirically using digital particle image velocimetry and particle tracking velocimetry. Exhalant jet speeds were modelled for a range of exhalant-aperture cross-sectional areas as determined in the laboratory and a range of filtration rates derived from literature. Significant differences were found in inhalant and exhalant current velocities and properties of the inhalant flow field (acceleration and distance of influence). At comparable body weight, inhalant current velocities were lower in C. gigas than in the other species. Modelled exhalant jets were higher in C. gigas, but oriented horizontally instead of vertically as in the other species. Despite these significant differences and apparent morphological differences between the three species, absolute differences in feeding current characteristics were small and are not expected to lead to significant differences in feeding efficiency.","output":"Feeding current characteristics of three morphologically different bivalve suspension feeders, Crassostrea gigas, Mytilus edulis and Cerastoderma edule, in relation to food competition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Portomesenteric venous thrombosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Events of interests were 15 prespecified AESIs (non-haemorrhagic and haemorrhagic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, anaphylaxis, Bells palsy, myocarditis or pericarditis, narcolepsy, appendicitis, immune thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis (including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), Guillain-Barr syndrome, and transverse myelitis). Incidence rates of AESIs were stratified by age, sex, and database. Rates were pooled across databases using random effects meta-analyses and classified according to the frequency categories of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. RESULTS: Background rates varied greatly between databases. Deep vein thrombosis ranged from 387 (95% confidence interval 370 to 404) per 100 000 person years in UK CPRD GOLD data to 1443 (1416 to 1470) per 100 000 person years in US IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid data among women aged 65 to 74 years. Some AESIs increased with age. For example, myocardial infarction rates in men increased from 28 (27 to 29) per 100 000 person years among those aged 18-34 years to 1400 (1374 to 1427) per 100 000 person years in those older than 85 years in US Optum electronic health record data.

Our study shows that virtual care can provide efficient triaging in the counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. We also confirmed that the largest spread of the disease occurs in areas with a high population density as well as in areas with major airports. CONCLUSIONS: The use of virtual care presents promising potential in the fight against COVID-19. Virtual care is capable of reducing emergency room visits, conserving health care resources, and avoiding the spread of COVID-19 by treating patients remotely. We call for further adoption of virtual care by health systems across the United States and the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Interpreting COVID-19 and Virtual Care Trends: Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a present-day complex pandemic infection with unpredictable levels of morbidity and mortality in various global populations. COVID-19 is associated with the different comorbidities with its change in biological function such as causing heart dysfunction via deregulating ACE-2 receptor, gastrointestinal risk via causing vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, chronic kidney disease via proteinuria and hematuria, diabetes mellitus, liver injury via increasing ALT, AST and bilirubin level, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risk, and cancer risk. In this, we are focused on the COVID-19 connected with male infertility. Some of the studies show that the patients of COVID-19 are associated with impaired spermatogenesis. Impaired spermatogenesis via COVID-19 decreases the level of testosterone by disturbing cytokines such as TNF-&#945;, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12 and further, attenuates the sperm count. COVID-19 is causing inflammation via TNF-&#945; and interferons. IL-4 plays an eminent role in the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and leads to the disturbing pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as further cause's male infertility. Th2 activates the IL-4 through IgG and IgE and mediates apoptosis with the triggering of STAT signaling. The activated STAT signaling augments Batf/Irf4, and the Bach2/Batf pathway. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is activating the level of Th2 cells. So, we hypothesized that the augmented Th2 cells would disturb the level of IL-4, JAK-STAT signaling, Batf/Irf4, and Bach2/Batf pathway. The disturbed IL-4 decreases the level of the ACE-2 with the inflammation. This further leads to male infertility in COVID-19 patients. So, in this hypothesis, we focused on the role of IL-4 in COVID-19 patients associated with male infertility via Th2 cells and JAK-STAT signaling.","output":"The role of Interleukin-4 in COVID-19 associated male infertility - A hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vulnerability drives disaster lawdefining its successes and illustrating its failures. Although understanding vulnerability is critical to disaster law and scholarship, the literature lacks both an overarching analysis of the different aspects of vulnerability and a nuanced examination of the factors that shape disaster outcomes. This paper attempts to fill those holes.Despite its centrality to disaster law and policy, vulnerability often lurks in the shadows of a disaster, evident only once the worst is past and the bodies have been counted. The COVID-19 pandemic is a notable exception to this historical pattern: from the beginning of the pandemic, it has been clear that the virus poses different risks to different people, depending on different vulnerability variables. This most recent pandemic experience thus provides a useful vantage point for considering vulnerability in a more nuanced way and for illuminating how a data-driven approach to vulnerability could improve disaster policy more generally.Drawing on new empirical data, as well as experience from past disasters, we introduce and develop three dimensions of vulnerability and their implications for policymakers. First, we explore the geography of vulnerability. Using statistical analysis and GIS mapping, our team of public health, statistics, and legal experts develops perhaps the most sophisticated and detailed empirical tool ever deployed to understand disaster vulnerabilityan innovative COVID-19 vulnerability index that draws on a rich dataset and uses statistical modeling of case fatality rates to accurately identify the countrys most vulnerable counties. We then demonstrate how this vulnerability index could have been used to inform two critical and contentious policy decisions that occupied decision-makers from the onset of the pandemic: mask mandates and voter accommodations during the 2020 elections. Building upon the lessons of COVID-19, we then show how similar modeling and thinking could make disaster management more proactivebetter able to anticipate needs and prioritize disaster mitigation and response resources.Incorporating insights from our exploration of the geographic dimension of vulnerability, we then explore a second aspect of disaster vulnerability: competing or conflicting vulnerabilities. These are situations in which policymakers must navigate choices that require prioritizing one vulnerable groups needs over another or one aspect of a groups vulnerability over another. To illustrate these issues, we consider two other important problems that have challenged policymakers during the pandemic: school closures and vaccine distribution.Finally, we explore political vulnerability. This analysis encompasses a variety of ways that disasters make already vulnerable groups even more vulnerable to certain kinds of harms, including political neglect, stigmatization, disenfranchisement, displacement, and other forms of exploitation. In particular, we consider how vulnerability data may be both an unintended roadmap for exploitation and an important check on disaster inequity. In sum, this Article draws upon the costly lessons of COVID-19 for the most vulnerable to suggest a more robust academic and policy framework for assessing and responding to vulnerability in future disasters.","output":"Disaster Vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Lithium is a metal used as a salt for the treatment of acute maniac episodes and for afetive bipolar disorders profilaxis.

Here, the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities, represented by countries and the state of Texas in the USA. The SIR model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of COVID-19 by the SIR model that we propose here, as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020, the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of COVID-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of COVID-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease.","output":"A SIR model assumption for the spread of COVID-19 in different communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a heterogeneous disease with a high recurrence rate and poor clinical outcomes. Molecular subtype provides a new framework for the study of MIBC heterogeneity. Clinically, MIBC can be classified as basal and luminal subtypes; they display different clinical and pathological characteristics, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Lipidomic and metabolomic molecules have recently been considered to play an important role in the genesis and development of tumors, especially as potential biomarkers. Their different expression profiles in basal and luminal subtypes provide clues for the molecular mechanism of basal and luminal subtypes and the discovery of new biomarkers. Herein, we stratified MIBC patients into basal and luminal subtypes using a MIBC classifier based on transcriptome expression profiles. We qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed the lipids and metabolites of basal and luminal MIBC subtypes and identified their differential lipid and metabolite profiles. Our results suggest that free fatty acids (FFAs) and sulfatides (SLs), which are closely associated with immune and stromal cell types, can contribute to the diagnosis of basal and luminal subtypes of MIBC. Moreover, we showed that glycerophosphocholine (GCP)/imidazoles and nucleosides/imidazoles ratios can accurately distinguish the basal and luminal tumors. Overall, by integrating transcriptomic, lipidomic, and metabolomic data, our study reveals specific biomarkers to differentially diagnose basal and luminal MIBC subtypes and may provide a basis for precision therapy of MIBC.","output":"Integrative Transcriptomic, Lipidomic, and Metabolomic Analysis Reveals Potential Biomarkers of Basal and Luminal Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Subtypes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to observed increases in reported mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety symptoms. There is evidence attentional bias is associated with depression and anxiety, and it has been further suggested that anxiety sensitivity has a role in both the development and maintenance of depression and anxiety symptoms. Understanding these relationships may help inform preventative interventions for those at risk of mental health concerns. The present study explores the role of anxiety sensitivity, specifically physical and cognitive concerns, as a potential mediator of the relationship between attentional bias with depression and anxiety symptoms. METHOD: Participants (n = 460) were recruited from the general population in China, and completed an online survey between February and March, 2020 which included the Attention to Positive and Negative Information Scale (APNI), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). After exploring the correlations between the measures, mediation analysis was performed to explore the role of anxiety sensitivity (physical and cognitive subscales) in the relationship between attentional bias and depression and anxiety (as measured by the DASS-21). RESULTS: The results indicated that negative attention bias was significantly positively correlated with physical and cognitive concerns, physical and cognitive concerns were significantly positively correlated with depression and anxiety, and negative attention bias was significantly positively correlated with depression and anxiety (all ps < 0.001). Physical and cognitive anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between negative attention bias and both anxiety and depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: Negative bias was associated with levels of anxiety and depression, and physical and cognitive anxiety sensitivity mediated associations between negative bias and anxiety and depression symptoms.

Therefore, individuals from populations with greater pathogen stress should have a greater disgust sensitivity. However, current evidence for a positive relationship between disgust sensitivity and the intensity of infectious diseases in the environment is limited. We tested whether disgust and contamination sensitivity changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Disgust was assessed in 984 women in 2017 (before pandemic) and 633 women in 2020 (during pandemic) by a set of photographs depicting sources of infection and Pathogen and Moral of Three-Domain Disgust Scale. Further, contamination sensitivity among participants in two waves was measured by Contamination Obsessions and Washing Compulsions Subscale of Padua Inventory. State anxiety was measured with the Polish adaptation of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) only during the second wave of data collection. Women from the COVID-19 pandemic group assessed the photographs depicting sources of infection as more disgusting, scoring higher on Padua Inventory, but lower on Moral Disgust Domain as compared to women from before the pandemic. In addition, anxiety levels during pandemic positively correlated with scores from Pathogen Disgust Domain, Padua Inventory, and the ratings of the photographs. The participants of the study scored higher in state anxiety than the norms determined for the Polish population.

Clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcome data were gathered and compared between patients with and without lymphopenia. The median age was 42 years (1C75). Fifty-four patients (47.0%) of the 115 patients had lymphopenia on admission. More patients in the lymphopenia group had hypertension (30.8% vs. 10.0%, P = 0.006) and coronary heart disease (3.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.029) than in the nonlymphopenia group, and more patients with leukopenia (48.1% vs 14.8%, P<0.001) and eosinopenia (92.6% vs 54.1%, P<0.001) were observed. Lymphopenia was also correlated with severity grades of pneumonia (P<0.001) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (P = 0.0014). Lymphopenia was associated with a prolonged duration of hospitalization (17.0 days vs. 14.0 days, P = 0.002).

Public places remain hotspots for COVID-19 transmission due to large numbers of people present; however preventive measures are poorly enforced. Supermarkets are among the high-risk establishments due to the high interactions involved, which makes compliance with the COVID-19 preventive guidelines of paramount importance. However, until now, there has been limited evidence on compliance with the set COVID-19 prevention guidelines. Therefore, this study aimed to measure compliance with the COVID-19 prevention guidelines among supermarkets in Kampala Capital City and Mukono Municipality Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among selected supermarkets in Kampala Capital City and Mukono Municipality in September 2020. A total of 229 supermarkets (195 in Kampala City and 34 in Mukono Municipality) were randomly selected for the study. Data were collected through structured observations on the status of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, and entered using the KoboCollect software, which was preinstalled on mobile devices (smart phones and tablets). Descriptive statistics were generated to measure compliance to the set COVID-19 Ministry of Health prevention guidelines using Stata 14 software. RESULTS: Only 16.6% (38/229) of the supermarkets complied with the COVID-19 prevention and control guidelines. In line with the specific measures, almost all supermarkets 95.2% (218/229) had hand washing facilities placed at strategic points such as the entrance, and 59.8% (137/229) of the supermarkets surveyed regularly disinfected commonly touched surfaces. Only 40.6% and 30.6% of the supermarkets enforced mandatory hand washing and use of face masks respectively for all customers accessing the premises. Slightly more than half, 52.4% (120/229) of the supermarkets had someone or a team in charge of enforcing compliance to COVID-19 measures and more than half, 55.5% (127/229) of the supermarkets had not provided their staff with job-specific training/mentorship on infection prevention and control for COVID-19. Less than a third, 26.2% (60/229) of the supermarkets had an infrared temperature gun for screening every customer, and only 5.7% (13/229) of the supermarkets captured details of clients accessing the supermarket as a measure to ease follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study revealed low compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, which required mandatory preventive measures such as face masking, regular disinfection, social distancing, and hand hygiene.

However, an over-reliance and misuse of our limited QAC arsenal has driven the development and spread of resistance to these compounds, as well as co-resistance to common antibiotics. Extensive use of these compounds throughout the COVID-19 pandemic thus raises concern for the accelerated proliferation of antimicrobial resistance and demands for next-generation antimicrobials with divergent architectures that may evade resistance. To this end, we endeavored to expand beyond canonical ammonium scaffolds and examine quaternary phosphonium compounds (QPCs). Accordingly, a synthetic and biological investigation into a library of novel QPCs unveiled biscationic QPCs to be effective antimicrobial scaffolds with improved broad-spectrum activities compared to commercial QACs. Notably, a subset of these compounds was found to be less effective against a known QAC-resistant strain of MRSA. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the unique presence of a family of small multiresistant transporter proteins, hypothesized to enable efflux-mediated resistance to QACs and QPCs. Further investigation of this resistance mechanism through efflux-pump inhibition and membrane depolarization assays illustrated the superior ability of P6P-10,10 to perturb the cell membrane and exert the observed broad-spectrum potency compared to its commercial counterparts.

While people of all ages, occupations, and communities are at risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the health care workers (HCWs) are possibly at the highest risk. Most seroprevalence surveys with HCWs conducted worldwide have been limited to Europe, North America, and East Asia. We aimed to understand how the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies varied across these geographic regions among HCWs based on the available evidences. METHODS: By searching through PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases, eligible studies published from January 1, 2020 to January 15, 2021 were included for the systematic review and meta-analysis. The random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled proportion of IgG seropositive HCWs. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot and confirmed by Egger's test. Heterogeneity was quantified using I(2) statistics. We performed sensitivity analyses based on sample size, diagnostic method and publication status. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020219086). FINDINGS: A total of 53 peer-reviewed articles were selected, including 173,353 HCWs (32.7% male) from the United States, ten European, and three East Asian countries. The overall seropositive prevalence rate of IgG antibodies was 8.6% in these regions (95% CI= 7.2C9.9%). Pooled seroprevalence of IgG antibodies was higher in studies conducted in the USA (12.4%, 95% CI= 7.8C17%) than in Europe (7.7%, 95% CI=6.3C9.2%) and East Asia (4.8%, 95% CI=2.9C6.7%). The subgroup study also estimated that male HCWs had 9.4% (95% CI= 7.2C11.6%) IgG seroconversion, and female HCWs had 7.8% (95% CI=5.9C9.7%). The study exhibits a high prevalence of IgG antibodies among HCWs under 40 years in the USA, conversely, it was high in older HCWs (40 years of age) in Europe and East Asia. In the months February-April 2020, the estimated pooled seroprevalence was 5.7% (4.0C7.4%) that increased to 82% (6.2C10%) in April-May and further to 9.9% (6.9C12.9%) in the May-September time-period. INTERPRETATION: In the view of all evidence to date, a significant variation in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs is observed in regions of Europe, the United States, and East Asia. The patterns of IgG antibodies by time, age, and gender suggest noticeable regional differences in transmission of the virus. Based on the insights driven from the analysis, priority is required for effective vaccination for older HCWs from Europe and East Asia. A considerable high seroprevalence of IgG among HCWs from the USA suggests a high rate of past infection that indicates the need to take adequate measures to prevent hospital spread. Moreover, the seroprevalence trend was not substantially changed after May 2020, suggesting a slow progression of long-term SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Routine testing of HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered even after the rollout of vaccination to identify the areas of increased transmission.

Recovery of coral reefs relies on reproduction and increased rates of successful recruitment, which can vary tremendously across coral species. We investigated the effects of increased temperatures in the environment of parental colonies on larval production, size, settlement and survival, in the heat-resistant coral Leptastrea purpurea in Guam. Thanks to two tank experiments (eleven and four weeks, respectively) conducted over two consecutive years we found that larvae released by heat-treated parents (30 C) were significantly smaller in size but greater in number, had normal settlement behavior and increased post-settlement survival rates compared to those released by control parent colonies (28 C). We conclude that changes in the environment of parental L. purpurea colonies trigger an anticipatory maternal effect which leads to the release of preconditioned larvae with an increased chance of survival.

METHODS: In the largest prospective study to date, adults with physician-confirmed LB were included at the start of antibiotic treatment. Primary outcomes, prevalence of persistent symptoms and symptom severity, were assessed using three-monthly standardised questionnaires during one year. Persistent symptoms were defined as impaired scores for fatigue (CIS, subscale fatigue), cognitive impairment (CFQ) or pain (SF-36, subscale bodily pain) 6 months, with onset <6 months. Outcomes were compared with a longitudinal general population and a tick-bite cohort without LB as a reference. FINDINGS: Of 1135 LB patients (94?8% erythema migrans, 5?2% disseminated LB), 1084 fulfilled primary analysis criteria, as well as 1942 population and 1887 tick-bite controls. Overall prevalence of persistent symptoms in LB patients was 27?2% (95%CI, 24?7%-29?7%); 6?0% and 3?9% higher than in population (21?2%, 95%CI, 19?3%-23?1%; p < 0?0001) and tick-bite (23?3%, 95%CI 21?3%-25?3%; p = 0?016) cohorts, respectively. At 12 months, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and pain were significantly more severe in erythema migrans patients than in reference cohorts, while in disseminated LB patients, only pain was more severe. INTERPRETATION: In treated LB patients, persistent symptoms were significantly more prevalent and symptoms were more severe than in individuals without LB, although the background prevalence was substantial. This suggests an association, either direct or indirect, between persistent symptoms and LB in a relatively small subset of patients.

This review summarizes recently published studies that describe the clinical epidemiology and racial/ethnic disparities associated with SARS-CoV-2 in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with a wide spectrum of disease. Most are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with fever, gastrointestinal, and/or upper respiratory disease. Some children can progress to develop severe lower respiratory disease or a hyper-inflammatory, Kawasaki-like syndrome leading to cardiovascular shock. Although SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in children are rare, more children died within the first nine months of the pandemic than have died during any influenza season over the last decade.Black and Hispanic children represent less than 41% of the US population but account for three out of every four SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and deaths in the USA. The drivers of these disparities in children are complex and likely a combination of societal, biological, and behavioral influences. SUMMARY: This pandemic brought to light longstanding health disparities in historically marginalized populations, and minority children have suffered tremendously. It provides an opportunity to understand how a virus hijacked deep-rooted inequities, address these inequities, and work to prevent this outcome in future pandemics/epidemics.","output":"The clinical epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 in children and adolescents mirrors the widening gap in healthcare disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The global pandemic caused by novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) is a major threat to the general population and for patients with pre-existing chronic conditions. We report data concerning SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with chronic liver disease (CLD). Methods: A literature review using the online database PubMed was performed to summarize available findings on the association between pre-existing liver disease and COVID-19 infection in children. Results: Children with COVID-19 have preserved effector and immunosuppressive components resulting in a milder disease compared to adults. The most common hepatic manifestation is an elevation of hepatic transaminases. Liver damage may be directly caused by viral infection of liver cells, by medications or by the chronic hypoxia seen in COVID-19 patients. A multicenter study reported that the majority of children with a CLD remained healthy during the outbreak. Similarly, studies reported that children on immunosuppressive treatment, including patients with autoimmune liver disease (AILD) and liver transplantation (LT), maintained good health during the outbreak without experiencing major complications even if infected with COVID-19. Conclusion: COVID-19-related liver injury presents with a mild elevation of transaminases, although its clinical significance is unclear. Children with CLD, including those with AILD and post-LT, do not have an increased risk for severe disease course of SARS-CoV-2 infection with little or no liver dysfunction. These data highlight the necessity to ensure normal standards of care while adhering to national Covid-19 guidelines, and particularly to maintain immunosuppressive medication to prevent relapse or rejection. Further research is required to evaluate the differences in clinical course between immunosuppressed adults and children and in particular whether asymptomatic infection is a concern.","output":"COVID-19 in Children With Liver Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amongst the many spiraling effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic has been an intense interest in finding historical frames of reference for our current predicament.

The main question of interest is how selected didactic (didaktik) models from science education and science communication can contribute to shed light on the present situation of an ongoing pandemic specifically and socio-scientific issues in general. Three models are synthesised to give a new composite model that may help communicators and educators understand, discuss, and analyse complex socio-scientific issues. The model is subsequently applied on the apparently contradictory issue of Norwegian and Swedish governments very different responses to the pandemic, despite grounding their decisions on largely the same scientific evidence and advice.

Since the promulgation of the Anti-drug law in 2008, community-based rehabilitation has become the primary approach to treat drug addiction. However, multiple problems occurred in the implementation process, leading to a low detoxification rate in the community. Mobile health (mHealth) serves as a promising tool to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of community-based rehabilitation. Community-based addiction rehabilitation electronic system (CAREs) is an interactive system for drug users and their assigned social workers. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of CAREs in community-based rehabilitation from the perspective of drug users and social workers in Shanghai, China. METHODS: In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 40 participants were recruited from the community in Shanghai from January to May 2019. Participants randomized to the intervention group (n=20) received CAREs + community-based rehabilitation, while participants in the control group (n=20) received community-based rehabilitation only for 6 months. CAREs provided education, assessment, and SOS (support) functions for drug users. The assigned social workers provided service and monitored drug use behavior as usual except that the social workers in the intervention group could access the webpage end to obtain drug users information and fit their routine workflow into CAREs. The primary outcome was the feasibility of CAREs, reflected in the overall proportion and frequency of CAREs features used in both app and webpage end. The secondary outcomes were the effectiveness of CAREs, including the percentage of drug-positive samples, longest period of abstinence, contact times with social workers, and the change of Addiction Severity Index (ASI) from baseline to the 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: The number of participants logged in to the app ranged from 7 to 20 per week, and CAREs had relatively high levels of continued patient use. Drug users preferred assessment and education features in the app end while their social workers showed high levels of use in urine results record and viewing assessment results on the webpage end. After the 6-month intervention, 3.3% (17/520) of samples in the intervention group and 7.5% (39/520) in the control group were drug-positive (F=4.358, P=.04). No significant differences were noted between the control and intervention groups in terms of longest duration of abstinence, number of contact times and ASI composite scores. CONCLUSIONS: The study preliminarily demonstrated that with relatively good feasibility and acceptability, CAREs may improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the community-based rehabilitation, which provided instruction for further improvement of the system.

Methods: A prospective cohort study which quantifies the protein expression of NTS, NTSR1 and NTSR3 in human CRCs using immunohistochemistry. Expression levels were then compared with clinico-pathological outcome including histological grade, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: Sixty-four patients were enrolled with median follow-up of 44.0 months. There was significantly higher expression of NTS in cancer tissue in CRC with higher T stages (p < 0.01), N stages (p = 0.03), and AJCC clinical stages (p = 0.04). There was significantly higher expression of NTS, NTSR1 and NTSR3 in cancer tissue compared to surrounding normal epithelium (median H-score 163.5 vs 97.3, p < 0.01). There was significantly shorter DFS in individuals with CRC with high levels of NTS compared to lower levels of NTS (35.8 months 95% CI 28.7-42.8 months vs 46.4 months 95% CI 42.2-50.5 months, respectively, p = 0.02). Above median NTS expression in cancer tissue was a significant risk factor for disease recurrence (HR 4.10, 95% CI 1.14-14.7, p = 0.03). Discussion: The expression of NTS and its receptors has the potential to be utilised as a predictive and prognostic marker in colorectal cancer for postoperative selection for adjuvant therapy and identify individuals for novel therapies targeting the neurotensinergic pathways.

The time difference between the death and the VA interview, also referred to as recall time, varies depending on social and operational factors surrounding the death. We investigated the effect of recall time on the assignment of causes of death by VA. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of 2002-2015 survey data of the Nairobi Urban Health Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS). The independent variable recall time was derived from the date of death and the date when the VA was conducted. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to calculate odds ratios of assigning a cause of death in defined categories of recall time. Results: There were 6218 deaths followed up between 2002 and 2016, out of which 5495 (88.3%) had VAs done. Recall time varied from 1-3001 days (median 92 days, IQR 44-169 days). Majority of the VAs (45.7%) were conducted between 1-3 months after death. The effect of recall time varied for different diseases. Compared to VAs conducted between 1-3 months, there was a 24% higher likelihood of identifying HIV/AIDS as the cause of death for VAs conducted 4-6 months after death (AOR 1.24; 95% CI 1.01-1.54; p-value = 0.043) and a 40% increased chance of identifying other infectious diseases as the cause of death for VAs conducted <1 month after death (AOR 1.4; 95% CI 1.02-1.92, p-value = 0.024).

We reconstructed undirected social networks from affiliative interactions and reconstructed microbial transmission networks from the pairwise phylogenetic similarity of E. coli pulsotypes from macaques within and across adjacent sampling events. Macaque E. coli pulsotypes were more phylogenetically similar to each other than to environmental isolates, which established a premise for socially mediated transmission. Dyadic grooming and huddling frequencies strongly influenced the likelihood of E. coli transmission during the second data collection phase, but not the first. Macaques that were more central/well connected in both their grooming and huddling networks were also more central in the E. coli transmission networks. Our results confirmed that affiliative grooming and huddling behaviours mediate the transmission of gut microbes among rhesus macaques, particularly among females and high-ranking individuals. The detectability of socially mediated E. coli transmission maybe partially masked by environmental acquisition in males, or by high frequencies of interactions in captivity. Predicting the potential transmission pathways of gastrointestinal parasites and pathogens, our findings add to current knowledge of the coevolutionary relationships between affiliative behaviour and health and may be used to identify 'superspreader' individuals as potential targets for disease control strategies.","output":"Affiliation and disease risk: social networks mediate gut microbial transmission among rhesus macaques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the respiratory disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 and is characterized by clinical manifestations ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms to severe respiratory insufficiency and multi-organ failure Patients with more severe symptoms may require intensive care treatments and face a high mortality risk Also, thrombotic complications such as pulmonary embolisms and disseminated intravascular coagulation are frequent in these patients Indeed, COVID-19 is characterized by an abnormal inflammatory response resembling a cytokine storm, which is associated to endothelial dysfunction and microvascular complications To date, no specific treatments are available for COVID-19 and its life-threatening complication Immunomodulatory drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and interleukin-6 inhibitors, as well as antithrombotic drugs such as heparin and low molecular weight heparin, are currently being administered with some benefit Ozone therapy consists in the administration of a mixture of ozone and oxygen, called medical ozone, which has been used for over a century as an unconventional medicine practice for several diseases Medical ozone rationale in COVID-19 is the possibility of contrasting endothelial dysfunction, modulating the immune response and acting as a virustatic agent Thus, medical ozone could help to decrease lung inflammation, slow down viral growth, regulate lung circulation and oxygenation and prevent microvascular thrombosis Ozone-therapy could be considered a feasible, cost-effective and easy to administer adjuvant therapy while waiting for the synthesis of a therapy or the development of the vaccine","output":"Rationale for ozone-therapy as an adjuvant therapy in COVID-19: a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Attentional bias to low-fat bodies is thought to be associated with body dissatisfactiona symptom and risk factor of eating disorders.

For each experiment, we analysed the effect of the attention training on (i) attention to subsequently presented high- versus low-fat body stimuli, (ii) visual adaptation to body size, and (iii) body dissatisfaction. The attention training had no effect on attention towards high- or low-fat bodies in an online setting (Experiment 1), but did increase attention to high-fat bodies in a laboratory setting (Experiment 2). Neither perceptions of a normal body size nor levels of body dissatisfaction changed as a result of the attention training in either setting. The results in the online setting did not change when we reduced the stimulus onset-asynchrony of the dot probe task from 500 to 100 ms (Experiment 3).

DESIGN: National surveillance studies, 2008-17. SETTING: 31 provinces in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: 4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases. The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000 in 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria. Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: China's success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare. Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Infectious diseases in children and adolescents in China: analysis of national surveillance data from 2008 to 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schizophrenia is a severely debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder that requires continuous multidisciplinary treatment.

METHODS In this nested case-control study, cases were Olmsted county, Minnesota residents with incident RA (based on 1987 ACR criteria) from 1980-2013 who developed HF after RA incidence. Each case was matched on year of birth, sex and year of RA incidence with an RA control who did not develop HF. Data on HCQ use including start and stop dates and dose changes was reviewed, and used to calculate HCQ duration and cumulative dose. Age-adjusted logistic regression models were used to examine the association between HCQ and HF. RESULTS The study identified 143 RA cases diagnosed with HF (mean age 65.8, 62% females) and 143 non-HF RA controls (mean age 64.5, 62% female). HCQ cumulative dose was not associated with HF (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.96 per 100g increase in cumulative dose, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.90-1.03). Likewise, no association was found for patients with a cumulative dose 300g (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.41-2.08).

METHODS: The (2012-2015) National Readmission Database was queried for all adult (age &#8805;18 y) trauma patients with penetrating injuries who underwent exploratory laparotomy and were readmitted within 6 mo of index hospitalization discharge. Patients were stratified by firearm injuries (FIs) and stab injuries (SIs). Primary outcomes were rates of MAC: intra-abdominal abscesses (IAAs), superficial surgical site infection (SSI), and fascial dehiscence within 6 mo after discharge. Secondary outcomes were both nonabdominal complications and mortality, postdischarge, and 6-mo readmission. Regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 4473 patients (FI, 2326; SI, 2147) were included in the study; the mean age was 32  14 y, the Injury Severity Score was 19 (15-25), and 23% underwent damage control laparotomy (DCL). The rate of MAC within 6 mo was 22% (IAA 19%, SSI 7%, and fascial dehiscence 4%). Patients with FIs had a higher rate of IAA (27% versus 10%; P < 0.01), SSI (11% versus 3%; P < 0.01), fascial dehiscence (5% versus 3%; P = 0.03), nonabdominal complications (54% versus 24%; P < 0.01), and postdischarge mortality (8% versus 6%; P < 0.01) compared with patients with SIs .

The internalization of PSMA has been shown to vary with inhibitors' mode of binding: irreversible, slowly reversible, and reversible. METHODS In the present study, PSMA-targeted clickable derivatives of an irreversible phosphoramidate inhibitor DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54 (IC(50) = 1.0 nM) and a slowly reversible phosphate inhibitor, DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54.2 (IC(50) = 6.6 nM) were clicked to (99m) Tc(CO)(3) -DPA-azide to assemble a PSMA-targeted SPECT agent. The selectivity, percent uptake, and internalization of these PSMA-targeted SPECT agents were evaluated in PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative cells. RESULTS In vitro studies demonstrated that PSMA-targeted SPECT agents exhibited selective cellular uptake in the PSMA-positive LNCaP cells compared to PSMA-negative PC3 cells. More importantly, it was found that (99m) Tc(CO)(3) -DPA-DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54 based on an irreversible PSMA inhibitor core, exhibited greater uptake and internalization than (99m) Tc(CO)(3) -DPA-DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54.2 constructed from a slowly reversible PSMA inhibitor core. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated that a PSMA-targeted SPECT agent can be assembled efficiently using copper-less click chemistry. In addition, we demonstrated that mode of binding has an effect on internalization and percent uptake of PSMA-targeted SPECT agents; with the irreversible targeting agent demonstrating superior uptake and internalization in PSMA+ cells.

Since these statistics are laboratory-based confirmed cases, the true burden of disease may be underestimated. Many populations like those who are regularly visiting health care facilities and those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for visiting dialysis units, patients with malignancies, on regular chemo and radiotherapy, and healthcare workers (HCW) are considered high risk for nosocomial COVID-19 re-infections. Objective To understand the long-term behaviour and protective efficacy of already formed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody against spike-S protein and nucleocapsid antigen in different populations keeping in view their risk of re-exposure and re-infection is high. To delineate seropositivity with respect to age, gender, and other co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD)/ESRD as well as the general population. Methodology During the study, 480 cases of COVID-19 with a post-exposure antibody reactive were followed. These patients were followed on telemedicine for the development of reinfection symptoms and persistence of antibody response. Around 115 patients agreed for regular monitoring of their immunity against the COVID-19 virus through testing through the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. The rest of the patients were followed on telemedicine until the date of development of any re-infection, but none reported to have typical symptoms of COVID-19 along with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results Among 115 patients, the mean age was 42.44 + 15.755 years. 61.7% of patients were males and 66.1% were non-health workers while 26.1% of patients had DM/HTN or both. Among these patients, 76.5% had mild/no symptoms and antibodies were found present among 51.3% patients for 3-6 months. Only 2.6% of patients were re-infected. Significant association (p<0.05) of age was found with re-infection while insignificant association (p>0.05) of sex, co-morbidities, profession, symptoms, and persistence of antibodies with re-infection. Conclusion The study concluded that natural immune response was adequate to protect against reinfection as long as more than 9 months. It was more pronounced among patients with ESRD and those with severe disease. Surprisingly, among patients with haematological malignancies, either there was no seropositivity or a very weak positive antibody response.

Vaccination is thus important to cope with this risk, even though not always effective. As a strategy to improve protection, adjuvants are used in concomitance with vaccines, however, occasionally producing important side effects. The use of probiotics has been proposed as an alternative to adjuvants due to their efficacy in reducing the risk of common infections through the interactions with the immune system and the gut microbiota. A placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial was carried out on fifty elderly subjects, vaccinated for influenza, to determine the efficacy of a probiotic mixture in reducing common infection symptoms. The incidence of symptoms was evaluated after 28 days of probiotic intake (namely, T28) and after further 28 days of follow-up (namely, T56). The number of subjects, as well as the number of days with symptoms, was remarkably reduced at T28, and even more at T56 in the probiotic group. Furthermore, the influence of probiotics on immunological parameters was investigated, showing a significant positive improvement of total antioxidant capacity and -defensin2 levels. Finally, faecal samples collected from participants were used to assess variations in the gut microbiota composition during the study, showing that probiotic intake enhanced the presence of genera related to a healthy status. Therefore, the collected results suggested that the treatment with the selected probiotic mixture could help in reducing common infectious disease symptom incidence through the stimulation of the immune system, improving vaccine efficacy, and modulating the composition of the resident gut microbiota by enhancing beneficial genera.","output":"Effectiveness of Multistrain Probiotic Formulation on Common Infectious Disease Symptoms and Gut Microbiota Modulation in Flu-Vaccinated Healthy Elderly Subjects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Vaccinations are a way accepted by science of preventing infectious diseases.

Here we provide proof of concept of this risk by describing a novel means for recovering PEDV-contaminated complete feed material from commercial swine sites and conducting an in vivo experiment to prove its infectivity. RESULTS: For on-farm detection of PEDV RNA in feed, paint rollers were used to collect material from at-risk feed bins from 3 clinically affected breeding herds. This material was tested by PCR and determined to be positive for PEDV-RNA (Ct = 19.50-22.20 range). To test infectivity, this material was pooled (Ct = 20.65) and a Treatment group of 3-week old PEDV-na?ve piglets were allowed to consume it via natural feeding behavior. For the purpose of a Positive control, piglets were allowed to ingest feed spiked with stock PEDV (Ct = 18.23) while the negative control group received PEDV-free feed.

Serious Educational Games (SEG) and Learning Analytics (LA) are gaining increasing attention from teachers and researchers, since they both can improve the learning quality. In this article, we aimed to examine, summarize and characterize the current state of the art related to the application of LA to SEGs through a systematic literature review based on a methodological instrument called PRISMA. A qualitative analysis was performed in which 80 significant papers were selected from the ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Web of Science, and IEEE-Xplore databases. From this analysis, we identified the main features of an efficient use of SEGs in terms of success factors and learning outcomes;we also discussed the benefits and challenges of integrating LA approaches into these environments. Consequently, a new multidimensional taxonomy for using SEGs to categorize these major features was proposed. The findings of this review reveal that SEGs have a beneficial effect on students behavior, cognition and emotion;but more future works and empirical studies investigating data science techniques are needed to improve the usability of educational games. This research and the suggested guideline recommendations may be of value to researchers and practitioners willing to deploy SEGs contributing thus to the continuous improvement of digital learning in formal education.

Patients and Methods: A self-report questionnaire that integrated the Spanish version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress ScaleC21 items (DASS-21) and the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSS) was designed to gather sociodemographic data and information related to the effects of lockdown on the lives of IBD patients. Twelve IBD units invited their patients to answer the anonymous online survey between the 1st July and the 25th August 2020. Results: Of the 693 survey participants with IBD, 67% were women and the mean age was 43 (SD 12). Sixty-one percent had ulcerative colitis, 36% Crohns disease and 3% indeterminate colitis. DASS-21 scores indicate that during lockdown the estimated prevalence of depression was 11% [95% CI 8.2C13%], anxiety 20% [95% CI C17-23%] and stress 18% [95% CI 8.2C13%]. Multivariate analysis showed that the perceived high risk of COVID-19 infection because of having IBD and maladaptation to government measures to reduce the spread of disease doubled the risk of anxiety and stress during lockdown. Conclusions: In the short-term, lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to have an impact on the already affected mental health of our IBD patients in Spain","output":"Psychosocial impact of the covid-19 pandemic on patients with inflammatory bowel disease in spain.

To study meeting effectiveness and meeting inclusiveness, we first conducted a large-scale email survey (N=4,425;after filtering N=3,290) at a large technology company (pre-COVID-19);using this data we derived a multivariate model of meeting effectiveness and show how it correlates with meeting inclusiveness, participation, and feeling comfortable to contribute. We believe this is the first such model of meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness. The large size of the data provided the opportunity to analyze correlations that are specific to sub-populations such as the impact of video. The model shows the following factors are correlated with inclusiveness, effectiveness, participation, and feeling comfortable to contribute in meetings: sending a pre-meeting communication, sending a post-meeting summary, including a meeting agenda, attendee location, remote-only meeting, audio/video quality and reliability, video usage, and meeting size. The model and survey results give a quantitative understanding of how and where to improve meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness and what the potential returns are. Motivated by the email survey results, we implemented a post-meeting survey into a leading computer-mediated communication (CMC) system to directly measure meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness (during COVID-19). Using initial results based on internal flighting we created a similar model of effectiveness and inclusiveness, with many of the same findings as the email survey. This shows a method of measuring and understanding these metrics which are both practical and useful in a commercial CMC system.","output":"Meeting Effectiveness and Inclusiveness in Remote Collaboration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Giardiasis remains a common cause of diarrhea and intestinal enteropathy globally. Here we give an overview of clinical treatment studies and discuss potential mechanisms and molecular targets for in-vitro testing of drug resistance. RECENT FINDINGS Giardia is a cause of disease both in diarrheal and nondiarrheal cases. The prevalence of treatment refractory giardiasis is increasing. Recent studies reveal 5-nitroimidazole refractory infection occurs in up to 50% of cases. Mechanisms of drug resistance are not known. Placebo controlled studies of drug efficacy, taking the self-limiting course of giardiasis into account, has not been reported. No randomized controlled trials of treatment of refractory infection have been performed the last 25 years. Based on the clinical studies reported, combination treatment with a 5-nitroimidazole and a benzimidazole is more effective than repeated courses of 5-nitroimidazole or monotherapies in refractory cases. Quinacrine is effective in refractory cases, but potentially severe side effects limit its use. SUMMARY A combination of a 5-nitroimidazole and albendazole or mebendazole, and quinacrine monotherapy, are rational choices in nitroimidazole refractory infections, but randomized controlled studies are needed. Further research into more recent clinical isolates is necessary to uncover mechanisms for the increase in metronidazole refractory giardiasis observed during the last decade.","output":"Giardiasis treatment: an update with a focus on refractory disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiplexed bead-based assays that use Luminex? xMAP? technology have become popular for measuring antibodies against proteins of interest in many fields, including malaria and more recently SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the incidence of pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema in COVID-19 patients was higher than in ARDS patients without COVID-19 and if this difference could be attributed to barotrauma or to lung frailty. Methods: We identified both a cohort of patients with ARDS and COVID-19 (CoV-ARDS), and a cohort of patients with ARDS from other causes (noCoV-ARDS).Patients with CoV-ARDS were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) during the COVID-19 pandemic and had microbiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. NoCoV-ARDS was identified by an ARDS diagnosis in the 5a? years before the COVID-19 pandemic period. Results: Pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 23 out of 169 (13.6%) patients with CoV-ARDS and in three out of 163 (1.9%) patients with noCoV-ARDS (p<0.001). Mortality was 56.5% in CoV-ARDS patients with pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema and 50% in patients without pneumomediastinum (p=0.46).CoV-ARDS patients had a high incidence of pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema despite the use of low tidal volume (5.90.8a? mLkg-1 ideal body weight) and low airway pressure (plateau pressure 234a? cmH2O). Conclusions: We observed a seven-fold increase in pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema in CoV-ARDS.

However, identifying immunogenic peptides accurately is still a huge challenge. Most of the antigen peptides predicted in silico fail to elicit immune responses in vivo without considering TCR as a key factor. This inevitably causes costly and time-consuming experimental validation test for predicted antigens. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel computational methods for precisely and effectively predicting immunogenic peptide recognized by TCR. Here, we described DLpTCR, a multimodal ensemble deep learning framework for predicting the likelihood of interaction between single/paired chain(s) of TCR and peptide presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules. To investigate the generality and robustness of the proposed model, COVID-19 data and IEDB data were constructed for independent evaluation. The DLpTCR model exhibited high predictive power with area under the curve up to 0.91 on COVID-19 data while predicting the interaction between peptide and single TCR chain. Additionally, the DLpTCR model achieved the overall accuracy of 81.03% on IEDB data while predicting the interaction between peptide and paired TCR chains. The results demonstrate that DLpTCR has the ability to learn general interaction rules and generalize to antigen peptide recognition by TCR.

This study aimed to determine the differences between laboratory parameters in (1) COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and (2) severe versus non-severe COVID-19 cases. Methods: Studies were collected until March 2020, and retrieved parameters include leukocyte, neutrophil, thrombocyte, and lymphocyte counts in addition to C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and D-dimer levels. In the presence of heterogeneity, the random-effect model (REM) was used instead of the fixed-effect model (FEM). Results: Seven studies in the first analysis showed significantly lower leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts in COVID-19 pneumonia (SMD = -0.42, 95%CI -0.60 C -0.25, p<0.00001, SMD = -0.23, 95%CI -0.41 C -0.06, p=0.01, SMD = -0.54, 95%CI -0.91 C -0.16, p=0.0005) compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Twenty-six studies in the second analysis showed significantly lower lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts (SMD = -0.56, 95%CI -0.71 C -0.40, p<0.0001, SMD = -0.32, 95%CI -0.49 C -0.15, p=0.0002) and significantly higher leukocyte, neutrophil, D-dimer, and CRP (SMD = 0.31, 95%CI 0.07 C 0.56, p=0.01; SMD = 0.44, 95%CI 0.24 C 0.64, p<0.0001; SMD = 0.53, 95%CI 0.31 C 0.75, p<0.00001; SMD = 0.97, 95%CI 0.70 C 1.24, p<0.00001) in severe COVID-19 compared to non-severe COVID-19. Conclusions: In conclusion, thrombocyte count is key in both diagnosis and prognosis. Low leukocyte and neutrophil counts are markers of COVID-19 infection, but contrastingly higher counts indicate progressive COVID-19. And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and CRP levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of COVID-19.

However, deciding whether to participate in such trials can be complex and patients have reported decisional conflict (i.e., unresolved decisional needs). The aim of our study was to untangle several factors that contribute to decisional conflict in patients with advanced cancer who have recently been asked to decide whether to participate in early phase clinical trials. We found that patients experienced less decisional conflict if they had a better global health status, higher satisfaction, and made their decision sooner. Other factors, such as the decision to (not) participate, did not prove to be the best indicators for decisional conflict. With these insights, we can start to build hypotheses on how to improve the decision-making process for patients with end-stage cancer, which can ultimately improve their quality of life. ABSTRACT: When standard treatment options are not available anymore, patients with advanced cancer may participate in early phase clinical trials. Improving this complex decision-making process may improve their quality of life. Therefore, this prospective multicenter study with questionnaires untangles several contributing factors to decisional conflict (which reflects the quality of decision-making) in patients with advanced cancer who recently decided upon early phase clinical trial participation (phase I or I/II). We hypothesized that health-related quality of life, health literacy, sense of hope, satisfaction with the consultation, timing of the decision, and the decision explain decisional conflict. Mean decisional conflict in 116 patients was 30.0 (SD = 16.9). Multivariate regression analysis showed that less decisional conflict was reported by patients with better global health status ( = ?0.185, p = 0.018), higher satisfaction ( = ?0.246, p = 0.002), and who made the decision before ( = ?0.543, p < 0.001) or within a week after the consultation ( = ?0.427, p < 0.001). These variables explained 37% of the variance in decisional conflict. Healthcare professionals should realize that patients with lower global health status and who need more time to decide may require additional support. Although altering such patient intrinsic characteristics is difficult, oncologists can impact the satisfaction with the consultation. Future research should verify whether effective patient-centered communication could prevent decisional conflict.","output":"Decisional Conflict after Deciding on Potential Participation in Early Phase Clinical Cancer Trials: Dependent on Global Health Status, Satisfaction with Communication, and Timing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Estimation of disease prevalence at sub-city neighborhood scale allows early and targeted interventions that can help save lives and reduce public health burdens. However, the cost-prohibitive nature of highly localized data collection and sparsity of representative signals, has made it challenging to identify neighborhood scale prevalence of disease. To overcome this challenge, we utilize alternative data sources, which are both less sparse and representative of localized disease prevalence: using query data from a large commercial search engine, we identify the prevalence of respiratory illness in the United States, localized to census tract geographic granularity. Focusing on asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), we construct a set of features based on searches for symptoms, medications, and disease-related information, and use these to identify illness rates in more than 23 thousand tracts in 500 cities across the United States. Out of sample model estimates from search data alone correlate with ground truth illness rate estimates from the CDC at 0.69 to 0.76, with simple additions to these models raising those correlations to as high as 0.84.

Unfortunately, coordinated government responses to address child protection since the start of the pandemic have been limited in Canada. As an exploratory study to examine the potential academic evidence base and location of expertise that could have been used to inform COVID-19 pandemic response, we undertook a review of child maltreatment research across three prominent Canadian professional journals in social work, medicine and public health. Methods: We conducted a pre-pandemic, thirteen-year (2006-2019) archival analysis of all articles published in the Canadian Social Work Review (CSWR), the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) and the Canadian Journal of Public Health (CJPH) and identified the research articles that related directly to child maltreatment, child protection or the child welfare system in Canada. Results: Of 11,824 articles published across the three journals, 20 research papers relating to child maltreatment, child protection or the child welfare system were identified (CJPH = 7; CMAJ = 3; CSWR = 10). There was no obvious pattern in article topics by discipline. Discussion: Taking these three prominent professional journals as a portal into research in these disciplines, we highlight the potential low volume of academic child maltreatment research despite the importance of the topic and irrespective of discipline. We believe that urgent transdisciplinary collaboration and overall awareness raising for child protection is called for at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as beyond in Canada.","output":"Child Maltreatment and Public Health: Do Gaps in Response during the COVID-19 Pandemic Highlight Jurisdictional Complexities?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are primary reservoirs for multiple lethal human viruses, such as Ebola, Nipah, Hendra, rabies, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, most recently, SARS-CoV-2. The innate immune systems of these immensely abundant, anciently diverged mammals remain insufficiently characterized. While bat genomes contain many endogenous retroviral elements indicative of past exogenous infections, little is known about restrictions to extant retroviruses. Here, we describe a major postentry restriction in cells of the yinpterochiropteran bat Pteropus alecto. Primate lentiviruses (HIV-1, SIVmac) were potently blocked at early life cycle steps, with up to 1,000-fold decreases in infectivity. The block was specific, because nonprimate lentiviruses such as equine infectious anemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus were unimpaired, as were foamy retroviruses. Interspecies heterokaryons demonstrated a dominant block consistent with restriction of incoming viruses. Several features suggested potential TRIM5 (tripartite motif 5) or myxovirus resistance protein 2 (MX2) protein restriction, including postentry action, cyclosporine sensitivity, and reversal by capsid cyclophilin A (CypA) binding loop mutations. Viral nuclear import was significantly reduced, and this deficit was substantially rescued by cyclosporine treatment. However, saturation with HIV-1 virus-like particles did not relieve the restriction at all. P. alecto TRIM5 was inactive against HIV-1 although it blocked the gammaretrovirus N-tropic murine leukemia virus. Despite major divergence in a critical N-terminal motif required for human MX2 activity, P. alecto MX2 had anti-HIV activity. However, this did not quantitatively account for the restriction and was independent of and synergistic with an additional CypA-dependent restriction. These results reveal a novel, specific restriction to primate lentiviruses in the Pteropodidae and advance understanding of bat innate immunity.","output":"A Potent Postentry Restriction to Primate Lentiviruses in a Yinpterochiropteran Bat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Acute pericarditis is frequently encountered in the immediate post-operative period following lung transplant, however when seen following recovery it is often in the context of infection. We present a case of a patient 12 years out from lung transplant who presented with findings compatible with acute pericarditis, ultimately diagnosed with acute cellular rejection (ACR). Case Report: A 60 year old man 12 years post bilateral lung transplant for smoking related COPD with CLAD, stage I, BOS phenotype and prior history of probable antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), presented to the emergency department with acute onset dyspnea (<24h), pleurisy, and a leukocytosis. CT angiogram of his chest revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but new bilateral ground glass and consolidative opacities. Infectious studies, including COVID-19, were negative. Multiple EKGs demonstrated diffuse ST elevations without reciprocal changes. Serial high sensitivity troponin assays were negative, and transthoracic echocardiogram did not reveal any findings compatible with myocardial injury. Once ischemia was excluded he underwent bronchoscopy with biopsies, which demonstrated A2 ACR. Screening for donor specific antibodies indicated new C1q-binding class II HLA antibodies. He was treated for acute pericarditis with colchicine and prednisone. He also received high dose methylprednisolone for ACR, as well as IVIG and rituximab for possible AMR. His chest pain and pleurisy dramatically improved after the first dose of methylprednisolone. The initial insult was thought to be an interruption of immunosuppression coupled with cigarette use. This case represents a novel presentation of ACR with concurrent findings of acute pericarditis.

Therefore, the rapid and accurate determination of cytokine biomarkers in body fluids, cells and tissues has attracted considerable attention.

The determinants of feeding responses to stress are unknown, in part because this issue is rarely studied in rodents. We focused our efforts on the novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) assay, which uses latency to eat as readout of anxiety-like behavior, but rarely assesses feeding per se. We explored how key variables in experimental paradigms C estrous and diurnal cyclicity, age and duration of social isolation, prandial state, diet palatability, and elevated body weight C influence stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and food intake in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Latency to eat in the novel environment is increased in both sexes across most of the conditions tested, while effects on caloric intake are variable. In the common NSF assay (i.e., lean mice in the light cycle), sex-specific effects of the length of social isolation, and not estrous cyclicity, are the main source of variability. Under conditions that are more physiologically relevant for humans (i.e., overweight mice in the active phase), the novel stress now elicits robust hyperphagia in both sexes . This novel model of stress eating can be used to identify underlying neuroendocrine and neuronal substrates. Moreover, these studies can serve as a framework to integrate cross-disciplinary studies of anxiety and feeding related behaviors in rodents.","output":"Assessing the effects of stress on feeding behaviors in laboratory mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Eliminating malaria along the China-Vietnam border remains one of the greatest challenges in China, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has disrupted the continuity of malaria control and elimination programs. Understanding the factors associated with asymptomatic malaria infection will inform control interventions aimed at elimination of the disease among migrants from Vietnam working in China, who constitute an at-risk population. METHODS: From March 2018 to September 2019, 108 migrants from Vietnam working in Ningming County, Guangxi, were enrolled in this study. Each person was interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected and sent for PCR detection and sequencing. The obtained sequences were analyzed using the BLAST program and DNAMAN software. RESULTS: The proportion of participants with malaria knowledge was low, with 19.4% (21/108) reporting knowledge about transmission, 23.2% (25/108) reporting knowledge about clinical symptoms, 7.4% (8/108) reporting awareness of the risk of death and 14.8% (16/108) reporting awareness of prevention methods. No significant difference in the malaria knowledge rate was found among occupational groups, except in the migrant worker group, whose knowledge rate was higher than those in the other occupational groups ((2) = 32.452, p < 0.001). Although most of the participants (80.6%, 87/108) owned mosquito nets, only approximately half of the participants (49.1%, 53/108) reported using bed nets. The parasitological analysis revealed that 5.6% (6/108) of all the participants were positive for malaria, including 5 participants with Plasmodium falciparum and 1 participant with Plasmodium vivax malaria. There were no statistically significant differences in the positivity rates among the different age, sex, family-size, nationality, occupational, and behavior groups. The positivity rates in individuals who did not use mosquito nets, did not use mosquito coils, and did not install mosquito nets were 4.8% (1/21), 6.8% (3/44), and 3.6% (2/55), respectively. CONCLUSION: Health education focused on high-risk populations, such as migrant workers and forest goers, should be strengthened. Verbal communication and information transmission via the internet, radio, and mobile phone platforms may be required during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further risk assessments and proactive case detection should also be performed in Ningming County and other border counties in Guangxi to detect active and asymptomatic infections in a timely manner and prevent re-establishment of the disease in these communities.","output":"Asymptomatic malaria infection at the China-Vietnam border: Knowledge and implications for the cross-border migrant population during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Positional scanning-synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries (PS-SPCLs) are powerful molecular tools to identify enzyme substrate and potent inhibitory sequences and also to provide crucial information about active site determinants. PS-SPCLs have been surveyed for furin, proprotein convertase (PC)2, PC1/3, and PACE4 and proven efficient to identify potent peptidyl inhibitors in the low nanomolar range for furin and PC1/3. We report herein the screenings of nonamidated and acetylated hexapeptide PS-SPCLs for PC5/6A and PC7. The L-configuration library surveys distinctively revealed that L-Arg, L-Lys, and sometimes L-His in all six positions would generate the most potent inhibitors for both enzymes. Based on this clear polybasic preference, L-poly-Arg peptides ranging from four to nine residues were assayed. Inhibitory potency of these polybasic peptides increased with chain length, making nona-l-Arg a potent nanomolar inhibitor of PC5/6A and PC7 (Ki of 150 and 120 nM). PC5/6 and PC7 inhibition by nona-l-arginine was equivalent to that of furin (Ki of 114 nM) (J Biol Chem 275: 36741-36749, 2000). Nona-d-arginine was a more potent inhibitor of PC5/6 and PC7 than its levorotatory version (Ki of 19 and 81 nM), reminiscent of furin (Ki of 1.3 nM) (J Biol Chem 279:36788-36794, 2004). Our data indicate that certain poly-arginine peptides represent potent inhibitors targeting PCs of the constitutive secretory pathway (furin, PC5/6, and PC7). We conclude that basic residues within PC peptide inhibitors might be responsible for targeting PCs in general and for inhibitory potency, but that select amino acid changes will be necessary to acquire true specificity toward a single PC.","output":"Short polybasic peptide sequences are potent inhibitors of PC5/6 and PC7: Use of positional scanning-synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries as a tool for the optimization of inhibitory sequences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined characteristics associated with being unvaccinated among a sample of university staff and faculty prior to university campus reopening for in-person learning in 2021.

The median duration of antibiotics was 7 days (IQR 5C10). In Group 3, factors associated with prescription IV antibiotics on admission were raised C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.024), increased age (P = 0.023), higher quick SOFA (P = 0.016) score and fever >37.5 C (P = 0.011). Factors associated with duration of antibiotic course were duration of hypoxia (P < 0.001) and maximum respiratory support requirement (P = 0.013). Twenty-one patients in Group 3 had one or more antibiotic escalation events, most (n = 139) had no escalation or de-escalation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Duration of hypoxia and need for respiratory support may have acted as surrogate measures of improvement where usual response measures (CRP, neutrophilia, culture clearance) were absent. Continuous review of antibiotic prescriptions should be at the forefront of clinical management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","output":"Antibiotic prescribing patterns in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: lessons from the first wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Academic and philanthropic communities have grown increasingly concerned with global catastrophic risks (GCRs), including artificial intelligence safety, pandemics, biosecurity, and nuclear war.

We aim to investigate the proportions, characteristics, and risk factors of this condition. Methods In this prospective, longitudinal cohort study, discharged patients with COVID-19 were face-to-face interviewed at 12 months after symptom onset. Rheumatic symptoms following COVID-19 included newly occurring joint pain, and (/or) joint swelling after COVID-19. The risk factors of developing rheumatic symptoms were identified by multivariable logistic regressions. Results In total, 1296 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Among them, 160 (12.3% [95% CI 10.6, 14.3]) suffered from rheumatic symptoms following COVID-19 at 12-month follow-up. The most frequently involved joints were the knee joints (38%), followed by hand (25%) and shoulder (19%). Rheumatic symptoms were independent of the severity of illness and corticosteroid treatment during acute phase, while elderly (OR 1.22, 95%CI 1.06, 1.40) and women (OR 1.58, 95%CI 1.12, 2.23) were identified as the risk factors for this condition.

DESIGN A nominal group technique (NGT) workshop and a Delphi survey were conducted to prioritise and achieve consensus (70% agreement) on 30 evidence-informed maternal (perinatal and lactation stage), infant (complementary feeding stage) and early years (family diet stage) vegetable-related advice messages. Messages were validated via triangulation analysis against the strength of evidence from an Umbrella review of strategies to increase children's vegetable liking, and gaps in advice from a Desktop review of vegetable feeding advice. SETTING Australia. PARTICIPANTS A purposeful sample of key stakeholders (NGT workshop, n=8 experts; Delphi survey, n=23 end-users). RESULTS Participant consensus identified the most highly ranked priority messages associated with the strategies of: 'in-utero exposure' (perinatal and lactation, n=56 points); and 'vegetable variety' (complementary feeding, n=97 points; family diet, n=139 points). Triangulation revealed two strategies ('repeated exposure' and 'variety') and their associated advice messages suitable for policy and practice, 12 for research and four for food industry.

Medications are a primary method of managing mental health problems, and pharmacists therefore have a vital role in supporting patients and providing them with information about the safety and efficacy of mental health medications. However, the potential role of pharmacists in managing mental health issues in Jordan has not been well established. AIM: This study aimed to assess Jordanian pharmacists attitudes and actual practices related to the provision of mental health services. METHOD: This was an exploratory cross-sectional study that used a self-report questionnaire among a convenience sample of 347 pharmacists in Amman, the capital of Jordan. RESULTS: The participating pharmacists had positive attitudes towards providing care for patients with mental health problems. However, their actual practices did not resonate with their enthusiasm, particularly in terms of the long-term follow-up of disease symptoms and medication side effects and adherence. The participating pharmacists showed an eagerness to collaborate with their colleagues, but their level of actual cooperation was lower than desired. The most commonly reported barrier to providing care for patients with mental health problems was the lack of education on mental health issues (71.5%), followed by the lack of privacy in pharmacy settings (53.9%). CONCLUSIONS: To be effectively involved in the provision of care to mental health patients, pharmacists should receive adequate education/training related to mental health issues, and pharmacies should be redesigned to provide private areas for patient counseling.","output":"Gaps in pharmaceutical care for patients with mental health issues: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly throughout the world, the scientific community has spent major efforts on better understanding the characteristics of the virus and possible means to prevent, diagnose, and treat COVID-19. A valid approach presented in the literature is to develop an image-based method to support COVID-19 diagnosis using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Because the availability of radiological data is rather limited due to the novelty of COVID-19, several methodologies consider reduced datasets, which may be inadequate, biasing the model. Here, we performed an analysis combining six different databases using chest X-ray images from open datasets to distinguish images of infected patients while differentiating COVID-19 and pneumonia from no-findings images. In addition, the performance of models created from fewer databases, which may imperceptibly overestimate their results, is discussed. Two CNN-based architectures were created to process images of different sizes (512  512, 768  768, 1024  1024, and 1536  1536). Our best model achieved a balanced accuracy (BA) of 87.7% in predicting one of the three classes (no-findings, COVID-19, and pneumonia) and a specific balanced precision of 97.0% for COVID-19 class. We also provided binary classification with a precision of 91.0% for detection of sick patients (i.e., with COVID-19 or pneumonia) and 98.4% for COVID-19 detection (i.e., differentiating from no-findings or pneumonia). Indeed, despite we achieved an unrealistic 97.2% BA performance for one specific case, the proposed methodology of using multiple databases achieved better and less inflated results than from models with specific image datasets for training.

We hypothesized that continuous telemetry- based QT monitoring is associated with better detection of prolonged QT episodes. METHODS: We introduced Continuous Cardiac Telemetry (CCT) with an algorithm for automated QT interval monitoring to our designated COVID-19 units. The daily maximum automated heart-rate corrected QT (Auto-QTc) measurements were recorded. We compared the proportion of marked QTc prolongation episodes (Long-QTc), defined as QTc > 500 ms, in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted before and after CCT was implemented (control group vs CCT group, respectively). Manual QTc measurement by electrophysiologists (EP-QTc) was used to verify Auto-QTc. Charts were reviewed to describe the clinical response to Long-QTc episodes. RESULTS: We included 33 consecutive patients (total of 451 monitoring days). Long-QTc episodes were detected more frequently in the CCT group [69/206 (34%) vs 26/245 (11%), P < 0.0001] and ECGs were performed less frequently [32/206 (16%) vs 78/245 (32%), P < 0.0001]. Auto-QTc correlated well with EP-QTc with an excellent agreement in detecting Long-QTc (Kappa=0.8, P<0.008). Only 28% of Long-QTc episodes were treated with recommended therapies. There was one episode of Torsade de Pointes (TdP) in the control group and none in the CCT group.

Additionally, we matched 52,405 infected patients with 524,050 control individuals of the same sex, age, geographical region and used conditional logistic regression to assess the relationship between baseline vitamin D levels, acquisition of vitamin D supplements in the last 4 months, and positive Covid-19.

Currently, more than 7258842 new cases, and more than 411879 deaths have been reported globally. This new highly transmitted coronavirus is responsible for the development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to this disorder, a great number of patients are hospitalized in the intensive care unit followed by connection to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for breath supporting and survival. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome is mostly accompanied by the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GSCF), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP10), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1A (MIP1A), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), an event which is known as cytokine storm. Further disease pathology involves a generalized modulation of immune responses, leading to fatal multiorgan failure. Currently, no specific treatment or vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been developed. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which are known for their immunosuppressive actions, could be applied as an alternative co-therapy in critically-ill COVID-19 patients. Specifically, MSCs can regulate the immune responses through the conversion of Th1 to Th2, activation of M2 macrophages, and modulation of dendritic cells maturation. These key immunoregulatory properties of MSCs may be exerted either by produced soluble factors or by cell-cell contact interactions. To date, several clinical trials have been registered to assess the safety, efficacy, and therapeutic potential of MSCs in COVID-19. Moreover, MSC treatment may be effective for the reversion of ground-glass opacity of damaged lungs and reduce the tissue fibrosis. Taking into account the multifunctional properties of MSCs, the proposed stem-cell-based therapy may be proven significantly effective in critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

Based on the data that have been amassed so far, the primary risk factors for a severe disease course or even mortality from COVID-19 are underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. As the global prevalence of diabetes continues to increase, patients with endocrine diseases such as diabetes mellitus and those who are on long-term corticosteroid therapy due to adrenal insufficiency or hypopituitarism are at risk for a poor prognosis of COVID-19. As endocrinologists, we would like to briefly review the current knowledge about the relationship between COVID-19 and endocrine diseases and to discuss what we can do for the safety and health of our patients with endocrine diseases in this globally threatening situation.","output":"Encountering COVID-19 as Endocrinologists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the volatility transmission between crude oil and four precious metals (i e , gold, silver, platinum, and palladium) and investigates whether oil can be considered as a hedge or safe-haven asset against four precious metals Our empirical analysis reveals several important findings First, we determine that the volatility transmission was time-varying and that influence from the Asian crisis, the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the 2008 global financial crisis, the recent oil-price crash, and COVID-19 alternated between negative and positive values over the entire studied period We further conclude that Brent oil is a diversifier and a weak safe haven for precious metals;and thus, that a combined portfolio composed of Brent-oil and precious-metals futures yields better hedging effectiveness These findings indicate that oil futures are a useful investment that reduces downside risks and strengthens diversification benefits in portfolio risk management","output":"Oil and precious metals: Volatility transmission, hedging, and safe haven analysis from the Asian crisis to the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though significant efforts are in progress for developing drugs and vaccines against COVID-19, limited therapeutic agents are available currently. Thus, it is essential to undertake COVID-19 research and to identify therapeutic interventions in which computational modeling and virtual screening of lead molecules provide significant insights. The present study aimed to predict the interaction potential of natural lead molecules against prospective protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular modeling, docking, and dynamic simulation. Based on the literature survey and database search, fourteen molecular targets were selected and the three targets which lack the native structures were computationally modeled. The drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetic features of ninety-two natural molecules were predicted. Four lead molecules with ideal drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetic properties were selected and docked against fourteen targets, and their binding energies were compared with the binding energy of the interaction between Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine to their usual targets. The stabilities of selected docked complexes were confirmed by MD simulation and energy calculations. Four natural molecules demonstrated profound binding to most of the prioritized targets, especially, Hyoscyamine and Tamaridone to spike glycoprotein and Rotiorinol-C and Scutifoliamide-A to replicase polyprotein-1ab main protease of SARS-CoV-2 showed better binding energy, conformational and dynamic stabilities compared to the binding energy of Chloroquine and its usual target glutathione-S-transferase.

METHODS: We independently externally validated the performance candidate prognostic models, identified through a living systematic review, among consecutive adults admitted to hospital with a final diagnosis of COVID-19. We reconstructed candidate models as per original descriptions and evaluated performance for their original intended outcomes using predictors measured at admission. We assessed discrimination, calibration and net benefit, compared to the default strategies of treating all and no patients, and against the most discriminating predictor in univariable analyses. RESULTS: We tested 22 candidate prognostic models among 411 participants with COVID-19, of whom 180 (43.8%) and 115 (28.0%) met the endpoints of clinical deterioration and mortality, respectively. Highest areas under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves were achieved by the NEWS2 score for prediction of deterioration over 24 h (0.78; 95% CI 0.73C0.83), and a novel model for prediction of deterioration <14 days from admission (0.78; 0.74C0.82). The most discriminating univariable predictors were admission oxygen saturation on room air for in-hospital deterioration (AUROC 0.76; 0.71C0.81), and age for in-hospital mortality (AUROC 0.76; 0.71C0.81). No prognostic model demonstrated consistently higher net benefit than these univariable predictors, across a range of threshold probabilities.

To what extent were these interventions effective in terms of combating the viral spread of the 'disinfodemic' in the broader information ecosystem? It argues that through a combination of manual and technology-enabled verification processes, these organizations were partly able to debunk some of the harmful, conspiratorial and misleading claims related to the coronavirus. It demonstrates that fact-checking alone is not enough to stem the 'disinfodemic' unless it is complemented by an ecosystem that prioritizes access to information, media literacy initiatives, proactive takedown interventions by platform companies and increased public awareness on truthful and credible public health information. Furthermore, fact-checking organizations need to increase the speed at which they respond to the 'disinfodemic' if virality, which is the major driver of this 'phenomenon', is to be mitigated. We recommend that fact-checkers should implement efficient mechanisms of decentralizing their activities, amplify the sharing of verified information, forge collaborative initiatives with key actors and ramp up critical media literacy programmes.","output":"Guardians of truth?

As economies slowly reopen, governments face a trade-off between implementing economic recovery and health policy measures to control the spread of the virus and to ensure it will not overwhelm the health system. We developed a mathematical model that measures the economic losses due to the spread of the disease and due to different lockdown policies. This is done by extending the subnational SEIR model to include two differential equations that capture economic losses due to COVID-19 infection and due to the lockdown measures imposed by the Philippine government. We then proceed to assess the trade-off policy space between health and economic measures faced by the Philippine government. The study simulates the cumulative economic losses for 3 months in 8 scenarios across 5 regions in the country, including the National Capital Region (NCR), to capture the trade-off mechanism. These scenarios present the various combinations of either retaining or easing lockdown policies in these regions. Per region, the trade-off policy space was assessed through minimising the 3-month cumulative economic losses subject to the constraint that the average health-care utilisation rate (HCUR) consistently falls below 70%, which is the threshold set by the government before declaring that the health system capacity is at high risk. The study finds that in NCR, a policy trade-off exists where the minimum cumulative economic losses comprise 10.66% of its Gross Regional Domestic Product. Meanwhile, for regions that are non-adjacent to NCR, a policy that hinges on trade-off analysis does not apply. Nevertheless, for all simulated regions, it is recommended to improve and expand the capacity of the health system to broaden the policy space for the government in easing lockdown measures.","output":"Economic losses from COVID-19 cases in the Philippines: a dynamic model of health and economic policy trade-offs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus will overshadow Earth Day's golden anniversary, but the movement's successes are worth celebrating, says Gary Paul Nabhan","output":"Earth Day at 50"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundBy March 2021, South Africa experienced two waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections; the second associated with emergence of Beta variant. We estimated the burden and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 over the two waves. MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study during July 2020-March 2021 in one rural and one urban community. Mid-turbinate nasal swabs were collected twice-weekly from consenting household members irrespective of symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Serum was collected every two months and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Household cumulative infection risk (HCIR) was defined as the proportion of household members with infection following SARS-CoV-2 introduction. FindingsAmong 71,759 nasal specimens from 1,189 members (follow-up rate 93%), 834 (1%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive. By PCR detection and serology combined, 34% (406/1189) of individuals experienced []1 SARS-CoV-2 infection episode, and 3% (12/406) experienced reinfection. Infection by PCR and/or serology before the second wave was 84% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65%-93%) protective against re-infection. Of 254 PCR-confirmed episodes with available data, 17% (n=43) were associated with []1 symptom, of which 21% (9/43) were medically attended. Among 222 included households, 161 (73%) had []1 SARS-CoV-2-positive individual. HCIR was 16% (66/411). On multivariable analysis, index case lower cycle threshold value (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.8-19.1), urban community (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.2) and infection with Beta variant (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.6-8.4) were associated with increased HCIR. HCIR was similar for symptomatic (8/67,12%) and asymptomatic (61/373, 16%) index cases (p-0.302). InterpretationIn this study, 83% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were asymptomatic and index case symptom status did not affect HCIR, suggesting a limited role for control measures targeting symptomatic individuals. Previous infection was protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the second wave although household transmission increased following the emergence of Beta variant. FundingUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrevious studies have generated wide-ranging estimates of the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections which are asymptomatic. A recent systematic review found that 20% (95% CI 3%-67%) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remained asymptomatic throughout infection and that transmission was lower from asymptomatic individuals.1 A systematic review and meta-analysis of 54 household transmission studies of SARS-CoV-2 found an estimated secondary attack rate of 17% (95% CI 14-19).2 The review also found that household secondary attack rates were increased from symptomatic index cases and that adults were more likely to acquire infection. South Africa experienced two waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections; the second wave was larger and associated with emergence of 501Y.V2 lineage. Modelling studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 variant 501Y.V2 may be more transmissible than other variants or that past exposure may provide limited protection, however, they were not able to establish which of these may be more important. A community study from Denmark and two healthcare worker cohorts estimated protection conferred by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection against reinfection to be between 81% and 89%. Data on protection conferred against infection with the 501Y.V2 variant are limited. Studies to quantify the burden of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic fraction, duration of shedding and household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatically infected individuals have mostly been conducted as part of outbreak investigations or in specific settings. Comprehensive systematic community studies and studies of 501Y.V2 are lacking. Added value of this studyWe found that from the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in March 2020 through March 2021 in South Africa, 406 (34%) of 1189 individuals from 222 randomly sampled households in a rural and an urban community in South Africa had at least one confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, detected on rRT-PCR- and/or serology, and 3% (12/406) experienced reinfection. Individuals with evidence of infection identified by PCR and/or serology before the onset of the second wave (14 December 2020) experienced 84% (95% CI 65%-93%) protection against re-infection compared to individuals without evidence of previous infection. Symptom data were analysed for 254 rRT-PCR-confirmed infection episodes that occurred >14 days after the start of follow-up (of a total of 310 episodes), of these, 17% (n=43) were associated with one or more symptom, of which 14% (n=6) were hospitalised and 2% (n=1) died. Seventy three percent (161/222) of included households, had one or more individual infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the household. SARS-CoV-2 infected index cases transmitted the infection to 16% (66/411) of susceptible household contacts. Index case ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load estimated through cycle threshold value as proxy was strongly predictive of household transmission. Index case or household contact age group and presence of symptoms in the index case were not associated with household transmission. Household transmission was four times greater from index cases infected with Beta variant compared to non-variant infection. Implications of all the available evidenceWe found a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in households in a rural community and an urban community in South Africa, with the majority of infections being asymptomatic in individuals of all ages. The household cumulative infection risk was 16% and did not differ by index case or contact age or presence of symptoms but was higher in households where the index case had potentially higher viral RNA and during the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority of infections were asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals transmitted SARS-CoV-2 at similar levels to symptomatic individuals suggesting that interventions targeting symptomatic individuals such as contact tracing of individuals tested because they report symptoms may have a limited impact as a control measure. The high level of heterologous protection from natural immunity evidenced in our study also informs our understanding of possible effects of population-level immunity on SARS-CoV-2 burden and transmission, although key questions remain regarding the durability of protection in the face of continued viral evolution.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 incidence, transmission and reinfection in a rural and an urban setting: results of the PHIRST-C cohort study, South Africa, 2020-2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid identification of patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 will become a challenge with the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (RVs).

METHODS: We used a prospective cohort including all consecutive patients admitted through the emergency department's (ED) and presenting respiratory symptoms from November 2019 to April 2020. Patients were tested for RV using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: 203/508 patients were positive for an RV during the non-SARS-CoV-2 epidemic period (November to February), and 268/596 patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (March to April). Younger age, male gender, fever, absence of expectoration and absence of chronic lung disease were statistically associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection. Combining these variables allowed for the distinguishing of SARS-CoV-2 infections with 83, 65, 75 and 76% sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients' characteristics associated with a positive PCR are common between SARS-CoV-2 and other RVs, but a simple discrimination of strong SARS-CoV-2 suspicion with a limited set of clinical features seems possible.

VFs with suspected pseudoprogression due to mask artefacts (VF test 1) were repeated with a surgical mask and an adhesive tape on its superior border (VF test 2) to distinguish from true VF loss. Several parameters including reliability indices, test duration, VF index (VFI), mean defect (MD) and pattern deviation probability plots were compared among last pre-COVID VFs, VF tests 1 and VF tests 2, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: We identified 18 VFs with suspected progression artefact due to masks (5.8%). In all of them, the median VFI and MD significantly improved after fitting the superior border of the mask, showing no significant differences with pre-COVID tests. The median fixation losses were significantly higher when wearing the unfitted mask (13% vs 6%,p=0.047). The inferior hemifield was the most affected, either as a new scotoma or as an enlargement of a prior defect.

An opportunity for service improvement resulted in a review of the practice followed by the authors and the development of a risk stratification tool for the haematuria clinic which aimed to prioritise the pathway of those with high-risk disease. Materials and methods: A risk stratification tool was developed for patients with newly diagnosed bladder tumours at the haematuria clinic. A tumour assessment carried out at FC is used to predict patients with high-risk disease, thus allowing those patients to be prioritised over those with low-risk disease on the waiting list. It also includes a reminder to request staging investigations for those with suspected high-risk disease. A closed loop audit was carried to review the following: the quality of tumour risk assessment at the haematuria clinic;time from FC to transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT);concordance between tumour assessment at FC and histopathology after TURBT;efficiency of arranging early staging investigations for those with suspected high-risk bladder cancer;time from FC to staging CT scan. Results: A risk assessment was carried out for 93% of patients in the second cycle compared with 40% in the first cycle. Concordance was noted in 83% of those with confirmed high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and 83% of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) in the first cycle, and in 100% of patients with high-risk NMIBC and MIBC in the second cycle. The interval from FC to TURBT decreased from 27 days in the first cycle to 21 days in the second cycle in those with high-risk NMIBC, and from 27 to 13 days in those with MIBC. Time from FC to staging CT for patients with high-risk bladder cancer was 6 days in the first cycle and 3 days in the second cycle if the request was made from the haematuria clinic. If the CT scan was requested later, the interval increased to 39 days in the first cycle and 22 days in the second cycle. Conclusion: There is a high degree of concordance between tumour risk assessment at FC and final pathology following TURBT which is supported by several series. Performing risk assessment and requesting staging investigations at the haematuria clinic for patients with newly diagnosed high-risk bladder cancer can minimise delays in their treatment pathway and improve patient outcomes.","output":"The implementation of a risk stratification tool for the haematuria clinic to optimise the management of patients with high-risk bladder cancer in the covid-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we develop a computational linguistic approach based on supervised machine learning using the Peoples Daily to measure Chinese official relations and political uncertainty towards the US.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine secreted by CD4+ T cell, has been shown to be a reliable marker of disease severity and a useful parameter for monitoring progression of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However its value as a predictor of severe disease has not been assessed. Methods: : A total of 160 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to two hospitals were enrolledand separated into two groups according to whether or not they progressed to develop severe illness. Demographic and clinical characteristics at admission were compared between the groups. Results: : Patients who developed severe COVID-19 had significantly higher baseline IL-6 levels than patients who had mild disease course in hospital ( P < 0.001). Patients were further grouped according to quartiles of IL-6 level. The cumulative incidence of severe illnesswas significantly higher in the third and fourth quartiles groups than in the first quartile group (55% vs. 15% and 80% vs. 15%, respectively;both P < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk for developing severe disease was markedly higher in the highest IL-6 quartile than in the lowest quartile (odds ratio: 14.95;95% confidence interval: 3.65C61.30;P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of potential predictive variables showed the area under the curve to be largest for baseline IL-6, with the value of 5.20 pg/mL having the best balance of sensitivity and specificity for predicting risk of severe COVID-19. Conclusion: Serum baseline IL-6 appears to be a reliable predictor of risk of severe COVID-19.

The underlying mechanisms and risk factors are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine if the bladder wall structure affects the risk of bladder perforation during TUR. METHODS Fifteen patients who underwent TUR complicated by a bladder perforation (group 1) and fifteen matched controls who underwent uncomplicated TUR (group 2) were retrospectively enrolled in this morphological analysis. Surgical specimens were collected from all participating patients to describe the quality and architecture of urothelium and bladder submucosa. Immunohistochemical studies were performed with primary mouse anti-human E-cadherin, beta-catenin, type IV collagen, cytokeratin 20 and epithelial membrane antigen antibodies. The intensity of the immunohistochemical reaction was assessed using an immunoreactive score (IRS). Ultrastructural examinations were performed by transmission electron microscopy. The microscopic assessment was focused on the intensity of fibrosis in the bladder submucosa and the presence of degenerative changes in the urothelium. RESULTS Patients' age, sex distribution, tumour diameters, surgeon experience or cancer stage did not differ between study groups. The immunohistochemical analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences between group 1 and group 2. From a clinical point of view, ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy showed a higher rate of severe fibrosis in group 1 (63.6% vs. 38.5%), with no differences in the rate and degree of urothelial changes. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS Bladder perforation during TUR is not a result of a deficient structure of the bladder wall.

We previously demonstrated that Golgi-specific brefeldin A (BFA) resistance factor 1 (GBF1), a regulator of intracellular transport, mediates CSFV infection. However, the molecular mechanism by which this protein regulates CSFV proliferation remains unelucidated. In this study, we constructed a series of plasmids expressing GBF1 truncation mutants to investigate their behavior during CSFV infection and found that GBF1 truncation mutants containing the Sec7 domain could rescue CSFV replication in BFA- and GCA (golgicide A)-treated swine umbilical vein endothelial cells (SUVECs), demonstrating that the effect of GBF1 on CSFV infection depended on the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Additionally, it was found that ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are known to be activated by the Sec7 domain of GBF1, also regulated CSFV proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ARF1 is more important for CSFV infection than other ARF members with Sec7 domain dependence. Subsequent experiments established the function of coatomer protein I (COP I), a downstream effector of ARF1 which is also required for CSFV infection by mediating CSFV invasion. Mechanistically, inhibition of COP I function impaired CSFV invasion by inhibiting cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane and regulating virion transport from early to late endosomes. Collectively, our results suggest that ARF1, with domain-dependent GBF1 Sec7, activates COP I to facilitate CSFV entry into SUVECs. IMPORTANCE Classical swine fever (CSF), a highly contact-infectious disease caused by classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infecting domestic pigs or wild boars, has caused huge economic losses to the pig industry. Our previous studies have revealed that GBF1 and class I and II ARFs are required for CSFV proliferation. However, a direct functional link between GBF1, ARF1, and COP I and the mechanism of the GBF1-ARF1-COP I complex in CSFV infection are still poorly understood. Here, our data support a model in which COP I supports CSFV entry into SUVECs in two different ways, depending on the GBF1-ARF1 function. On the one hand, the GBF1-ARF1-COP I complex mediates cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane to support CSFV entry. On the other hand, the GBF1-ARF1-COP I complex mediates CSFV transport from early to late endosomes during the entry steps.","output":"ARF1 with Sec7 Domain-Dependent GBF1 Activates Coatomer Protein I To Support Classical Swine Fever Virus Entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We here describe the case of a 71-year-old Caucasian woman previously diagnosed with Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) that had been treated with Mepolizumab, an anti-IL5 monoclonal antibody, since 2019 with a good clinical response.

METHODS: A bitter-tasting fluorescein solution was aerosolised during mask fit tests, with filter paper placed on masks' inner surfaces. Participants reported whether they could taste bitterness to determine taste test 'pass' or 'fail' results. Filter paper photographs were digitally analysed to quantify total fluorescence (TF). RESULTS: Fifty-six healthcare professionals were fit tested; 32 (57%) 'passed' the taste test. TF between the taste test 'pass' and 'fail' groups was significantly different (p<0.001).

In this study, we examined antibody responses after complete COVID-19 vaccination in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, most of whom were receiving treatment. Patients and Methods: Real world study of consecutive patients with multiple myeloma and other plasma cell dyscrasias (PCD) were evaluated after complete vaccination with either the 2-shot mRNA vaccines from BioNTech and Moderna or the 1-shot adenoviral vector vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J). Patients received vaccines 1-4 months before antibody testing without controlling for the type of vaccine or the timing of drug therapy. Patients with a clinical history or antibody evidence of prior infection were excluded. Anti-nucleocapsid and quantitative anti-spike antibody levels were measured with the Roche Elecys assay. Results: 95% of patients had detectable antibody responses. Multivariate analysis showed that higher age, ongoing anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody therapy and the J&J vaccine negatively affected quantitative response. A small number of ineffectively vaccinated patients receiving IVIG subsequently had detectable nucleocapsid and spike antibodies confirming the presence of the latter in currently administered IVIG. Conclusions: Nearly all PCD had detectable anti-spike antibodies after vaccination but age, anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody therapy, and the single-shot J&J vaccine negatively affected responses. In patients who received the J&J vaccine, second doses or heterologous mRNA vaccines should be tested. Quantitative antibody testing might make future management more rational, particularly in patients with poor responses.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine responses in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias after complete vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the end of 2019 a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, first identified in Wuhan, China, is spreading around the world partially associated with a high death toll.

Clinically, albuterol is administered using an infusion pump or unit doses. However, little evidence is available to compare the two administration strategies. METHODS: A toddler manikin (15 kg) with appropriate anatomic airway was connected with collecting filter to a simulator of distressed breathing. HFNC device with mesh nebulizer placed at the inlet of a humidifier at 37C, with the gas flow set at 25 and 3.75 L/min. Five milligrams of albuterol was delivered in all experiments. With infusion pump administration, albuterol concentrations of 5 and 1 mg/mL were delivered at 4 and 20 mL/hr for 15 minutes. With unit dose administration, 1 mL (5 mg/mL) and 2 mL (2.5 mg/mL) of albuterol were nebulized. Additional tests with mouth open and nebulizers via mask were using 5 mg/1 mL for mesh nebulizer and 5 mg/3 mL for jet nebulizer (n = 3). The drug was eluted from the filter and assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS: The inhaled dose was higher with unit dose than infusion pump administration with gas flows of 25 L/min (2.66  0.38 vs 1.16  0.28%; P = .004) and 3.75 L/min (10.51  1.29 vs 8.58  0.68%; P = .025).

However, the specific effects on workers across seafood value chains are less well known. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), fishers and seafood workers face an increased risk of workplace exposure to COVID-19 given the close proximity to others in processing facilities and on fishing vessels, long work hours, and communal housing, living, and transportation arrangements associated with seasonal employment. To explore this hypothesis, and given a lack of data on the sector, we reviewed news articles, scientific articles, and white papers to identify the various effects of COVID-19 on US seafood workers and to track COVID-19 cases and outbreaks. Here, we show that most COVID-19 cases among seafood workers were reported during the summer of 2020 and during the beginning of 2021 with outbreaks primarily occurring in seafood processing. COVID-19 cases were documented throughout coastal areas, with Alaska experiencing the largest number of cases and outbreaks. Based on news reports, seafood workers were about twice as likely to contract COVID-19 as workers in other parts of the overall US food system. By examining news articles and scientific literature, we also documented a number of indirect effects of the pandemic. Social-distancing restrictions limited crew size and number of workers on processing lines, resulting in longer work hours and more physical and mental taxation. Economic consequences of the pandemic were reportedly a primary concern for fishers and aquaculture businesses, including changes in markets, supply and demand, in addition to revenue loss, price fluctuations, supply chain issues, and labor shortages. Fewer outlets interviewed workers in seafood processing; however, concerns about workplace safety, contracting COVID-19, access to medical services, vaccination, and paid sick leave were all noted. We also highlight a number of inequities in COVID-19 responses within the seafood sector, both along racial and gender lines. Peer-reviewed studies and news coverage all point to diverse direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on workers across seafood value chains.

This would help policy makers and investors in making efficient decisions.Design/methodology/approachThe outbreak of the novel COVID-19 has been a thorn in the flesh of the world in its entirety, affecting many aspects of life including the stock market. This study, therefore, examined the impact of the outbreak on the stock returns of the Ghana Stock Exchange. The study utilized data from the All Share Prices of the Ghana stock exchange, commonly known as the Ghana stoke exchange composite index (GSECI) for analysis. The data covered the period before the outbreak of COVID-19 and during the outbreak. It was revealed that the Ghana stock exchange experienced better returns on the market before the outbreak of the virus. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to wide variations in the market increasing the risk of investments. The exponential General Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) (1, 1) model also reveals that the outbreak of COVID-19 has a significant negative effect on the returns in the market. The market in these periods of COVID-19 is highly volatile. It is recommended that investors should carefully consider risk mitigation strategies to enable them diversify their investments effectively and efficiently against the high risk associated with the market in this COVID-19 era.FindingsIt was revealed that the Ghana stock exchange experienced better returns on the market before the outbreak of the virus.

However, the knowledge of how the market has been affected by the disease, it is important that financial risk mitigation studies be undertaken. This goes beyond what this study has done. The study can further be expanded to include other important economic variables such as GDP, inflation, exchange rates and the likes in to the model.Practical implicationsInvestors should carefully consider risk mitigation strategies to enable them diversify their investments effectively and efficiently against the high risk associated with the market in this COVID-19 era.Social implicationsIt is also important that investors consider diversification of their investments in order to reduce the risk in their investments. It will be more appropriate for most investors to invest with companies such as banks and the telecommunications companies listed on the on the market.

Undetected transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus and pose an appalling threat to the public. An urgent question that has been asked by the public is\\"Should I be tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?\\". While different regions established their own criteria for screening infected cases, the screening criteria have been modified based on new evidence and understanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The shortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our ability to do as many tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians are facing a dilemma of balancing the limited resources and unlimited demands.

This study describes the changes in public emotional reactions and mobility patterns in the Chinese population during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We collected data on public emotional reactions in response to the outbreak through Weibo, the Chinese Twitter, between 1st January and 31st March 2020. Using anonymized location-tracking information, we analyzed the daily mobility patterns of approximately 90% of Sichuan residents. RESULTS: There were three distinct phases of the emotional and behavioral reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak. The alarm phase (19thC26th January) was a restriction-free period, characterized by few new daily cases, but a large amount public negative emotions [the number of negative comments per Weibo post increased by 246.9 per day, 95% confidence interval (CI) 122.5C371.3], and a substantial increase in self-limiting mobility (from 45.6% to 54.5%, changing by 1.5% per day, 95% CI 0.7%C2.3%). The epidemic phase (27th JanuaryC15th February) exhibited rapidly increasing numbers of new daily cases, decreasing expression of negative emotions (a decrease of 27.3 negative comments per post per day, 95% CI ?40.4 to ?14.2), and a stabilized level of self-limiting mobility. The relief phase (16th FebruaryC31st March) had a steady decline in new daily cases and decreasing levels of negative emotion and self-limiting mobility. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the public's emotional reaction was strongest before the actual peak of the outbreak and declined thereafter.

METHODS: Twenty-four sites across Canada completed a practice profile survey and enrolled adult non-pregnant patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes injecting insulin using an insulin pen. Seven areas of proper injection technique to be evaluated were identified by the study steering committee: size of injection site, use of a skin lift, needle reuse, length of the needle, duration of the needle in the skin, injection into lipohypertrophic tissue, and applied injection force. During a scheduled visit, each patient filled out the Injection Technique Survey and the physician documented the answers via an electronic database. RESULTS: Almost all physicians surveyed agreed (96%) that proper insulin injection technique is important or very important and 80% indicated they were either completely confident or fairly confident in discussing overall insulin injection technique. All patients surveyed were making at least one insulin injection technique error within the following categories: applied injection force (76%), area size of injection site (64%), duration of pen needle in skin (61%), pen needle reuse (39%), performs a skin lift with a 4 or 5 mm needle (38%), uses a longer pen needle than required (34%), and injection of insulin into lipohypertrophic tissue (37%). CONCLUSION: Patients commonly make insulin injection errors. Patient and physician education on optimal insulin injection technique continues to be an unmet medical need for the treatment of patients with diabetes. Prospective trials examining the impact of new technology, diabetes educational teams, and e-learning as educational interventions are potential avenues to explore in future studies to support improved insulin injection technique.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between allergic diseases and COVID-19 severity in pediatric patients. Methods: Seventy-five pediatric patients with COVID-19 were classified according to clinical severity and evaluated in the allergy/immunology and pulmonology departments 1 to 3 months after the infection resolved. Blood was collected from the patients for a complete blood cell count and assessment of immunoglobulin and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and skin-prick tests and spirometry tests were performed. Results: A total of 75 patients ages 5-18 years were evaluated. COVID-19 was asymptomatic/mild in 44 patients and moderate/severe/critical in 31 patients. Based on allergy evaluation, allergic rhinitis was diagnosed in 19 patients (25.3%), asthma in 10 patients (13%), and atopic dermatitis in 3 patients (4%). Aeroallergen sensitivity was detected in 26 patients (34.7%). COVID-19 infection was asymptomatic/mild in 15 patients with allergic rhinitis (78.9%) and in 21 with aeroallergen sensitivity (80.8%) (p = 0.038 and p = 0.005, respectively). There was no difference in severity between the patients with and without asthma (p = 0.550). The median (interquartile range) total IgE level was significantly higher in the asymptomatic/mild group (71.8 [30.7-211.2]) (p = 0.015). There were no differences in terms of spirometry parameters. Conclusion: Aeroallergen sensitization and allergic rhinitis in children may be associated with a milder course of COVID-19.

Although some research progress has been made in recent years, the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS remains unclear due to its heterogeneity and etiology. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a type of small noncoding RNA, play a vital role in various diseases. In ALI/ARDS, miRNAs can regulate inflammatory and immune responses by targeting specific molecules. Regulation of miRNA expression can reduce damage and promote the recovery of ALI/ARDS. Consequently, miRNAs are considered as potential diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets of ALI/ARDS. Given that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, we review the miRNAs involved in the inflammatory process of ALI/ARDS to provide new ideas for the pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of ALI/ARDS.","output":"MicroRNAs: Important Regulatory Molecules in Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the single greatest contributor to global mortality.

Patient satisfaction with services is an important proxy measure of quality. We assessed patient satisfaction at a tertiary hospital in Northern Malawi to understand the current state. METHODS: We conducted exit interviews with patients aged  18 years using a 28 statement interviewer administered questionnaire. Patients were asked to express their level of agreement to each statement on a five-point Likert scale C strongly disagree to strongly agree, corresponding to scores of 1 to 5. Overall patient satisfaction was calculated by summing up the scores and dividing the sum by the number of statements. Mean score > 3 constituted satisfaction while mean score  3 constituted dissatisfaction. A (2) test was used to assess the association between overall patient satisfaction and demographic variables, visit type and clinic consulted at alpha 0.05. Patient self-rated satisfaction was determined from a single statement that asked patients to rate their satisfaction with services on a five-point Likert scale. We also asked patients to mention aspects of hospital care that they did not like. Responses were summarized into major issues which are presented according to frequencies. RESULTS: Overall patient satisfaction was 8.4% (95% CI: 5.2 ? 12.9%). Self-rated patient satisfaction was 8.9% (95% CI: 5.5 ? 13.4%). There was no significant association between overall patient satisfaction and all predictor variables assessed. Patients raised six major issues that dampened their health care seeking experience, including health workers reporting late to work, doctors not listening to patients concerns and neither examining them properly nor explaining the diagnosis, shortage of medicines, diagnostics and medical equipment, unprofessional conduct of health workers, poor sanitation and cleanliness, and health worker behaviour of favouring relatives and friends over other patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found very low levels of patient satisfaction, suggesting that quality of services in the public health sector is still poor.

While vaccinations role as a powerful life-saving weapon in the fight against infectious diseases has been further highlighted following the introduction of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, there is still a discrepancy between the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of vaccines and the perception of the risk attributed to them. Known as Vaccine Hesitancy (VH), this phenomenon is the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines, despite the availability of services. VH can be found in at least 15% of the worldwide population, and even professional groups tasked with promoting vaccination as a primary prevention measure, e.g., healthcare workers (HCWs), sometimes have doubts regarding vaccination. Since 2014, this Public Health problem has been increasing in 90% of countries worldwide, to the extent that in 2019 it was listed as one of the ten greatest threats to global health by the World Health Organization (WHO). VH has also affected COVID-19 vaccination, hampering the achievement of desired vaccination coverage.

Mounting epidemiological evidence has indicated that COF exposure is significantly associated with an increased risk of various health effects including lung cancer, but toxicological studies are very limited. OBJECTIVES: We conduct a systematic study to provide toxicological evidence of COF exposure on the lungs, to examine the underlying toxicological mechanism, and to suggest intervention measures to mitigate this toxicity. METHODS: A total 96 female rats were randomly divided into control groups, COF exposure groups (0.2, 2, 20 mg/kg) and vitamin E protection groups, receiving appropriate treatment for 30 days. First we measured airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) followed by a lung histological analysis to investigate the toxicological effects of COF. We next analyzed the biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis to examine the underlying toxicological mechanism, and finally we investigated the protective effects of vitamin E against the toxicity of COF. RESULTS: AHR measurement indicated that the airway resistance increased with the COF dose and the lung histological assay showed narrowing of the airway lumen, which provided evidence of the toxicological effects of COF. The biomarkers of oxidative stress (ROS and MDA), pro-inflammation (TNF-&#945; and IL-1?), and apoptosis (NF-&#954;B and Caspase-3) were all significantly increased with COF dose. We observed that above toxicological effects and biomarker levels induced by COF were significantly ameliorated after administration of VE. CONCLUSION: The toxicity of cooking oil fumes on the lungs is clear from the evidence and mechanism, and can be ameliorated by vitamin E.

We describe a simple model to illustrate the large effect of decreasing the number of social contacts on the suppression of outbreaks of an infectious disease. Although we do not aim to model the COVID19 pandemic, we choose model parameter values that are not unrealistic for COVID19. We hope to provide some intuitive insight in the role of social distancing. As our calculations are almost analytical, they allow us to understand some of the key factors influencing the spread of a disease. We argue that social distancing is particularly powerful for diseases that have a fat tail in the number of infected persons per primary case. Our results illustrate that a 'bad' feature of the COVID19 pandemic, namely that super-spreading events are important for its spread, could make it particularly sensitive to truncating the number of social contacts.","output":"Effect of social distancing on super-spreading diseases: why pandemics modelling is more challenging than molecular simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease a pandemic, more than 2 million cases of infections and 140,000 deaths have been reported across the world.

More recent pathogen incidence studies have included culture, as well as newer microbiological methods to determine etiology. Current disparities among disadvantaged populations, including African-Americans, result in more comorbidities which predisposes to more severe CAP.

On d 0, pens were randomly assigned to 1) transport for 1,440 km in a livestock trailer and oral administration of meloxicam (1 mg/kg of BW) at loading (d 0), unloading (d 1), and daily from d 2 to 7 of feedlot receiving (MEL; n = 7); 2) the same transportation and treatment schedule of MEL but oral administration of lactose monohydrate (1 mg/kg of BW) instead of meloxicam (TRANS; n = 7); or 3) no transport and oral administration of lactose monohydrate (1 mg/kg of BW) concurrently with treatment administration to MEL and TRANS (CON; n = 7). Upon arrival (d 1), MEL and TRANS steers returned to their pens for a 21-d feedlot receiving with the same diet offered from d -10 to 0. Treatments were administered to steers via oral drench on d 0 and 1 or mixed daily with the concentrate from d 2 to 7. Full BW was recorded before (d -2, -1, and 0) treatment application and at the end of experiment (d 20, 21, and 22) for ADG calculation. Daily DMI was recorded from d 1 to 21. Blood samples were collected on d 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21. During the initial 7 d of feedlot receiving, hay and total DMI were reduced (P  0.03) in TRANS vs. CON and MEL and similar between CON and MEL (P  0.26), whereas concentrate DMI did not differ (P = 0.16) among treatments. Mean ADG was reduced (P  0.03) in TRANS vs. MEL and CON but similar (P = 0.82) between MEL and CON. Moreover, TRANS had reduced G:F vs. CON (P = 0.01) and MEL (P = 0.05), whereas G:F was similar (P = 0.39) between CON and MEL.

This study aimed to analyze quantitative SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibody titers and safety of the third dose. Material and methods: A prospective longitudinal cohort study included healthcare workers who received a third booster dose after six months of the complete BNT162b2 regimen. We assessed the quantitative SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibody titers 21-28 days after the first and second dose, three months after the complete scheme, 1-7 days following the third dose, and 21-28 days after the boost. Results: The cohort comprised 168 non-immunocompromised participants of 41(10) years old, 67% being women. The third dose was associated with increasing the quantitative antibody titers, regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 history. In negative SARS-CoV-2 history, the median (IQR) antibody titers increased from 379 (645.4) to 2960 (2010), while in positive SARS-CoV-2 history, from 590 (1262) to 3090 (2080).

We hypothesized that human fibrinogen concentrate (FC) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), administered as combined therapy with TXA, would provide additive effects for reducing blood loss in an animal trauma model. METHODS Thirty-six pigs were subjected to 2 consecutive blunt liver injuries, resulting in severe hemorrhagic shock and coagulopathy. Intervention comprised saline (control group); TXA (15 mg kg, TXA group); TXA and FC (90 mg kg, TXA-FC); or TXA, FC, and PCC (20 U kg, TXA-FC-PCC). Blood loss, thromboelastometry (ROTEM), measures of thrombin generation, platelet activation, and global coagulation variables were monitored for 4 hours. Tissue sections were examined to determine the occurrence of thromboembolic events. RESULTS Total blood loss was similar in the TXA-FC and TXA-FC-PCC groups (mean  SD: 1012  86 mL and 1037  118 mL, respectively; P = 1.000). These values were both lower (P < 0.001) than the TXA group (1579  306 mL). Blood loss in all 3 intervention groups was lower (P < 0.001) than in the control group (2376  478 mL). After trauma and resuscitation, but before study intervention, plasma fibrinogen levels were severely depleted (median for the whole study population: 66 mg dL; interquartile range: 51-108 mg dL) and clot strength was decreased (EXTEM whole-blood maximum clot firmness [MCF]: 53  5 mm). Compared with controls, TXA inhibited fibrinolysis and stabilized MCF and clotting time. The addition of FC restored and stabilized hemostasis to a greater extent than TXA alone; the addition of PCC had no statistically significant impact on blood loss, clot strength (MCF), or clotting time, but it increased thrombin generation. There were no significant differences among the study groups regarding platelet activation. No thrombi or microthrombi were observed in any group at necropsy. CONCLUSIONS The early use of TXA and FC reduced blood loss and improved coagulation measurements in a porcine model of blunt liver injury and hemorrhagic shock. FC, administered in addition to TXA, was highly effective in reducing blood loss. The lack of statistically significant reduction in blood loss when PCC was added to TXA and FC may be attributable to the absence of thrombin generation impairment in this model.","output":"Hemostatic Therapy Using Tranexamic Acid and Coagulation Factor Concentrates in a Model of Traumatic Liver Injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, references to scientific findings have permeated public-facing communications.

Trust was highest among older respondents and those who identified as of white ethnicity. The concurrent (November 2020) levels of reported trust in scientific information about coronavirus were generally lower than those reported retrospectively for the start of the pandemic (March 2020). There was higher trust and positivity about science among people who had been shielding and among those who had not contracted coronavirus. Around half of respondents did not think that the uncertainty in science was conveyed much or at all, most were confident in the accuracy of coronavirus science, and around half thought that public information was a true representation of the science. Conclusions: Our study indicates that there is room to improve trust and communication in science. As well as detailed analyses to account for inter-relationships, further research could examine reasons behind change in trust over time and any persisting patterns by age, ethnicity, and shielding status.","output":"Public views of coronavirus science and scientists: findings from a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding who blames or supports whom in news text is a critical research question in computational social science.

From a million-scale news corpus, we construct a dataset of news sentences where sentiment relations of political entities are manually annotated. We present a simple but effective approach for utilizing a pretrained transformer, which infers the target class by predicting multiple question-answering tasks and combining the outcomes. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed method for social science research questions by analyzing positive and negative opinions between political entities in two major events: 2016 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced medical schools to evolve clinical rotations to minimize interruption through implementation of novel remote learning courses. To address the students' need for remote clinical education, we created a virtual PoCUS course for our fourth year class. We present details of the course's development, implementation, quality improvement processes, achievements, and limitations. Methods: A virtual PoCUS course was created for 141 fourth-year medical students. The learning objectives included ultrasound physics, performing and interpreting ultrasound applications, and incorporating PoCUS into clinical decisions and procedural guidance. Students completed a 30-question pre and post-test focused on ultrasound and knowledge of clinical concepts. PoCUS educators from 10 different specialties delivered the course over 10 days using video-conferencing software. Students watched live scanning demonstrations and practiced ultrasound probe maneuvers using a cellular telephone to simulate ultrasound probe. Students completed daily course evaluations which were used as a continuous needs assessment to make improvements. Results: 141 students participated in the course, all received a passing grade. The mean pre and post-test scores improved from 58% to 88% (p <0.001) through the course duration. Daily evaluations revealed the percentage of students who rated the course's live scanning sessions and didactic components as \\"very well\\" increased from 32.7% on day 1 to 69.7% on day 10. The end-of-course evaluation revealed 91% of students agreed they received effective teaching. Conclusions: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our multi-specialty faculty expeditiously developed a virtual PoCUS curriculum for the entire fourth year class. This innovative course improved students' ultrasound knowledge, image interpretation and clinical application while utilizing novel techniques to teach a hands-on skill virtually. As the demand for PoCUS instruction continues to increase, the accessibility of virtual training and blended learning will be beneficial.","output":"Virtual Multi-Specialty Point-of-Care Ultrasound Rotation for 4th Year Medical Students during COVID-19: Innovative Teaching Techniques Improve Ultrasound Knowledge and Image Interpretation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Acute respiratory illness caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) involved the whole globe within no time.

The objective of our study was to describe clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the disease in our setup. Methods in this descriptive case series, individuals with signs and symptoms of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and asymptomatic patients with history of close contact to confirmed COVID-19 patients were considered for SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Epidemiological and clinical features of only PCR positive cases were recorded. Data regarding hospitalization status, exposure to known COVID-19 patients, clinical feature and clinical outcome of patients was collected and interpreted. Results A total of 266 patients were found to be SARS-CoV 2 PCR positive which were included in the study. Mean age of patients was 39.4531.9 years and majority of the patients in our study were male, i.e., 238 (89.5%).

To measure these attitudes a survey was administered to 316 respondents across the United States by a survey corporation. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships of several factors with attitudes toward potential COVID-19 vaccination. Prior vaccine usage and attitudes predicted attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Assessment of the severity of COVID-19 for the United States was also predictive. Approximately 68% of all respondents were supportive of being vaccinated for COVID-19, but side effects, efficacy and length of testing remained concerns. Longer testing, increased efficacy and development in the United States were significantly associated with increased vaccine acceptance. Messages promoting COVID-19 vaccination should seek to alleviate the concerns of those who are already vaccine-hesitant.

Lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic has forced to carry out the prehabilitation program at home.This study aimed to assess the effect of home prehabilitation on body composition, complications and hospital stay in patients undergoing oncological colorectal surgery. Mthods A prospective and randomized clinical study was conducted in 20 patients operated of colorectal cancer during COVID-19 lockdown (13th March -21st June 2020) in a single university clinical hospital. Patients was randomly into two study groups (10 per group): Prehabilitation vs Standard Care. Changes in lean mass and fat mass at 45 and 90 days after surgery was measured using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. Results: Prehabilitation managed to reduce hospital stay (4.8 vs 7.2 days, p = 0.052) and postoperative complications (20% vs 50%, p = 0.16).45 days after surgery, the loss of lean mass decreased (1.7% vs 7.1%, p = 0.17). These differences in lean mass were attenuated at 90 days, however, the standard care group increased considerably their fat mass compared to the prehabilitation group (+ 8.72% vs -8.16%). Conclusions: Home prehabilitation has proven its effectiveness achieving an attenuation of lean mass loss in the early postoperative period and a lower gain in fat mass in the late postoperative period.

Under some circumstances, airway epithelial cells may be programmed to release cytokines (notably IL-33) that activate a type 2 immune response, which in excess might contribute to the development of chronic obstructive lung disease.

Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by the continuous loss of skeletal muscle mass and decreased strength and function. In recent years, many studies have shown a correlation between sarcopenia and depression. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of depression among individuals with sarcopenia and to ascertain whether sarcopenia is independently associated with depression. METHODS We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases for papers on sarcopenia published up to 31 August 2021. We reviewed the literature on the number of individuals with sarcopenia, the number of individuals with both sarcopenia and depression, and the odds ratio (OR) of sarcopenia to depression. Statistical analyses were performed using Meta-DiSc 1.4 software and Stata version 12.0. RESULTS Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria for review: nine reported both prevalence and ORs, four described prevalence only, and six detailed the ORs only. Regarding prevalence, there were 1476 cases of sarcopenia and 364 of depression in the selected studies; the mean age of the patients was 75.5 years, and the overall prevalence of depression was 0.28 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21-0.36].

The synthesis presents evidence that savings groups found ways to continue operating, provided leadership opportunities for women during the pandemic, and mitigated some of the negative economic consequences of COVID-19 on individual savings group members. Savings, credit, and group support from other members all likely contributed to the ability of groups to positively affect the resilience of womens group member during COVID-19. Households with a female member in a savings group in Nigeria and Uganda have coped with the crisis better than those not in savings groups. While savings groups have shown the potential for resilience during the pandemic, they often faced financial challenges because of decreased savings, which sometimes resulted in the depletion of group assets. Savings groups also contributed to community responses and provided women a platform for leadership. These findings are consistent with a recent evidence synthesis on how past covariate shocks affected womens groups and their members.

Spatial evolution of Covid-19 cases in the United States followed multifractal scaling. A rapid increase in the spatial correlation was identified early in the outbreak (March to April). Then, the increase continued at a slower rate and approached the spatial correlation of human population. Instead of adopting agent-based models that require tracking of individuals, a kernel-modulated approach is developed to characterize the dynamic spreading of disease in a multifractal distributed susceptible population. Multiphase Covid-19 epidemics were reasonably reproduced by the proposed kernel-modulated susceptibleCinfectiousCrecovered (SIR) model. The work explained the fact that while the reproduction number was reduced due to nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masks, social distancing, etc.), subsequent multiple epidemic waves still occurred; this was due to an increase in susceptible population flow following a relaxation of travel restrictions and corollary stay-at-home orders. This study provides an original interpretation of Covid-19 spread together with a pragmatic approach that can be imminently used to capture the spatial intermittency at all epidemiologically relevant scales while preserving the disordered spatial pattern of infectious cases.","output":"A kernel-modulated SIR model for Covid-19 contagious spread from county to continent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die Rezeptor-bindende Dom?ne (RBD) des SARS-CoV-2 Spike-Glykoproteins kann durch Semisynthese als homogene Glykoform hergestellt werden Ping Wang et?al berichten in ihrem Forschungsartikel (DOI: 10 1002/ange 202100543) ber die erstmalige Synthese von glykosylierten RBDs mit strukturell definierten Glykanen Das Titelbild illustriert die Kombination von Kohlenhydrat- und Proteinchemie, die zur erfolgreichen Synthese dieses Proteins fhrte","output":"Synthetic Homogeneous Glycoforms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain Reveals Different Binding Profiles of Monoclonal Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests is inherently linked to viral load.

However, it is not approved for mucosal application in Japan. The aims of this study were to investigate if topical povidone iodine (i) inhibits bacterial growth and (ii) disrupts the balance of the oral microbiota. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial included 23 patients who underwent mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. The patients were divided randomly into two groups: the intervention group (n = 16) and the control group (n = 7). All patients received oral cleaning with 3% hydrogen peroxide, followed by irrigation with tap water. The patients in the intervention group received 10% povidone iodine applied topically to the oral cavity. The concentration of total bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid were determined before, immediately after, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after oral care using the Rapid Oral Bacteria Quantification System, which is based on dielectrophoresis and impedance measurements. The number of streptococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans before, immediately after, 1 h, and 3 h after oral care were estimated based on real-time polymerase chain reaction data. RESULTS: After irrigation of the oral cavity, the number of bacteria decreased, but increased again at 1 h after oral care in the control group; however, in the intervention group, the concentration of bacteria was significantly lower than that in the control group at 1 hour (p = 0.009), 2 h (p = 0.001), and 3 h (p = 0.001) after oral care. The growth of all bacterial species tested was inhibited in the intervention group at 3 h after oral care, suggesting that povidone iodine did not disturb the balance of the oral microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of povidone iodine after cleaning and irrigation of the oral cavity inhibited bacterial growth in the oropharyngeal fluid of patients on mechanical ventilation while not disrupting the balance of the oral microbiota.

Paraffin sections were made to compare the developmental differences in testis tissue between mulard and Pekin ducks. Comparative transcriptome sequencing of testis tissues was performed, and the expression of candidate genes was verified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In mulard ducks, spermatogonia and spermatocytes were arranged in a disordered manner, and no mature sperm were observed in the testis tissue. However, different stages of development of sperm were observed in seminiferous tubules in the testis tissue of Pekin ducks. A total of 43.84 Gb of clean reads were assembled into 193 535 UniGenes. Of these, 2131 transcripts exhibited differential expression (false discover rate [Formula: see text] and fold change [Formula: see text]), including 997 upregulated and 1134 downregulated transcripts in mulard ducks as compared to those in Pekin duck testis tissues. Several upregulated genes were related to reproductive functions, including ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), calmodulin (CALM), argininosuccinate synthase and delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase ALDH18A1 (P5CS). Downregulated transcripts included the testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase 3, aquaporin-7 (AQP7) and glycerol kinase GlpK (GK). The 10 related transcripts involved in the developmental biological process were identified by GO (Gene Ontology) annotation. The KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways indicated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and calcium signaling pathways were significantly ([Formula: see text]) associated with normal testis physiology. The differential expression of select genes implicated in reproductive processes was verified by qRT-PCR, which was consistent with the expression trend of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Differentially expressed candidate genes RYR2, CALM, P5CS, AQP7 and GK were identified by transcriptional analysis in mulard and Pekin duck testes. These were important for the normal development of the male duck reproductive system. These data provide a framework for the further exploration of the molecular and genetic mechanisms of sterility in mulard ducks. Highlights. The mulard duck is an intergeneric sterile hybrid offspring resulting from mating between Muscovy and Pekin ducks.

Methods Between 3 August and 19 December 2020, we implemented a household transmission study based on a standardized WHO protocol. We recruited laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected cases through the federal COVID-19 database. Trained contact-tracers interviewed index cases and household members to collect information on demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors. Contacts were followed up for 28 days to identify secondary infections. We estimated SAR and computed odds ratios for risk factors for transmission. Results We included 383 households and 793 contacts. The overall SAR was 17% (95% CI: 14C21). Contacts had an increased odds of infection if the primary case had a cough and runny nose (OR: 4.31 [95% CI: 1.60C11.63]), and if the contact was aged 18C49 years, kissed the primary case or shared a meal with the primary case, OR: 4.67 (95% CI: 1.83C11.93), OR: 3.16 (95% CI 1.19C8.43) and OR: 3.10 (95% CI 1.17C8.27), respectively.

The objective of this study was to relate COVID-19 infection rates to the social vulnerability of the city of Madrid by district, in two different episodes, spring 2020 and summer 2020. METHODS: Analytical cross-sectional study. Taking sociodemographic data of the entire population of the city of Madrid between the months of April and October 2020, together with the cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19, a linear regression analysis, correlation and factor analysis was carried out, relating the cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 and the vulnerability indicator of the districts of the city of Madrid. RESULTS: The results showed important differences between the two episodes of the pandemic: on one hand, the first had more relationship with health factors, while in the second, a relationship appeared with the groups of greater social vulnerability, territorially located in the South-East of the City and related in this case to social factors rather than health. Thus we see that the TIA x 100,000 in the first episode in Chamberi and Usera -two extreme districts in vulnerability- were 896 and 843 cases respectively, while in the second they were 3,708 and 6,258 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The territorial differences in the city become evident with the arrival of a generalised, universal event such as COVID-19, where vulnerability increases for everyone, with greater repercussions in those territories where it already had an impact.","output":"COVID-19 in the city of Madrid and vulnerability.

Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources.

Cytokines and metabolites profiles were assessed using a multiplex cytokine assay and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry respectively. The findings showed that NS1 was able to induce the loss of barrier function in microvascular endothelium in a dose dependent manner, however, the level of NS1 in serum samples did not correlate with the extent of vascular leakage induced. Further assessment of host factors revealed that cytokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CCL20 and CXCL1, as well as adhesion molecule ICAM-1, that are involved in leukocytes infiltration were expressed higher in dengue patients in comparison to healthy individuals. In addition, metabolomics study revealed the presence of deregulated metabolites involved in the phospholipid metabolism pathway in patients with severe manifestations. In conclusion, disease severity in dengue virus infection did not correlate directly with NS1 level, but instead with host factors that are involved in the regulation of junctional integrity and phospholipid metabolism.

However, we demonstrate that a perceived risk to oneself (risk of death) and a motivation to protect oneself can act as a suppressor: conspiracy mentality is linked with an increase in the perception of risk to oneself, which in turn, is associated with normative compliance. We also find that perceived risk of death explains the relationship between conspiracy mentality and non-normative prevention behaviours. Conclusions.

However, following a temporal delay infections started to expand to older age groups. A comprehensive understanding of such transmission dynamics will be key for managing the pandemic in the time to come and to anticipate future developments. The present study thus extends the scope of previous SARS-CoV-2-related research in Switzerland by contributing to deeper insight into the potential impact of &ldquo;social mixing&rdquo; of different age groups on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: The present study examined persons aged 65 years and older with respect to possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure risks using longitudinal panel data from the Swiss COVID-19 Social Monitor. The study used data from two assessments (survey &ldquo;May&rdquo; and survey &ldquo;August&rdquo;). Survey &ldquo;May&rdquo; took place shortly after the release of the lockdown in Switzerland. Survey &ldquo;August&rdquo; was conducted in mid-August. To identify at-risk elderly persons, we conducted a combined factor/k-means clustering analysis of the survey data assessed in August in order to examine different patterns of adherence to recommended preventive measures. RESULTS: In summary, 270 (survey &ldquo;May&rdquo;) and 256 (survey &ldquo;August&rdquo;) persons aged 65 years and older were analysed for the present study. Adherence to established preventive measures was similar across the two surveys, whereas adherence pertaining to social contacts decreased substantially from survey &ldquo;May&rdquo; to survey &ldquo;August&rdquo;. The combined factor/k-means clustering analysis to identify at-risk elderly individuals yielded four distinct groups with regard to different patterns of adherence to recommended preventive measures: a larger group of individuals with many social contacts but high self-reported adherence to preventive measures (n = 86); a small group with many social contacts and overall lower adherence (n = 26); a group with comparatively few contacts and few social activities (n = 66); and a group which differed from the latter through fewer contacts but more social activities (n = 78). Sociodemographic characteristics and risk perception with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infections among the four groups did not differ in a relevant way across the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although many elderly persons continued to follow the recommended preventive measures during the transitional phase between the two pandemic waves, social mixing with younger persons constitutes a way for transmission of infections across age groups.

There is limited research on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on textiles, with the risk of textiles acting as fomites not being well understood. To date, there does not appear to be any published research on the stability of coronaviruses during laundering, which is required to determine the efficacy of current laundering policies in the decontamination of health care textiles. The aim of this study was to investigate the environmental stability of human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E on different textile fiber types and the persistence of HCoV-OC43 on textiles during domestic and industrial laundering. This study demonstrated that human coronaviruses (5 log10 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]) remain infectious on polyester for &#8805;72 h, cotton for &#8805;24 h, and polycotton for &#8805;6 h; HCoV-OC43 was also able to transfer from polyester to PVC or polyester after 72 h. Under clean conditions, HCoV-OC43 was not detectable on cotton swatches laundered with industrial and domestic wash cycles without temperature and detergent (&#8805;4.57-log10-TCID50 reduction), suggesting that the dilution and agitation of wash cycles are sufficient to remove human coronaviruses from textiles. In the presence of interfering substances (artificial saliva), &#8804;1.78 log10 TCID50 HCoV-OC43 was detected after washing domestically without temperature and detergent, unlike industrial laundering, where the virus was completely removed. However, no infectious HCoV-OC43 was detected when washed domestically with detergent.IMPORTANCE Synthetic textiles such as polyester could potentially act as fomites of human coronaviruses, indicating the importance of infection control procedures during handling of contaminated textiles prior to laundering. This study provides novel evidence that human coronaviruses can persist on textiles for up to 3 days and are readily transferred from polyester textile to other surfaces after 72 h of incubation. This is of particular importance for the domestic laundering of contaminated textiles such as health care uniforms in the United Kingdom and United States, where there may be a risk of cross-contaminating the domestic environment. It was demonstrated that human coronaviruses are removed from contaminated textiles by typical domestic and commercial wash cycles, even at low temperatures without detergent, indicating that current health care laundering policies are likely sufficient in the decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 from textiles.","output":"The Stability of Model Human Coronaviruses on Textiles in the Environment and during Health Care Laundering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Predictive factors associated with stent-retriever thrombectomy for patients with acute anterior circulation stroke remain to be elucidated.

RESULTS Using multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 0.965; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944-0.986; P=0.001), successful revascularization (OR, 4.658; 95% CI, 2.240-9.689; P<0.001), parenchymal hemorrhage (OR, 0.150; 95% CI, 0.049-0.460; P=0.001), and baseline NIHSS score (OR, 0.908; 95% CI, 0.855-0.965; P=0.002) were independent predictors of good outcome. Independent predictors of mortality were age (OR, 1.043; 95% CI, 1.002-1.086; P=0.041), successful revascularization (OR, 0.171; 95% CI, 0.079-0.370; P<0.001), parenchymal hemorrhage (OR, 2.961; 95% CI, 1.059-8.276; P=0.038), and a history of previous stroke/TIA (OR, 3.124; 95% CI, 1.340-7.281; P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS Age, revascularization status, and parenchymal hemorrhage are independent predictors of both good outcome and mortality after stent retriever thrombectomy for acute anterior circulation stroke. In addition, NIHSS score on admission is independently associated with good outcome, whereas a history of previous stroke is independently associated with mortality.","output":"Predictive Factors for Good Outcome and Mortality After Stent-Retriever Thrombectomy in Patients With Acute Anterior Circulation Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sensors is instituting the Best Paper Award to recognize outstanding papers published in the journal [...].","output":"Sensors 2020 Best Paper Awards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can persist on surfaces, suggesting possible surface-mediated transmission of this pathogen.

Interview guides were informed by the Resilience Framework for Public Health Emergency Preparedness and analyzed using a directed content analysis approach. RESULTS: Fifty-five clinical staff participated in the study. Three themes emerged from the data: 1) Risk assessment and planning: The powder keg, 2) Innovative evolution of roles and responsibilities, and 3) Pandemic response and capacity. In the early phases of the pandemic, participants reported varying levels of risks for dying. However, most participants adapted to practice changes and became innovative in their roles over time. Hierarchies were less relevant during care delivery, whereas team collaboration became crucial in managing workforce capacity. DISCUSSION: As the pandemic progressed, staff preparedness evolved through a trial-and-error approach.

Transition between hosts results in distinct environmental signals that influence patterns of gene expression, consistent with the morphological and functional changes operating in the parasites during their life stages. In addition,comparing differential patterns of gene expression among mammalian and tick parasite stages can provide clues for developing improved methods of control. Hereby, we upgraded the genome assembly of Babesia bovis, a bovine hemoparasite, closing a 139 kbp gap, and used RNA-Seq datasets derived from mammalian blood and tick kinete stages to update the genome annotation. Of the originally annotated genes, 1254 required structural changes , and 326 new genes were identified, leading to a different predicted proteome compared to the original annotation. Next, the RNA-Seq data was used to identify B. bovis genes that were differentially expressed in the vertebrate and arthropod hosts. In blood stages, 28% of the genes were upregulated up to 300 fold, whereas 26% of the genes in kinetes, a tick stage, were upregulated up to >19,000 fold. We thus discovered differentially expressed genes that may play key biological roles and serve as suitable targets for the development of vaccines to control bovine babesiosis.","output":"Comparative analysis of gene expression between Babesia bovis blood stages and kinetes allowed by improved genome annotation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Food insecurity has been linked to poor health outcomes, however this relationship is poorly understood among women of reproductive age. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between food insecurity and common mental health problems (CMHPs) in this population of women in Kabul, Afghanistan. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 421 women of reproductive age from four health centers located in four randomly selected zones in the city of Kabul. We used the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) food-insecurity questionnaire, multiple 24-h recall for dietary intake, the Depression, the Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess major mental health problems, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to assess physical activity. Result: Food insecurity affected 69.6% of reproductive-aged women. In total, 44.9, 10.9, and 13.9% of food-insecure participants had food insecurity without hunger, food insecurity with hunger, and food insecurity with severe hunger, respectively. Depression, anxiety, and stress were prevalent among food-insecure participants at 89.4, 90.8, and 85.7%, respectively.

The virtual community is divided into family groups with 2-6 individuals in each group. Agents interact with other agents in virtual public places like at grocery stores, on public transportation and in offices. We initially seed the virtual community with a very small number of infected individuals and then monitor the disease spread and hospitalization over a period of fifty days, which is a typical time-frame for the initial spread of a pandemic. An uninfected or asymptomatic agent is randomly selected from a random family group in each simulation step for visiting a random public space. An uninfected agent contracts infection if the public place is occupied by other infected agents. We have calibrated our simulation rounds according to the size of the population of the virtual community for simulating realistic exposure of agents to a contagion.

Literature on the impact on individuals with eating disorders is slowly emerging. While outpatient eating disorder services in Canada have attempted to transition to virtual care, guidelines related to optimal virtual care in this field are lacking. As such, the objective of our Canadian Consensus Panel was to develop clinical practice guidelines related to the provision of virtual care for children, adolescents, and emerging adults living with an eating disorder, as well as their caregivers, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. METHODS: Using scoping review methodology (with literature in databases from 2000 to 2020 and grey literature from 2010 to 2020), the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation tool, and a panel of diverse stakeholders from across Canada, we developed high quality treatment guidelines that are focused on virtual interventions for children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, and their caregivers. RESULTS: Strong recommendations were supported specifically in favour of in-person medical evaluation when necessary for children, adolescents, and emerging adults, and that equity-seeking groups and marginalized youth should be provided equal access to treatment. For children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for telehealth family-based treatment (FBT) and online guided parental self-help FBT. For emerging adults, internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based guided self-help was strongly recommended. Weak recommendations for emerging adults included CBT-based group internet interventions as treatment adjuncts, internet-based relapse prevention Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) guided self-help, telehealth relapse prevention using MANTRA, and guided CBT-based smartphone apps as treatment adjuncts. For caregivers of children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for virtual parent meal support training, and moderated online caregiver forums and support groups. For caregivers of emerging adults, guided parental self-help CBT was strongly recommended, and unguided caregiver psychoeducation self-help was weakly recommended.

Regarding Portugal, a suppression strategy with social distancing was adopted, attempting to break the transmission chains, bending the epidemy curve and reducing mortality. These measures seek to prevent an eventual National Health Service over-running, enforcing the suspension of all elective and non-urgent health care. Despite the success in so far, there is a consensus on the need to recover the previous level of health care provision and further enhance it. The Portuguese National Health Service, as a public, universal access, health care system funded by the State proved, in this context, its importance and relevance to the Portuguese population. However, long standing issues, such as the pre pandemic over long waiting lists for hospital ophthalmology attendance, whose determinants are fully identified but still unmet, emerge amplified from this pandemic. The lack of primary eye care in the National Health Service is a significant bottleneck, placing a huge stress on hospital-based care. An exclusive ophthalmologist's center care was over-runned before pandemic and will be even more so.

Among the risk factors, hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections, cirrhosis, and male gender are widely reported. The clinical appearance of cHCC-CCA is similar to that of HCC and iCCA and it is usually silent until advanced states, causing a delay of diagnosis. Diagnosis is mainly based on histology from biopsies or surgical specimens. Correct pre-surgical diagnosis during imaging studies is very problematic and is due to the heterogeneous characteristics of the lesion in imaging, with overlapping features of HCC and CCA. The predominant histological subtype within the lesion establishes the predominant imaging findings. Therefore, in this scenario, the radiological findings characteristic of HCC show an overlap with those of CCA. Since cHCC-CCAs are prevalent in patients at high risk of HCC and there is a risk that these may mimic HCC, it is currently difficult to see a non-invasive diagnosis of HCC. Surgery is the only curative treatment of HCC-CCA. The role of liver transplantation (LT) in the treatment of cHCC-CCA remains controversial, as is the role of ablative or systemic therapies in the treatment of this tumour. These lesions still remain challenging, both in diagnosis and in the treatment phase. Therefore, a pre-treatment imaging diagnosis is essential, as well as the identification of prognostic factors that could stratify the risk of recurrence and the most adequate therapy according to patient characteristics.","output":"Combined Hepatocellular-Cholangiocarcinoma: What the Multidisciplinary Team Should Know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is accumulating evidence showing that influenza infection and cardiorespiratory diseases are closely associated.

It is common for risk and resilience studies to model system recovery by analyzing a single or aggregated measure of performance, such as economic output or system functionality. However, the history of past disasters and recent risk literature suggest that a single-dimension view of relevant systems is not only insufficient, but can compromise the ability to manage risk for these systems. In this article, we explore how multiple dimensions influence the ability for complex systems to function and effectively recover after a disaster. In particular, we compile evidence from the many competing resilience perspectives to identify the most critical resilience dimensions across several academic disciplines, applications, and disaster events. The findings demonstrate the need for a conceptual framework that decomposes resilience into six primary dimensions: workforce/population, economy, infrastructure, geography, hierarchy, and time (WEIGHT). These dimensions are not typically addressed holistically in the literature; often they are either modeled independently or in piecemeal combinations. The current research is the first to provide a comprehensive discussion of each resilience dimension and discuss how these dimensions can be integrated into a cohesive framework, suggesting that no single dimension is sufficient for a holistic analysis of a disaster risk management. Through this article, we also aim to spark discussions among researchers and policymakers to develop a multicriteria decision framework for evaluating the efficacy of resilience strategies. Furthermore, the WEIGHT dimensions may also be used to motivate the generation of new approaches for data analytics of resilience-related knowledge bases.","output":"Workforce/Population, Economy, Infrastructure, Geography, Hierarchy, and Time (WEIGHT): Reflections on the Plural Dimensions of Disaster Resilience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid growth of research in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) follows on two substantial developments.

All FBs were retrieved immediately following original procedures under local or general anaesthesia, using combined computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopic guidance. The basic technique involved positioning a 6G trocar sleeve around the FB long axis and co-axially advancing an 8G biopsy needle to retrieve the FB within the biopsy core. Retrospective chart review facilitated analysis of procedures, FBs, technical success, and complications. RESULTS Mean FB size was 23 mm (range 8-74 mm). Four FBs were located within 10 mm of non-vascular significant anatomic structures. The basic technique was successful in 3 cases; 2 cases required technical modifications including using a stiff guide-wire to facilitate retrieval in the case of the post-cryoablation FB; and using the central mandrin of the 6G trocar to push a cement tract back into an augmented vertebra when initial retrieval failed.

METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical data of six Chinese families with autosomal dominant congenital cataracts were recorded. Targeted exome sequencing was applied to detect the underlying genetic defects for the families. Generated variants were confirmed by PCR and sanger sequencing. Afterward, bioinformatic analysis through several computational predictive programs was performed to assess impacts of mutations on protein structure and function. RESULTS: A total of 53 participants (23 affected and 30 unaffected) from six unrelated Chinese families were recruited. Cataract phenotypes covered nuclear, total, posterior polar, pulverulent, snowflake-like, and zonular. Through targeted exome sequencing, six mutations in four ?-crystallin genes were revealed which included five missense mutations CRYBB1 p.Q70P, CRYBB2 p.E23Q, CRYBB2 p.A49V, CRYBB2 R188C, CRYBA4 p.M14K and one splice mutation CRYBB3 c.75+1 G>A. In silico results predicted pathogenic for all four missense variants except variant CRYBB2-p.A49V yielded results as tolerant. The CRYBB3 c.75+1 G>A splice site mutation was predicted to be deleterious by leading to a broken splice site, a premature stop codon, and subsequently resulting in a short peptide of 113 amino acids, which may affect protein features. CONCLUSION: The obtained results expanded mutational and phenotype spectrum of ?-crystallin genes and offer clues for pathogenesis of congenital cataracts.

The primary aim of this systematic review is to determine whether HFNT in AT2RF improves 1) PaCO 2, 2) clinical and patient-centred outcomes and 3) to assess potential harms. Methods: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (January 1999-January 2021). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing HFNT with low flow nasal oxygen (LFO) or NIV were included. Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, data extraction and risk of bias. We used Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs and Ottawa-Newcastle scale for cohort studies. Results: From 727 publications reviewed, four RCTs and one cohort study (n=425) were included. In three trials of HFNT vs NIV, comparing PaCO 2 (kPa) at last follow-up time point, there was a significant reduction at four hours (1 RCT; HFNT median 6.7, IQR 5.6 - 7.7 vs NIV median 7.6, IQR 6.3 - 9.3) and no significant difference at 24-hours or five days. Comparing HFNT with LFO, there was no significant difference at 30-minutes. There was no difference in intubation or mortality. Conclusions: This review identified a small number of studies with low to very low certainty of evidence. A reduction of PaCO 2 at an early time point of four hours post-intervention was demonstrated in one small RCT. Significant limitations of the included studies were lack of adequately powered outcomes and clinically relevant time-points and small sample size.

However, the detection method needs improvement. In this study, we used Nanopore sequencing to build a quick detection protocol and compared the efficiency of different methods for detecting 7 VAP pathogens. METHODS: The endotracheal aspirate (ETA) of 83 patients with suspected VAP from Peking University Third Hospital (PUTH) was collected, saponins were used to deplete host genomes, and PCR- or non-PCR-amplified library construction methods were used and compared. Sequence was performed with MinION equipment and local data analysis methods were used for sequencing and data analysis. RESULTS: Saponin depletion effectively removed 11 of 12 human genomes, while most pathogenic bacterial genome results showed no significant difference except for S. pneumoniae. Moreover, the average sequence time decreased from 19.6 h to 3.62 h. The non-PCR amplification method and PCR amplification method for library build has a similar average sensitivity (85.8% vs. 86.35%), but the non-PCR amplification method has a better average specificity (100% VS 91.15%), and required less time.

In the present study, a lipopolymeric nanoparticle (NP) containing Br was developed to enhance its stability and oral delivery efficiency. Firstly, Br was loaded into poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) and PLGA-phosphatidylcholine (PLGA-PC) NPs using double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. Then, Br integrity and activity were investigated using SDS-PAGE and gelatin test. The stability and release profile of Br from synthetized NPs were evaluated at different pH values of the digestive system. Furthermore, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and the amount of Br passage from Caco-2 cells were explored. The results showed PLGA-PC-Br NPs had higher encapsulation efficiency (83%) compared to PLGA-Br NPs (50%). In addition, this NP showed more Br released in neutral (20.36%) and acidic (34%) environments compared to PLGA-Br NPs after 5 days. The delay in the release of Br from PLGA-PC-Br NPs versus the faster release of Br from PLGA-Br formulation could assure that an appropriate concentration of Br has reached the intestine. Intestinal absorption study demonstrated that lipid polymer NPs were able to pass through Caco-2 cells about 1.5 times more (98.4%) than polymeric NPs (70%). In conclusion, PLGA-PC NPs would be considered as a promising lipid-polymer nanocarrier for effective intestinal absorption of Br.","output":"Bromelain Loaded Lipid-Polymer Hybrid Nanoparticles for Oral Delivery: Formulation and Characterization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to recent results from clinical intra-arterial treatment for acute ischemic stroke (IAT-AIS) trials such as the interventional management of stroke III, IAT-AIS and the merit of revascularization have been contested. Even though intra-arterial treatment (IAT) has been shown to improve revascularization rates, a corresponding increase in good outcomes has only recently been noted. Even though a significant percentage of patients achieve good revascularization in a timely manner, results do not translate into good clinical outcomes (GCOs). Based on a review of the literature, the authors suspect limited GCOs following timely and successful revascularization are due to poor patient selection that led to futile and possibly even harmful revascularization. The capillary index score (CIS) is a simple angiography-based scale that can potentially be used to improve patient selection to prevent revascularization being performed on patients who are unlikely to benefit from treatment. The CIS characterizes presence of capillary blush related to collateral flow as a marker of residual viable tissue, with absence of blush indicating the tissue is no longer viable due to ischemia. By only selecting patients with a favorable CIS for IAT, the rate of GCOs should consistently approach 80-90%. Current methods of patient selection are primarily dependent on time from ischemia. Time from cerebral ischemia to irreversible tissue damage seems to vary from patient to patient; so focusing on viable tissue based on the CIS rather than relying on an artificial time window seems to be a more appropriate approach to patient selection.","output":"Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment, Part 2: Treatment \\"Roles of Capillary Index Score, Revascularization and Time\\"."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":".","output":"Reopening Endoscopy after the COVID-19 Outbreak: Indications from a High Incidence Scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is interest in assessing if per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposures are associated with any increased risk of COVID-19 or its severity, given the evidence of immunosuppression by some PFAS. The objective of this paper is to evaluate at the ecological level if a large area (Red Zone) of the Veneto Region, where residents were exposed for decades to drinking water contaminated by PFAS, showed higher mortality for COVID-19 than the rest of the region. METHODS: We fitted a Bayesian ecological regression model with spatially and not spatially structured random components on COVID-19 mortality at the municipality level (period between 21 February and 15 April 2020). The model included education score, background all-cause mortality (for the years 2015-2019), and an indicator for the Red Zone. The two random components are intended to adjust for potential hidden confounders. RESULTS: The COVID-19 crude mortality rate ratio for the Red Zone was 1.55 (90% Confidence Interval 1.25; 1.92). From the Bayesian ecological regression model adjusted for education level and baseline all-cause mortality, the rate ratio for the Red Zone was 1.60 (90% Credibility Interval 0.94; 2.51). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we observed a higher mortality risk for COVID-19 in a population heavily exposed to PFAS, which was possibly explained by PFAS immunosuppression, bioaccumulation in lung tissue, or pre-existing disease being related to PFAS.","output":"Exposure to Perfluoroalkyl Substances and Mortality for COVID-19: A Spatial Ecological Analysis in the Veneto Region (Italy)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Viral pneumonias are a major cause of childhood mortality.

Here, each of these components is analyzed as a function of the angle of rotation, as well as in terms of the wave-function localization properties. In particular, it is proved that the non-Abelian operator represents interlayer currents between each layer triangular sublattices, i.e., a second-neighbor interlayer current between bipartite sublattices. A crossover is seen between such contributions and thus the first magic angle is different from other higher order magic angles. Such angles are determined by a balance between the negative energy contribution from interlayer currents and the positive contributions from the kinetic and confinement energies. A perturbative analysis performed around the first magic angle allows to explore analytically the details of such energy balance.","output":"Why the first magic-angle is different from others in twisted graphene bilayers: interlayer currents, kinetic and confinement energy and wavefunction localization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fluorescent reporters have revolutionized modern applications in the fields of molecular and synthetic biology, enabling applications ranging from education to point-of-care diagnostics. Past advancements in these fields have primarily focused on improving reaction conditions, the development of new applications, and the broad dissemination of these technologies. However, field and classroom-based applications have remained limited in part due to the nature of fluorescent signal detection, which often requires the use of costly lab equipment to observe and quantify fluorescence readouts. Users without access to laboratory equipment rely on qualitative assessments of fluorescence, a process that remains highly variable from user-to-user even within the same classroom. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a foldable illuminator and incubator device to support field-applications of synthetic biology-based biosensors for education and diagnostics. The Fold-Illuminator is an affordable, portable, and recyclable device that allows for the visible detection of fluorescent biomolecules. The Fold-Illuminator's design allows for assembly in under 10 min, a user can then utilize the optional heating element to incubate biochemical reactions and visualize fluorescence outputs in a defined and light-controlled environment. Interchangeable LED strips and light-filtering screens provide modularity to pair with the fluorescence wavelengths of interest. The user can then unfold the device for convenient storage, transport, or even recycling. The cost for the Fold-Illuminator is $5.58 USD and is compatible with an optional heating element for an additional $3.98 cost, with potential for further reductions in cost for larger quantities. Open-source templates for cutting device parts from paper stock are provided for both printing and cutting by hand; cutting can also be achieved with consumer-grade smart cutting machines such as the Cricut?.

Our goal was to see if modifying cover letter information would prevent non-random non-response bias altogether. Our secondary goal tested whether larger incentives would reduce non-response bias. METHODS: A mailed, survey of 480 male and 480 female, nationally representative, Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, or New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) Veterans applying for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cover letters conveyed different information about the survey's topics (combat, unwanted sexual attention, or lifetime and military experiences), how Veterans' names had been selected (list of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans or list of Veterans applying for disability benefits), and what incentive Veterans would receive ($20 or $40). The main outcome, non-response bias, measured differences between survey respondents' and sampling frame's characteristics on 8 administrative variables, including Veterans' receipt of VA disability benefits and exposure to combat or military sexual trauma. Analysis was intention to treat. We used ANOVA for factorial block-design, logistic, mixed-models to assess bias and multiple imputation and expectation-maximization algorithms to assess potential missing mechanisms (missing completely at random, missing at random, or not random) of two self-reported variables: combat and military sexual assault. RESULTS: Regardless of intervention, men with any VA disability benefits, women with PTSD disability benefits, and women with combat exposure were over-represented among respondents. Interventions explained 0.0 to 31.2% of men's variance and 0.6 to 30.5% of women's variance in combat non-response bias and 10.2 to 43.0% of men's variance and 0.4 to 31.9% of women's variance in military sexual trauma non-response bias. Non-random assumptions showed that men's self-reported combat exposure was overestimated by 19.0 to 28.8 percentage points and their self-reported military sexual assault exposure was underestimated by 14.2 to 28.4 percentage points compared to random missingness assumptions. Women's self-reported combat exposure was overestimated by 8.6 to 10.6 percentage points and military sexual assault exposure, by 1.2 to 6.9 percentage points. CONCLUSIONS: Our interventions reduced bias in some characteristics, leaving others unaffected or exacerbated.

It can be influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, and lifestyle choices. The assessment of body composition is an essential tool for nutrition specialists to effectively evaluate nutritional status and monitor progression during dietary interventions. As humans age, there is a natural increase in fat mass coupled with a gradual decline in lean mass, specifically in bone and muscle mass. Individuals with a high body fat percentage are at a greater risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, several types of cancer, and early mortality. Significant decreases in bone mineral density signify osteopenia and osteoporosis, while reductions in skeletal muscle mass increase the risk of developing sarcopenia. Moreover, undernutrition exacerbates the effects of many medical conditions and is important to address. Though weight tracking and calculation of BMI are used commonly by clinicians and dietitians, these measures do not provide insight on the relative contributions of fat mass and fat-free mass or the changes in these compartments that may reflect disease risk.

Four groups of male Wistar rats were provided with a diet composed of 33% (w/w) of genetically modified potatoes (GMP) or 33% of the commercial Spunta variety (Sp), and a control group fed with the basal rats' diet. The influence of the GMP on rat behavior and overall health parameters was evaluated and compared with that of commercial potato (i.e., the Sp group) and control diet. RESULTS: Small differences were noticed in the chemical composition of the different tubers, but all the diets were adjusted to an identical caloric level. Results showed that no sign of toxic or detrimental effects on the rats' overall health were remarked as a result of these diet consumption. The rats fed with the GMP meal showed hematological and biochemical composition of the plasma comparable to the control groups. No histopathological damage nor any structural disorganization, severe congestion, or acute inflammation were noticed in the rats' tissues. CONCLUSION: Under these study conditions, the GMP diets did not induce any apparent or significant adverse effects on rats after 30 days of dietary administration in comparison with rats fed diets with the corresponding non-transgenic diet and the standard diet group.

In the present review, we discuss the data emerged from research of leptin in obesity as an inflammatory mediator sustaining multifactorial diseases and how this knowledge could be instrumental in the design of leptin-based manipulation strategies to help restoration of abnormal immune responses. On the other direction, chronic inflammation, either from autoimmune or infectious diseases, or impaired microbiota (dysbiosis) may impair the leptin response inducing resistance to the weight control, and therefore it may be a cause of obesity.

In this paper, the underlying causes of changes in premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 pollution and the response of this mitigation policy in China were explored using sensitivity analysis. The simulated annual average PM2.5 concentration reduced by 24.9% over mainland China from 2008 to 2016. Subsequently, national premature mortality would decrease by 14.4% from 1.14 million (95% CI: 0.54, 1.55) in 2008 to 0.98 million (95% CI: 0.44, 1.38) in 2016. Specifically, premature mortality reduced by 209,600 cases (-18.3%) owing to PM2.5 reduction during 2008-2016, of which 188,500 cases were from 2014 to 2016 due to the Action Plan in 2013. Note that the health benefits were limited when compared with air quality improvements, mainly due to that the IER functions have a stable curve at higher concentration intervals. Meanwhile, premature mortality would have increased by 14.2% from 2008 to 2016 owing to demographic changes, substantially weakening the impact of the decrease in PM2.5 and baseline mortality.

We collected data on 8 million calls from 19 countries, focusing on the COVID-19 crisis. Call volumes peaked six weeks after the initial outbreak, at 35% above pre-pandemic levels. The increase was driven mainly by fear (including fear of infection), loneliness and, later in the pandemic, concerns about physical health. Relationship issues, economic problems, violence and suicidal ideation, however, were less prevalent than before the pandemic. This pattern was apparent both during the first wave and during subsequent COVID-19 waves. Issues linked directly to the pandemic therefore seem to have replaced rather than exacerbated underlying anxieties. Conditional on infection rates, suicide-related calls increased when containment policies became more stringent and decreased when income support was extended. This implies that financial relief can allay the distress triggered by lockdown measures and illustrates the insights that can be gleaned from the statistical analysis of helpline data.","output":"Mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic as revealed by helpline calls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary The study analyzed health care workers (HCWs) knowledge, practices, and attitudes regarding COVID-19.

The rapid airborne transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of a vaccine, calls for active containment measures to avoid the propagation of transmission chains. The best strategy up to date, popularly known as Test-Track-Treat (TTT), consist in testing the population for diagnosis, track the contacts of those infected, and treat by quarantine all these cases. The dynamical process that better describes the combined action of the former mechanisms is that of a contagion process that competes with the spread of the pathogen, cutting off potential contagion pathways. Here we propose a compartmental model that couples the dynamics of the infection with the contact tracing and isolation of cases. We develop an analytical expression for the effective case reproduction number $R_c(t)$ that reveals the role of contact tracing in the mitigation and suppression of the epidemics. We show that there is a trade off between the infection propagation and the isolation of cases. If the isolation is limited to symptomatic individuals only, the incidence curve can be flattened but not bended. However, if contact tracing is applied to asymptomatic individuals too, the strategy can bend the curve and suppress the epidemics. Quantitative results are dependent on the network topology. We quantify, the most important indicator of the effectiveness of contact tracing, namely its capacity to reverse the increasing tendency of the epidemic curve, causing its bending.","output":"Virus spread versus contact tracing: two competing contagion processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the modern synthesis, the fitness effects of mutations and epistasis have been central yet provocative concepts in evolutionary and population genetics.

Thus, this review characterizes the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) antibodies after the second dose of a primary cycle of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. A systematic search of literature was performed and a total of 18 studies (N=15,980) were identified and reviewed. The percent difference of means of reported antibody titers were then calculated to determine the decline in humoral response after the peak levels post-vaccination. Findings revealed that the peak humoral response was reached at 21-28 days after the second dose, after which serum levels progressively diminished at 4-6 months post-vaccination. Additionally, results showed that regardless of age, sex, serostatus and presence of comorbidities, longitudinal data reporting antibody measurement exhibited a decline of both anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and anti-spike IgG, ranging from 94-95% at 90-180 days and 55-85% at 140-160 days, respectively, after the peak antibody response. This suggests that the rate of antibody decline may be independent of patient-related factors and peak antibody titers but mainly a function of time and antibody class/molecular target.

Based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Because no specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing the outbreak. Here, we report a field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The sensor was produced by coating graphene sheets of the FET with a specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The performance of the sensor was determined using antigen protein, cultured virus, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients. Our FET device could detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline and 100 fg/mL clinical transport medium. In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6  101 pfu/mL) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42  102 copies/mL). Thus, we have successfully fabricated a promising FET biosensor for SARS-CoV-2; our device is a highly sensitive immunological diagnostic method for COVID-19 that requires no sample pretreatment or labeling.","output":"Rapid Detection of COVID-19 Causative Virus (SARS-CoV-2) in Human Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens Using Field-Effect Transistor-Based Biosensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 was characterised by a worldwide pandemic crisis due to dissemination of a Coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 also named COVID-19.

DESIGN Neonatal pigs were exposed to PRCV when they were 2, 4, or 6 days old and challenge-exposed to virulent TGEV at 10 days of age. ANIMALS 34 hysterectomy-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs. PROCEDURE After challenge exposure, clinical signs were observed, body weight, antibody response, and virus shedding were measured, and mortality was determined. RESULTS After exposure to PRCV, principals had a slightly slower rate of weight gain than did controls; with 1 exception (a PRCV-exposed pig that was dyspneic for 1 day), principals and controls remained clinically normal until shortly after challenge exposure, when all pigs became listless and anorectic and developed watery diarrhea. However, by day 3, most of the pigs that had been exposed to PRCV when they were either 2 or 4 days old began to recover and most (15/18) survived. Conversely, the clinical condition of most of the other pigs worsened and most (14/16) died. Pigs exposed to PRCV when they were 2 or 4 days old also differed from all other pigs in that they had serum virus-neutralizing antibodies for PRCV and TGEV at the time of challenge exposure. CONCLUSIONS The PRCV can induce protective immunity to TGEV in neonatal pigs and such immunity develops at or about 6 days after exposure to PRCV. Moreover, protective immunity may be coincident with the appearance of virus-neutralizing antibody.

Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) has been shown to be useful with combining with damage control laparotomy in identifying and controlling active arterial hemorrhage. Hybrid operating room (OR) allows both damaged control surgery and TAE in the same location in minimal time. We report a case of a patient with three cardiac arrests who was saved by early intervention using damage control surgery (DCS) with interventional radiology (IVR) in the hybrid OR. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old woman was injured in a collision with a tree while snowboarding. She was eventually transported to hybrid operating room in our hospital with the diagnosis of significant liver laceration and hemorrhagic shock. Damage control surgery was performed with perihepatic packing (PHP) and TAE was conducted to stop active bleeding from right hepatic artery. She experienced 3 times of cardiopulmonary arrest, which was successfully resuscitated on each occasion. Although she had total of 3 times of laparotomy but tolerated well. She was discharged on day 82 of hospitalization and showed no neurological sequelae.

We built a simplified computational model, called SpikePro, to predict the SARS-CoV-2 fitness from the amino acid sequence and structure of the spike protein. It contains three contributions: the inter-human transmissibility of the virus predicted from the stability of the spike protein, the infectivity computed in terms of the affinity of the spike protein for the ACE2 receptor, and the ability of the virus to escape from the human immune response based on the binding affinity of the spike protein for a set of neutralizing antibodies. Our model reproduces well the available experimental, epidemiological and clinical data on the impact of variants on the biophysical characteristics of the virus. For example, it is able to identify circulating viral strains that, by increasing their fitness, recently became dominant at the population level. SpikePro is a useful, freely available instrument which predicts rapidly and with good accuracy the dangerousness of new viral strains.

Summary of Frequency and Time Burden with Nursing Practices in an Emergency Room COVID-19 Isolation Zone. Note. IV, intravenous;IM, intramuscular;ID, intradermal;SC, subcutaneous;PPE, personal protective equipment;CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation Methods With institutional review board approval, we recruited ER nurses who were assigned to COVID-19 isolation zone with more than 6 months ER work experience. After their demographic information were collected through a questionnaire, their nursing practices and practice time during their 1 shift (day or evening) were recorded by one researcher using a stopwatch and an observation form. For each observation shift, unit-related information was collected, including the numbers of hospitalized patients, admission, discharge, and transfer of patients. For each nursing practice, frequency and total time spent were analyzed using descriptive statistics with SPSS 26.0 program. Results From January 4 to February 22, 2021, a total 18 nurses (27.4 years old on average with 25.2 months of ER experience) were observed from 20 different shifts. During the observation period, the average number of nurses working hours was 8.27  0.39 hours. A total of 6,567 tasks were monitored with 337,703 seconds (93.81 hours) of the total time spent. Infection control practices were most frequent (33.88%) followed by nursing management (27.80%), assessment and observation (11.07%), medication (10.35%), pre and post examination care(4.86%), education (4.37%), communication (4.10%), safety care (1.10%), and others (0.03;Table 1).

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in acute situations, where it is associated with more complications and higher mortality. Methods Analysis of the international HOPE registry (NCT04334291). The objective was to assess the prognostic information of AF in COVID-19 patients. A multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed to assess the relationship between AF and mortality. We also evaluated the impact on mortality and embolic events of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in these patients. Results Among 6217 patients enrolled in the HOPE registry, 250 had AF (4.5%). AF patients had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. After propensity score matching, these differences were attenuated. Despite this, patients with AF had a higher incidence of in-hospital complications such as heart failure (19.3% vs 11.6%, P =.021) and respiratory insufficiency (75.9% vs 62.3%, P =.002), as well as a higher 60-day mortality rate (43.4% vs 30.9%, P =.005). On multivariate analysis, AF was independently associated with higher 60-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.234; 95%CI, 1.003-1.519).

Few data on COVID-19 and its impact on nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are available from low and middle-income countries (LMICs). As these countries often have high rates of AMR, it is vital to report the effects of COVID-19 on AMS so as to inform clinical practice and IPC guidelines. This study aims to compare prevalence of AMR in COVID-19 wards with general non-COVID-19 hospital wards. Methods This pilot hospital-based study is being conducted in two sites in both Sudan and Zambia. IPC and AMS guidelines for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards were identified for each institution. This study is comparing bacterial isolates and AMR patterns of nosocomial associated infections acquired on COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards were compared, using microbiological and sequencing methods. A total of 200 patients have been recruited: 100 per country, 50 COVID-19 patients and 50 non-COVID-19 patients.

However, little research to date has empirically explored influential factors of consumer willingness toward using these novel technologies, and the effect of individual differences in predicting this willingness. Objectives: This study aims to explore (a) the influential factors of consumers' willingness to use health chatbots related to COVID-19, (b) the effect of individual differences in predicting willingness, and (c) the likelihood of using health chatbots in the near future as well as the challenges/barriers that could hinder peoples' motivations. Methods: An online survey was conducted which comprised of two sections. Section one measured participants' willingness by evaluating the following six factors: performance efficacy, intrinsic motivation, anthropomorphism, social influence, facilitating conditions, and emotions. Section two included questions on demographics, the likelihood of using health chatbots in the future, and concerns that could impede such motivation. Results: A total of 166 individuals provided complete responses. Although 40% were aware of health chatbots and only 24% had used them before, about 84% wanted to use health chatbots in the future. The strongest predictors of willingness to use health chatbots came from the intrinsic motivation factor whereas the next strongest predictors came from the performance efficacy factor. Nearly 39.5% of participants perceived health chatbots to have human-like features such as consciousness and free will, but no emotions. About 38.4% were uncertain about the ease of using health chatbots.

METHODS The Truven Health Database, consisting of 279 employers and over 3000 hospitals, was reviewed for all umbilical hernia patients, aged 18-64 who were enrolled in health plans for 12 months prior to surgery and 12 months after surgery. Patients were excluded if they had a recurrence or had been offered a \\"no surgery\\" approach within 1 year of the index date. The remaining patients were separated into surgery (open or laparoscopic repair) or no surgery (NS). Post-cost analysis at 90 and 365 days and estimated days off from work were reviewed for each group. RESULTS The non-surgery cohort had a higher proportion of females and comorbidity index. Adjusted analysis showed significantly higher 90 and 365 costs for the surgery group (p < 0.0001), though the cost difference did decrease over time. NS group had significantly higher estimated days of health-care utilization at both the 90 (1.99 vs. 3.58 p < 0.0001) and 365 (8.69 vs. 11.04 p < 0.0001) day post-index mark.

Many recent approaches have also extended U-Net with more complex building blocks, which typically increase the number of network parameters considerably. Such complexity makes the inference stage highly inefficient for clinical applications. Towards an effective yet economic segmentation network design, in this work, we propose backward skip connections that bring decoded features back to the encoder. Our design can be jointly adopted with forward skip connections in any encoder-decoder architecture forming a recurrence structure without introducing extra parameters. With the backward skip connections, we propose a U-Net based network family, namely Bi-directional O-shape networks, which set new benchmarks on multiple public medical imaging segmentation datasets. On the other hand, with the most plain architecture (BiO-Net), network computations inevitably increase along with the pre-set recurrence time. We have thus studied the deficiency bottleneck of such recurrent design and propose a novel two-phase Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm, namely BiX-NAS, to search for the best multi-scale bi-directional skip connections. The ineffective skip connections are then discarded to reduce computational costs and speed up network inference. The finally searched BiX-Net yields the least network complexity and outperforms other state-of-the-art counterparts by large margins.

The aim of our study was to study its impact on activity related to emergencies in hand and upper limb trauma in comparison to the same reference period in 2019. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All consecutive patients consulting for upper limb injury requiring urgent care at Georges-Pompidou European Hospital (HEGP), France, during the lockdown period (case group) and the equivalent period in 2019 (control group) were included. In each group, the type of accident, the anatomical location of the injury, and the treatment were reported and compared. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients were included in the case group in comparison to 784 patients in the control group. We observed a two-third decrease in the rate of upper limb emergencies (- 64.9%) in particular a drastic drop in the rate of road, work, and leisure accidents (10.4% vs 14.3%, p = 0.1151; 10.0% vs 22.6%, p < 0.0001; 13.1% vs 30.8%, p < 0.0001, respectively), and a clear increase in domestic accidents (66.5% vs 32.3%, p < 0.0001). The aetiologies were more dominated by lacerations of soft tissues (48.4%, vs 38.3%, p = 0.0034) and infections (8.7% vs 5.1%, p = 0.0299) with an increase in the indications for surgical management (51.2% vs 36.9%, p < 0.0001). Conversely, we observed fewer consultations for joint injuries (20.7% vs 30.7%, p = 0.0015) and fractures (22.2% vs 25.9%, p = 0.2210).

The use of web-based online-therapy has been shown to be useful to overcome caregiver's distress syndrome and further stimulate cognitive-motor recovery of SABI-patients. Our study aimed to investigate whether a systematic online Skype-therapy(OLST) may be of support in favoring global cognitive and sensory-motor recovery in SABI-patients and reducing caregiver distress. METHODS Twenty-five SABI-subjects in inpatient regimen were provided with intensive OLST with the caregiver for 12 weeks in addition to standard neurorehabilitation. Each subject and caregiver was evaluated before and after the treatment by administering an ad hoc battery. Furthermore, 18 of 27 patients were provided with EEG recording in resting state. RESULTS We found a significant reduction in caregiver's anxiety (p<0.0001) and burden(p<0.0001). Patients showed significant improvement in trunk control (p<0.0001), functional independence (p = 0.005), functional (p = 0.01) and global communication (p = 0.004), cognitive functioning (p = 0.001), and behavioral responsiveness (p = 0.0004). The training yielded a significant connectivity change within the fronto-centro-parietal areas in the delta frequency band (p<0.0001) and the centro-parieto-occipital areas in the alpha range (p = 0.004). DISCUSSION OLST may be a useful and complementary treatment to optimize global cognitive and functional recovery in SABI-subjects and reduce caregivers' concerns in the Covid-era. OLST can foster cognitive-motor recovery potentially by favoring the plasticity-dependent functional recovery. Therefore, OLST could be proposed as a tool allowing social conversations also in the hospital setting.","output":"'Online therapy' to reduce caregiver's distress and to stimulate post-severe acquired brain injury motor and cognitive recovery: A Sicilian hospital experience in the COVID era."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We live in the age of globalization.

As a first step in pursuing this need, our commentary summarizes thirteen international and regional guidance documents by three broad categories on evaluating safety, efficacy, and product quality for market-based approval and distribution of these treatments. We highlight the paucity of updated international recommendations on these subjects and identify gaps that could inform the current evidence base. All available guidance note the need for evidence surrounding the efficacy of these treatments and practices but are also quick to caution against methodological difficulties in the conduct of such evaluations.

We aimed to understand whether perceptions of support and communication by local leadership were associated with reduced reports of stress and burnout among frontline HCWs. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional surveys embedded within emergency department (ED) workflow during the first wave of COVID-19 from April 9, 2020 to June 15th, 2020 within three EDs of a multisite health system in the Northeast United States. All ED HCWs were administered electronic surveys during shift via text message. We simultaneously conducted 64 qualitative interviews to better characterize and validate survey responses. Primary survey outcomes were levels of work stress and burnout. RESULTS: Over 10 week study, 327 of 431 (76%) frontline HCWs responded to at least one round of the survey. More useful communication mediated through higher perception of support was significantly associated with lower work stress (B = ?0.33, p < 0.001) and burnout (B = ?7.84, p < 0.001). A one-point increase on the communication Likert scale was associated with a 9% reduction in stress and a 19% reduction in burnout. Three themes related to effective crisis communication during COVID-19 emerged in interviews: (1) information consolidation prior to dissemination, (2) consistency of communication, and (3) bi-directional communication. CONCLUSION: This work suggests that effective local leadership communication, characterized by information consolidation, consistency, and bi-directionality, leads to higher perceptions of support and lower stress and burnout among ED frontline workers. As the pandemic continues, these results present an evidence-based framework for leaders to support frontline HCWs through effective crisis communication.","output":"Leadership communication, stress, and burnout among frontline emergency department staff amid the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed methods approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent decades have witnessed a steady increase in efforts from a range of actors to facilitate and support meaningful and effective engagement with coastal communities and stakeholders Indeed, this move towards improved participatory approaches are increasingly framed as being integral to successful and sustainable management of coastal resources and spaces, including in the context of climate adaptation The effectiveness of the processes, structures and frameworks underpinning coastal community engagement has always been subject to external and internal drivers;however, the global threat posed by COVID-19 presented, and continues to present, an unexpected shift in approach, and the need for rapid adaptation by those of us working within these spheres Using the Coastal Communities Adapting Together (CCAT) project as a case study, we explore how engagement with coastal communities and stakeholders in the project areas of Fingal, Ireland, and Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been impacted and forced to adapt as a result of COVID-19 Through a qualitative data collection process, we explore how project teams across different scales have rapidly adapted their models of community and stakeholder engagement, identify successes and failures, and explore challenges that have been faced Finally, we consider if the legacy of COVID-19 has provided an opportunity for coastal community engagement approaches being used across the globe to become more diverse, adapting to new technologies and increasing accessibility and effectiveness Insights identified as fundamental to successful adaptation and enhancing resilience include: a rapid response to change, adoption of a diversity of techniques, broadened participation and supported social learning and knowledge exchange","output":"Going digital - Lessons for future coastal community engagement and climate change adaptation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The era of the explosion of immersive technologies has bumped head-on with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndromeCcoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey with self and proxy-report items (where the participant was a parent). METHODS: Adults (n = 1360) and adolescents (n = 1292) reported the frequency they performed 30- or 60-min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), muscle-strengthening exercises, and participation in 11 active recreation behaviours in February 2020 (pre-COVID-19) and in April/May (during lockdown restrictions). Parents also proxy-reported activity for their child (n = 147, 5C12 years). Mixed effects logistic regressions or a logistic regression (with robust sandwich estimation for variance) assessed recall differences pre- and during lockdown, and interaction by sex. RESULTS: Compared to February, in April/May children were less likely to meet MVPA recommendations (OR = 0.27, 95%CI = 0.12C0.64); adolescents males, but not females, were less likely to meet MVPA (OR = 0.71, 95%CI 0.43, 1.17) and both recommendations (OR = 0.12, 95%CI = 0.02, 0.79); and adults were more likely to meet MVPA (OR = 1.26, 95%CI = 1.01, 1.57) but less likely to meet muscle-strengthening exercise recommendations (OR = 0.76, 9%CI = 0.65, 0.89).

Of specific concern is the emerging resistance against azithromycin, the only remaining oral drug to treat extensively drug resistant (XDR) typhoid. Since the first report of azithromycin resistance from Bangladesh in 2019, cases have been reported from Nepal, India, and Pakistan. The genetic basis of this resistance is a single point mutation in the efflux pump AcrB (R717Q/L). Here, we report 38 additional cases of azithromycin-resistant (AzmR) Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A isolated in Bangladesh between 2016 and 2018. Using genomic analysis of 56 AzmR isolates from South Asia with AcrB-R717Q/L, we confirm that this mutation has spontaneously emerged in different Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A genotypes. The largest cluster of AzmR Typhi belonged to genotype 4.3.1.1; Bayesian analysis predicts the mutation to have emerged sometime in 2010. A travel-related Typhi isolate with AcrB-R717Q belonging to 4.3.1.1 was isolated in the United Kingdom, increasing fears of global spread. For real-time detection of AcrB-R717Q/L, we developed an extraction-free, rapid, and low-cost mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA). Validation of MAMA using 113 AzmR and non-AzmR isolates yielded >98% specificity and sensitivity versus phenotypic and whole-genome sequencing assays currently used for azithromycin resistance detection. With increasing azithromycin use, AcrB-R717Q/L is likely to be acquired by XDR strains.

Early into the pandemic, reports of CoV-2 diagnoses in pets and other animals emerged, including dogs, cats, farmed mink and some large felids (tigers and lions) from various countries. While most CoV-2 positive animals were confirmed to have been in close contact with CoV-2 positive humans, there has been a paucity of published evidence to-date describing risk factors associated with CoV-2 transmission among humans and domestic and wild animals. The COVID-19 Human-Animal Interactions Survey (CHAIS) was developed through a cross-CEIRS Center collaboration to provide a standardized survey describing human-animal interaction during the pandemic and to evaluate behavioral, spatiotemporal, and biological risk factors associated with bi-directional zoonotic transmission of CoV-2 within households and other shared environments. CHAIS measures four broad domains of transmission risk; 1) intensity and risk of infection among human hosts, 2) spatial characteristics of shared environments, 3) behaviors and human-animal interactions, and 4) animal susceptibility to infection and propensity for onward spread. Following the development of CHAIS, with a One Health approach, a multidisciplinary group of experts (n=20) was invited to review and provide feedback on the survey for content validity. Expert feedback was incorporated into two final survey formats-a long-form and an abridged version for which specific core questions addressing zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission were identified. Both forms are modularized, with each section having the capacity to serve as independent instruments, allowing researchers to customize the survey based on context and research-specific needs. Further adaptations for studies seeking to investigate other zoonotic pathogens with similar routes of transmission (i.e. respiratory, direct contact) are also possible. The CHAIS instrument is a standardized human-animal interaction survey developed to provide important data on risk factors that guide transmission of CoV-2 from humans to animals, with great utility in capturing information of zoonotic transmission risk factors for CoV-2 and other similar pathogens.

Methods Two hundred sixty-seven patients with PCOS were divided into two groups Group 1 with 25(OH)D3 deficiency, and Group 2 with normal 25(OH)D3. Biochemical and hormonal parameters (androgen hormones, gonadotropins, and thyroid function tests) were compared between the two groups. Results Eighty-six percent of the patients (n=231) were in Group 1 and 14% (n=36) in Group 2. Statistically significantly higher concentrations of serum testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate and LH were determined in Group 1 (p<0.05). 25(OH)D3 concentrations were negatively correlated with body mass index (r=-0.459), serum testosterone (r =-0.374) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate levels (r=-0.418); (all; p< 0.05). Conclusion The study findings show that low 25(OH)D3 levels are associated with high androgen levels in women with PCOS.

It has a remarkably high resistance profile with few effective antifungal agents, mostly limited to voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by 1 of these 2 antifungal agents further complicates the management of these infections. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman with short bowel syndrome presented to the hospital with concerns of abdominal pain and loose stools. An abdominal CT was negative for inflammatory or ischemic bowel disease, and there was no evidence of liver disease. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and required transfer to the ICU due to hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. On day 43 of her admission, the patient developed a low-grade fever, for which she underwent central-line and peripheral-blood cultures that were positive for Fusarium dimerum. The central line was removed and i.v. voriconazole was started. After 3 days of treatment, the patients liver enzymes rose abruptly. Voriconazole was discontinued and replaced with liposomal amphotericin B, and the liver enzymes improved significantly. The patient completed 14 days of therapy and was discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This is a case of F. dimerum infection followed by DILI from voriconazole treatment. Her infection was resolved after switching to liposomal amphotericin B, with improvement in liver enzymes on day 1 after discontinuing voriconazole.

This article presents a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to ascertain if methylprednisolone can be recommended for use in patients with COVID-19 to prevent deaths. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and preprint servers until 13 April 2021. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The random-effects model for the meta-analysis was utilized to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Five RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for all-cause mortality was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.29 - 1.43, n = 652) comparing methylprednisolone with the control, indicating no mortality benefits. A similar finding was noted with a sub-group analysis including four trials that used low-dose methylprednisolone. However, the only trial that administered high dose methylprednisolone indicated a statistically significant mortality benefit (OR 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02-0.42). CONCLUSIONS: In determining equipotent doses for an acute short-course pulse therapy of corticosteroids, the biological half-life of steroids should also be accounted for besides the potency factor.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who had undergone elective thoracic surgery from 12 February 2020 to 30 April 2020 and were symptomatic or tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection within 14 days after surgery, with a focus on their complications and potential deaths. RESULTS: Out of 101 surgical procedures, including 57 primary oncological resections, 6 lung transplants and 18 emergency procedures, only 5 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 were identified, 3 in the immediate postoperative period and 2 as outpatients. All 5 patients had cancer; the median age was 64 years. The main virus-related symptom was fever (80%), and the median onset of coronavirus disease 2019 was 3 days. Although 80% of the patients who had positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 required in-hospital care, none of them were considered severe or critical and none died.

Using the geotracking data of 15 million smartphones per day, we found that US counties that voted for Donald Trump (Republican) over Hillary Clinton (Democrat) in the 2016 presidential election exhibited 14% less physical distancing between March and May 2020. Partisanship was more strongly associated with physical distancing than numerous other factors, including counties' COVID-19 cases, population density, median income, and racial and age demographics. Contrary to our predictions, the observed partisan gap strengthened over time and remained when stay-at-home orders were active. Additionally, county-level consumption of conservative media (Fox News) was related to reduced physical distancing. Finally, the observed partisan differences in distancing were associated with subsequently higher COVID-19 infection and fatality growth rates in pro-Trump counties.

This is particularly true for multiple myeloma (MM), a common and largely incurable neoplasm of post-germinal center, immunoglobulin-producing B lymphocytes, called plasma cells, that reside in the hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) and cause osteolytic lesions and kidney failure among other forms of end-organ damage. The most widely used mouse models used to aid drug and immunotherapy development rely on in vivo propagation of human myeloma cells in immunodeficient hosts (xenografting) or myeloma-like mouse plasma cells in immunocompetent hosts (autografting). Both strategies have made and continue to make valuable contributions to preclinical myeloma, including immune research, yet are ill-suited for studies on tumor development (oncogenesis). Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), such as the widely known V*MYC, may overcome this shortcoming because plasma cell tumors (PCTs) develop de novo (spontaneously) in a highly predictable fashion and accurately recapitulate many hallmarks of human myeloma. Moreover, PCTs arise in an intact organism able to mount a complete innate and adaptive immune response and tumor development reproduces the natural course of human myelomagenesis, beginning with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), progressing to smoldering myeloma (SMM), and eventually transitioning to frank neoplasia. Here we review the utility of transplantation-based and transgenic mouse models of human MM for research on immunopathology and -therapy of plasma cell malignancies, discuss strengths and weaknesses of different experimental approaches, and outline opportunities for closing knowledge gaps, improving the outcome of patients with myeloma, and working towards a cure.","output":"Laboratory Mice C A Driving Force in Immunopathology and Immunotherapy Studies of Human Multiple Myeloma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of a 9-day, smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol for tracking the frequency of Canadian adolescents exposures to cannabis marketing, their reactions to such exposures, and the context in which exposures occur in the real-world and in real-time. METHOD: Participants were n = 18 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 years of age. They used an EMA application to capture and describe cannabis marketing exposures through photographs and brief questionnaires assessing marketing channel and context. Participants also rated their reactions to each exposure in real-time. RESULTS: Results showed that participants were generally compliant with the protocol. Participants recorded 40 total exposures to cannabis marketing, representing an average of 2.2 (SD 2.3) exposures per participant during the 9-day study.

Galvanostatic anodic oxidations were performed in a filter-press flow cell fitted with a boron-doped diamond anode. Removal rates higher than the theoretical one for a process purely controlled by mass transfer were found for all SEs, indicative of contribution by indirect oxidation processes. However, the removal rates for NaCl were about tenfold higher, with the lowest energy consumption per order (EC O) of targeted pollutant removal rate (ca. 0.7 kW h mC3 orderC1), a very competitive performance. The TOC removal rates were also affected by the SE, but not as markedly. The antimicrobial activity of the electrolyzed solutions against Escherichia coli showed distinct temporal profiles, depending on the fluoroquinolone and SE. For instance, when Na3PO4 was used, the antimicrobial activity was completely removed for NOR, but none for CIPRO; conversely, when NaCl was used, complete removal was attained only for CIPRO. From LC-MS/MS analyses of Na3PO4 electrolyzed solutions, rupture of the fluoroquinolone ring leading to byproducts with no toxicity against E. coli occurred only for NOR, whereas exactly the opposite occurred for the NaCl solutions. Clearly, the nature of both the SE and the fluoroquinolone influence the oxidation steps of the respective molecule; this was also evidenced by the distinct short-chain carboxylic acids identified in the degradation of NOR and CIPRO.","output":"Comparing the electrochemical degradation of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin using distinct electrolytes and a BDD anode: evolution of main oxidation byproducts and toxicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientists have been warning us about pandemics for years How can we heed such calls in future, asks Debora MacKenzie","output":"Pandemic warnings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To replace educational opportunities lost during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Neurosurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital produced an open-access webinar series (\\"BRAINterns\\") that covered a broad range of healthcare topics with a focus on neurosurgery. METHODS This eight-week webinar series ran from July 1st to August 28th, 2020. An optional exit survey was distributed to participants. Data were analyzed to characterize and better understand trends among a global cohort of participants. RESULTS A total of 16,484 people registered for BRAINterns and 6,675 took the survey (40.5% response rate). Responders represented 87 countries, of which the majority were from the United States of America and Canada (90.48%, n = 6,039). Responders were primarily female (82.9%, n = 5,521). Racial and ethnic representation was majority Asian (42%, n = 2,798), followed by White (22.7%, n = 1514), Hispanic/Latino (16.2%, n = 1,080), and Black and African Americans (7.7%, n = 516). Participants reported hearing about BRAINterns through various social media platforms, (72.18%, n = 4,818)-the most popular was TikTok (33.4%, n = 2,232). Overall, 93.4% of participants reported that the course was a good use of their time during the pandemic and 86.7% reported that the course helped replace lost opportunities.

BanLec binds high mannose glycans expressed on the viral envelopes of HIV, Ebola, influenza, and coronaviruses. BanLec mitogenicity can be divorced from antiviral activity via a single amino acid change (H84T). The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is decorated with high mannose N-glycosites that are in close proximity to the viral receptor binding domain (RBD). Our goal was to use the H84T-BanLec as the extracellular targeting domain of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). We hypothesized that engineering NK cells to express an H84T-BanLec CAR would specifically direct antiviral cytotoxicity against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: H84T-BanLec was synthesized and added to a 4-1BB. CAR by subcloning into an existing retroviral vector. To modify primary human NK cells, CD3-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells were first activated with lethally irradiated feeder cells (K562.mbIL15.4-1BBL), then transduced with transiently produced replication incompetent -retrovirus carrying the H84T-BanLec.4-1BB. CAR construct. Vector Copy Number (VCN) per cell was measured and CAR protein expression detected with Western blotting. 293T cells were engineered to express human ACE2 (hACE2.293T), the binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2. CAR expression on NK cells and SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding to hACE2.293T were measured using FACS. S-protein pseudotyped lentivirus carrying a firefly Luciferase (ffLuc) reporter was produced. Viral infectivity was measured using bioluminescence (BL) detection in virally transduced cells. H84T-BanLec CAR NK cells were added to our S-protein pseudotyped lentiviral infectivity assay and degree of inhibited transduction was measured. NK cell activation was assessed with detection of IFN and TNF secretion using ELISA. Results: A median of 4.5 integrated H84T-BanLec CAR copies per cell was measured (range 3.5-7.45, n=4). The CAR was detected by Western blot in NK cell lysates using antibodies to TCR and H84T-BanLec. Surface expression of the CAR on primary NK cells was recorded on day 4 after transduction (median [range], 67.5% CAR-positive [64.7-75%], n=6; Fig. 1). CAR expression was maintained on NK cells in culture for 14 days (58.9% CAR-positive [43.6-66.7%], n=6; Fig. 1). ACE2 expression and binding of recombinant S-proteins to hACE2 on hACE2.293T but not parental 293Ts was verified. S-protein pseudotyped lentiviral transduction of hACE2.293T was confirmed with increase in BL from baseline across diminishing viral titer (n=3; Fig. 2). Control 293T cells without hACE2 expression were not transduced, confirming specificity of viral binding and entry dependent on hACE2 (n=3; Fig. 2). S-protein pseudoviral infectivity of hACE2.293T cells was inhibited by both H84T-BanLec CAR-NK and unmodified NK cells, with enhanced inhibition observed in the CAR-NK condition (mean % pseudovirus infectivity +/- SEM of hACE2.293T in co-cultures with unmodified NK vs. H84T-BanLec CAR-NK; 65 +/-11% vs 35%+/- 6% for 1:1 effector-to-target ratio, p=0.05; 78 +/-3% vs 68%+/- 3% for 1:2.5 effector-to-target ratio, p=0.03; n=6; Fig.3). Both unmodified and H84T-BanLec CAR-NK cells were stimulated to secrete inflammatory mediators when co-cultured with pseudoviral particles and virally infected cells. CAR-NK cells showed overall higher cytokine secretion both at baseline and with viral stimulation. Conclusions: A glycoprotein binding H84T-BanLec CAR was stably expressed on the surface of NK cells. CAR-NK cells are activated by SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudovirus and virally infected cells. Viral entry into hACE2 expressing cells was inhibited by H84T-BanLec CAR-NK cells. Translation of H84T-BanLec CAR-NK cells to the clinic may have promise as an effective cellular therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This study is part of a worldwide survey of radiologists' responses to COVID-19 in 18 different countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The purpose of this study is to analyze the changes made in international radiology departments and practices in response to the pandemic. METHODS: The 18-item survey was sent via email from April to May 2020 to radiologists in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America to assess their response to COVID-19. Our survey included questions regarding imaging, workforce adjustments, testing availability, staff and patient safety, research and education, and infrastructure availability. RESULTS: 28 survey responses were reviewed. Of the 28 respondents, 42.9% have shortages of infrastructure and 78.6% responded that COVID-19 testing was available. Regarding the use of Chest CT in COVID-19 patients, 28.6% respondents used Chest CT as screening for COVID-19. For staff safety, interventions included encouraging use of masks in patient encounters, social distancing and PPE training. To cope with their education and research mission, radiology departments are doing online lectures, reducing the number of residents in rotations, and postponing any non-urgent activities. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there are disparities in infrastructure, research, and educational initiatives during COVID-19 which also provides opportunity for the global radiology community to work together on these issues.","output":"COVID-19 RADIOLOGY PREPAREDNESS, CHALLENGES & OPPORTUNITIES: RESPONSES FROM 18 COUNTRIES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) forced the worldwide higher educational institutes to adopt distance learning mode. Further, remote electronic exams (E?exams) were considered as mode of assessment. Objectives: This cross-sectional study evaluated the students' experience of remote E-exams during the COVID-19 pandemic among medical sciences students in (our country). Materials and Methods: A survey of 29 questions was prepared on Google forms and distributed among students at Faculties of Medical sciences (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing and Applied Medical Sciences) at (Educational Institute). The questions include students' demographics, stress experience, and factors contributing to stress as well as behavioral changes related to remote E-exams. Responses were analyzed using descriptive, cross tabulation and Chi-square tests. Results: Among 1019 respondents, 32% reported more stress with remote E-exams. This was associated with academic major and gender. Among students with more stress during remote E-exams, the exam duration, mode of questions navigation and technical problems (exam platform and internet connectivity) appeared as the main factors related to stress in 78%, 76% and >60%, respectively. Other factors include concern regarding the teaching methods, exam environment and students' dishonesty. Remote E-exams had negative impact on students' dietary habits (increase consumption of caffeine and high energy drinks, high sugar food, fast food), sleep (reduction in sleeping hours, more consumption of insomnia medications), physical activity (less exercises) and smoking habits (increase). Conclusion: Results suggested a negative impact of E-exams on students within Medical Faculties. Robust exam platform and remote mock E-exams are recommended to reduce students' potential stress. A stress-free environment is very essential to encourage students to adopt remote E-exams, particularly if the pandemic will take longer. Various awareness programs about students' habits related to dietary, sleep quality, physical activity and smoking are highly valuable for students health benefits. This is of particular importance since the current students at faculties of Medical Sciences are the future health care providers.","output":"Stress and behavioral changes with remote E-exams during the Covid-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study among undergraduates of medical sciences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There is paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of facemask use in COVID-19 in community settings. Objectives We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of facemask use alone or along with hand hygiene in community settings in reducing the transmission of viral respiratory illness. Methods We searched PubMed and Embase for randomized controlled trials on facemask use in community settings to prevent viral respiratory illnesses published up to April 25, 2020. Two independent reviewers were involved in synthesis of data. Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were done in a standard format from the selected studies. Outcome data for clinically diagnosed or self-reported influenza-like illness (ILI) was recorded from individual studies. Pooled effect size was estimated by random-effects model for \\"facemask only versus control\\" and \\"facemask plus hand hygiene versus control.\\" Results Of the 465 studies from PubMed and 437 studies from Embase identified from our search, 9 studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 8 studies in quantitative synthesis. Risk of bias was assessed as low (n = 4), medium (n = 3), or high (n = 1) risk. Interventions included using a triple-layered mask alone or in combination with hand hygiene. Publication bias was not significant. There was no significant reduction in ILI either with facemask alone (n = 5, pooled effect size: -0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.43-0.10; P = 0.23; I2 = 10.9%) or facemask with handwash (n = 6, pooled effect size: (n=6, pooled effect size: -0.09; 95% CI: -0.58 to 0.40; P = 0.71, I2 = 69.4%).

Based on smart energy meter data from 10,246 households in Singapore, we find strong correlations between the pandemic progression in the city-state and the residential electricity consumption. In particular, we find that the daily new COVID-19 cases constitute the most dominant influencing factor on the electricity demand in the early stages of the pandemic, before a lockdown. However, this influence wanes once the lockdown is implemented, signifying the arrival of a new normal in the residents lifestyles. These observations point to a proactive response from Singaporean residents---who increasingly stayed at home during evenings despite not being forced by the government to do so using a lockdown---a finding that surprisingly extends across all demographics.

It has been associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes, mortality and progression to overt thyroid hormone deficiency. Current guidelines on the management of subclinical hypothyroidism differ because of conflicting evidence on long-term treatment benefits. Even though there are several existing systematic reviews on its clinical outcomes, no definitive conclusion has been reached yet. As such, a new synthesis could help provide more insight and consensus on this topic. To this purpose, this umbrella review will evaluate and synthesise current evidence on the long-term clinical outcomes of the different management strategies for subclinical hypothyroidism. METHODS: This is a protocol for an umbrella review on the management strategies for subclinical hypothyroidism. We will conduct literature searches in multiple electronic databases (from inception onwards), namely MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, JBI Evidence Synthesis, Epistemonikos database, PDQ Evidence and the PROSPERO register. There will be no restriction on the date or language of publication. Additional material will be identified through grey literature searches and citation chaining. Review inclusion criteria will be patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, receiving treatment or monitoring, no restrictions on the comparators used and with cardiovascular events, frailty fractures, quality of life and all-cause mortality as primary outcomes of interest. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles and abstract data on a pre-piloted form in duplicate. Methodological quality (or bias) of included studies will be appraised using AMSTAR-2. Any conflicts that arise will be resolved through discussion or involving a third reviewer. A narrative synthesis will be provided with information presented in the main text and tables to summarise and explain the characteristics and findings of the included reviews. Even so, it is not expected that a meta-analysis will be performed due to review variability. Study limitations and methodological quality assessments will also be reported to provide context for the overall summary of evidence. DISCUSSION: This review will provide a comprehensive summary of the effects of the pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of subclinical hypothyroidism on specific long-term clinical outcomes. It is anticipated that the findings of this umbrella review will aid in the development of consensus-based clinical recommendations for subclinical hypothyroidism, as well as highlight areas for future research. Review findings will be disseminated primarily through peer-reviewed publications.

DESIGN: Time series study of high income countries. SETTING: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, England and Wales, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United States. PARTICIPANTS: Mortality data from the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations data series of the Human Mortality Database for 2016-20, harmonised and disaggregated by age and sex. INTERVENTIONS: Covid-19 pandemic and associated policy measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weekly excess deaths (observed deaths versus expected deaths predicted by model) in 2020, by sex and age (0-14, 15-64, 65-74, 75-84, and &#8805;85 years), estimated using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model that accounts for temporal trends and seasonal variability in mortality. RESULTS: An estimated 979 000 (95% confidence interval 954 000 to 1 001 000) excess deaths occurred in 2020 in the 29 high income countries analysed. All countries had excess deaths in 2020, except New Zealand, Norway, and Denmark. The five countries with the highest absolute number of excess deaths were the US (458 000, 454 000 to 461 000), Italy (89 100, 87 500 to 90 700), England and Wales (85 400, 83 900 to 86 800), Spain (84 100, 82 800 to 85 300), and Poland (60 100, 58 800 to 61 300). New Zealand had lower overall mortality than expected (-2500, -2900 to -2100). In many countries, the estimated number of excess deaths substantially exceeded the number of reported deaths from covid-19. The highest excess death rates (per 100 000) in men were in Lithuania (285, 259 to 311), Poland (191, 184 to 197), Spain (179, 174 to 184), Hungary (174, 161 to 188), and Italy (168, 163 to 173); the highest rates in women were in Lithuania (210, 185 to 234), Spain (180, 175 to 185), Hungary (169, 156 to 182), Slovenia (158, 132 to 184), and Belgium (151, 141 to 162). Little evidence was found of subsequent compensatory reductions following excess mortality. CONCLUSION: Approximately one million excess deaths occurred in 2020 in these 29 high income countries. Age standardised excess death rates were higher in men than women in almost all countries. Excess deaths substantially exceeded reported deaths from covid-19 in many countries, indicating that determining the full impact of the pandemic on mortality requires assessment of excess deaths. Many countries had lower deaths than expected in children <15 years. Sex inequality in mortality widened further in most countries in 2020.","output":"Excess deaths associated with covid-19 pandemic in 2020: age and sex disaggregated time series analysis in 29 high income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) period have dictated a different approach to cardiac interventions at our medical institution.

Here we report an unexpected correlation between the expression of a functional X domain encoded by the hepatotropic mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), the high-level production of inflammatory cytokines, and the induction of acute viral hepatitis in mice. X-domain (also called macro domain) proteins possess poly-ADP-ribose binding and/or ADP-ribose-1''-phosphatase (ADRP) activity. They are conserved in coronaviruses and in members of the \\"alpha-like supergroup\\" of phylogenetically related positive-strand RNA viruses that includes viruses of medical importance, such as rubella virus and hepatitis E virus. By using reverse genetics, we constructed a recombinant murine coronavirus MHV-A59 mutant encoding a single-amino-acid substitution of a strictly conserved residue that is essential for coronaviral ADRP activity. We found that the mutant virus replicated to slightly reduced titers in livers but, strikingly, did not induce liver disease. In vitro, the mutant virus induced only low levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In vivo, we found that IL-6 production, in particular, was reduced in the spleens and livers of mutant virus-infected mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the MHV X domain exacerbates MHV-induced liver pathology, most likely through the induction of excessive inflammatory cytokine expression.","output":"Mouse hepatitis virus liver pathology is dependent on ADP-ribose-1''-phosphatase, a viral function conserved in the alpha-like supergroup."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 26-year-old male presented to the emergency department feeling unwell in February of 2021 with symptoms including diaphoresis, loose stools, and loss of taste sensation.

Multivariate analyses for disease progression were conducted in the total and propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts. Results A total of 778 mild COVID-19 patients were included and classified as the regdanvimab (n = 234) and supportive care (n = 544) groups. Significantly fewer patients required O2 supplementation via nasal prong in the regdanvimab group (8.1%) than in the supportive care group (18.4%, P < 0.001). The decreased risk for O2 support by regdanvimab treatment was noticed in the multivariate analysis of the total cohort (HR 0.570, 95% CI 0.343C0.946, P = 0.030), but it was not statistically significant in the PS-matched cohort (P = 0.057). Progression to severe disease was also significantly lower in the regdanvimab group (2.1%) than in the supportive care group (9.6%, P < 0.001).

The LPP is distinct from other liposomal gene delivery systems in that it utilizes a modular protein component to drive transfection activity as opposed to relying on the passive effects of the cationic lipids. A CSP library has been rationally designed to improve the efficacy of the LPP compared to the parent protein via improved alpha-helical structure and increased nucleic acid binding through the use of extended histidine tags and increased positive charge. The secondary structure and nucleic acid binding ability of each library member was assessed, then compared to functional transfection data in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts.

In all patient subgroups investigated, the NC combinations (ie, N: 20, 30, or 60 mg; C: 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg daily) provided greater SBP and DBP lowering and higher rates of BP control (defined as BP <140/90 mm Hg) than respective monotherapies or placebo, with greatest absolute BP reductions observed in the moderately elevated SBP or DBP subgroups. A trend to dose-response relationship was observed in each subgroup. In each SBP and DBP subgroup, treatment-related vasodilatory events (flushing, headache, or edema) were less frequent for patients receiving NC combination therapy than N monotherapy. These analyses support the use of calcium antagonist and angiotensin receptor blocker combination therapy in patients with both mild and moderate hypertension, for whom effective BP normalization and good drug tolerance would greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.","output":"Nifedipine GITS/Candesartan Combination Therapy Lowers Blood Pressure Across Different Baseline Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure Categories: DISTINCT Study Subanalyses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Aim of this study was to report the authors' experience with the anterior transperitoneal approach, and with an anterior submesocolic approach in case of left sided lesions.

Studies have shown that the data quality, and by extension data integrity, has been suboptimal and thus poses a barrier to strengthening service delivery. This article showcases how the design process sparked the concept for an intervention to improve the integrity of public health data being collected in Nigeria. In collaboration with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) and Lifebank, the Co-creation Hub team conducted formative research with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) test center managers at NIMR. The insights informed the development of the features for an outbreak management system. These features were refined through an iterative process of development and continuous feedback from the end users. NIMR reported an improvement in its data collection process and data integrity. They reported that (1) almost all data collection by the test center was now automated, thereby minimizing the proportion of inaccurate and repeat entry in comparison to data collected in other parts of the same center; (2) the auto-validation feature of the system ensured that all required fields of a patients information were completed and verified, thereby ensuring 100% data completeness; and (3) the validation and verification feature ensured that patients contact information was validated.

AIM: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies in Thai patients with differing severities of COVID-19. METHODS: Plasma from the following patient groups was examined: 118 adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, 49 patients under investigation (without confirmed infections), 20 patients with other respiratory infections, and 102 healthy control patients. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from EUROIMMUN was performed to assess for IgA and IgG antibodies. The optical density (OD) ratio cutoff for a positive result was 1.1 for IgA and 0.8 for IgG. Additionally, the association of the antibody response with both the severity of disease and the date after onset of symptoms was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 289 participants were enrolled and 384 samples analyzed from March 10 to May 31, 2020. Patients were categorized, based on their clinical manifestations, as mild (n = 59), moderate (n = 27), or severe (n = 32). The overall sensitivity of IgA and IgG from the samples collected after day 7 of the symptoms was 87.9% (95% CI: 79.8-93.6) and 84.8% (95% CI: 76.2-91.3), respectively. Compared to the mild group, the severe group had significantly higher levels of spike 1 (S1) antigen-specific IgA and IgG. All patients in the moderate and severe groups had S1-specific IgG, while 20% of the patients in the mild group did not have any IgG detected after two weeks after the onset of symptoms. Interestingly, in the severe group, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was significantly higher in males than females (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The serological test for SARS-CoV-2 has a high sensitivity more than two weeks after the onset of illness. Additionally, the serological response differs among patients based on sex as well as the severity of infection.","output":"Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with differing severities of coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, droplet-based microfluidic systems have been widely used in various biochemical and molecular biological assays.

Effective renal replacement therapy (RRT) could give us an advantage removing cytokines in patients with RRT requirements superimposed on COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study in COVID-19 patients who required hemodialysis (HD). Patients were assigned to online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) and expanded HD (HDx) according to Brescia group recommendations. We measured several cytokines, 2 microglobulin and albumin levels pre/post-dialysis and on 1stC2nd week. We compared levels among both techniques and control group (HD without COVID-19). RESULTS: We included 26 patients: 18 with COVID-19 on RRT (5 of them had acute kidney injury [AKI]) and 8 controls. We confirm higher cytokine levels in COVID-19 patients than controls and even higher in patients with AKI than in those with chronic kidney disease. Most cytokines raised during HD session, except IL-10 and TNF. IL-10 was eliminated by any dialysis technique, while clearance of TNF was higher in the HDx group. HDx achieved a deeper normalization of cytokines and 2 microglobulin reduction. Mortality was higher in the OL-HDF group than the HDx group. DISCUSSION: Not all cytokines behave equally along HD session. The following characteristics should be taken into account, such as intrinsic kinetic profile during a HD session. HDx seems to get better performance, probably due to the combination of different factors; however, we did not reach statistical significance due to the small sample size, dropout, and reduction of AKI incidence during the 2nd pandemic wave. CONCLUSION: HDx appears to provide better clearance for TNF and 2 microglobulin during HD session and associates lower mortality. We propose the HDx technique for COVID-19 patients with RRT requirements since it seems to be safe and more effective than OL-HDF. Further studies are still needed, but we hope that our preliminary data may help us in future pandemic waves of SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses still to come.","output":"Effect of Expanded Hemodialysis with Theranova? in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Construction of knowledge repositories from web corpora by harvesting linguistic patterns is of benefit for many natural language-processing applications that rely on question-answering schemes These methods require minimal or no human intervention and can recursively learn new relational facts-instances in a fully automated and scalable manner This paper explores the performance of tolerance rough set-based learner with respect to two important issues: scalability and its effect on concept drift, by (1) designing a new version of the semi-supervised tolerance rough set-based pattern learner (TPL 2 0), (2) adapting a tolerance form of rough set methodology to categorize linguistic patterns, and (3) extracting categorical information from a large noisy dataset of crawled web pages This work demonstrates that the TPL 2 0 learner is promising in terms of precision@30 metric when compared with three benchmark algorithms: Tolerant Pattern Learner 1 0, Fuzzy-Rough Set Pattern Learner, and Coupled Bayesian Sets-based learner","output":"Harvesting Patterns from Textual Web Sources with Tolerance Rough Sets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Travel destinations, particularly large resorts in otherwise small communities, risk infectious disease outbreaks from an influx of visitors who may import infections during peak seasons. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this risk in the context of global travel and has raised questions about appropriate interventions to curb the potential spread of infectious disease at tourist destinations. In Colorado, the initial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in the state occurred in ski communities, leading to large economic losses from closures and visitor restrictions. In this study, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the 2020-21 season in a ski region of Colorado to determine optimal combinations of intervention strategies that would keep the region below a predetermined threshold of SARS-CoV-2 infection density. This analysis used an age-stratified, deterministic SEIR compartmental model of disease transmission, calibrated to cellphone-based mobility data, to simulate infection trajectories during the winter ski season. Under three national infection levels corresponding to high, medium, and low viral importation risk, we estimated the potential impact of interventions including policy and behavior changes, visitor restriction strategies, and case investigation/contact tracing, in order to quantify the relative and absolute impacts of these interventions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that, in the context of low viral importation risk, case investigation/contact tracing and policy and behavior changes may be sufficient to stay below predetermined infection thresholds without visitor restrictions. However, if viral importation risk is high, visitor restrictions and/or screening for infected visitors would be needed to avoid lockdown-like control scenarios and large outbreaks in tourist communities. These findings provide important guidance to tourist destinations for balancing policy impact in future infectious disease outbreaks.","output":"Modeling SARS-CoV-2 transmission at a winter destination resort region with high outside visitation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given a large number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, clinical detection has proved challenging.

ML in pediatrics is distinctly unique with clinical, technical, and ethical nuances limiting the direct translation of ML tools developed for adults to pediatric populations. To our knowledge, no work has yet focused on outlining the unique considerations that need to be taken into account when designing and implementing ML in pediatrics. RECENT FINDINGS: The nature of varying developmental stages and the prominence of family-centered care lead to vastly different data-generating processes in pediatrics. Data heterogeneity and a lack of high-quality pediatric databases further complicate ML research. In order to address some of these nuances, we provide a common pipeline for clinicians and computer scientists to use as a foundation for structuring ML projects, and a framework for the translation of a developed model into clinical practice in pediatrics. Throughout these pathways, we also highlight ethical and legal considerations that must be taken into account when working with pediatric populations and data. SUMMARY: Here, we describe a comprehensive outline of special considerations required of ML in pediatrics from project ideation to implementation. We hope this review can serve as a high-level guideline for ML scientists and clinicians alike to identify applications in the pediatric setting, generate effective ML solutions, and subsequently deliver them to patients, families, and providers.","output":"From Clinic to Computer and Back Again: Practical Considerations When Designing and Implementing Machine Learning Solutions for Pediatrics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previously, we showed that the presence of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) gD glycoprotein but not gB potently restricted HIV-1 particle infectivity. This restriction was characterized by incorporation of HSV-1 gD and the exclusion of the HIV-1 gp120/gp41 from budding virus particles. To determine the structural domains involved in gD restriction of HIV-1, a series of deletion mutants and chimeric proteins between gD and the non-restrictive gB were generated. Our results show that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) of gD or that replacement of the transmembrane domain (TMD) with the TMD from gB slightly reduced restriction activity. However, replacement of the gD CTD with that of gB resulted in lower cell surface expression, significantly less incorporation into HIV-1 particles, and inefficient restriction of the release of infectious HIV-1. Analysis of gB/gD chimeric proteins revealed that removal of the gB CTD or replacement with gD CTD resulted in enhanced surface expression and an increase in restriction activity. Finally, we show that expression of gD without other HSV-1 proteins resulted in gD fractionation into detergent resistant membranes (DRM) and that gD co-localized with the raft marker GM1, which may partially explain its incorporation into budding virus particles. Taken together, our results suggest that expression of gD at the cell surface is likely a major factor but that other intrinsic properties are also involved in the gD-mediated restriction of HIV-1 particle infectivity.IMPORTANCE Previously, we showed that unlike the HSV-1, the presence of the gD glycoprotein in virus producer cells but not gB potently restricted HIV-1 particle infectivity. To better understand the relationship between cell surface expression, virus incorporation and restriction of HIV-1, we analyzed a series of deletion mutants and chimeric proteins in which domains of gD and gB were swapped. Our results indicate that: a) gD/gB chimeras having the cytoplasmic domain (CTD) of gB significantly reduced cell surface expression, release from cells, incorporation into virus, and reduced HIV-1 restriction; b) removal of the gB CTD or replacement with the gD CTD resulted in better surface expression, incorporation into HIV-1, and enhanced restriction; and c) the transmembrane domain of gB can influence transport and ultimately effect incorporation of gB into HIV-1. Overall, these data support a role for gD surface expression as crucial to restriction of infectious HIV-1 release.","output":"Structural Domains of the Herpes Simplex Type 1 gD Protein that Restrict HIV-1 Particle Infectivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 crisis has given rise to existential questions around the university during and after Covid-19 How might we re-imagine the future of HE and the post-coronial university?

However, shortcomings including health disparities persist particularly with a rapidly aging population. This has resulted in a shift in the disease burden from communicable to noncommunicable diseases such as dementia, cancer, and diabetes. These medical conditions require long-term care, which causes an accelerating crisis for the health sector and society. The current health care system in Vietnam is unlikely to cope with these challenges. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to explore the opportunities, challenges, and necessary conditions for Vietnam in transforming toward a patient-centered care model to produce better health for people and reduce health care costs. METHODS: We examine the applicability of a personalized and integrated Bespoke Health Care System (BHS) for Vietnam using a strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat analysis and examining the successes or failures of digital health care innovations in Vietnam. We then make suggestions for successful adoption of the BHS model in Vietnam. RESULTS: The BHS model of patient-centered care empowers patients to become active participants in their own health care. Vietnams current policy, social, technological, and economic environment favors the transition of its health care system toward the BHS model. Nevertheless, the country is in an early stage of health care digitalization. The legal and regulatory system to protect patient privacy and information security is still lacking. The readiness to implement electronic medical records, a core element of the BHS, varies across health providers and clinical practices. The scarcity of empirical evidence and evaluation regarding the effectiveness and sustainability of digital health initiatives is an obstacle to the Vietnamese government in policymaking, development, and implementation of health care digitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a personalized and integrated health care system may help Vietnam to address health care needs, reduce pressure on the health care system and society, improve health care delivery, and promote health equity. However, in order to adopt the patient-centered care system and digitalized health care, a whole-system approach in transformation and operation with a co-design in the whole span of a digital health initiative developing process are necessary.","output":"Patient-Centered Care: Transforming the Health Care System in Vietnam With Support of Digital Health Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To estimate the transmissibility of the Ice Bucket Challenge among globally influential celebrities and to identify associated risk factors.

Such vaccines are practical and effective because (1) most fatal ETEC infections in farm animals occur in the early neonatal period when the antibody titres in colostrum and milk are highest; (2) more than 90% of the ETEC in farm animals belong to a small family of fimbrial antigen types: (3) fimbriae consist of good protein antigens on the bacterial surface where they are readily accessible to antibody; (4) fimbriae are required for a critical step (adhesion-colonization) early in the pathogenesis of the disease. ETEC infections continue to be a significant clinical problem in farm animals in spite of extensive use of fimbriae-based vaccines. Definitive data on the efficacy of the commercial vaccines in field use are not available. The prevailing perception among animal health professionals is that the vaccines are effective, that the problem occurs chiefly among non-vaccinated animals, and that in some herds vaccination moves peak prevalence of disease from the first to the second or third week after birth, when mortality is lower. It has been suggested that extensive use of vaccines will rapidly select for the emergence of novel or previously low prevalence fimbrial antigen types. There is no evidence that this has happened after a decade of routine vaccine use in the United States. However, there is no active direct surveillance for such emergence. In contrast to the rational development of vaccines to provide passive lacteal protection against ETEC in suckling neonates, comparatively little progress has been made in providing the knowledge required for development of vaccines to protect against postweaning ETEC infections in swine.","output":"Vaccines for preventing enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infections in farm animals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic drastically disrupted the functioning of U.S. public schools, potentially changing the relative appeal of alternatives such as homeschooling and private schools.

Satisfaction of telemedicine was measured using a 10-item scale, demonstrating that all participants were overall satisfied with their telemedicine experience(s), (mean = 1.67, standard deviation = 0.61). Broadly, the differences in perceptions between the groups included the reasons for using telemedicine, perceptions of quality of in-person care, continuity of care, and a technical issue. Conclusions: Overall, patients are satisfied using telemedicine, however, for new users, both providers and patients, some acclimation needs to occur.","output":"Patients Perceptions of Telemedicine Visits Before and After the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus COVID-19, exchange rate dynamics and other macroeconomic factors make the risk of implementing projects in the construction sector quite high and require effective management.

The existential struggle with the awareness of death impacts the gamut of human cognition, emotion, and behavior. This multi-method research (&#931;N = 1,219) explains the psychosocial impact of COVID-19-related mortality salience on altruism. Drawing from terror management theory, two studies tested death-thought accessibility, mortality salience, and anxiety buffer hypotheses. Study 1 (cross-sectional survey), using structural equation modeling, confirms death anxiety and fear are predictors of powerlessness and materialism which, in turn, predict charitable donations. Study 2 (between-subjects experiment) confirms the causal effects of COVID-19-induced mortality salience on altruism. Controlling income and socioeconomic status, people in the mortality salience treatment condition indicate greater monetary donations ($), ratio of prosocial (altruistic) to proself (egocentric) spending (%), donation of time (hour), monetary valuation of time (hourly rate = $/hour), and economic value of donated time (hourly rate*hour) than the controls. These effects are mediated by powerlessness. Moderating effects of relevant individual difference factors are significant: the greedier, more selfish, narcissistic, materialistic, and system-justifying the donor is, the higher monetary donations, volunteer time, and perceived value of donated time are, only when the COVID-19-induced mortality is made salient but not in the controls.

The purpose of this study is to understand the psychological stress among college students in different stages of epidemics in hard-hit areas such as Hubei. Moreover, to highlight the factors that influencing, their psychological conditions with the emphasis of further corresponding suggestions. Methods This study includes self-designed questionnaires in order to assess and analyze the psychological state of over 17,000 college students during the outbreak period in January and home quarantine in February. The questionnaire contains three aspects and six dimensions: pressure responses: stress susceptibility (SS), stress adjustment (SA), risk cognition: cognition of danger (CD), cognition of illness (CI) and stress reactions: emotional responses (ER), somatic responses (SR). This survey was done by an online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the psychological stress information of college students, and analyzed the data by SPSS 22.0 for Windows. Results Regarding the stress susceptibility, participants were more likely stressed in February than in January. Regarding the stress adjustment, the number of participants requiring pressure regulation or release in the February survey was significantly lower than that the effective in the January survey. The mean of the cognition of danger reduced significantly in February than in January, in other words, participants were highly worried about the epidemic in January than in February. Regarding the cognition of illness, participants in January had a more pessimistic attitude towards the epidemic than those in February. The emotional responses of the participants in February were more severe than those in January, while the somatic responses reduced significantly in February compared with January. Furthermore, females have stronger stress reactions than males. However, the SR doesnt have significant differences between females and males. Conclusion After two surveys in January and February, it was found that the psychological stress of college students in Hubei were significantly different at different stages of the epidemic, where the epidemic developped, the psychological stress of college students become more severe.

Tool-driven (e.g., using static analysis tools) approaches lack context and domain-specific requirements of an app being tested. App developers struggle to find an actionable and prioritized list of vulnerabilities from a laundry list of security warnings reported by static analysis tools. Process-driven (e.g., applying threat modeling methods) approaches require substantial resources (e.g., security testing team, budget) and security expertise, which small to medium-scale app dev teams could barely afford. To help app developers securing their apps, we propose SO{U}RCERER, a guiding framework for Android app developers for security testing.

Management of chronic ailments has become challenging because of the strained health-care resources and social distancing measures that prevent on-site clinical visits and treatments. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a debilitating, chronic disease characterized by unpredictable swelling attacks in various parts of the body. Controlling HAE symptoms often requires long-term prophylactic medication use and regular medical care; however, limited scientific information has been published about HAE medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To gather patient and health-care professional (HCP) perspectives on the global impact that COVID-19 has had, and the future impact it will have on HAE medical care and to identify differences in perceptions across economic and geographic boundaries. Methods: We conducted two independent but similar online global surveys to capture patient and HCP perspectives on the impact that COVID-19 has had, and the future impact it will have on HAE medical care. Results: Both patients and HCPs globally reported that the pandemic has limited the availability of HAE medical care, and they expect the restrictions to continue far beyond the pandemic. In addition, the results of our study suggested that telehealth use has increased across the globe but has been more successfully implemented in high-income countries. Conclusion: Patients and HCPs expect that HAE-related care will be negatively impacted by the pandemic for many years. Disparities in medical care and technologic infrastructure may exacerbate these challenges in non-high-income countries. Supportive tools and global infrastructure should be established to provide aid to non-high-income countries throughout the pandemic and several years after.","output":"Global perceptions of the current and future impacts of COVID-19 on hereditary angioedema management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objectives: Canadians want to live and die in their home communities.

This study aims to identify the essential components required to best support patients and families with palliative care needs in their communities to inform system changes and empower family physicians (FPs) in providing community-based palliative care for patients. Design: Appreciative Inquiry (AI) methodology with individual interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed iteratively for emerging themes and used to develop -possibility statements- to frame discussion in subsequent focus groups. A conceptual framework emerged to describe the Destiny state as per AI methods. Setting: Family physicians, palliative home care providers, patients and bereaved caregivers were recruited in the urban and surrounding rural health authority zones of Calgary, Canada. Participants: 9 females and 9 males FPs (range of practice years 2-42) in interviews; 8 bereaved caregivers, 1 patient, 26 Palliative Home Care team members in focus groups. Interviews and focus groups were recorded digitally and transcribed with consent. Results: The identified themes that transcended all three groups created the foundation for the conceptual framework. Enhanced communication and fostering team relationships between all care providers with the focus on the patient and caregivers was the cornerstone concept. The family physician/patient relationship must be protected and encouraged by all care providers, while more system flexibility is needed to respond more effectively to patients. These concepts must exist in the context that patients and caregivers need more education regarding the benefits of palliative care, while increasing public discourse about mortality. Conclusions: Key areas were identified for how the patient's team can work together effectively to improve the patient and caregiver palliative care journey in the community with the cornerstone element of building on the trusting FP-patient longitudinal relationship.","output":"Family physicians supporting patients with palliative care needs within the Patient Medical Home in the community: An Appreciative Inquiry qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the potential therapeutic utility of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is well established, the clinical development of ACE2 drugs has been limited, likely due in part to the short half-life of the protein.

Early postoperative extubation is currently recommended in anesthesia guidelines. No current technology can accurately, non-invasively, measure respiratory competence after extubation. Pulse oximetry has been helpful, but this is a late indicator of respiratory compromise. A novel, non-invasive, respiratory volume monitor (RVM) has been shown to deliver accurate continuous, real-time minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume (TV) and respiratory rate (RR) measurements and provide an objective measure of respiratory competence. The RVM will accurately reflect MV, TV and RR in cardiac surgery patients before and after extubation. METHODS RVM traces were recorded from patients before and after cardiac surgery. Continuous monitoring began on admission to the unit and was ended at 24 h after extubation. RVM-based MV, TV and RR were calculated from 30-s segments. MV, TV and RR were also continuously recorded from the ventilator prior to extubation. The RVM was calibrated to each patient using the readings from the ventilator. RESULTS During mechanical ventilation, the RVM measured TVs strongly correlated with the ventilator TVs (r = 0.97). Following extubation, the patient's breathing became more erratic and TVs and MVs decreased. Within 1 h, all patients studied showed a marked recovery of MV and TV. CONCLUSIONS RVM-based MV, TV and RR correlated well with similar data collected from ventilators. After extubation, RVM shows promise as a means to monitor respiratory competence of non-intubated patients, and has implications for use in other settings and improving patient safety.","output":"Use of a Respiratory Volume Monitor to Assess Respiratory Competence in Cardiac Surgery Patients After Extubation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: In March of 2020, Minnesota schools were mandated to transition to distance learning to slow the spread of COVID-19.

This psychological impact might vary in different countries, and thus we compared the prevalence of self-reported psychological distress, loneliness and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among young people in the United Kingdom (UK) and China at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data of this study came from two sources. One source was the first wave of COVID-19 study in Understanding Society, a special wave of the UK household longitudinal study, which provided the high-quality, national-wide representative panel data. The sample comprised 1054 young people. The other source was an online survey on the mental health of 1003 young people from Shanghai, a highly developed area in China. The questionnaire included questions on the prevalence of common mental disorders (cut-off score  4), loneliness and potential PTSS (cut-off  33). Univariable analyses were conducted to test the differences in the self-reported prevalence of psychological distress and loneliness between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were run to explore the predictors of psychological distress and loneliness among all the young people from England and Shanghai. RESULTS: Among the samples with self-reported psychological distress, the UK sample accounted for 34.4% (n=1054) and the Chinese sample accounted for 14.1% (n=1003). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Additionally, 57.1% of people in the UK and 46.7% in China reported that they sometimes or often felt lonely, of which the difference is statistically significant (p < 0.001). Regression analysis of the entire samples showed that nationality, gender, psychotherapy and loneliness were significant predictors of 12-item General Health Questionnaire scores, while the variables of age and living alone were not. Significant predictors of self-reported loneliness were the nationality, gender, age, living alone and psychotherapy. In China, 123 (12.3%) young people, 49 men (11.3%) and 74 women (13.0%), met the criteria of PTSS symptoms (cut-off scores  33). These scores were only collected in China. CONCLUSION: This evidence suggests that mental health and loneliness reported by young people were lower in China than that in the UK during the studied period. More research is needed to understand these differences. If the differential negative psychological impacts are confirmed, country-specific measures of prevention and intervention should be adopted to improve the mental health of young people under the ongoing impact of the pandemic.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young people: A comparison between China and the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease has rapidly spread around the world after initial identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

Forty-four percent of the groundwater samples had detectable viral loads between 2.6 and 38.3 copies/ml. A significant correlation between viral load and sucralose concentration in groundwater reaffirmed the hypothesis of leaching and infiltrating effluent from surface and/or failing sewage pipes and emphasized the importance of water disinfection. Twelve percent of the surface water dam samples tested positive for viral RNA, with values varying between 3.3 and 3.8 copies/ml. Finally, 13% of the river samples were positive for viral RNA, with concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 7.0 copies/ml. Untreated wastewater samples taken in the same period showed viral loads of up to 3535 copies/ml, demonstrating a dilution effect and/or wastewater facilities efficiency of three orders of magnitude.

While distinct from SARS-CoV, both group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization, origins to bat CoVs, and an arsenal of immune antagonists. In this report, we evaluate type I interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication to SARS-CoV, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I. In Vero E6 and in Calu3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 is substantially attenuated in the context of IFN-I pretreatment, whereas SARS-CoV is not. In line with these findings, SARS-CoV-2 fails to counteract phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of ISG proteins, while SARS-CoV is able to suppress both. Comparing SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in human airway epithelial cultures, we observe the absence of IFN-I stimulation by SARS-CoV-2 alone but detect the failure to counteract STAT1 phosphorylation upon IFN-I pretreatment, resulting in near ablation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we evaluated IFN-I treatment postinfection and found that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive even after establishing infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonists. The absence of an equivalent open reading frame 3b (ORF3b) and genetic differences versus ORF6 suggest that the two key IFN-I antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to IFN-I responses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that may help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development. IMPORTANCE With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment options. In addition, these findings could have key implications for animal model development as well as further research into how SARS-CoV-2 modulates the type I IFN response early during infection.","output":"Type I Interferon Susceptibility Distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been observed that there is an increase in the number of candidates applying for the PhD course (organic chemistry in the present context) as compared to the number of seats available in general all over the globe.

It is important to estimate its impact of COVID-19 for health policy decision-making. We estimated the years of life lost (YLLs) due to COVID-19 in high-incidence countries. METHODS: We collected the YLLs due to COVID-19 in 30 high-incidence countries as of April 13, 2020 and followed up as of July 14, 2020. Incidence and mortality were collected using each country's formal reports, articles, and other electronic sources. The life expectancy of Japanese females by age and the UN population data were used to calculate YLLs in total and per 100,000. RESULTS: As of April 22, 2020, there were 1,699,574 YLLs due to COVID-19 in 30 high-incidence countries. On July 14, 2020, this increased to 4,072,325. Both on April 22 and July 14, the total YLLs due to COVID-19 was highest in the USA (April 22, 534,481 YLLs; July 14, 1,199,510 YLLs), and the YLLs per 100,000 population was highest in Belgium (April 22, 868.12 YLLs/100,000; July 14, 1,593.72 YLLs/100,000). YLLs due to COVID-19 were higher among males than among females and higher in those aged &#8805; 60 years than in younger individuals. Belgium had the highest proportion of YLLs attributable to COVID-19 as a proportion of the total YLLs and the highest disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 population. CONCLUSION: This study estimated YLLs due to COVID-19 in 30 countries. COVID-19 is a high burden in the USA and Belgium, among males and the elderly. The YLLs are very closely related with the incidence as well as the mortality. This highlights the importance of the early detection of incident case that minimizes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 fatality.","output":"Years of Life Lost Attributable to COVID-19 in High-incidence Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An innovative simple, rapid and sensitive spectrophotometric method was developed for the simultaneous analysis of sofosbuvir (SOF) and ledipasvir (LED) in their combined dosage forms.

We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may target IS assembly in CTLs to escape killing. We show that primary human CD8+ T cells strongly upregulate the expression of ACE2, the Spike protein receptor, during differentiation to CTLs. CTL pre-incubation with the Wuhan or Omicron Spike variants inhibits IS assembly and function, as shown by defective synaptic accumulation of TCRs and tyrosine phosphoproteins as well as defective centrosome and lytic granule polarisation to the IS, resulting in impaired target cell killing. These defects were reversed by anti-Spike antibodies that interfere with ACE2 binding and were reproduced by ACE2 engagement with Angiotensin-II or an anti-ACE2 antibody, but not by the ACE2 product Ang (1-7). These results highlight a new strategy of immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 based on the Spike-dependent, ACE2-mediated targeting of the lytic IS to prevent the elimination of infected cells.

The aim of this study is to describe the efficacy and safety outcomes of the virtual training program. METHOD: ology: A prospective observational cohort study was performed, including patients with diagnosis of T1D previously treated with multiple doses of insulin (MDI) or sensor augmented pump therapy (SAP) who were updating to HCL system, from March to July 2020. Virtual training and follow-up were done through the Zoom video conferencing application and Medtronic Carelink System version 3.1 software. CGM data were analyzed to compare the time in range (TIR), time below range (TBR) and glycemic variability, during the first two weeks corresponding to manual mode with the final two weeks of follow-up in automatic mode. RESULTS: 91 patients were included. Mean TIR achieved with manual mode was 77.3  11.3, increasing to 81.6%  7.6 (p < 0.001) after two weeks of auto mode use.

Several human randomized clinical trials assessing potential vaccines are currently underway. There is an urgent need for a living systematic review that continuously assesses the beneficial and harmful effects of all available vaccines for COVID-19. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials. We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available. Two review authors will independently extract data and conduct risk of bias assessments. We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any vaccine aiming to prevent COVID-19 (including but not limited to messenger RNA; DNA; non-replicating viral vector; replicating viral vector; inactivated virus; protein subunit; dendritic cell; other vaccines) with any comparator (placebo; active placebo; no intervention; standard care; an active intervention; another vaccine for COVID-19) for participants in all age groups. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality; a diagnosis of COVID-19; and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be quality of life and non-serious adverse events. The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network meta-analyses, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Within-study bias will be assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) and Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approaches will be used to assess certainty of evidence.

However, patient adherence to recommended intervals varies, potentially diminishing benefit from screening. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of patient adherence to Lung-RADS recommended screening intervals. METHODS We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and major radiology and oncology conference archives between Apr 28, 2014 and Dec 17, 2020. Eligible studies mentioned patient adherence to Lung-RADS recommendations. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020189326). RESULTS We identified 24 eligible studies for qualitative summary, of which 21 were suitable for meta-analysis. The pooled adherence rate was 57% (95% confidence interval (CI): 46-69%) for defined adherence (e.g., an annual incidence screen was performed within 15 months) among 6689 patients and 65% (95% CI: 55-75%) for anytime adherence among 5085 patients. Large heterogeneity in adherence rates between studies was observed (I2=99% for defined adherence, I2=98% for anytime adherence). Heterogeneous adherence rates were associated with Lung-RADS scores, with significantly higher adherence rates among Lung-RADS 3-4 than Lung-RADS 1-2 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Patient adherence to Lung-RADS recommended screening intervals is suboptimal across clinical LCS programs in the US, especially among patients with Lung-RADS category 1-2 results. To improve adherence rates, future research may focus on implementing tailored interventions after identifying barriers to LCS. We also propose a minimum standardized set of data elements for future pooled analyses of LCS adherence based on our findings.","output":"Patient Adherence to Lung-RADS Recommended Screening Intervals in the United States: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a high postoperative morbidity rate after cancer surgery, that impairs patients self-management, job condition and economic strength.

However, some E. coli strains of different pathotypes can cause disease in both humans and animals. Atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC) can infect both animals and humans or influence the severity of other ongoing infections. RESULTS: In the present study, a total of 332 samples were collected from ducks, geese, turkeys, chickens, and pigeons from the Hungarian Veterinary Diagnostic Directorate, two slaughterhouses, two pigeon keepers and one backyard chicken farm. E. coli was isolated and verified from 319 samples. The isolates were screened by PCR for diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes. Altogether seven atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC) strains were identified: two from four-week-old dead turkeys, two from force-fed geese, and three from pigeons. No further pathotypes were identified in the collection. The atypical EPEC strains were classified phylogenetically to B1, B2, and F, and four out of the seven aEPEC isolates proved to be multidrug resistant. Serotypes of aEPEC strains were uniform collected from same farms and showed diversity between their origins with O76, O145, O109 serogroups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report in the literature about aEPEC in goose (Anser anser domestica). Furthermore, this is the first isolation of aEPEC from turkeys and pigeons in Hungary.

Moreover, we presented an overview of the EBPTs mostly used in clinical practice with the aim to modulate immune system dysfunction in sepsis. RECENT FINDINGS Sepsis is a life-threatening disease and recent findings showed that its pathophysiology relies on dysregulated immune system response to pathogen invasion of the body. In the light of this view, EBPTs have been demonstrated effective to remove specific mediators and foster balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways. SUMMARY EBPTs have been widely used in clinical practice, with the aim to modulate immune system dysfunction by the removal of pathogens and inflammatory mediators in critically ill patients with sepsis. Such therapies are characterised by specific structural features, which allow selective and nonselective removal of mediators by adsorption. However, few evidences support their role in the management of critically ill patients with sepsis.

CONCLUSION: the non-referring to a univocal conception of appropriateness deprives professionals of an objective criterion to resolve the most difficult decisions. However, it allows them to establish what from time to time seems to be the most appropriate care pathway for a given patient, at a given time and context, preserving the goal of personalized care.","output":"Health professionals' perception of appropriateness of care: a qualitative study in Italian pediatric hospices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It can be misleading to think that the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) which has a very strong mutation and adaptation capabilities, uses only the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) pathway to reach target cells Despite all the precautions taken, the pandemic attack continues and the rapid increase in the number of deaths suggest that this virus has entered the cell through different pathways and caused damage through different mechanisms The main reason why the ACE2 pathway comes to the fore in all scientific studies is that this receptor is located at the entry point of basic mechanisms that provide alveolo-capillary homeostasis SARS-CoV-2 has to use nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB), caveloae, clathrin, lipoxin, serine protease and proteasome pathways in addition to ACE2 to enter the target cell and initiate damage For this reason, while new drug development studies are continuing, in order to be beneficial to patients in their acute period, it is imperative that we are able to come up with drugs that activate or inhibit these pathways and are currently in clinical use It is also critical that we adopt these new pathways to the treatment of pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2, based on the scientific data we use to treat the general population","output":"Combating sars-cov-2 through lipoxins, proteasome, caveolin and nuclear factor-kappab pathways in non-pregnant and pregnant populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of fear and anxiety on nutrition during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Participants were recruited by an online survey in this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire included general demographic characteristics, level of fear and anxiety, and nutritional habits. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7) were used to determine fear and anxiety. SETTING: Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: A total sample consisted of 1012 adults. RESULTS: In pandemic, fear and anxiety caused individuals to skip breakfast and snacks less, but more at lunch. A positive significant correlation was observed between the increased consumption of yoghurt, cheese and water and FCV-19S scores. There was a positive significant correlation between cheese, legume, nuts-seeds, cake-cookies, dessert and tea consumption and GAD-7 scores. A 1-unit increase in FCV-19S scores affected 104 times of increased consumption of yoghurt, kefir, cheese, nuts-seeds, fruit (dry) and rice-pasta. A 1-unit increase in GAD-7 scores affected 103 times of increased consumption of egg and fruit (fresh); 104 times of increased consumption of cheese and other vegetables; 105 times of increased consumption of milk, meat, poultry, fish, legume, nuts-seeds, fruit (dry), cake-cookies and tea; 107 times of increased consumption of rice-pasta and coffee and 108 times of increased consumption of bread and dessert. CONCLUSIONS: In pandemic, anxiety and fear led to changes in individuals nutritional habits and food preferences.

Intestinal viruses are closely integrated with these bacterial communities, yet the composition and clinical significance of these communities in CAP patients are unknown. The aims of this exploratory study were to characterise the composition of the rectal bacteriome and virome at hospital admission for CAP, and to determine if microbiota signatures correlate with clinical outcomes. Methods We performed a prospective observational cohort study in CAP patients, admitted to a university or community hospital in the Netherlands between October 2016 and July 2018, and controls. Rectal bacteriome and virome composition were characterised using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and virus discovery next-generation sequencing, respectively. Unsupervised multi-omics factor analysis was used to assess the co-variation of bacterial and viral communities, which served as primary predictor. The clinical outcomes of interest were the time to clinical stability and the length of hospital stay. Findings 64 patients and 38 controls were analysed. Rectal bacterial alpha (p = 0?0015) and beta diversity (r(2)=0?023, p = 0?004) of CAP patients differed from controls. Bacterial and viral microbiota signatures correlated with the time to clinical stability (hazard ratio 0?43, 95% confidence interval 0?20C0?93, p = 0?032) and the length of hospital stay (hazard ratio 0?37, 95% confidence interval 0?17C0?81, p = 0?012), although only the latter remained significant following p-value adjustment for examining multiple candidate cut-points (p = 0?12 and p = 0?046, respectively). Interpretation This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence that intestinal bacteriome and virome signatures could be linked with clinical outcomes in CAP. Such exploratory data, when validated in independent cohorts, could inform the development of a microbiota-based diagnostic panel used to predict clinical outcomes in CAP.

METHODS We retrospectively analysed 412 patients with HBV-related single HCC treated with percutaneous RFA between January 2004 and December 2013. AFP and DCP levels were measured before (pre-ablation) and 1 month after treatment (post-ablation). We assessed predictive factors for overall and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS On univariate analysis, Child-Pugh score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, platelet count, tumour size, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, and pre- and post-ablation DCP were significant for overall survival; and age, Child-Pugh score, MELD score, platelet count, tumour size, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score, BCLC stage, and pre- and post-ablation AFP and DCP were significant for recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences in overall survival by MELD score and tumour size and in recurrence-free survival by BCLC stage. Among the tumour markers, post-ablation DCP was an independent prognostic factor for overall and recurrence-free survival [hazard ratio (HR), 3.438; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.331-8.877; P = 0.011 and HR, 4.934; 95% CI, 2.761-8.816; P < 0.001 respectively].

The coastal sediment of Goseong Bay in the Republic of Korea is organically enriched with pollutants, including heavy metals, sulfide, phosphate, and ammonia. Microbial remediation and capping techniques have been suggested as effective routes for sediment remediation. In this study, Bacillus subtilis zeolite (BZ) was used as a sediment capping material, and effective remediation of coastal sediment was observed in a 40-day laboratory microcosm experiment. A significant decrease in the sediment water content and reduced concentration of acid volatile sulfide were observed in the BZ-capped sediment. In the overlying water and pore water, significant decreases in phosphate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; NO2-N + NO3-N and NH4-N) concentrations were observed in the BZ-treated experiment.

Previous studies have shown that Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients have time perception deficits compared to a cognitively unimpaired control group (CU). There are only a few studies on dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients' time perception in comparison with CU and AD patients. Early intervention and prescription of the right medicine may delay the deterioration of AD and DLB, moreover, knowing how prodromal AD (prAD) and prodromal DLB's (prDLB) time perception differ from each other might be helpful for future understanding of these two dementias. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the difference in time perception performance between prodromal AD and prodromal DLB. Methods: We invited people diagnosed with prAD, prDLB, and CU to participate in this study. Tests of verbal estimation of time and time interval production were used to assess their time perception. We analyzed the average time estimation (ATE), absolute error score (ABS), coefficient of variance (CV), and subjective temporal unit (STU) within the three groups. Results: A total of 40 prAD, 30 prDLB, and 47 CU completed the study. In the verbal estimation test, the CV for the prAD was higher than both prDLB and CU at the 9 s interval, and the CV of prAD was higher than CU at the 27 s interval. In the time interval production test, the subjective time units of prDLB were higher than prAD at the 10 s interval, while those of both prDLB and CU were higher than prAD at the 30 s interval. The percentage of subjects with STU < 1.0 s, indicating overestimation, was higher in prAD than both prDLB and CU. Conclusion: Time perception of prAD patients showed imprecision and overestimation of time, while prDLB tended to underestimate time intervals. No significant difference was found in accuracy among the three groups. It is speculated that the clinical and pathological severity of the two prodromal dementia stages may be different, and some patients have not yet had their time perception affected.","output":"Time Perception in Prodromal Alzheimer's Dementia and in Prodromal Dementia With Lewy Bodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need to understand better animal-to-human transmission of coronaviruses and adaptive evolution within new hosts. We scanned over 182,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for selective sweep signatures and found a distinct footprint of positive selection located around a non-synonymous change (A1114G; T372A) within the Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), predicted to remove glycosylation and increase binding to human ACE2 (hACE2), the cellular receptor. This change is present in all human SARS-CoV-2 sequences but not closely related viruses from bats and pangolins. As predicted, T372A RBD bound hACE2 with higher affinity in experimental binding assays. We engineered the reversion mutant (A372T) and found that A372 (WT-SARS-CoV-2) enhanced replication in human lung cells relative to its putative ancestral variant (T372), an effect which was 20x greater than the well-known D614G mutation.

All preparations should be made considering the worst possible conditions and the provided service should continue without interruption. In this study, a multi-criteria decision-making model was developed to evaluate disaster preparedness of hospitals. This decision model includes Bayesian bestCworst method (BBWM), the VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods. With the proposed decision model, six main criteria and 34 sub-criteria related to disaster preparedness of hospitals were considered. The criteria and sub-criteria evaluated in pairwise comparison manner by the experts were weighted with BBWM. These weight values and the data obtained from the six Turkish hospitals were combined to provide inputs for VIKOR and TOPSIS. In addition, a comparative study and sensitivity analysis were carried out using weight vectors obtained by different tools. BBWM application results show that the Personnel criterion was determined as the most important criterion with an importance value of 26%. This criterion is followed by Equipment with 25%, Transportation with 14%, Hospital building and Communication with 12%, and Flexibility with 11%. Hospital-2 was determined as the most prepared hospital for disasters as a result of VIKOR application. The VIKOR Q value of this hospital was obtained as 0.000. According to the results of the comparative study, Hospital-2 was determined as the most disaster-ready hospital in all six different scenarios. This hospital is followed by Hospital-4 (Q = 0.5661) and Hospital-5 (Q = 0.7464). The remaining rankings were Hospital-6, Hospital-3 and Hospital-1. The solidity of the results was checked with TOPSIS. Based on TOPSIS application results, Hospital-2 was again found the most-ready hospital. The usage of BBWM in this study enabled the expert groups views to be combined without loss of information and to determine the criteria and sub-criteria weights with less pairwise comparisons in a probabilistic perspective.

Given the health risks associated with childhood anaemia and the large heterogeneity of published studies on this subject, we conducted a systematic review of the evidence regarding anaemia prevalence and associated factors in children under 5 years in Western China. METHODS: We searched for all relevant studies on the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in children under 5 years in Western China, obtaining research between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2021, in English and Chinese from Medline, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, WanFang Data and VIP. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts; three reviewed full texts of relevant articles for data extraction and performed quality assessments. The median prevalence was calculated on unweighted pooling, stratified by region, sex, age and ethnic group. Associated factors and a linear trend chart were conducted to identify trends and research highlights. RESULTS: Among the 55 articles included, most were cross-sectional studies (39, 70.91%). The prevalence of anaemia in children under 5 years in Western China ranged from 3.69% to 75.74% (median 42.54% (IQR 25.62%C52.56%)); the highest levels were in Qinghai province: 59.10%C75.74% (median 67.80% (IQR 64.70%C72.75%)); the highest levels were reported in the subgroup of children aged 6C12 months (median 50.09% (IQR 34.35%C59.04%)). Regional contexts, individual sociodemographic characteristics and feeding behaviours, and nutritional programme interventions were factors associated with anaemia prevalence.

The proportion of respondents who received []1-dose of a COVID-19 vaccine increased from 18% in January to 67% in March. Older age predicted vaccine uptake in January (OR=2.02[95%CI=1.14-3.78], p<.001) and March (10.92[6.76-18.05], p<.001). In January, additional predictors of vaccine uptake were higher numeracy (1.48[1.20-1.86], p<.001), COVID-19 risk perceptions (1.35[1.03-1.78], p=.029), and believing it is important that adults get the COVID-19 vaccine (1.66[1.05-2.66], p=.033). In March, additional predictors of vaccine uptake were believing it is important that adults get the COVID-19 vaccine (1.63[1.15-2.34], p=.006), previous (January) COVID-19 vaccine intentions (1.37[1.10-1.72], p=.006), and belief in science (0.84[0.72-0.99], p=.041). Concerns about side effects and the vaccine development process were the most common reasons for non-vaccination. Unvaccinated respondents with no interest in getting a COVID-19 vaccine were younger (0.27[0.09-0.77], p=.016), held negative views about COVID-19 vaccines for adults (0.15[0.08-0.26], p<.001), had lower trust in healthcare (0.59[0.36-0.95], p=.032), and preferred to watch and wait in clinically ambiguous medical situations (0.66[0.48-0.89], p=.007). Limitations. Reliance on the accuracy and consistency of self-reported data. Conclusion. These findings offer important insights regarding key predictors of vaccine uptake during the early stages of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the US, which can help guide health communications and public outreach. Evidence that attitudes and intentions towards COVID-19 vaccines are important predictors of uptake provides validation for studies which have used these measures and reinforces the need to develop effective strategies for addressing concerns about vaccine safety and development which continue to be at the forefront of vaccine hesitancy.","output":"Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake: An online longitudinal study of US Veterans and non-Veterans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is increasingly utilised to assess the aetiology and severity of cardiomyopathies Non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) is a heterogeneous condition, with varying clinical and demographic factors influencing outcome This study assesses differences in clinical outcomes in European compared with Mori and Pacific NICM patients undergoing CMR in South Auckland Method: CMR reports from Counties Manukau District Health Board region (2005 C 2019) were analysed from an ANZACS-QI linked CMR database 536 patients with a diagnosis of NICM were identified and linked ethnicity data recorded 498 patients were grouped according to European (n = 231) vs Mori and Pacific ethnicity (n = 267) Clinical, biochemical, imaging and demographic data was collected from electronic medical records The primary end point was combined all cause mortality and readmission rate for decompensated heart failure Results: Mori and Pacific patients were younger (52 3 +/-11 6 vs 57 2 +/- 14 6 years, p&lt;0 001), had higher Body Mass Index (36 7 kg/m2 vs 29 5 kg/m2, p&lt;0 001), and weight (105 3kg vs 87 4kg, p&lt;0 001) CMR markers of left ventricular (LV) volumes (p=0 95), LV ejection fraction (p=0 14), and presence of myocardial fibrosis (p=0 13) were similar between the two groups Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator, and Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy implantation rates were similar (p=0 58) The primary combined outcome of readmission for decompensated heart failure and all cause mortality was significantly higher in Mori and Pacific patients (96 vs 48, p&lt;0 001) Conclusion: Mori and Pacific patients with NICM have worse clinical outcomes than European patients, despite similar disease severity on CMR","output":"Mori and Pacific Patients With Non-Ischaemic Cardiomyopathy, Undergoing Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Have Worse Clinical Outcomes than European Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of 2020, the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a deadly viral illness, is declared as a public health emergency situation by WHO.

In this article, our main goal is to investigate the effect of intensity of Covid-19 cases based on the population size and tourism factors in certain regions of Italy by visual data analysis. The regions of Lombardia, Veneto, Campania, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte are the top five regions covering 58.50% of the total Covid-19 cases diagnosed in Italy. It has been shown by visual data analysis that population and tourism factors play an important role in the spread of Covid-19 cases in these five regions. In addition, a prediction model was created using Bi-LSTM and ARIMA algorithms to forecast the number of Covid-19 cases occurring in these five regions in order to take early action. We can conclude that these northern regions have been affected mostly by Covid-19 and the distribution of the resident population and tourist flow factors affected the number of Covid-19 cases in Italy.","output":"The effect of population and tourism factors on Covid-19 cases in Italy: Visual data analysis and forecasting approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foreign body ingestion is not an uncommon encounter in adults, especially denture ingestion in the elderly.

Therefore, we hypothesize that a MUC1 VNTR TACA-conjugate can be successfully formulated into a liposome-based anticancer vaccine. The immunogenicity of the vaccine should be further augmented by incorporating surface-displayed l-rhamnose (Rha) epitopes onto the liposomes to take advantage of a natural antibody-dependent antigen uptake mechanism. To validate our hypothesis, we synthesized a 20-amino-acid MUC1 glycopeptide containing a GalNAc-O-Thr (Tn) TACA by SPPS and conjugated it to a functionalized Toll-like receptor ligand (TLRL). An l-Rha-cholesterol conjugate was prepared using tetra(ethylene glycol) (TEG) as a linker. The liposome-based anticancer vaccine was formulated by the extrusion method using TLRL-MUC1-Tn conjugate, Rha-TEG-cholesterol, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) in a total lipid concentration of 30 mM. The stability, homogeneity, and size characterization of the liposomes was evaluated by SEM and DLS measurements. The formulated liposomes demonstrated positive binding with both anti-Rha and mouse anti-human MUC1 antibodies. Groups of female BALB/c mice were immunized and boosted with a rhamnose-Ficoll (Rha-Ficoll) conjugate formulated with alum as adjuvant to generate the appropriate concentration of anti-Rha antibodies in the mice. Anti-Rha antibody titers were >25-fold higher in the groups of mice immunized with the Rha-Ficoll conjugate than the nonimmunized control groups. The mice were then immunized with the TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomal vaccine formulated either with or without the surface displaying Rha epitopes. Sera collected from the groups of mice initially immunized with Rha-Ficoll and later vaccinated with the Rha-displaying TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomes showed a >8-fold increase in both anti-MUC1-Tn and anti-Tn antibody titers in comparison to the groups of mice that did not receive Rha-Ficoll. T-cells from BALB/c mice primed with a MUC1-Tn peptide demonstrated increased proliferation to the Rha-liposomal vaccine in the presence of antibodies isolated from Rha-Ficoll immunized mice compared to nonimmune mice, supporting the proposed effect on antigen presentation. The anti-MUC1-Tn antibodies in the vaccinated mice serum recognized MUC1 on human leukemia U266 cells. Because this vaccine uses separate rhamnose and antigenic epitope components, the vaccine can easily be targeted to different antigens or epitopes by changing the peptide without having to change the other components.","output":"Synthesis and immunological evaluation of a MUC1 glycopeptide incorporated into l-rhamnose displaying liposomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The protection of children from maltreatment has become extremely challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. The public's gaze is focused on the urgent health crisis, while many children are at risk due to social isolation and reduced social services. OBJECTIVE: Examine child protection in Israel during COVID-19, as portrayed in mainstream news media and government policy documents. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study analyzed all policy documents and mainstream media reports published in Israel from March to May 2020, during the initial mandatory nationwide quarantine. METHODS: (1) Search of relevant articles in mainstream news websites; (2) Search of documents in official websites of relevant government ministries and agencies. RESULTS: 28 government policy documents and 22 media articles were found relevant. When examined chronologically, what stood out was the initial decision to shut down social services, including some of the residential care units for youth at risk, and declare social workers non-essential. These decisions were revoked a few weeks into the quarantine, following persistent media pressure by child advocates, resulting in minor changes in policy. CONCLUSION: Children were initially invisible to Israeli policymakers facing the pandemic, highlighting the centrality of advocates promoting children's rights and of mainstream news media in disseminating the discourse of protecting children from maltreatment, especially in times of crisis. Moreover, the study points to the heightened threat to at-risk children due to inadequate policies, and to the urgent need to develop child protection policies in order to avoid further risk in future global crises.","output":"Invisible children and non-essential workers: Child protection during COVID-19 in Israel according to policy documents and media coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has had a major impact on health-care provision Social distancing will impact the organization of outpatient clinics (OCs) and require general restructuring of health care Methods: Our retinal team participated in a structured fact-finding session to implement social distancing of patients and staff in wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) clinics Clinic flow and performance were continually reviewed and improved A retrospective audit of all wAMD follow-up appointments was conducted for 4 weeks from the start of the UK lockdown A search for clinical guidance regarding retinal services was performed on the homepages of international professional bodies The guidelines were compared to the implemented changes in our wAMD social distancing OCs (SDOCs) and potential risk examined Results: The changes in clinic setup to achieve SDOCs are described The average total time spent in the clinic area by each patient has reduced by 27% The audit concluded that 65% of patients needed a treatment interval of 4C 7 weeks after their appointment, 17% at either 8 or 9 weeks, and 18% at 10 weeks or beyond The UK, AustralianCNew Zealand, US, and German professional ophthalmology bodies have published divergent guidelines, but all recommended a continuation of anti-VEGF injections Conclusion: Health-care provision will change and hospitals and outpatient facilities will have to adapt to the COVID-19 epidemic We describe a clinic setup (SDOCs) that minimizes risk to patients and staff, while maintaining the ability to treat each patient and their disease individually","output":"Restructuring Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic to Allow Social Distancing Outpatient Clinics (SDOC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: So far, there has been no published population study on the relationship between COVID19 infection and public risk perception, information source, knowledge, attitude and four nonpharmaceutical interventions(NPI: hand washing, proper coughing habits, social distancing and mask wearing) during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods: An online survey of 8158 Chinese adults between 22 February to 5 March 2020 was conducted. Bivariate associations between categorical variables were examined using Fisher exact test. We also explored the determinants of four NPIs as well as their association with COVID19 infection using logistic regression. Results: Of 8158 adults included, 57 (0.73%) were infected with COVID19. The overwhelming majority of respondents showed a positive attitude (99.2%), positive risk perception (99.9%) and high knowledge levels that were among the strongest predictors of four highly adopted NPIs (hand washing:96.8%; proper coughing: 93.1%; social distancing:87.1%; mask wearing:97.9%). There was an increased risk of COVID19 infection for those who not washing hands (2.28% vs 0.65%; RR=3.53: 95%CI: 1.538.15; P<0.009); not practicing proper coughing (1.79% vs 0.73%; RR=2.44: 95%CI: 1.15-5.15;P=0.026); not practicing social distancing (1.52% vs 0.58%; RR=2.63:95%CI:1.48 4.67; P=0.002); and not wearing a mask (7.41% vs 0.6%; RR=12.38:95%CI:5.81-26.36; P<0.001). For those who did practice all other three NPIs, wearing mask was associated with significantly reduced risk of infection compared to those who did not wear a mask (0.6% vs 16.7%; p=0.035). Similarly, for those who did not practice all or part of the other three NPIs, wearing mask was also associated with significantly reduced risk of infection. In a penalised logistic regression model including all four NPIs, wearing a mask was the only significant predictor of COVID19 infection among four NPIs (OR=7.20; 95%CI:2.2423.11; p<0.001). Conclusions: We found high levels of risk perception, positive attitude, desirable knowledge as well as a high level of adopting four NPIs. The relevant knowledge, risk perception and attitude were strong predictors of adapting the four NPIs. Mask wearing, among four personal NPIs, is the most effective protective measure against COVID19 infection with added preventive effect among those who practised all or part of the other three NPIs.","output":"The Relationship Between COVID-19 Infection and Risk Perception, Knowledge, Attitude As Well As Four Non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) During the Late Period Of The COVID-19 Epidemic In China An Online Cross-sectional Survey of 8158 Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for the COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and by March 2020, it was declared a pandemic.

Methods: This hospital-based study included performed for patients presenting with unilateral or bilateral ODE at the ophthalmology outpatient department of a tertiary institute between January 2019 and December 2019. Clinical features of all ODE patients were noted. RNFL thickness was measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Cirrus 500, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). Results: Sixty-four patients with ODE were seen with female preponderance (56.2%). The mean age of presentation was 36.8  13.8 years. Bilateral ODE was seen in 57.8% patients. The most common cause of bilateral ODE was idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and vascular papillopathy. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO)-associated ODE was the most common unilateral presentation. Presenting visual acuity was best with IIH and worst with anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION). The mean duration of symptoms was maximum with intracranial space-occupying lesion associated papilloedema and minimum with AION. The mean RNFL thickness was highest in uveitis-associated ODE, followed by compressive ON, and IIH. A positive correlation was noted between clinical ODE severity and RNFL thickness.

Face masks are equipment used in healthcare by health professionals to prevent the transmission of airborne infections. As part of the social distancing efforts related to COVID-19, wearing facial masks has been practiced globally. Such practice might influence affective information communication among humans. Previous research suggests that masks disrupt expression recognition of some emotions (e.g., fear, sadness or neutrality) and lower the confidence in their identification. To extend the previous research, in the current study we tested a larger and more diverse sample of individuals and also investigated the effect of masks on perceived intensity of expressions. Moreover, for the first time in the literature we examined these questions using individuals with autistic traits. Specifically, across three experiments using different populations (college students and general population), and the 10-item Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10; lower and higher scorers), we tested the effect of facial masks on facial emotion recognition of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutrality. Results showed that the ability to identify all facial expressions decreased when faces were masked, a finding observed across all three studies, contradicting previous research on fear, sad, and neutral expressions. Participants were also less confident in their judgements for all emotions, supporting previous research; and participants perceived emotions as less expressive in the mask condition compared to the unmasked condition, a finding novel to the literature. An additional novel finding was that participants with higher scores on the AQ-10 were less accurate and less confident overall in facial expression recognition, as well as perceiving expressions as less intense.

This species is endemic to Brazil and is currently critically endangered due to its habitat destruction. The genetic basis underlying adaptive traits of New World monkeys has been a subject of interest to several investigators, with significant concern about genes related to the immune system. In the absence of a reference genome, RNA-seq and de novo transcriptome assembly have proved to be valuable genetic procedures for accessing gene sequences and testing evolutionary hypotheses. We present here a first report on the sequencing, assembly, annotation and adaptive selection analysis for thousands of transcripts of B. arachnoides from two different samples, corresponding to 13 different blood cells and fibroblasts. We assembled 284,283 transcripts with N50 of 2,940 bp, with a high rate of complete transcripts, with a median high scoring pair coverage of 88.2%, including low expressed transcripts, accounting for 72.3% of complete BUSCOs. We could predict and extract 81,400 coding sequences with 79.8% of significant BLAST hit against the Euarchontoglires SwissProt dataset. Of these 64,929 sequences, 34,084 were considered homologous to Supraprimate proteins, and of the remaining sequences (30,845), 94% were associated with a protein domain or a KEGG Orthology group, indicating potentially novel or specific protein-coding genes of B. arachnoides. We use the predicted protein sequences to perform a comparative analysis with 10 other primates. This analysis revealed, for the first time in an Atelid species, an expansion of APOBEC3G, extending this knowledge to all NWM families. Using a branch-site model, we searched for evidence of positive selection in 4,533 orthologous sets. This evolutionary analysis revealed 132 amino acid sites in 30 genes potentially evolving under positive selection, shedding light on primate genome evolution. These genes belonged to a wide variety of categories, including those encoding the innate immune system proteins (APOBEC3G, OAS2, and CEACAM1) among others related to the immune response.

Advanced cellular therapies are also investigated, thus representing an additional therapeutic tool for clinicians. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which are known for their immunoregulatory properties, may halt the induced cytokine release syndrome mediated by SARS-CoV-2, and can be considered as a potential stem cell therapy. AIM: To evaluate the immunoregulatory properties of MSCs, upon stimulation with COVID-19 patient serum. METHODS: MSCs derived from the human Whartons Jelly (WJ) tissue and bone marrow (BM) were isolated, cryopreserved, expanded, and defined according to the criteria outlined by the International Society for Cellular Therapies. Then, WJ and BM-MSCs were stimulated with a culture medium containing 15% COVID-19 patient serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine for 48 h. The quantification of interleukin (IL)-1 receptor a (Ra), IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, transforming growth factor (TGF)-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-a, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) was performed using commercial ELISA kits. The expression of HLA-G1, G5, and G7 was evaluated in unstimulated and stimulated WJ and BM-MSCs. Finally, the interactions between MSCs and patients macrophages were established using co-culture experiments. RESULTS: Thawed WJ and BM-MSCs exhibited a spindle-shaped morphology, successfully differentiated to osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes, and in flow cytometric analysis were characterized by positivity for CD73, CD90, and CD105 (> 95%) and negativity for CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR (< 2%). Moreover, stimulated WJ and BM-MSCs were characterized by increased cytoplasmic granulation, in comparison to unstimulated cells. The HLA-G isoforms (G1, G5, and G7) were successfully expressed by the unstimulated and stimulated WJ-MSCs. On the other hand, only weak expression of HLA-G1 was identified in BM-MSCs. Stimulated MSCs secreted high levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-1, FGF, VEGF, PDGF, and IDO in comparison to unstimulated cells (P < 0.05) after 12 and 24 h. Finally, macrophages derived from COVID-19 patients successfully adapted the M2 phenotype after co-culturing with stimulated WJ and BM-MSCs. CONCLUSION: WJ and BM-MSCs successfully produced high levels of immunoregulatory agents, which may efficiently modulate the over-activated immune responses of critically ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"Mesenchymal stromal cell delivery as a potential therapeutic strategy against COVID-19: Promising evidence from in vitro results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that affects the respiratory system of infected individuals.

As of 29 Sept 2020, over 235 countries, areas or territories across the globe reported a total of 33,441,919 confirmed cases, and 1,003,497 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19. Individuals of all ages are at risk for infection, but in most cases disease severity is associated with age and pre-existing diseases that compromise immunity, like cancer. Numerous reports suggest that people with cancer can be at higher risk of severe illness and related deaths from COVID-19. Therefore, managing cancer care under this pandemic is challenging and requires a collaborative multidisciplinary approach for optimal care of cancer patients in hospital settings. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients, their care, and treatment. Further, this review covers the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, genome characterization, COVID-19 pathophysiology, and associated signaling pathways in cancer, and the choice of anticancer agents as repurposed drugs for treating COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and Cancer Comorbidity: Therapeutic Opportunities and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports an error in \\"Real-time suicide mortality data from police reports in Queensland, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic: An interrupted time-series analysis\\" by Stuart Leske, Kairi Kolves, David Crompton, Ella Arensman and Diego de Leo (The Lancet Psychiatry, 2021[Jan], Vol 8[1], 58-63) In the original article, there were some errors in the Summary The updated Summary is provided (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2021-00076-024) Background: Deaths by suicide can increase during infectious disease outbreaks This study analysed suspected suicide rates in 2020 relative to 2015-19 to assess any early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland, Australia Methods: We analysed data from the interim Queensland Suicide Register (iQSR), a state-wide real-time suicide surveillance system, using an interrupted time-series design The data source for the iQSR is the Form 1 police report of a death to a coroner Two QSR staff independently classed the probability of a death by suicide as possible, probable, or beyond reasonable doubt The analysis included the probable or beyond reasonable doubt categories as suspected suicides The primary outcome was the monthly suspected suicide rate We applied Poisson and negative binomial regressions to assess whether Queensland's Public Health Emergency Declaration on Jan 29, 2020, affected suspected suicides from Feb 1 to Aug 31, 2020 Secondary outcomes included absolute or relative changes in police-reported motives of recent unemployment, financial problems, domestic violence, and relationship breakdown Findings: 3793 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14 85 deaths per 100 000 people (from Jan 1, 2015, to Jan 31, 2020) before the declaration, and 443 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14 07 deaths per 100 000 people (Feb 1, 2020, onwards) after the declaration An interrupted time-series Poisson regression model unadjusted (rate ratio [RR] 0 94, 95% CI 0 82-1 06) and adjusted for overdispersion, seasonality, and pre-exposure trends (RR 1 02, 95% CI 0 83-1 25) indicated no evidence of a change in suspected suicide rates We found no absolute or relative increases in the motives for suspected suicides, including recent unemployment, financial problems, relationship breakdown, or domestic violence from February to August, 2020, compared with the pre-exposure period Interpretation: There does not yet appear to be an overall change in the suspected suicide rate in the 7 months since Queensland declared a public health emergency Despite this, COVID-19 has contributed to some suspected suicides in Queensland Ongoing community spread and increasing death rates of COVID-19, and its impact on national economies and mental health, reinforces the need for governments to maintain the monitoring and reporting of suicide mortality in real time (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"\\"Real-time suicide mortality data from police reports in Queensland, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic: An interrupted time-series analysis\\": Correction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus outbreak in December 2019 completely changed the dynamic of consumption in different sectors of industry.

Debilitating and even deadly complications have occurred to the millions. A recent study reported 31% of right ventricular dilation in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which is significantly associated with the mortality. Therefore, we sought to search for the lines of evidence in the literature that COVID-19 may contribute to right heart dysfunction. The relevant literature and data from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, and Web of Science were searched using the MeSH terms including 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'novel coronavirus pneumonia', 'novel coronavirus', 'right heart failure', 'right heart dysfunction', 'pulmonary hypertension', 'pulmonary embolism', and various combinations. The collected literature and data were sorted and summarized. Literature reports that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host receptor mediating the cell entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Clinical and experimental evidence shows that loss of function of ACE2 aggravates pulmonary hypertension and gain of function of ACE2 exerts protection on cardiopulmonary circulation. Moreover, the patients with COVID-19 are more susceptible to pulmonary embolism and severe pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, COVID-19 may cause right heart dysfunction by inducing pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Particular attention should be paid to the function of the right heart, the overlooked chamber in COVID-19. Blood gas analysis, laboratory test of cardiac injury markers, physical examination, and echocardiography should be performed to identify right heart failure as early as possible.

Differences in adverse clinical outcomes following coronary artery bypass graft between these groups are poorly established. Therefore, a propensity matched comparison of short and longer term mortality and morbidity in insulin-controlled diabetes, tablet-controlled diabetes and non-diabetic patients was undertaken. METHODS Isolated first-time coronary artery bypass graft surgeries between April 1999 and April 2017 were propensity score matched by pre- and intra-operative variables. RESULTS 8241 patients; 23.5% diabetics and 76.5% non-diabetics. The groups' demographical and clinical characteristics were comparable after matching. Insulin-controlled diabetes patients had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (3.8% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.05), multisystem failure (2.6% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.05), sternal wound infections requiring debridement (3.6% vs. 1.3%, p < 0.05), respiratory complications (25.6% vs. 21.9%, p < 0.05), new dialysis (4.7% vs. 0.9%, p < 0.05) and longer hospital stays (13.5  13.3 vs. 10.6  8.0, p < 0.05) compared to non-diabetic patients.Tablet-controlled diabetes patients had significantly higher strokes (2.9% vs. 1.2, p < 0.05), superficial sternal wound infections (6.7% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.05), respiratory complications (25.7% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.05), new dialysis (1.7% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.05), post-operative atrial fibrillation (37.1% vs. 33.9%, p < 0.05) and readmission with myocardial infarction (22.4% vs. 19.6%, p < 0.05) compared to non-diabetic patients.

The recent development of even shorter-wavelength UV-C lamps, such as the Krypton-Chloride, 222-nm lamp, has led to greater concerns about the UV-C generation of ozone. It is well known that wavelengths below 240 nm more readily generate ozone. However, there is a great misunderstanding with regard to the actual generation and dissipation of ozone molecules by UV-C lamps. A review of this subject is much warranted.

However, methodical limitations prevent O2 measurements on the millisecond scale. To bypass the constraints of quasi-continuous recording, progressive measurements of O2 partial pressure (PO2 ) in rhythmically contracting skeletal muscle were compiled to describe the O2 kinetics surrounding and including a single muscle contraction. Phosphorescence quenching microscopy measured PO2 in the interstitium of the rat spinotrapezius muscle. Measurements were triggered by contraction-inducing electrical pulses. For the first 60 seconds, measurement preceeded stimulation. After 60, measurement followed with a progressive 20 ms increment. Thus, the first 60 measurements describe the overall PO2 response to electrical stimulation initiated after a 10 second rest period, while 61-100 (stroboscopic mode) were compiled into a single 800 ms profile of the PO2 transient surrounding muscle contraction. Thirty seconds of stimulated contractions decreased interstitial PO2 from a baseline of 71  1.4 mmHg to an \\"active\\" steady-state of 43  1.5 mmHg. The stroboscopic mode compilation revealed an unexpected post-contractile rise in PO2 as a 205 ms spike with a maximum amplitude of 58  3.8 mmHg at 68 ms, which restored 58% of the PO2 drop from baseline. Interpretation of this phenomenon is based on classical experiments by G.V. Anrep (1935), who discovered the rapid thrust of blood flow associated with muscle contraction. In addition to the metabolic implications during exercise, the physiological impact of these PO2 spikes may grow with an increased rate of rhythmical contractions in muscle or heart. NEW&NOTEWORTHY: The principal finding is a spike of interstitial PO2 , produced by a twitch in a rhythmically contracting muscle. A possible mechanism is flushing capillaries with arterial blood by mechanical forces. A technical novelty is the PO2 measurement with a \\"stroboscopic mode\\" and progressively increasing delay between stimulator pulse and PO2 measuring.

This search may well benefit from the experiences of the animal health profession in the development and use of coronavirus vaccines in domestic animal species. These animal vaccines will in no way protect humans against COVID-19 but knowledge of the difficulties encountered in vaccinating animals may help avoid or minimize similar problems arising in humans. Diverse coronaviruses can infect the domestic species from dogs and cats, to cattle and pigs to poultry. Many of these infections are controlled by the routine vaccination. Thus, canine coronavirus vaccines are protective in puppies but the disease itself is mild and self-limiting. Feline coronavirus infections may be mild or may result in a lethal immune-mediated disease C feline infectious peritonitis. As a result, vaccination of domestic cats must seek to generated protective immunity without causing immune-mediated disease. Vaccines against bovine coronavirus are widely employed in cattle where they protect against enteric and respiratory disease in young calves. Two major livestock species suffer from economically significant and severe coronavirus diseases. Thus, pigs may be infected with six different coronaviruses, one of which, porcine epidemic diarrhea, has proven difficult to control despite the development of several innovative vaccines. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus undergoes frequent genetic changes. Likewise, infectious bronchitis coronavirus causes an economically devastating disease of chickens. It too undergoes frequent genetic shifts and as a result, can only be controlled by extensive and repeated vaccination. Other issues that have been encountered in developing these animal vaccines include a relatively short duration of protective immunity, and a lack of effectiveness of inactivated vaccines.

Logistic regression analysis was used in both unmatched and propensity score-matched case-control analyses. RESULTS: No association was found between exposure to child care and COVID-19 in both unmatched (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-1.38) and matched (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.73-1.21) analyses. In matched analysis, being a home-based provider (as opposed to a center-based provider) was associated with COVID-19 (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.14-2.23) but revealed no interaction with exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Within the context of considerable infection mitigation efforts in US child care programs, exposure to child care during the early months of the US pandemic was not associated with an elevated risk for COVID-19 transmission to providers. These findings must be interpreted only within the context of background transmission rates and the considerable infection mitigation efforts implemented in child care programs.","output":"COVID-19 Transmission in US Child Care Programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of antigen compared with reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR testing in an asymptomatic athlete screening programme and to monitor infection in college athletes. METHODS: Quidel Sofia-2 SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Tests were performed daily before sports participation for football, basketball, wrestling and water polo from 29 September 2020 to 28 February 2021. Paired RT-PCR and antigen tests were performed at least once a week. Positive antigen tests were confirmed with RT-PCR. RESULTS: 81 175 antigen and 42 187 RT-PCR tests were performed, including 23 462 weekly paired antigen/RT-PCR screening tests in 1931 athletes. One hundred and seventy-two athletes had a positive screening RT-PCR (0.4%), of which 83 (48%) occurred on paired testing days. The sensitivity of antigen tests varied with the frequency of RT-PCR testing and prevalence of COVID-19. The sensitivity of antigen testing was 35.7% (95% CI: 17% to 60%) and specificity 99.8% (95% CI: 99.7% to 99.9%) with once-a-week RT-PCR testing after adjusting for school prevalence. Daily antigen testing was similar to RT-PCR testing two to three times a week in identifying infection. Antigen testing identified infection before the next scheduled PCR on 89 occasions and resulted in 234 days where potentially infectious athletes were isolated before they would have been isolated with RT-PCR testing alone. Two athletic-related outbreaks occurred; 86% of total infections were community acquired. CONCLUSION: Antigen testing has high specificity with a short turnaround time but is not as sensitive as RT-PCR. Daily antigen testing or RT-PCR testing two to three times a week is similar. There are benefits and drawbacks to each testing approach.","output":"Surveillance testing for SARS-COV-2 infection in an asymptomatic athlete population: a prospective cohort study with 123 362 tests and 23 463 paired RT-PCR/antigen samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Occupational exposure to whole-body vibration is associated with the development of musculoskeletal, neurological, and other ailments. Low back pain and other spine disorders are prevalent among those exposed to whole-body vibration in occupational and military settings. Although standards for limiting exposure to whole-body vibration have been in place for decades, there is a lack of understanding of whole-body vibration-associated risks among safety and healthcare professionals. Consequently, disorders associated with whole-body vibration exposure remain prevalent in the workforce and military. The relationship between whole-body vibration and low back pain in humans has been established largely through cohort studies, for which vibration inputs that lead to symptoms are rarely, if ever, quantified. This gap in knowledge highlights the need for the development of relevant in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models to study such pathologies. The parameters of vibrational stimuli (eg, frequency and direction) play critical roles in such pathologies, but the specific cause-and-effect relationships between whole-body vibration and spinal pathologies remain mostly unknown. This paper provides a summary of whole-body vibration parameters; reviews in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models for spinal pathologies resulting from whole-body vibration; and offers suggestions to address the gaps in translating injury biomechanics data to inform clinical practice.","output":"Deleterious effects of whole-body vibration on the spine: A review of in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, divergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages have emerged continuously, mostly through the genomic accumulation of substitutions.

The cross-reactivity test was performed with 17 positive samples for other respiratory viruses, and the sensibility test was performed with 8 dilutions (10 based) of SARS-CoV-2 isolated and 63 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. The SYBR Green assays and conventional RT-PCR have not shown amplification of the 17 respiratory samples positives for other viruses. The SYBR Green-based assay was able to detect all 8 dilutions of the isolate. The conventional PCR detected until 107 dilution, both assays detected the majority of the 63 samples, 98.42% of positivity in SYBR Green, and 93% in conventional PCR. The average Ct variation between SYBR Green and TaqMan was 1.92 and the highest Ct detected by conventional PCR was 35.98.

It occurs mostly in people aged 40-50 years and 90% of the patients are female. FNH can be cured by local resection. How to locate and judge the tumor boundary in real time is often a challenge for surgeons. AIM To summarize the technique and feasibility of robotic resection of FNH guided by indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. METHODS The demographics and perioperative outcomes of a consecutive series of patients who underwent robotic resection of liver FNH guided by ICG fluorescence imaging between May 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. ICG was injected through the median elbow vein in all the patients at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg 48 h before the operation. During the operation, the position of FNH in the liver was located in the fluorescence mode of the Da Vinci Si robot operating system and the tumor boundary was determined during the resection. RESULTS Among the 23 patients, there were 11 males and 12 females, with a mean age of 30.5  9.3 years. Twenty-two cases completed robotic resection, while one (4.3%) case converted to open surgery. In the robotic surgery group, the operation time was 35-340 min with a median of 120 min, the intraoperative bleeding was 10-800 mL with a median of 50 mL, and the postoperative hospital stay was 1-7 d with a median of 4 d. Biliary fistula occurred in two (8.7%) patients after robotic operation and they both recovered after conservative treatment. One (4.3%) patient received blood transfusion and there was no death in this study. The postoperative hospital stay in the small tumor group was significantly shorter than that in the large tumor group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION ICG fluorescence imaging can guide the surgeon to perform robotic resection of liver FNH by locating the tumor and displaying the tumor boundary in real time. It is a safe and feasible method to ensure the complete resection of the tumor.","output":"Robotic resection of liver focal nodal hyperplasia guided by indocyanine green fluorescence imaging: A preliminary analysis of 23 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: EMA decided that with ulipristal acetate (UPA) treatment for uterine fibroids, should be discontinued due to the associated risk of hepatic failure, We analyzed whether the risk of recurrent symptoms due to fibroids may lead to an increased risk of Covid -19 infection and death, that would exceed the former risk of hepatic failure and transplantation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We used a Markov model to generate probabilities. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: There are currently about 36250 treated patients in Europe. We estimated bleeding probabilities, while using or discontinuing UPA, which may induce a need of medical or surgical management in symptomatic patients, and increase the risk of acquiring a Covid-19 infection, and die from it. We also estimated the risk of suffering a hepatic failure and hepatic transplantation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Based on our assumptions, ceasing UPA during a Covid 19 pandemic may be associated with a fatality ratio between 4 and 18, due to the Pandemic, whereas pursuing UPA would be associated with a fatality rate due to the pandemic between 1-2, and an added fatality rate due to hepatic impairment of 1. The added risk of stopping UPA may range between 2 and 15 additional deaths. Our calculations suggest that the decision to stop UPA in the middle of the Covid- 19 pandemic may be untimely, since it may result in an increased risk of Covid-19 infection, due to the recurrence of symptoms and the need for medical and surgical treatment.

To combat the pandemic, multiple types of vaccines are under development with unprecedented rapidity. Theoretically, future vaccination against COVID-19 may fall into long-term costly guerrilla warfare between SARS-CoV-2 and humans. Elimination of SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination to avoid the potential long-term costly guerrilla warfare, if possible, is highly desired and worth intensive consideration. Human influenza pandemics emerging in 1957, 1968, and 2009 established strong global herd immunity and led to the elimination of three human influenza viruses, which circulated worldwide for years before the pandemics. Moreover, both clade 7.2 of subtype H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and subtype H7N9 avian influenza virus circulated in poultry in China for years, and they have been virtually eliminated through mass vaccination in recent years. These facts suggest that the rapid establishment of global herd immunity through mass vaccination using an appropriate vaccine could eliminate SARS-CoV-2. The coming 2 years are a golden time for elimination through vaccination, which requires tremendous national and international collaboration. This review also prioritizes the efficacy of vaccines for COVID-19 and elucidates the importance of the development of more live vaccines for COVID-19.","output":"Potential for elimination of SAR-CoV-2 through vaccination as inspired by elimination of multiple influenza viruses through natural pandemics or mass vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is commonly targeted to achieve glycemic control and has potent anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. Recent structural analyses indicated a potential tight interaction between DPP4 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), raising a promising hypothesis that DPP4 inhibitor (DPP4i) drugs might be an optimal strategy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients with diabetes. However, there has been no direct clinical evidence illuminating the associations between DPP4i use and COVID-19 outcomes. AIM: To illuminate the associations between DPP4i usage and the adverse outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis including 2563 patients with type 2 diabetes who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 at 16 hospitals in Hubei Province, China. After excluding ineligible individuals, 142 patients who received DPP4i drugs and 1115 patients who received non-DPP4i oral anti-diabetic drugs were included in the subsequent analysis. We performed a strict propensity score matching (PSM) analysis where age, sex, comorbidities, number of oral hypoglycemic agents, heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) < 95%, CT diagnosed bilateral lung lesions, laboratory indicators, and proportion of insulin usage were matched. Finally, 111 participants treated with DPP4i drugs were successfully matched to 333 non-DPP4i users. Then, a linear logistic model and mixed-effect Cox model were applied to analyze the associations between in-hospital DPP4i use and adverse outcomes of COVID-19. RESULTS: After rigorous matching and further adjustments for imbalanced variables in the linear logistic model and Cox adjusted model, we found that there was no significant association between in-hospital DPP4i use (DPP4i group) and 28-d all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.09-2.11, P = 0.31). Likewise, the incidences and risks of secondary outcomes, including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute organ (kidney, liver, and cardiac) injuries, were also comparable between the DPP4i and non-DPP4i groups. The performance of DPP4i agents in achieving glucose control (e.g., the median level of fasting blood glucose and random blood glucose) and inflammatory regulation was approximately equivalent in the DPP4i and non-DPP4i groups. Furthermore, we did not observe substantial side effects such as uncontrolled glycemia or acidosis due to DPP4i application relative to the use of non-DPP4i agents in the study cohort. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that DPP4i use is not significantly associated with poor outcomes of COVID-19 or other adverse effects of anti-diabetic treatment. The data support the continuation of DPP4i agents for diabetes management in the setting of COVID-19.","output":"No significant association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and adverse outcomes of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: The study attempts to analyse whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected the incidence of forearm, arm, and hip fractures during a 1-year observation period. Additionally, changes in the overall treatment costs of those fractures were estimated. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of forearm, arm, and hip fractures remained statistically unchanged, neither were any significant changes observed in the expenditure, incurred for the treatment of the fracture cases. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to find out and evaluate if the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic (including lockdown and the fear of infection) influenced the incidence of osteoporotic forearm, arm, and hip fractures and to estimate the changes in the costs of their management during one-year observation period. METHODS: The incidence of forearm, arm, and hip fractures was collected for the population, aged  50, residing at the district of Tarnowskie Gry and the Town of Piekary ?l?skie, Poland, during 1 year of COVID-19 pandemic (from March 16th 2020 to March 15th 2021). The obtained results were compared with the number of corresponding limb fractures, recorded before the pandemic during five consecutive yearly periods, each starting from 16th March and ending on the 15th March of a subsequent year, the entire period covering the years 2015C2020. The rates of the analysed fractures were calculated per 100,000 inhabitants together with their economic impact. RESULTS: The mean numbers and the incidence rates of upper extremity fractures were slightly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the previous 5 years, whereas hip fracture figures remained almost stable. The observed changes were not statistically significant. That annual observation revealed a slight decrease in expenditure volumes, when compared to the analysed period before the pandemic (?0.33%). CONCLUSION: The decreased incidence rate of forearm, arm, and hip fractures, observed during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, was not statistically significant in the 1-year observation. After several weeks/months under the shock, caused by government limitations and the fear of infection, the number of patients remained unchanged during the one-year observation.","output":"One year of the COVID-19 pandemic in PolandCthe incidence of osteoporotic forearm, arm, and hip fractures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is escalating all over the world and has higher morbidities and mortalities in certain vulnerable populations.

In the pre-vaccination period (the year 2020), this country accumulated 169 321 cases and 2185 deaths. Methods: To describe the clinical presentations at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19 in Costa Rica during the pre-vaccination period, we implemented a symptom-based clustering using machine learning to identify clusters or clinical profiles among 18 974 records of positive cases. Profiles were compared based on symptoms, risk factors, viral load, and genomic features of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. Results: A total of seven COVID-19 clinical profiles were identified, which were characterized by a specific composition of symptoms. In the comparison between clusters, a lower viral load was found for the asymptomatic group, while the risk factors and the SARS-CoV-2 genomic features were distributed among all the clusters. No other distribution patterns were found for age, sex, vital status, and hospitalization. Conclusion: During the pre-vaccination time in Costa Rica, the clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19 were described in seven profiles. The host co-morbidities and the SARS-CoV-2 genotypes are not specific of a particular profile, rather they are present in all the groups, including asymptomatic cases.

No country has been deprived of this viral genomic contamination wherever populaces reside and are interconnected. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of this viral genome. The analysis aids the study of the outbreak of this Virus towards the other parts of the continent and the world. The parameters such as population mobility, natural history, epidemiological characteristics, and the transmission mechanism towards viral spread when considered into crowd dynamism result in improved estimation. This article studies the impact of time on the amount of susceptible, exposed, the infected person taking into account asymptomatic and symptomatic ones; recovered i.e., removed from this model and the virus particles existing in the open surfaces. The transition from stable phase to attractor phase happens after 13 days i.e.; it takes nearly a fortnight for the spread to randomize among people. Further, the pandemic transmission remains in the attractor phase for a very long time if no control measures are taken up. The attractor-source phase continues up to 385 days i.e., more than a year, and perhaps stabilizes on 386th day as per the Lyapunov exponent's analysis. The time series helps to know the period of the Virus's survival in the open sources i.e. markets, open spaces and various other carriers of the Virus if not quarantined or sanitized. The Virus cease to exist in around 60 days if it does not find any carrier or infect more places, people etc. The changes in LCEs of all variables as time progresses for around 400 days have been forecasted. It can be observed that phase trajectories indicate how the two variables interact with each other and affect the overall system's dynamics. It has been observed that for exposed and asymptomatically infected (y-z), as exposed ones (y) change from 0 to 100 the value of asymptomatically infected (z) increased upto around 58, at exposed ones (y)=100, asymptomatically infected (z) has two values as 58 and 10 i.e. follows bifurcation and as exposed ones (y) changes values upto 180, the value of asymptomatically infected (z) decreases to 25 so for exposed ones (y) from 100 to 180, asymptomatically infected (z) varies from 58 to 25 to 10 follows bifurcation. Also, phase structures of exposed-symptomatically infected (y-u), exposed-removed (y-v), exposed-virus in the reservoir (y-w), asymptomatically infected-removed (z-v), symptomatically infected-removed (u-v) specifically depict bifurcations in various forms at different points. In case of asymptomatically infected-virus in the reservoir (z-w), at asymptomatically infected (z)=10, the value of viruses in the reservoir (w)=50, then as asymptomatically infected (z) increases to upto around 60. At this point, removed ones (v) increase from 50 to 70 and asymptomatically infected (z) decrease to 20 i.e., crosses the same value twice, which shows its limiting is known as limit cycle behavior and both the values tend to decrease towards zero.

We conducted this survey to document the number of surgeries performed on COVID-19-positive patients during the ongoing pandemic at a tertiary care center in Pakistan. Materials and methods A retrospective clinical audit was conducted in a tertiary care hospital that receives surgical cases from almost all over the country. Ethical approval was granted prior to the execution of this intra-departmental audit. Both patients who were admitted to general surgery and visited on a consultative basis in other departments during the year 2020 were evaluated, and only those having COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive were included. Those with PCR-negative were omitted from the analysis. All the surgical procedures performed in these patients, along with those managed conservatively, were analyzed. Basic and demographic data of all patients were collected from electronic medical records. The data were defined as either mean and standard deviation or frequency and relative percentages. The normality of the data was verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Parametric analysis was used to interpret the disparity in descriptive statistics. Although the categorical results were compared by cross-tabulation, the degrees of significance were calculated either by chi-square test or Fisher's exact test according to the distribution of the data. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant (two-tailed). Results A total of 79 COVID-19-positive patients were provided with surgical services and subsequently analyzed. The mean age of those patients was 48.88  16.62 years. The mean length of stay in the hospital was 2.10  3.52 with indifference among gender and mode of treatment (either surgical or conservative). The study participants were 59.5% males and 40.5% females, and only 6.3% had a past surgical history. Most patients were admitted through the outpatient department (65.8%), and only a few were referrals from other departments (10.1%); 64.5% of patients were managed in general wards, 24.0% in critical care units, and 11.4% in intensive care units. Surgical intervention was done in 60.8% of the COVID-19-positive patients, while the rest 39.2% were conservatively managed. Among whom, 63.3% were discharged, 29.1% of them left against medical advice (LAMA), with a 7.6% death rate during the hospital stay. The frequent comorbidities were diabetes (27.8%) and hypertension (26.6%), although most patients had no comorbidities (49.3%).

In this study, researchers aimed to enrich the information processing literature by focusing on the uses and gratifications of 360-degree VR videos during the pandemic. Through employing survey research with 1422 participants located in the U.S. and structural equation modeling for data analysis, this study found that five types of gratification, including utilitarian (i.e., navigation), hedonic (i.e., enjoyment), sensual (i.e., realism), social (i.e., community), and symbolic (i.e., coolness), significantly motivated users to use such immersive videos. Simultaneously, data demonstrated that these five types of gratification could influence users cognitive engagement with virtual content. In addition, such VR engagement facilitated users positive attitudes toward immersive videos and continued usage of them. The findings provided practical implications for COVID-19 global recovery as well.","output":"Shared Virtual Reality Experiences during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Gratifications and Effects of Engagement with Immersive Videos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine the role played by the COVID\\\\19 infection in patients' death and to determine the proportion of patients for whom it was a major contributor to death. METHODS: We included patients 50 years old who were hospitalized with COVID\\\\19 infection and died between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 in a tertiary medical center. We considered COVID\\\\19 infection to be a major cause for death if the patient had well\\\\controlled medical conditions and death was improbable without coronavirus infection, and a minor cause for death if the patient had serious illnesses and had an indication for palliative care. RESULTS: Among 243 patients, median age was 80 (interquartile intervals: 72C86) and 40% were female. One in two had moderate or severe frailty and 41% had dementia. Nearly 60% of the patients were classified as having advanced, serious illnesses present prior to the hospitalization, with death being expected within 12 months, and among this group 39% were full code at admission. In the remaining 40% of patients, deaths were classified as unexpected based on patients' prior conditions, suggesting that COVID\\\\19 infection complications were the primary contributor to death. CONCLUSIONS: For slightly less than half (40%) of patients who died of complications of COVID\\\\19, death was an unexpected event.

In preparation for the management of health care personnel that are likely to be infected, we looked in to the data collected during the Influenza pandemic in 2009, caused by a novel strain of H1N1 influenza called swine flu. The care of healthcare personnel in our institution, who had an acute febrile respiratory illness (AFRI) during that period was routed through a single channel using a uniform protocol. We retrospectively analysed the available data, during the initial four months of the pandemic, to draw lessons from it. Objective: To study the prevalence, clinical profile and risk factors of swine flu among health care personnel during the pandemic of 2009 in a tertiary care hospital in South India. Methodology: This retrospective study enrolled all the health care personnel including students of a tertiary care institution in South India, who presented with an AFRI between June to August, the initial four months of the swine flu pandemic of 2009. The clinical profile and risk factors were extracted. The results of the RT PCR for swine flu was obtained. Prevalence in each demographic group was calculated and compared. Characteristics of those with swine flu were compared with those who turned negative for the swine flu. Results: The prevalence of all AFRI and only swine flu among health care personnel during the study period was 18 per thousand and 8.7 per thousand respectively. Highest prevalence of swine flu was found among students and office staff. After adjusting for confounding factors, hyperthermia at presentation was significantly higher {OR = 1.97; 95% CI (1.01C3.76)} among those who tested positive for swine flu as compared with those with other AFRI's. Only 2.5% of the entire AFRI group required admission and there was no mortality. Conclusion: Health care personnel are at increased risk of acquiring infection. Our study demonstrated that students and office staff were the most susceptible. Unprotected exposure to unknown infectious patients and relatives is likely to have been an important factor. Though the mode of transmission is similar, compared to H1N1, COVID-19 is associated with different comorbidities and has significantly higher mortality. Therefore, in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic, the personal protective equipment of the healthcare personnel need to be escalated.","output":"Lessons from healthcare personnel screening and management during H1N1 pandemic in preparation for the impending COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Undernutrition is associated with gut microbiota unbalance, and probiotics are believed to restore it and improve gut integrity.

However, the active ingredients in FA and the potential mechanisms of its therapeutic effects have not been fully explored. Here, we applied a network pharmacology approach to explore the potential mechanisms of FA. We identified 5 active compounds from FA and a total of 209 potential targets to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PTGS2), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), cell division protein kinase 6 (CDK6), caspase 3 (CASP3), apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (Bcl-2), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) were identified as key targets of FA in the treatment of multiple diseases. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment demonstrated that FA was highly related to transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter, DNA-templated transcription, positive regulation of transcription, regulation of apoptosis process, and regulation of cell proliferation. Various signaling pathways involved in the treatment of FA were identified, including pathways in cancer and pathways specifically related to prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, PI3K-Akt, apoptosis, and non-small-cell lung cancer. TP53, AKT1, caspase 3, MAPK3, PTGS2, and BAX/BCL2 were related key targets in the identified enriched pathways and the PPI network. In addition, our molecular docking results showed that the bioactive compounds in FA can tightly bind to most target proteins.

This study evaluated the measurement properties of FLU-PRO Plus in a study enrolling individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Data from a prospective cohort study (EPICC) in US Military Health System beneficiaries evaluated for COVID-19 was utilized. Adults with symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with FLU-PRO Plus survey information within 1 week of symptom onset were included. Reliability of FLU-PRO Plus was estimated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC; 2 days' reproducibility). Known-groups validity was assessed using patient global assessment (PGA) of disease severity. Patient report of return to usual health was used to assess responsiveness (day 1-6/7). Results Two hundred twenty-six SARS-CoV-2-positive participants were included in the analysis. Reliability among those who reported no change in their symptoms from one day to the next was high for most domains (ICC range, 0.68-0.94 for day 1 to day 2). Construct validity was demonstrated by moderate to high correlation between the PGA rating of disease severity and domain and total scores (eg, total scores correlation: 0.69 [influenza-like illness severity], 0.69 [interference in daily activities], and -0.58 [physical health]). In addition, FLU-PRO Plus demonstrated good known-groups validity, with increasing domain and total scores observed with increasing severity ratings.

These cases where findings overlap with cancer pose a significant dilemma for diagnostic purposes, follow-up, and management leading to possible treatment delays, unnecessary repeat imaging and sampling, and patient anxiety. These cases can largely be avoided by optimal coordination between vaccination and planned imaging as well as preemptive selection of vaccine administration site.

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children (MIS-C), with symptoms similar to Kawasaki syndrome, was described in young minors testing positive for COVID-19. The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined MIS-C as occurring in <21-year-olds, triggering hundreds of PubMed-listed papers. However, postpubertal adolescents are no longer children biologically; the term MIS-C is misleading. Furthermore, MIS also occurs in adults, termed MIS-A by the CDC. Acute and delayed inflammations can be triggered by COVID-19. The 18th birthday is an administrative not a biological age limit, whereas the body matures slowly during puberty. This blur in defining children leads to confusion regarding MIS-C/MIS-A. United States and European Union (EU) drug approval is handled separately for children, defined as <18-year-olds, ascribing non-existent physical characteristics up to the 18th birthday.

However, these patients may experience physical dysfunction to limit their access during conventional rehabilitation after total knee replacement. The use of telemedicine may be the promising solution. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of telerehabilitation with conventional in-person rehabilitation in patients who underwent a total knee replacement. METHODS: For this systematic review on randomized controlled trials, PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect and CINAHL databases were searched for eligible articles published between 1 January 2003 and 28 February 2022. The eligibility criteria were patients who underwent total knee replacement, randomized controlled trials and publications in English. The main outcome measures were focused on pain and physical function. Reference lists of relevant studies were also manually checked to find additional studies. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection separately. PEDro scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the included randomized controlled trials. A meta-analysis was performed on the collected data. Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.3) was used for all analyses. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies met the eligibility criteria and included 1825 participants in the systematic review. Overall, the results revealed that the effectiveness of telerehabilitation is comparable to conventional in-person rehabilitation in improving various pain and functional outcomes in patients who underwent a total knee replacement. In the meta-analysis with the fixed-effects model, no significant difference was found in the improvement of pain and physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis compared with conventional rehabilitation (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) -0.15, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.16, P = 0.34 and SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.12, P = 0.62, respectively). In addition, the utilization of hospital resources and costs were significantly lower in telerehabilitation when compared with in-person rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Telerehabilitation was comparable to conventional in-person rehabilitation in improving clinical outcomes following total knee replacement.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the associated factors that limit the youths' practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 in the study area. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. The study used a quantitative approach for collecting data from 384 youths using a survey method. Not practicing preventive measures was measured to determine whether or not youths applied hygiene practices, kept their distance, restricted their movements, and sought self-help or support in the past two months. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the distribution of study participants, and a binary regression model was executed to examine the association factors with inability to practice preventive measures with a p-value < 0.05 statistically significant. RESULTS: Male youths (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.16) were less likely to practice preventive measures. Older youth (AOR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.56), with higher education level (AOR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06), and who had higher income (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.78) were more likely to practice preventive measures.

However, a comprehensive assessment of how walking speed affects accelerometer based quantitative and qualitive gait measures in younger and older adults is lacking. RESEARCH QUESTION What is the relationship between walking speed and quantitative and qualitive gait outcomes in younger and older adults? METHODS Younger (n = 27, age: 21.6) and older participants (n = 27, age: 69.5) completed 340 steps on a treadmill at speeds of 0.70 to a maximum of 1.75 ms-1. We used generalized additive mixed models to determine the relationship between walking speed and quantitative (stride length, stride time, stride frequency and their variability) and qualitive (stride regularity, stability, smoothness, symmetry, synchronization, predictability) gait measures extracted from trunk accelerations. RESULTS The type of relationship between walking speed and the majority of gait measures (quantitative and qualitative) was characterized as logarithmic, with more prominent speed-effects at speeds below 1.20 ms-1. Changes in quantitative measures included shorter strides, longer stride times, and a lower stride frequency, with more variability at lower speeds independent of age. For qualitative measures, we found a decrease in gait symmetry, stability and regularity in all directions with decreasing speeds, a decrease in gait predictability (Vertical, V, anterior-posterior, AP) and stronger gait synchronization (AP-mediolateral, ML, AP-V), and direction dependent effects of gait smoothness, which decreased in V direction, but increased in AP and ML directions with decreasing speeds. We found outcome-dependent effects of age on the quantitative and qualitative gait measures, with either no differences between age-groups, age-related differences that existed regardless of speed, and age-related differences in the type of relationship with walking speed.

However, in COVID-19 pandemic, whether MOH patients would have greater physical and mental symptom deterioration or worse relief of headache symptoms and medications overuse remained unclear. We aim to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on MOH patients to guide for a better management in this study. METHODS: We enrolled MOH patients who were diagnosed and treated at headache clinic of West China Hospital. Information of the pre-pandemic 3 months period and COVID-19 pandemic period was collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify independent factors associated with changes in headache symptoms and drug withdrawal. RESULTS: Seventy-eight MOH patients were enrolled into the study ultimately. In comparison to pre-pandemic period, fewer MOH patients reported decreased headache days, intensity and days with acute medications per month during the pandemic. Available access to regular prophylactic medications was significantly associated with a reduction of at least 50% in headache days and decrease in headache intensity per month with respective odds ratios of 39.19 (95% CI 3.75-409.15, P = 0.002) and 10.13 (95% CI 2.33-44.12, P = 0.002).

Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in infected patients are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: To summarize retrospectively the skin features of COVID-19 infection and to analyze the skin rash incidence rate, clinical onset time, cutaneous manifestations, pathological characteristics and relationship with the novel coronavirus pneumonia severity. METHODS: The literature up to Sep 20, 2020, were searched and analyzed. Information on clinical features including skin manifestations, disease severity, stage and onset day, and cutaneous pathological characteristics was extracted. Data were analyzed using descriptive non-parametric statistics. For categorical data, the number and percentage of patients are presented. A Spearman correlation test was used to analyze the associations between rash type, rash onset and severity of COVID-19. All statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS software (version 20) using two-tailed tests. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Twenty-three cases of COVID-19 patients with cutaneous manifestations from seven reports were collected. Inflammatory dermatosis, skin vasculitis and vascular dermatosis were the main lesion types of COVID-19 patients. Microvascular and endothelial cell injury, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, thrombosis, extremely dilated vessels and prominent deposits of C5b-9 were the main dermatologic pathological changes. The onset day analysis showed that out of 19 patients, 63.2% of cutaneous manifestations were within 10 days, 21.1% in 10C20 days and 15.8% were 20 days after the time the patient presented with COVID-19 main symptoms.

Individuals are considered eligible for lung cancer screening if they meet specific high-risk criteria, such as age and smoking history. Population groups that are at highest risk of lung cancer, and therefore, the target of lung cancer screening interventions, are also the least likely to participate in lung cancer screening. This can lead to a widening of health inequities. Deliberate effort is needed to both reduce lung cancer risk (through upstream interventions that promote smoking cessation) as well as midstream interventions that promote equitable access to lung cancer screening. METHODS: This protocol paper describes an equity-informed patient-oriented research study. Our study aims to promote equitable access to lung cancer screening by partnering with patients to co-design an e-learning module for healthcare providers. The learning module will describe the social context of lung cancer risk and promote access to lung cancer screening by increasing equity at the point of care. We have applied the Generative Co-Design Framework for Healthcare Innovation and detail our study processes in three phases and six steps: Pre-design (establishing a study governance structure); Co-design (identifying research priorities, gathering and interpreting data, co-developing module content); and Post-design (pilot testing the module and developing an implementation plan). DISCUSSION: Patient engagement in research can promote the design and delivery of healthcare services that are accessible and acceptable to patients. This is particularly important for lung cancer screening as those at highest risk of developing lung cancer are also those who are least likely to participate in lung cancer screening. By detailing the steps of our participatory co-design journey, we are making visible the processes of our work so that they can be linked to future outcomes and related impact, and inform a wide range of patient co-led processes.","output":"Toward equity-oriented cancer care: a Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) protocol to promote equitable access to lung cancer screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more 176 million cases and around 3.82 million deaths worldwide.

The drug interventions considered here include Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the first BCG vaccine dose, and a booster dose of BCG administered at a later stage. In this work, we consider two scenarios involving the administration of these interventions. The findings of these studies include the following: the average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when both the HCQ and BCG interventions were applied together in both scenarios. On the other hand, the average susceptible cell count decreased the best when HCQ alone was administered in both these scenarios. From the comparative effectiveness study it was observed that the basic reproduction number and viral count decreased the best when HCQ and BCG booster interventions were applied together, reinstating the fact obtained earlier in the optimal control setting.

Further, colistin has been also used to prevent and treat Enterobacteriaceae infections in food animals. However, chromosomal mutations and mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes, which confer resistance to colistin, have been detected in bacterial isolates from food animals and humans worldwide; thus, limiting the use of colistin. Therefore, strategies that could aid in ameliorating colistin resistance are critically needed. Objective Investigate the adjuvant potential of novel small molecules (SMs) on colistin. Materials and Methods Previously, we identified 11 membrane-affecting SMs with bactericidal activity against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). Here, we investigated the potentiation effect of those SMs on colistin using checkerboard assays and wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larval model. The impact of the SM combination on colistin resistance evolution was also investigated by analyzing whole genome sequences of APEC isolates passaged with colistin alone or in combination with SMs followed by quantitating pmrCAB and pmrH expression in those isolates. Results The SM combination synergistically reduced the minimum bactericidal concentration of colistin by at least 10-fold. In larvae, the SM combination increased the efficacy of colistin by two-fold with enhanced (>50%) survival and reduced (>4 logs) APEC load. Further, the SM combination decreased the frequency (5/6 to 1/6) of colistin resistance evolution and downregulated the pmrCAB and pmrH expression. Previously unknown mutations in pmrB (L14Q, T92P) and pmrA (A80V), which were predicted deleterious, were identified in the colistin-resistant (ColR) APEC isolates when passaged with colistin alone but not in combination with SMs. Our study also identified mutations in hypothetical and several phage-related proteins in ColR APEC isolates in concurrent with pmrAB mutations. Conclusion Our study identified two SMs (SM2 and SM3) that potentiated the colistin activity and attenuated the development of colistin resistance in APEC. These SMs can be developed as anti-evolution drugs that can slow down colistin resistance development.","output":"Small Molecule Adjuvants Potentiate Colistin Activity and Attenuate Resistance Development in Escherichia coli by Affecting pmrAB System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic originated in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization to declare an official global COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.

This study examined how changes in pediatric ED visits during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic differed by two markers of socioeconomic disadvantage: minoritized race (MR) (compared with non-Hispanic White [NHW]), and publicly insured (compared with privately insured). METHODS: This study used electronic medical records from a large pediatric ED for the period January to June 2020. Three time periods in 2020 were compared with corresponding time periods in 2019. Changes in overall visits, visits for MR versus NHW children, and Medicaid-enrolled versus privately insured children were considered, and changes in the acuity mix of ED visits and share of visits resulting in inpatient admits were inspected. RESULTS: Compared with 2019, total ED visits declined in time period (TP) 1 and TP2 of 2020 (54.3%, 48.9%). Declines were larger for MR children (57.3%, 57.8%) compared with NHW children (50.5%, 39.3%), and Medicaid enrollees (56.5%, 52.0%) compared with privately insured (48.3%, 39.0%). The MR children group experienced steeper percentage declines in high-acuity visits and visits, resulting in inpatient admissions compared with NHW children. In contrast, there was little evidence of difference between TP0s of 2019 and 2020.

It has spread to more than 200 countries and regions around the world. At present, the global pandemic continues to rise and continues to spread worldwide. It is necessary to explore the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19 as soon as possible. Remdesiviras was an antiviral agent with therapeutic potential, but it was still controversial. Objective: Through systematic review and meta-analysis, to evaluate the effect and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, and will provide a reliable reference for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: We used the following search string: \\"COVID-19\\" [Mesh], \\"remdesivir\\" [Mesh], \\"randomized controlled trial\\" [Mesh]. We used the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and corresponding keywords to make the search strategy. We searched six databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinical trials.gov and chictr.org.cn. Data analyses were conducted by using the software Review Manager 5.3 and STATA version 14.0. Results: Our systematic search identified 5 meta-analyses of RCTs, including 1782 patients with COVID-19.The clinical improvement of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 was superior to the placebo-controlled group (relative risk (RR) =1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-1.29, p= 0.0009). The following are the Single-Arm Study, Meta-analysis results. The pooled prevalence of clinical improvement significant findings was 62% (95% CI = 59-65%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir. The incidence rates of Acute kidney injury ,Hepatic enzyme increased , Any serious adverse event were 5% (95%CI=3-7%, p=0.00), 11%(95%CI=5-16%, p=0.00), 22%(95%CI=18-27%, p =0.00), respectively, and the mortality was 13%(95%CI=8-19%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir. Conclusion: This analysis confirms that remdesivir is effective in the clinical improvement of COVID-19 patients, and the rate of clinical improvement was 62%. In addition, adverse events and mortality should also be paid attention to. Future research should aim that more large-scale studies were needed to confirm the results, to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms.","output":"The efficacy and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health information technology offers a powerful tool to monitor the performance of a healthcare system. Advances in computer technology and capacity combined with lower start-up costs will allow developing countries to achieve greater impact when they initiate electronic health information systems. We focused on the integrated health information system that was established in Taiwan in conjunction with the launch of the National Health Insurance (NHI) programme. We used data from that health information system to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of chemotherapy use among breast cancer patients. We then used this analysis to discuss what policy makers can learn from this type of analysis. We identified a cohort of patients in the NHI Research Database who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001 and had received chemotherapy following surgical removal of the tumour. We followed these patients for 3 years and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the payer's perspective. Using the net benefit regression approach, we compared the cost effectiveness of the two most commonly prescribed first-line chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of breast cancer in 2001 in Taiwan. The dependent variable of the regression model was the individual-level net benefit, and the independent variables included a binary variable indicating the choice of chemotherapy regimen, the patients' age, co-morbidity, type of surgery, geographic region and type of treatment facility. We employed both frequentist and Bayesian approaches in our net benefit regression analyses. In the Bayesian analysis, we applied non-informative priors to all parameters in the base-case analyses. We then explored the use of informative priors in the sensitivity analysis, using cost-effectiveness data published in the literature to form the prior distributions for the relevant parameters. Over 60% of surgically treated breast cancer patients received either CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) or CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, fluorouracil). A comparison of patient characteristics indicated that patients in the CEF group tended to be younger (47.8 vs 49.1 years; p = 0.016), and were significantly more likely to have undergone a mastectomy (84% vs 76%; p < 0.001) and to have been treated in a teaching hospital (26% vs 13%; p < 0.001). We also observed significant variations in geographic region of the location of facilities between treatment groups. On average, CEF was not cost effective in the treatment of patients with breast cancer in Taiwan, although analyses stratified by geographic region suggested a wide variation across regions. At a societal willingness to pay (WTP) of new Taiwanese dollar ($NT)1 500 000 ($US80 000), the probability that CEF was more cost effective than CMF was 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 3.9% for the Taipei metropolitan area, and the north, middle and the combined south and east region, respectively; the probability became 0.6%, 0.0%, 1.3% and 54.5%, respectively, at a WTP of $NT5 000 000 ($US270 000). After co-variate adjustments, the probabilities were 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 0.8%, respectively at a WTP of $NT1 500 000, and were 0.0%, 0.0%, 1.4% and 34.7% at $NT5 000 000. Sensitivity analyses showed that CEF potentially could have been more cost effective than CMF within a reasonable range of societal WTP (i.e. $NT1 000 000-3 000 000 or $US55 000-160 000) had the optimal dosage level for CEF been established for breast cancer patients in Taiwan. A population-based, fully integrated electronic health information system provides useful data to assess the cost effectiveness of competing treatments and interventions in current practice. This research may potentially inform policy makers of modifications that can be instituted to improve the cost effectiveness of a new therapy. However, findings from this study need to be interpreted with caution because the study provided information only on the short-term cost effectiveness (i.e. 3 years) of CEF compared with CMF. It is possible that a future analysis will reach a different conclusion when more years of follow-up data become available.","output":"Information technology facilitates cost-effectiveness analysis in developing countries: an observational study of breast cancer chemotherapy in Taiwan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, American medical schools made swift changes to clinical education based on guidelines provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges. The purpose of this study was to collect medical student perceptions of the solely online learning environment, their quality of life (QoL), and the pandemic response by their School of Medicine (SoM) to provide suggestions to inform medical schools' responses during the continuation of this pandemic and the next. Methods: Between April 29, 2020 and May 16, 2020, the authors distributed a 60-item questionnaire that assessed demographics, learning environment, QoL, and the SoM response. Likert-type items were analyzed on an item-by-item basis, whereas themes were identified for open-ended questions. Results: A total of 330 medical students (of 632; 52.2%) responded. Those who responded had positive perceptions of the online learning environment with moderate QoL disruptions to concentration and sleep. Although most students perceived being able to contribute meaningfully to the healthcare setting, they viewed themselves as underutilized. Three themes encapsulated both positive and negative perceptions of the SoM's response-communication, learning environment, and empathy and support. Conclusion: These findings provide insight into medical student perceptions of their learning environment and QoL as they acclimated to changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Results can help inform a SoM's response during the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as during future pandemics or crises.

However, there is currently no consensus on the incidence of cardiac injury and its associated prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies that evaluated cardiac injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Demographic information, co-morbidities, and relevant laboratory values were extracted and a meta-analysis was performed. Results: Ten studies with 1637 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The overall incidence of cardiac injury was 23.2% (380/1637) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence was higher (58.5%) in patients who were critically ill, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or died. The composite mortality rate of patients with cardiac injury was 75.1% (251/334). Cardiac injury was significantly associated with increased mortality (OR=21.71, 95% CI 9.16-51.46) in those patients. When combining death with ICU admission and patients who were critically ill, patients with cardiac injury was again strongly associated with worse outcomes (OR=22.18, 95% CI 11.68-42.10). In subgroup analyses, hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were older and had history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, and diabetes were associated with increased risk of developing cardiac injury. Conclusion: Cardiac injury is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is significantly associated with poor outcomes. Patients who are older and have hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases are prone to develop cardiac injury.

Statistical analyses concerning the characteristics were performed by 2 test, and the detection ability was analyzed by cross-tabulation. All of the fractured teeth were nontraumatized teeth. The vertical root fracture occurrence was not differed by core construction. The vertical root fracture number was largest at the premolar teeth (p = 0.005), and the number of the bucco-lingual fracture was larger than the mesio-distal fracture (p = 0.046). Vertical root fractures were detectable using CBCT, while undetectable by intraoral radiography (p < 0.001).

Poorly ventilated clinic spaces in particular may be high risk, due to the presence of both infectious and susceptible people. While relatively simple approaches to estimating ventilation rates exist, the approaches most frequently used in epidemiology cannot be used where occupancy varies, and so cannot be reliably applied in many of the types of spaces where they are most needed. METHODS: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of a non-steady state method to estimate the absolute ventilation rate, which can be applied in rooms where occupancy levels vary. We used data from a room in a primary healthcare clinic in a high TB and HIV prevalence setting, comprising indoor and outdoor carbon dioxide measurements and head counts (by age), taken over time. Two approaches were compared: approach 1 using a simple linear regression model and approach 2 using an ordinary differential equation model. RESULTS: The absolute ventilation rate, Q, using approach 1 was 2407 l/s [95% CI: 1632-3181] and Q from approach 2 was 2743 l/s [95% CI: 2139-4429]. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate two methods that can be used to estimate ventilation rate in busy congregate settings, such as clinic waiting rooms. Both approaches produced comparable results, however the simple linear regression method has the advantage of not requiring room volume measurements. These methods can be used to identify poorly-ventilated spaces, allowing measures to be taken to reduce the airborne transmission of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, measles, and SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Estimating ventilation rates in rooms with varying occupancy levels: Relevance for reducing transmission risk of airborne pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer is a disease associated with aging. As the US population ages, the number of older adults with cancer is projected to dramatically increase. Despite this, older adults remain vastly underrepresented in research that sets the standards for cancer treatments and, consequently, clinicians struggle with how to interpret data from clinical trials and apply them to older adults in practice. A combination of system, clinician, and patient barriers bar opportunities for trial participation for many older patients, and strategies are needed to address these barriers at multiple fronts, five of which are offered here. This review highlights the need to (1) broaden eligibility criteria, (2) measure relevant end points, (3) expand standard trial designs, (4) increase resources (e.g., institutional support, interdisciplinary care, and telehealth), and (5) develop targeted interventions (e.g., behavioral interventions to promote patient enrollment). Implementing these solutions requires a substantial investment in engaging and collaborating with community-based practices, where the majority of older patients with cancer receive their care. Multifaceted strategies are needed to ensure that older patients with cancer, across diverse healthcare settings, receive the highest-quality, evidence-based care.","output":"Strategies to improve participation of older adults in cancer research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of virtual dermatology curricula in developing countries remains unclear despite an urgent need due to the pandemic and other factors.

METHODS: We developed a free, on-line dermatology course. 104 trainees from the University of Gondar, Ethiopia, completed the course. Pre- and post-course surveys measuring self-reported proficiency were administered. End-of-Course surveys were distributed to elicit feedback on the course. Performance on final examinations was compared to a historical control group, which did not participate in the course but received standard in-person training. RESULTS: Compared to historical controls (n = 236), the pilot cohort (n = 104) averaged over 4 points higher on the final exam (P < .0001). Most participants were satisfied with all aspects of the on-line course and desire at least a component of virtual learning in the future.

Little is known about unrecognized viruses of the urinary tract that potentially result in transmission. Using an open metagenomic approach, we aimed to comprehensively assess virus transmission in living-donor kidney transplantation. METHODS: Living kidney donors and their corresponding recipients were enrolled at the time of transplantation. Follow-up study visits for recipients were scheduled 4C6 weeks and 1 year thereafter. At each visit, plasma and urine samples were collected and transplant recipients were evaluated for signs of infection or other transplant-related complications. For metagenomic analysis, samples were enriched for viruses, amplified by anchored random polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequenced using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing. Viruses detected by sequencing were confirmed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 30 living kidney donor and recipient pairs, with a follow-up of at least 1 year. In addition to viruses commonly detected during routine post-transplant virus monitoring, metagenomic sequencing detected JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) in the urine of 7 donors and their corresponding recipients. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed infection with the donor strain in 6 cases, suggesting transmission from the transplant donor to the recipient, despite recipient seropositivity for JCPyV at the time of transplantation.

Here, two different phage libraries are used to identify immunogenic epitopes across the spike protein and monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients. Three peptides are further characterized in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and measured their antibody levels in COVID-19 patients, from which one identifies one most immunodominant epitope with the highest antibody response in COVID-19 patients and in immunized mice. More importantly, monoclonal antibodies specifically binding to this peptide isolated from COVID-19 patients have therapeutic potential to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Primary hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disorder with an allele frequency greater than 10% in individuals of European ancestry, while hemosiderosis is less common but associated with a much higher morbidity and mortality. Iron overload leads to iron deposition in many tissues especially the liver, brain, heart and endocrine tissues. Elevated cardiac iron leads to diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy, and is the primary determinant of survival in patients with secondary iron overload as well as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in primary hemochromatosis patients. In addition, iron-induced cardiac injury plays a role in acute iron toxicosis (iron poisoning), myocardial ischemiaCreperfusion injury, Friedreich ataxia and neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with iron overload also routinely suffer from a range of endocrinopathies, including diabetes mellitus and anterior pituitary dysfunction. Despite clear connections between elevated iron and clinical disease, iron transport remains poorly understood. While low-capacity divalent metal and transferrin-bound transporters are critical under normal physiological conditions, L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCC) are high-capacity pathways of ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) uptake into cardiomyocytes especially under iron overload conditions. Fe(2+) uptake through L-type Ca(2+) channels may also be crucial in other excitable cells such as pancreatic beta cells, anterior pituitary cells and neurons.

Due to the country specific scenario of high social and demographic heterogeneity, combined with limited testing capacity, lack of reliable data, under-reporting of cases, and restricted testing policy, the focus of this study is twofold: (i) to develop a generalized SEIRD model that implicitly takes into account the quarantine measures, and (ii) to estimate the response of the COVID-19 spread dynamics to perturbations/uncertainties. By investigating the projections of cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases, as well as the effective reproduction number, we show that the model parameter related to social distancing measures is one of the most influential along all stages of the disease spread and the most influential after the infection peak. Due to such importance in the outcomes, different relaxation strategies of social distancing measures are investigated in order to determine which strategies are viable and less hazardous to the population. The results highlight the need of keeping social distancing policies to control the disease spread. Specifically, the considered scenario of abrupt social distancing relaxation implemented after the occurrence of the peak of positively diagnosed cases can prolong the epidemic, with a significant increase of the projected numbers of confirmed and death cases. An even worse scenario could occur if the quarantine relaxation policy is implemented before evidence of the epidemiological control, indicating the importance of the proper choice of when to start relaxing social distancing measures.","output":"Spreading of COVID-19 in Brazil: Impacts and uncertainties in social distancing strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strong international health agreements and good planning created a structure and common procedure for nations involved in detection and evaluation of the emergence of influenza A (H1N1).

DSC measured the thermodynamic stability of free and ligand-bound HSA and HSAB at pH = 6.0, 7.4 and 8.0. DSC analysis provided a quantitative gauge of responses of HSA and HSAB thermodynamic stability to ligand binding. The influence of different levels of biotinylation of HSAB on ligand binding, and how ligand binding varied as a function of pH for these molecules was also examined. In the three pH environments, biotinylation increased stability of HSAB alone compared to free HSA at pH 7.4. Stabilities of free protein and ligand-bound complexes varied with pH in the order, pH = 6.0>7.4>8.0. Our analytical approach provided very accurate estimates for known binding constants of these ligands for HSA. Results revealed, for both ligands, extent of biotinylation of HSAB affected binding, reducing binding constants from three to 100-fold. Naproxen binding was less sensitive to increased levels of biotinylation compared to bromocresol green.

Several differences and similarities between MIS-C and Kawasaki disease pathology have been observed. Several puzzling aspects of MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other Kawasaki-like diseases have been discussed, but not yet explained. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: An explanatory hypothesis has been presented. Using the hypothesis that a transient or permanent inability to quickly phagocytize antigen-antibody immune complexes created by a novel virulent pathogen infection induces a Type III hypersensitivity immune response and the resulting proteinase exposure and expression of new autoantigens are the fundamental steps for MIS and other Kawasaki-like diseases, it is possible to provide straightforward explanations for at least 10 of the most puzzling aspects of these diseases. The validity of the hypothesis itself is also supported by its ability to provide consistent and straightforward explanations for a large number of these disease aspects.

METHODS: A Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from a US healthcare sector perspective. A lifetime time horizon captured potential long-term costs and outcomes. Model outcomes included discounted total costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Remdesivir was modeled as an addition to standard of care and compared with standard of care alone, including dexamethasone for patients requiring respiratory support. COVID-19 hospitalizations were assumed to be reimbursed through a single payment based on the respiratory support received alongside a remdesivir carveout payment in the base case. Sensitivity and scenario analyses identified key drivers. RESULTS: At a unit price of $520 per vial and assuming no survival benefit with remdesivir, the incremental cost-effectiveness was $298 200/QALY for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and $1 847 000/QALY for patients with mild COVID-19. Although current data do not support a survival benefit, if one was assumed, the cost-effectiveness estimate was $50 100/QALY for the moderate to severe population and $103 400/QALY for the mild population. Another key driver included the hospitalization payment structure (per diem vs bundled payment).

Blood samples from COVID-19 patients (n = 266) at Bamako Dermatology Hospital (HDB) and pre-COVID-19 donors (n = 283) from a previous malaria survey conducted in Dangassa village were tested by ELISA to assess IgG antibodies specific to the full-length spike (S) protein, the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the receptor-binding motif (RBM(436C507)). Study participants were categorized by age, gender, treatment duration for COVID-19, and comorbidities. In addition, the cross-seroreactivity of samples from pre-COVID-19, malaria-positive patients against the three antigens was assessed. Recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by sera from COVID-19 patients was 80.5% for S, 71.1% for RBD, and 31.9% for RBM (p < 0.001). While antibody responses to S and RBD tended to be age-dependent, responses to RBM were not. Responses were not gender-dependent for any of the antigens. Higher antibody levels to S, RBD, and RBM at hospital entry were associated with shorter treatment durations, particularly for RBD (p < 0.01).

Further evaluation concerning antibody persistence beyond this point, and the proportion of neutralizing antibodies with higher affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed, especially in nave and immunosuppressed subjects.","output":"Antibody response after two doses of the SARS-CoV-2 Comirnaty vaccine in a Covid-19 positive and Covid-19 negative Italian healthcare workers cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has swept globally and Pakistan is no exception. To investigate the initial introductions and transmissions of the SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan, we performed the largest genomic epidemiology study of COVID-19 in Pakistan and generated 150 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from samples collected before June 2, 2020. We identified a total of 347 mutated positions, 31 of which were over-represented in Pakistan. Meanwhile, we found over 1000 intra-host single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs). Several of them occurred concurrently, indicating possible interactions among them or coevolution. Some of the high-frequency iSNVs in Pakistan were not observed in the global population, suggesting strong purifying selections. The genomic epidemiology revealed five distinctive spreading clusters. The largest cluster consisted of 74 viruses which were derived from different geographic locations of Pakistan and formed a deep hierarchical structure, indicating an extensive and persistent nation-wide transmission of the virus that was probably attributed to a signature mutation (G8371T in ORF1ab) of this cluster. Furthermore, 28 putative international introductions were identified, several of which are consistent with the epidemiological investigations. In all, this study has inferred the possible pathways of introduction and transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan, which could aid ongoing and future viral surveillance and COVID-19 control.","output":"Genomic Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The antioxidant properties of purple grape juice, organic and conventional, in brain tissues are not well known. In this study our objective was to evaluate the antioxidant activity in substantia nigra and striatum of rats chronically treated with organic or conventional purple grape juice and to correlate the results obtained with the polyphenol content (total polyphenolic content, resveratrol, and anthocyanins [malvidin, delphinidin, peonidin, and cyanidin]). We observed that CCl(4) damage decreased significantly in the grape juice-treated groups when compared with the control group. In the grape juice-treated groups we further observed a decrease of lipid (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances assay) and protein (carbonyl) peroxidation, as well as a significant antioxidant protection through the increase of enzyme activity. Antioxidant activities were significantly correlated with polyphenol content. These findings demonstrated that both grape juices have potent antioxidant properties and these activities could be at least attributed to the high phenolic content present in these juices.","output":"Protective effects of purple grape juice on carbon tetrachloride-induced oxidative stress in brains of adult Wistar rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although our current knowledge of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is still fragmentary, the information so far accrued on the tropism and life cycle of its etiological agent SARS-CoV-2, together with the emerging clinical data, suffice to indicate that the severe acute pulmonary syndrome is the main, but not the only manifestation of COVID-19. Necropsy studies are increasingly revealing underlying endothelial vasculopathies in the form of micro-haemorrhages and micro-thrombi. Intertwined with defective antiviral responses, dysregulated coagulation mechanisms, abnormal hyper-inflammatory reactions and responses, COVID-19 is disclosing a wide pathophysiological palette. An additional property in categorising the disease is the combination of tissue (e.g. neuro- and vasculo-tropism) with organ tropism, whereby the virus preferentially attacks certain organs with highly developed capillary beds, such as the lungs gastrointestinal tract, kidney and brain. These multiple clinical presentations confirm that the acute respiratory syndrome as described initially is increasingly unfolding as a more complex nosological entity, a multiorgan syndrome of systemic breadth.

We described the distribution of underlying comorbidities, quality of care metrics, demographic and social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators across race groups. We also described clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients including length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission and mortality. We performed multivariable analyses for hospitalisation risk among all patients with COVID-19 and stratifyied by race and sex. SETTING: KPGA, an integrated healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: 5712 patients who all had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Of them, 57.8% were female, 58.4% black, 29.5% white, 8.5% Hispanic and 3.6% Asian. RESULTS: Black patients had the highest proportions of living in neighborhoods under the federal poverty line (12.4%) and in more deprived locations (neighbourhood deprivation index=0.4). Overall, 14.4% (n=827) of this cohort was hospitalised. Asian patients had the highest rates of ICU admission (53.1%) and mechanical ventilation (21.9%).

This study evaluated the transmissibility of the infectious disease and analyzed its association with temperature and humidity, in order to put forward suggestions on how to suppress the transmission. Methods: In this study, we revised the reported data in Wuhan to estimate the actual number of confirmed cases. Then we used the equation derived from the SusceptibleCExposedCInfectiousCRecovered (SEIR) model to calculate R0 from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020 in 11 major cities in China for comparison. With the calculation results, we conducted correlation analysis and regression analysis between R0 and temperature and humidity to see the impact of weather on the transmissibility of COVID-19. Results: It was estimated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases had exceeded 45,000 by February 13, 2020 in Wuhan. The average R0 in Wuhan was 2.7011, significantly higher than those in other cities ranging from 1.7762 to 2.3700. The inflection points in the cities outside Hubei Province were between January 30, 2020 and February 3, 2020, while there had not been an obvious downward trend of R0 in Wuhan. R0 negatively correlated with both temperature and humidity, which was significant at the 0.01 level. Conclusions: The transmissibility of COVID-19 was strong and importance should be attached to the intervention of its transmission especially in Wuhan.

The ICD-10 main diagnoses from the DNPR are often used as proxies for mental disorders in psychiatric research. With the transition from the second version of the DNPR (DNPR2) to the third (DNPR3) in February-March 2019, the way main diagnoses are coded in relation to outpatient treatment changed substantially. Specifically, in the DNPR2, each outpatient treatment course was labelled with only one main diagnosis. In the DNPR3, however, each visit during an outpatient treatment course is labelled with a main diagnosis. We assessed whether this change led to a break in the diagnostic time-series represented by the DNPR, which would pose a threat to the research relying on this source. Methods All main diagnoses from outpatients attending the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region from 2013 to 2021 (n=93,889 unique patients) were included in the analyses. The stability of the DNPR diagnostic time-series at the ICD-10 subchapter level was examined by comparing means across the transition from the DNPR2 to the DNPR3. Results While the proportion of psychiatric outpatients with diagnoses from some ICD-10 subchapters changed statistically significantly from the DNPR2 to the DNPR3, the changes were small in absolute terms (e.g., +0.9% for F2 - psychotic disorders and +0.1% for F3 - mood disorders).

Novel approaches that maximise capacity and efficiency of surgical care are urgently required. This study applies Markov multiscale community detection (MMCD), an unsupervised graph-based clustering framework, to identify new surgical care models based on pooled waiting-lists delivered across an expanded network of surgical providers. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics. SETTING: Public and private hospitals providing surgical care to National Health Service (NHS) patients in England. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients resident in England undergoing NHS-funded planned surgical procedures between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The identification of the most common planned surgical procedures in England (high-volume procedures (HVP)) and proportion of low, medium and high-risk patients undergoing each HVP. The mapping of hospitals providing surgical care onto optimised groupings based on patient usage data. RESULTS: A total of 7 811 891 planned operations were identified in 4 284 925 adults during the 1-year period of our study. The 28 most common surgical procedures accounted for a combined 3 907 474 operations (50.0% of the total). 2 412 613 (61.7%) of these most common procedures involved 'low risk' patients. Patients travelled an average of 11.3 km for these procedures. Based on the data, MMCD partitioned England into 45, 16 and 7 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive natural surgical communities of increasing coarseness. The coarser partitions into 16 and seven surgical communities were shown to be associated with balanced supply and demand for surgical care within communities. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled waiting-lists for low-risk elective procedures and patients across integrated, expanded natural surgical community networks have the potential to increase efficiency by innovatively flexing existing supply to better match demand.","output":"New geographic model of care to manage the post-COVID-19 elective surgery aftershock in England: a retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In most areas in Japan, patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) would be transferred to the secondary hospitals or tertiary hospitals according to the judgement of emergency medical service (EMS) staff members.

Mass transportation resources were deemed necessary. To achieve that goal, the concept of a Collective Advanced Life Support Ambulance (CALSA) was proposed in the form of a long-distance bus re-designed and equipped so as to accommodate up to six intensive care patients and allow Advanced Life Support (ALS) techniques to be performed while en route. Methods: : The expected benefit of the CALSA, when compared to ALS ambulances accommodating a single patient, was to reduce the resources requirements, in particular by a lower personnel headcount for several patients being transferred to the same destination. A foreseen prospect, comparing to other collective transportation vectors such as airplanes, was the door-to-door capability, minimalizing patients handovers for safety concerns and time efficiency. With the project of a short-distance transfer of several Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients together, the opportunity came to test the CALSA under real-life conditions and evaluate safely its technical feasibility and impact in time and resources saving, before it could be proposed for longer distances. Results: : Four COVID-19 patients were transported over 37 km. All patients were intubated and under controlled ventilation. One of them was under Norepinephrine support. Mean loading time was 1min 39s. Transportation time was 29 min. At destination, the mean unloading time was 1min 15s. No serious adverse effect, in particular regarding hemodynamic instability or ventilation disorder, has been observed. No harmful incident, in particular no accidental extubation, has occurred. Conclusions: : It was a very instructive test. Collective medical evacuation by bus for critically ill patients under controlled ventilation is suitable and easy to implement. Design, ALS equipment, power autonomy, safety and resources saving, open the way for carrying up to 6 ICU-patients over a long distance. The CALSA could bring a real added-value in an epidemic context and could also be helpful in many other events generating multiple victims such as an armed conflict, a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.","output":"Collective Advanced Life Support Ambulance An Innovative Transportation of Critical Care Patients by Bus in COVID-19 Pandemic Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cough is an indispensable defensive reflex. Although generally beneficial, it is also a common symptom of diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, upper respiratory tract infections, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer. Cough remains a major unmet medical need and although the centrally acting opioids have remained the antitussive of choice for decades, they have many unwanted side effects. However, new research into the behaviour of airway sensory nerves has provided greater insight into the mechanisms of cough and new avenues for the discovery of novel non-opioid antitussive drugs.

This study thus aimed to examine the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its demographic and correlates among frontline health professionals. METHODS: This is a multicenter, cross-sectional survey conducted in Liaoning province, China. Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: A total of 1,931 frontline health professionals were recruited. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 18.4% (95%CI: 16.6%C20.11%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that older age (OR=1.043, 95%CI=1.026C1.061, P < 0.001), being nurse (OR=3.132, 95%CI=1.727C5.681, P < 0.001), and working in outer emergency medical team (OR=1.755, 95%CI=1.029C3.064, P=0.039) were positively associated with poor sleep quality. Participants who were familiar with crisis response knowledge were negatively associated with poor sleep quality (OR=0.70, 95%CI=0.516C0.949, P=0.021). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of poor sleep quality was relatively low among frontline health professionals during the COVID-19 epidemic. Considering the negative impact of poor sleep quality on health professionals health outcomes and patient outcomes, regularly screening and timely treatments are warranted to reduce the likelihood of poor sleep quality in health professionals.","output":"Prevalence and Demographic Correlates of Poor Sleep Quality Among Frontline Health Professionals in Liaoning Province, China During the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, online health platforms and physicians online knowledge sharing played an important role in public health crisis management and disease prevention.

METHODS: Twenty-four frontline HCP participated in this crossover pilot where the viewing order of the experiences were randomized. All participants attended in-person consent, baseline, and end-of-study visits. The intervention consisted of viewing 2 nature-based scenes (walk in the woods and forest of focus) through 3-D VR and with computer 4K graphic imagery. Randomization took place with regards to the viewing order (VR vs 4K computer video, scene 1 and 2). Outcomes measured were safety, acceptability and changes in intensity of anxiety feelings, resilience, emotional distress, cognitive function, and self-efficacy. RESULTS: Among the 26 HCP expressing interest in the study, 24 enrolled in this study. The majority were male (58.3%), white (66.7%) and of an average age of 46.3  10.5 years (standard deviation (SD)). End of the study survey showed that almost all participants (96%) would participate in the study again and recommend it to others. Twenty-three of the 24 participants also felt relaxed after seeing the imagery. With respect to anxiety (as measured by the STAI Y1), the VR walk in the woods had the greatest reduction from pre to post (6.4 points, SD = 5.98) followed by VR forest of focus (5.8 points, SD = 9.29), computer screen forest of focus (5.0 points, SD = 8.89), and computer screen walk in the woods (4.1 points, SD = 6.22). All 4 sessions had a significant decrease in score from pre to post (P-values .005), but there was no significant difference in the change from pre- to post-session between the 4 groups (P-value = .5835).

Our objective was to examine disparities in preventive oral health care among US adults with diabetes. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011C2016. Periodontal examinations were conducted in adults aged 30 and older. We compared the weighted prevalence of periodontal disease and the practice of preventive oral health care, including practicing dental interproximal cleaning (flossing or using other interproximal cleaning devices) and use of preventive dental services, among people with and without diabetes. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to examine the relationship between the presence of diabetes, periodontal disease, and preventive oral health care practices. RESULTS: Weighted prevalence of periodontal disease in the US population was higher among adults with diabetes than those without (58.0% vs 37.6%). This difference persisted after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and smoking status. People with diabetes were more likely to have periodontal disease (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.39; 95% CI, 1.17C1.65), less likely to practice daily interproximal cleaning (aOR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75C0.95), and less likely to visit a dentist for preventive care in the past year (aOR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76C0.96) than people without diabetes. CONCLUSION: Adults with diabetes reported suboptimal preventive oral health care behaviors in use of preventive dental services and interproximal dental cleaning than people without diabetes, despite their health disparity related to periodontal disease.

The only effective treatment to prevent progression of liver damage is reducing or ceasing alcohol consumption. Psychological and pharmacological therapies for alcohol misuse are ineffective in patients with ArLD. Functional imagery training (FIT) is a novel psychological therapy that builds on motivational interviewing techniques with multisensory imagery. This pilot trial aims to test the feasibility of training alcohol liaison nurses to deliver FIT therapy and of recruiting and retaining patients with ArLD and alcohol dependence to a randomised trial of FIT and treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU alone. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a randomised pilot trial of FIT and TAU versus TAU alone in 90 patients with ArLD and alcohol dependence admitted to one of four UK centres. The primary objectives are to estimate rates of screening, recruitment, randomisation, retention, adherence to FIT/TAU and a preliminary assessment of the FIT intervention in the ArLD population. Data from the pilot study will be used to finalise the design of a definitive randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FIT. The proposed primary outcome measure for the definitive trial is self-reported alcohol use assessed using timeline follow-back.

However, individual studies are usually inconclusive, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. We used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA), and the Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA). We identified 38 studies containing data from 7848 individuals. Tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests. IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody alone. All methods yield high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods perform better in terms of sensitivity (90%-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 89%.

Through targeted recombination and reverse genetic manipulation, studies of infection with MHV-JHM variants have identified phenotypic differences and examined the effects of these differences on viral pathogenesis and anti-viral host immune responses. Studies employing recombinant viruses with a modified spike (S) glycoprotein of MHV-JHM have identified the S gene as a major determinant of neurovirulence. However, the association of S gene variation and neurovirulence with host ability to generate anti-viral CD8 T cell responses is not completely clear. Partially protective anti-viral immune responses may result in persistent infection and chronic demyelinating disease characterized by myelin removal from axons of the CNS and associated with dense macrophage/microglial infiltration. Demyelinating disease during MHV-JHM infection is immune-mediated, as mice that lack T lymphocytes fail to develop disease despite succumbing to encephalitis with high levels of infectious virus in the CNS. However, the presence of T lymphocytes or anti-viral antibody can induce disease in infected immunodeficient mice. The mechanisms by which these immune effectors induce demyelination share an ability to activate and recruit macrophages and microglia, thus increasing the putative role of these cells in myelin destruction.","output":"Pathogenesis of acute and chronic central nervous system infection with variants of mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thymosin alpha 1 (T1) is widely used to treat patients with COVID-19 in China; however, its efficacy remains unclear.

Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir reduces hospitalization among high-risk patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Brazil. Recently symptomatic adults diagnosed with respiratory symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled between June 2 and September 30, 2020. The planned sample size was 1476 patients, with interim analyses planned after 500 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped after the interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 685 patients. Statistical analysis was performed in December 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (800 mg loading dose, then 400 mg daily for 9 days), lopinavir-ritonavir (loading dose of 800 mg and 200 mg, respectively, every 12 hours followed by 400 mg and 100 mg, respectively, every 12 hours for the next 9 days), or placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death assessed at 90 days after randomization. COVID-19-associated hospitalization was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model. The trial included the following secondary outcomes: all-cause hospitalization, viral clearance, symptom resolution, and adverse events. Results: Of 685 participants, 632 (92.3%) self-identified as mixed-race, 377 (55.0%) were women, and the median (range) age was 53 (18-94) years. A total of 214 participants were randomized to hydroxychloroquine; 244, lopinavir-ritonavir; and 227, placebo. At first interim analysis, the data safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrollment of both hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir groups because of futility. The proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was 3.7% (8 participants) in the hydroxychloroquine group, 5.7% (14 participants) in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 4.8% (11 participants) in the placebo group. We found no significant differences between interventions for COVID-19-associated hospitalization (hydroxychloroquine: hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.30-1.88]; lopinavir-ritonavir: HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.53-2.56] as well as for the secondary outcome of viral clearance through day 14 (hydroxychloroquine: odds ratio [OR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.82-1.02]; lopinavir-ritonavir: OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.94-1.16]).

However, the usability of the developed rehabilitation system is still unknown to a large extent. The purpose of this study was to develop a virtual reality upper limb rehabilitation system for patients after breast cancer surgery and to explore its usability. METHODS: We built a multidisciplinary team based on virtual reality and human-computer interaction technology and designed and developed an upper limb function rehabilitation system for breast cancer patients after surgery. Breast cancer patients were recruited from a grade III-a general hospital in Changchun city for the experiment. We used the System Usability Scale to evaluate the system availability, the Presence Questionnaire scale to measure the immersive virtual reality scene, and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire subjective measurement scale for simulator sickness symptoms. RESULTS: This upper limb rehabilitation system hardware consisted of Head-mounted Display, a control handle and notebook computers. The software consisted of rehabilitation exercises and game modules. A total of 15 patients were tested on this system, all of whom were female. The mean age was 54.737.78 years, and no patients were excluded from the experiment because of adverse reactions such as dizziness and vomiting. The System Usability Scale score was 90.505.69, the Presence Questionnaire score was 113.409.58, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire-nausea score was 0.931.16, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire-oculomotor score was 0.801.27, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire-disorientation score was 0.801.27, and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire total score was 2.533.40. CONCLUSIONS: This study fills in the blanks regarding the upper limb rehabilitation of breast cancer patients based on virtual reality technology system usability research. As the starting point of research in the future, we will improve the systems function and design strictly randomized controlled trials, using larger samples in the promotion, to evaluate its application in breast cancer patients with upper limbs and other physiological functions and the feasibility and effects of rehabilitation.","output":"Upper limb rehabilitation system based on virtual reality for breast cancer patients: Development and usability study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) demonstrate a range of hemostasis dysfunctions, such as coagulation dysfunction and changes in blood platelet function, this being a major cause of death. These complications may also be associated with oxidative stress. Recently, various papers, including some reviews, have suggested that the use of dietary bioactive compounds, including phenolic compounds, may play a significant role in the treatment of COVID-19. However, while some phenolic compounds, such as curcumin, resveratrol, myricetin and scutellarian, have been found to have antiviral effects against COVID-19, recommendations regarding the use of such compounds to prevent or reduce the risk of CVDs during COVID-19 infection remain tentative. The present mini-review examines the antioxidant, anti-platelet and anticoagulant and antiviral activities of selected phenolic compounds and the possible implications for their use in treating CVDs associated with COVID-19. This review also examines whether these phenolic compounds can be promising agents in the modulation of hemostasis and CVDs during COVID-19. While their properties have been well documented in various in vitro and in vivo studies, particularly their positive role in the prophylaxis and treatment of CVDs, less is known regarding their prophylactic potential against CVDs during COVID-19, and no credible evidence exists for their efficiency in humans or animals. In such cases, no in vitro or in vivo studies are available. Therefore, it cannot be unequivocally stated whether treatment with these phenolic compounds offers benefits against CVDs in patients with COVID-19.","output":"The Antioxidant, Anti-Platelet and Anti-Coagulant Properties of Phenolic Compounds, Associated with Modulation of Hemostasis and Cardiovascular Disease, and Their Possible Effect on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air-filtering masks, also known as respirators, protect wearers from inhaling fine particulate matter (PM2 5) in polluted air, as well as airborne pathogens during a pandemic, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic Fibrous medium, used as the filtration layer, is the most essential component of an air-filtering mask This article presents an overview of the development of fibrous media for air filtration We first synthesize the literature on several key factors that affect the filtration performance of fibrous media We then concentrate on two major techniques for fabricating fibrous media, namely, meltblown and electrospinning In addition, we underscore the importance of electret filters by reviewing various methods for imparting electrostatic charge on fibrous media Finally, this article concludes with a perspective on the emerging research opportunities amid the COVID-19 crisis","output":"Air-Filtering Masks for Respiratory Protection from PM2.5 and Pandemic Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the difficult and tragic changes wrought by COVID-19, many of us have also been given the gift of a reminder to return to the basis of our spiritual life, our connection to the natural world.

Here, we describe senescent declines in social connectedness using 43 years of data in a wild, individually-monitored population of a long-lived mammal (European red deer, Cervus elaphus). Applying a series of spatial and social network analyses, we demonstrate that these declines likely occur due to a combination of within-individual changes in social behaviour and altered spatial behaviour (smaller home ranges and movements to lower-density, lower-quality areas).

We showed that the HIDROX solution exhibits time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities, and that HIDROX has more potent virucidal activity than pure HT. The evaluation of the mechanism of action suggested that both HIDROX and HT induced structural changes in SARS-CoV-2, which changed the molecular weight of the spike proteins. Even though the spike protein is highly glycosylated, this change was induced regardless of the glycosylation status. In addition, HIDROX or HT treatment disrupted the viral genome. Moreover, the HIDROX-containing cream applied on film showed time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities.

Prebiotics are a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit as defined by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics. The current work aimed to study the effect of XOS and glucose addition on wheat flour sourdough fermented with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12) strain in terms of organic acid production and on the rheological properties of the doughs. The effect of XOS addition increased the production of organic acids, and positively influenced the rheological properties of the dough. Additionally, after frozen storage, there were no significant viscoelastic changes in the dough structure, which indicates that xylo-oligosaccharides improved the water retention capability of the dough. Through fermentation carbohydrates like, glucose, xylose, maltose, and XOS were consumed, and a high quantity of lactic and acetic acid were produced, organic acids with roles in the flavor generation and sensorial properties of the final product. This study showed the potential use of XOS as food ingredient in sourdoughs for bakery products manufacturing with improved quality and rheological properties. ABSTRACT: Xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) are considered non-digestible fibers produced mainly from agricultural biomass and are classified as emerging prebiotic compounds. Since XOS were shown to promote the growth of bifidobacteria in the gut with potential effects on ones health, scientists used them as food ingredients. For example, the addition of XOS in bakery products could improve their physicochemical characteristics. The current work aimed to investigate the effect of XOS and glucose addition on wheat flour sourdough fermented with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12) strain in terms of organic acid production. The effect on viscoelastic changes during frozen storage and after the thawing process was also studied. The results showed that the viability of BB-12 increased slightly with the increase in XOS and glucose concentrations, which determined dough acidification due to accumulation of organic acids, that positively influenced the doughs rheological properties such as a higher elasticity before and after frozen storage. With 10% XOS-addition, the acetic acid quantity reached 0.87  0.03 mg/L, and the highest lactic acid concentration was found in the 10% XOS-enriched doughs, the glucose-enriched doughs and in the control sample (100% wheat dough). The quantity of glucose, maltose, XOS, and xylose decreased until the end of fermentation.","output":"Assessment of Physicochemical and Rheological Properties of Xylo-Oligosaccharides and Glucose-Enriched Doughs Fermented with BB-12"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intraoperative vs postoperative initiation of haemofiltration procedures in patients submitted for major vascular surgery is a controversial issue and a subject of debate in recent literature.

Methods: A simulation study was conducted on current, nationwide, patient-led triage systems from three countries with low case fatality rates (Singapore, Norway and Japan) and two countries with high case fatality rates (the USA and the UK). 36 case scenarios were designed to imitate common presentations of COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity. These scenarios were then fed into each countrys patient-led triage system. The advice for each scenario was recorded and then compared. Results: Patient-led triage systems from Singapore, Japan and Norway maintained a low threshold for advising clinical contact for patients with possible COVID-19 (88 to 100% of cases were referred). Patient-led triage systems from the USA and the UK maintained high thresholds for advising contact with either call centre support or clinical contact (28 and 33% of cases were referred, respectively), and triaged the majority of cases home with no further healthcare input.

We further sought to identify journal characteristics that might influence TTA and TTOP. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We searched the publication history of 5 leading international radiation oncology journals. For all research articles accepted from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, we tabulated the date of article receipt, the date of acceptance, and the date of online publication when available. The TTA was calculated as the number of elapsed days from article receipt to acceptance, and the TTOP was calculated as the number of elapsed days from article acceptance to online publication. Using the Mann-Kendall test, we assessed for monotonic trends over time and used the post hoc Theil-Sen method to estimate rates of change. We created a multiple regression model to identify journal characteristics associated with TTA and TTOP. RESULTS: In total, 10,132 articles were included. Both the TTA and the TTOP decreased significantly from 2010 to 2019 (P = .005 and P < .001, respectively), with an estimated decrease of 1.5 days per year for the TTA and 7.0 days per year for the TTOP. Multiple regression modeling revealed that a higher journal impact factor was independently associated with an increased TTA (P < .001) and a decreased TTOP (P < .001). A higher number of accepted journal articles per year was associated with a decreased TTA (P < .001) and an increased TTOP (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Radiation oncology research has been accepted and published online at increasingly faster rates during the past decade. The TTA may be longer in higher-impact, more selective journals, possibly suggesting a need for comprehensive peer review and complex editorial decisions.

Of those who did not use a DMHT to cope with COVID-19, most indicated that they did not consider looking for such a tool to help with coping (1179/1710, 68.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the potential need for DMHTs, this study found that the use of such tools remains similar to prepandemic levels. This study also found that regardless of the level of distress or even past experience using an app to cope with COVID-19, it is possible to develop a COVID-19 coping app that would appeal to a majority of essential workers and unemployed persons.","output":"Mental Health and the Perceived Usability of Digital Mental Health Tools Among Essential Workers and People Unemployed Due to COVID-19: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) was declared in January 2020 as a public health emergency of international concern. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) suffered from several pandemics previously. Pharmacists have vital roles to play to prevent the spread of this virus. OBJECTIVES: To assess the COVID\\\\19 awareness amongst pharmacists from Arabic\\\\speaking countries located in the MENA region, and to assess their perspectives of their role, barriers, and roles of the educational institutions/pharmaceutical associations. METHODS: An online survey was conducted to run a descriptive cross\\\\sectional study in Jordan from 12(th) to 22(nd) April 2020. The questionnaire was validated (face validity) and put on Facebook and directed for pharmacists only (clarified in the introduction of the questionnaire). Assessment of pharmacists awareness (20 questions) about pandemics and COVID\\\\19, their perceived roles and barriers, and roles of the educational institutions (e.g. universities) and pharmaceutical associations (e.g. Pharmacists Syndicate) was done. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS). RESULTS: Study participants (n= 2589) had a mean age of 29.3 (8.2) years and 1329 (51.5%) were females. Most of the participants were from Egypt (n= 819, 40.8%), followed by Jordan, Algeria, and Syria. Regarding the sources of information about coronavirus management, 60.8% of participants got their information from the social media. Fear from contracting the coronavirus while performing their duties was reported by the majority of pharmacists as the main barrier to delivering their roles (82.3%). The majority of pharmacists identified positive roles for the pharmaceutical institutions (74.8%) and pharmaceutical associations (63.6%). CONCLUSION: Pharmacists from the MENA countries believe they got enough education previously about pandemics, and the majority follow the latest coronavirus updates from social media. Fear was reported as the major barrier that requires resolution by the policymakers.

METHODS Klenow-FragELTM DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit and immunohistochemical alkaline phosphatase detection reagent kit were used to detect cell apoptosis and expressions of CD68, CD20, CD4, CD8 and CD45RA in the pathological tissues of SARS patients. RESULTS Apoptotic cells increased significantly in the spleen, lung and lymph nodes of SARS patients as compared with normal tissues. The apoptotic cells included pneumocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes, and CD68+ monocytes were observed in abundance in the lung, spleen and lymph nodes of SARS patients. In the lung tissue of the patients, few CD20+/CD45RA+ B cells and CD4+/CD8+ T cells were spotted, and CD20+/CD45RA+ B cells along with CD4+/CD8+ T cells were also significantly decreased in the spleen and lymph nodes, where few conserved B and T cells underwent apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS Apoptosis is a general phenomenon in SARS, and the invasive cells in the pathological tissues are primarily monocytes, suggesting that apoptosis and invasion of monocyte play important roles in the progression of SARS. The cell apoptosis and decreased number of T cell and B cells in the lungs and CD4+/CD8+ T cells and CD20+/CD45RA+ B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes indicate that the SARS virus may exercise immune cell-killing effect to some extent during its pathogenesis.","output":"[Detection of cell apoptosis in the pathological tissues of patients with SARS and its significance]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last 20 years, and especially since the Global Financial Crisis, the EUs relationship with North-East Asia has evolved significantly.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Participants aged 25C79 years enrolled in the Healthy Life in an Urban Setting population-based prospective cohort (n=16 889) were randomly selected within ethnic groups and invited to participate in a cross-sectional COVID-19 seroprevalence substudy. OUTCOME MEASURES: We tested participants for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and collected information on SARS-CoV-2 exposures. We estimated prevalence and correlates of SARS-CoV-2 exposure within ethnic groups using survey-weighted logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and calendar time. RESULTS: Between 24 June and 9 October 2020, we included 2497 participants. Adjusted SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was comparable between ethnic Dutch (24/498; 5.1%, 95% CI 2.8% to 7.4%), South-Asian Surinamese (22/451; 4.9%, 95% CI 2.2% to 7.7%), African Surinamese (22/400; 8.3%, 95% CI 3.1% to 13.6%), Turkish (30/408; 7.9%, 95% CI 4.4% to 11.4%) and Moroccan (32/391; 7.2%, 95% CI 4.2% to 10.1%) participants, but higher among Ghanaians (95/327; 26.3%, 95% CI 18.5% to 34.0%). 57.1% of SARS-CoV-2-positive participants did not suspect or were unsure of being infected, which was lowest in African Surinamese (18.2%) and highest in Ghanaians (90.5%). Correlates of SARS-CoV-2 exposure varied across ethnic groups, while the most common correlate was having a household member suspected of infection. In Ghanaians, seropositivity was associated with older age, larger household sizes, living with small children, leaving home to work and attending religious services. CONCLUSIONS: No remarkable differences in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence were observed between the largest ethnic groups in Amsterdam after the first wave of infections. The higher infection seroprevalence observed among Ghanaians, which passed mostly unnoticed, warrants wider prevention efforts and opportunities for non-symptom-based testing.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence and correlates of six ethnic groups living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands: a population-based cross-sectional study, JuneCOctober 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of COVID -19 infection irrfants anci childrerr iS low arld most cases have only few (rhinitis, fever) or rlo sym t ever, a high viral load may he present in the upper and lower airways thus imposirig specific precautions far ENT surgeoris children, Ir ' the next paragraphs, we will discuss some situations upori a background of available guidelines for outpatierit and in -patient marlagement","output":"Challenges in pediatric otolaryngology in the COVID-19 pandemic: insights from current protocols and management strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In this study, a Burkholderia mallei tonB mutant (TMM001) deficient in iron acquisition was constructed, characterized, and evaluated for its protective properties in acute inhalational infection models of murine glanders and melioidosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Compared to the wild-type, TMM001 exhibits slower growth kinetics, siderophore hyper-secretion and the inability to utilize heme-containing proteins as iron sources. A series of animal challenge studies showed an inverse correlation between the percentage of survival in BALB/c mice and iron-dependent TMM001 growth. Upon evaluation of TMM001 as a potential protective strain against infection, we found 100% survival following B. mallei CSM001 challenge of mice previously receiving 1.5 x 10(4) CFU of TMM001. At 21 days post-immunization, TMM001-treated animals showed significantly higher levels of B. mallei-specific IgG1, IgG2a and IgM when compared to PBS-treated controls. At 48 h post-challenge, PBS-treated controls exhibited higher levels of serum inflammatory cytokines and more severe pathological damage to target organs compared to animals receiving TMM001. In a cross-protection study of acute inhalational melioidosis with B. pseudomallei, TMM001-treated mice were significantly protected. While wild type was cleared in all B. mallei challenge studies, mice failed to clear TMM001.

METHODS In our retrospective single-center analysis of 176 patients with carotid artery stenting between 2009 and 2015, using duplex ultrasound, we detected 9 patients with high-grade carotid artery in-stent restenosis. All restenosis patients were treated with a drug-eluting balloon (DEB) to prevent recurrent neointimal hyperplasia. One patient had bilateral carotid artery disease with bilateral in-stent restenosis, and 1 patient needed repeated DEB treatment 19 months after the first DEB intervention, so 11 DEB procedures, in total, were performed. RESULTS The median time-interval between primary carotid artery stenting and first DEB-treatment was 9 months. In 3 of the 11 interventions, the DEB treatment was assisted by an additional stent. One repeat DEB treatment was necessary, and three DEB treatments were followed by a secondary stent. No peri-interventional complications (TIA, stroke, or death) were observed during or after DEB intervention. Therefore, in the entire group, the 1y event-free survival (EFS) was 100%, and the 2y/3y/5y EFS was 83%.

However, the global distribution, endemicity, and latitudinal gradients of species richness in mangrove crabs remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed whether species richness of mangrove crabs decreases towards the higher latitudes and tested the importance of environmental factors such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in creating the latitudinal gradients in species richness of mangrove crabs. A total of 8262 distribution records of 481 species belonging to six families of mangrove crabs including Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae, and Oziidae were extracted from open-access databases or collected by the authors, quality controlled, cleaned, and analyzed. Species richness was plotted against 5 latitudinal bands in relation to environmental factors. The R software and ArcGIS 10.6.1 were used to analyze the species latitudinal range and richness as well as to map the distribution of mangrove forest, endemic species, species geographical distribution records, and biogeographic regions. The Indo-West Pacific showed the highest species richness of mangrove crabs where more than 65% of species were found in the Indian Ocean and along the western Pacific Ocean. Our results showed that there are 11 significantly different biogeographic regions of mangrove crabs. The highest endemicity rate was observed in the NW Pacific Ocean (29%). Latitudinal patterns of species richness in Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, and Sesarmidae showed an increasing trend from the poles toward the intermediate latitudes including one dip near the equator. However, latitudinal gradients in Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, and Oziidae were unimodal increasing from the higher latitudes towards the equator. Species richness per 5 latitudinal bands significantly increased following mean SST mean (C), calcite, euphotic depth (m), and mangrove area (km2) across all latitudes, and tide average within each hemisphere. Species richness significantly decreased with dissolved O2 (ml l-1) and nitrate (mol l-1) over all latitudes and in the southern hemisphere. The climax of global latitudinal species richness for some mangrove was observed along latitudes 20 N and 15-25 S, not at the equator.

In 2013, imported human H7N9 influenza infected cases from China were reported. Our study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) concerning A/H7N9 among Hong Kong general population regarding pandemic preparedness in early 2014. METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey study was conducted among the Cantonese-speaking population aged over 15 years in Hong Kong in February 2014. The study survey was composed of 78 KAP questions. Factors associated with individual and household pandemic preparedness were analyzed. RESULTS: Final study sample was 1,020 with a response rate of 45.9 %. Among the respondents, most of them believed personal hygiene and avoidance of avian contacts were effective in preventing H7N9 infections. The majority of respondents had satisfactory hand hygiene practices and avoided touching avian species but did not employ other preventive measures. Female, 25 years old or older, white collar workers, people with chronic diseases and people living in the city center tended to report better hygiene practices.

Methodology: We conducted this retrospective study to compare the spectrum and outcome of trauma victims who presented to our emergency department (ED) from April 2020 (lockdown period) to a similar season matched control arm of April 2018 (non-lockdown period). Results: Our study groups included 403 trauma victims (trauma prevalence: 9.7%) from April 2020 as compared to 667 trauma victims (trauma prevalence: 10.8%) from April 2018 with an absolute decrease of ?39.6% during the lockdown month. The intense lockdown resulted in an absolute decrease in the number of road traffic accidents (RTA) (?75.1%), sports-related injuries (?81.8%), bull gore injuries (?64.3%), workplace-related injuries (?50.0%), and fall from height (?3.5%). However, an absolute increase in the number of falls on level ground (FLG) (+95.7%), domestic trauma (+91.4%), and burn (+37.5%) patients were noted during the lockdown period.

Although interim analyses of clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, a serious but rare adverse event, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), has been reported following COVID-19 vaccination. AREAS COVERED: This review, using data from both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed studies, aimed to provide updated information about the critical issue of COVID-19 vaccine-related TTS. EXPERT OPINION: : The exact epidemiological characteristics and possible pathogenesis of this adverse event remain unclear. Most cases of TTS developed in women within 2 weeks of the first dose of vaccine on the receipt of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines. In countries with mass vaccination against COVID-19, clinicians should be aware of the relevant clinical features of this rare adverse event and perform related laboratory and imaging studies for early diagnosis. Non-heparin anticoagulants, such as fondaparinux, argatroban, or a direct oral anticoagulant (e.g. apixaban or rivaroxaban) and intravenous immunoglobulins are recommended for the treatment of TTS. However, further studies are required to explore the underlying mechanisms of this rare clinical entity. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: What is the context?Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) usually develops within 2 weeks of the first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccines.TTS mainly occurs in patients aged < 55 years and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.What is new?TTS mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and can be mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4. Non-heparin anticoagulants, such as fondaparinux, argatroban, or a direct oral anticoagulant (e.g. apixaban or rivaroxaban) should be considered as the treatment of choice if the platelet count is > 50  109/L and there is no serious bleeding. Intravenous immunoglobulins and glucocorticoids may help increase the platelet count within days and reduce the risk of hemorrhagic transformation when anticoagulation is initiated.What is the impact?TTS should be a serious concern during the implementation of mass COVID-19 vaccination, and patients should be educated about this complication along with its symptoms such as severe headache, blurred vision, seizure, severe and persistent abdominal pain, painful swelling of the lower leg, and chest pain or dyspnea. The incidence of TTS is low; therefore, maintenance of high vaccination coverage against COVID-19 should be continued.","output":"COVID-19 vaccines and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How has the informality of urban slums exposed a gap in policy formulation and research questions in the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic? This paper seeks to identify the appropriate questions and policy frame that would assist future researchers and policymakers on the subject of pandemics in densely populated urban settlements. The authors argue that the nexus between asking the appropriate questions and developing appropriate policy response measures during a pandemic can significantly impact the outcome of the response. The paper examines how the government of Kenya's response to the COVID-19 pandemic reveals a deep-rooted socio-economic and cultural inequality when \\"blanket\\" policies are adopted without taking into consideration the unique dynamics characterizing the society. The findings show that the effectiveness of implementing COVID-19 containment policies such as lockdowns, the cession of movement, working from home, distance learning, and social distancing are affected by other factors such as the nature of jobs, one's income levels, where someone lives, cultural beliefs, access to water, sanitation, internet, and medical facilities. This means that a significant number of people within the society experience a double tragedy from the pandemic and impact of government response measures. Yet most of the existing literature has focused on the causes, spread, and impact of the pandemic on health institutions, economies, and public health with little emphasis on the impact on policy measures especially on the vulnerable segments of the society. This paper, therefore, looks at the question of how the various public health intervention strategies disrupt or construct the livelihood of the already complex informal settlement. It provides policymakers and researchers with a number of questions that can frame policy and research during a pandemic with important consideration to urban informality.","output":"Policy and research frame of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: reflections on urban informality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the causal relationship between tourism expansion and economic development in Taiwan.

This planetary event started in Turkestan and hit the Russian Empire, before reaching all European countries, the United States of America, and the whole world. Contemporaries were surprised by its high contagiousness as evidenced by attack rates averaging 60% in urban populations, its rapid spread in successive waves circling the globe in a few months by rail and sea, and the tendency of the disease to relapse. Despite its low case-fatality rate (0.10%-0.28%), it is estimated to have caused one million deaths worldwide. On serological grounds, it is generally accepted that the causative agent of Russian influenza was Myxovirus influenzae, the virus identified for all influenza pandemics since the \\"Spanish flu\\" of 1918. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has underscored the extraordinary epidemic potential of coronaviruses, this assumption has recently been questioned. Coronaviruses come from wild reservoirs (bats, rodents, birds, ). They induce respiratory symptoms mimicking influenza, possibly leading to respiratory distress with pneumonia. In addition to the Covid-19 pandemic, recent deadly and limited epidemics, such as SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012, have occurred. Russian influenza presented as an influenza-like syndrome with clinical peculiarities (multivisceral and neurological involvement, skin rash, early iterative relapses), evoking some particularities of Covid-19. Four other coronaviruses circulating in the human population for decades (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1) have been found to be responsible for 15 to 30% of seasonal colds. All of these viruses are of animal origin. Recently, phylogenetic studies have revealed the genetic proximity between a bovine coronavirus BCoV and the human virus HCoV-OC43, indicating that the latter emerged around 1890, at the time of the Russian flu, when an epizootic was raging among cattle throughout Europe.

No meta-analysis has explored the impact of varied definitions of liver injury on the reported prevalence of liver injury. Moreover, few studies reported the extent of hypertransaminasemia stratified by COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Embase. The pooled prevalence of liver injury and hypertransaminasemia was estimated. Results: In total, 60 studies were included. The overall prevalence of liver injury was 25%. Compared to subgroups with the non-strict definition of liver injury (33%) and subgroups without giving detailed definition (26%), the subgroup with a strict definition had a much lower prevalence of liver injury (9%). The overall prevalence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation was 19% and 22%. The prevalence of elevated ALT and AST were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 cases compare to non-severe cases (31% vs 16% and 44% vs 11%). In critically ill and fatal cases, no difference was found in the prevalence of elevated ALT (24% vs 30%) or AST (54% vs 49%). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the adjusted prevalence of ALT elevation, AST elevation, and liver injury decreased to 14%, 7%, and 12%. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of liver injury and hypertransaminasemia in COVID-19 patients might be overestimated. Only a small fraction of COVID-19 patients have clinically significant liver injury. The prevalence of hypertransaminasemia was significantly higher in severe COVID-19 cases compare to non-severe cases.

The B.1.1.7 variant has been linked to increased morbidity rates, transmissibility, and potentially mortality. To assess viral fitness in vivo and to address whether the B.1.1.7 variant is capable of immune escape, we conducted infection and reinfection studies in naive and convalescent Syrian hamsters (>10 months old). Nasal wash samples from hamsters infected by a B.1.1.7 variant exhibited slightly higher viral RNA levels but lower infectious titers than those from B.1 (G614) variant-infected hamsters, and the two variants induced comparable lung pathologies in hamsters. Despite a sporadic and transient low-level infection in the nasal cavity, convalescent hamsters that had recovered from a previous USA-WA1 isolate (D614) infection displayed no observable clinical signs or lung pathology following B.1.1.7 rechallenge. Altogether, our study did not find that the B.1.1.7 variant significantly differs from the B.1 variant in pathogenicity in Syrian hamsters and that a heterologous natural infection-induced immunity confers protection against a secondary challenge by the B1.1.7 variant. IMPORTANCE The rapid emergence of several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 calls for evaluations of viral fitness and pathogenicity in animal models in order to understand the mechanism of enhanced transmission and the possible increases in morbidity and mortality rates. Here, we demonstrated that immunity naturally acquired through a prior infection with the first-wave variant does confer nearly complete protection against the B.1.1.7 variant in Syrian hamsters upon reexposure. Strikingly, although the B.1.1.7 variant appears to replicate to a higher level in the nose than the ancestral B.1 variant, it does not induce more severe lung pathology in hamsters.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Infection of Syrian Hamster Does Not Cause More Severe Disease, and Naturally Acquired Immunity Confers Protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Throughout recent studies, data suggests high viral load in the plasma and nasopharynx of patients with severe SARS-CoV2 infection is associated with disease severity (mortality, length of hospitalization, and risk of intubation). Here, we evaluated whether viral load in the airway is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV2. Methods: Lower airway samples in 148 patients from an academic center that were admitted to the ICU (dates: March 10th to May 10th, 2020) with severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and underwent bronchoscopy for airway clearance and/or tracheostomy. Clinical outcome was defined as  28 Day mechanical ventilation vs. &gt; 28 Day mechanical ventilation vs. death. Post-admission followup time was 232 [IQR 226-237] days. RNA was isolated in parallel using zymoBIOMICS? DNA/RNA Miniprep Kit (Cat: R2002) as per manufacturer's instructions. Viral load was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT -PCR) targeting the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene and an additional primer/probe set to detect the human RNase P gene (RP). Results: Among this bronchoscopy cohort, n=58 39% of the subjects were successfully extubated within 28 days of initiation of mechanical ventilation, n=56 38% required prolonged mechanical ventilation and n=34 23% died. We evaluated the viral load by rRT-PCR for SARSCoV2 N gene adjusted by human RP gene throughout the respiratory tract using supraglottic samples and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained during bronchoscopy. Paired analysis of upper and lower airway samples shows that there is a subset of subjects (n=31, 21%) where there is greater viral load in the BAL than in the supraglottic area supporting topographical differences in viral replication (Fig 1A). BAL samples from subjects that died had higher viral load in their lower airways than patients that survived, even after adjusting for confounders such as age, gender, BMI and timing of sample collection (Fig 1B magenta dots (deceased) vs. yellow/green dots (alive)). Conclusions: Using samples obtained via bronchoscopy we identified that in a subset of subjects with acute SARS-CoV2 infection, the lower airways are the predominant site for viral replication. From our study, it is unclear if the higher viral load reflects host co-morbidies (e.g., diabetes or immunosuppression) or viral factors favoring higher replication. High viral load can be used as a predictor for disease severity upon hospital admission as viral load in the lower airways correlated with poor outcomes.","output":"Evaluation of the airway viral load in acute sars-cov2 infection as a predictor of clinical outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Engaging families through patient- and family-centered care (PFCC), the NICU nurse upholds the core concepts providing holistic care The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic altered the daily routine of visiting parents to hospitals around the nation, particularly for pediatric and neonatal populations Methods This paper describes innovative strategies implemented in a large Level IV NICU to promote the core concepts of PFCC that ensured parent-infant bonding while limiting exposure to a pandemic infection, such as COVID-19 Discussion Strategies discussed include virtual visits between parents and infants to promote bonding;virtual parent support groups to encourage information sharing;remote music therapy options which included take-home music kits;diaries, albums, and celebration boards to support participation;among others Parent collaboration throughout implementation promoted partnership Conclusion Utilizing a variety of unique and innovative approaches to promote PFCC strategies became a critical component of routine planning and care delivery for one large neonatal intensive care unit","output":"Engaging parents of hospitalized neonates during a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Electronic cigarettes have become increasingly popular over the last 10 years. These devices represent a new paradigm for tobacco control offering smokers an opportunity to inhale nicotine without inhaling tobacco smoke. To date there are no definite conclusions regarding the safety and long-term health effects of electronic cigarettes; however, there is evidence that they are being marketed online as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes. This scoping review aims to identify and describe the breadth of messages (eg, health, smoking-cessation and price related claims) presented in online electronic cigarette promotions and discussions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A scoping review will be undertaken adhering to the methodology outlined in The Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Scoping Reviews. Six key electronic databases will be searched to identify eligible studies. Studies must be published in English between 2007 and 2017, examine and/or analyse content captured from online electronic cigarette promotions or discussions and report results for electronic cigarettes separately to other forms of tobacco delivery. Studies will be screened initially by title and abstract, followed by full-text review. Results of the search strategy will be reported in a PRISMA flow diagram and presented in tabular form with accompanying narrative summary. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The methodology consists of reviewing and collecting data from publicly available studies, and therefore does not require ethics approval. Results will be published in a peer reviewed journal and be presented at national/international conferences. Additionally, findings will be disseminated via social media and online platforms. Advocacy will be key to informing policy makers of regulatory and health issues that need to be addressed.

The aim of this study was to understand current feelings and concerns about seeking and receiving orthopaedic care 9 mo into the global pandemic. Methods: Utilizing a survey developed to evaluate the attitudes and beliefs from healthcare respondents about receiving care during the COVID-19 pandemic, an updated and revised version, evaluating changes in perception of respondents 9 mo into the pandemic, was distributed to a group of panelists by email. Results: Out of 1200 individuals, 197 (16%) completed the survey. A majority of respondents reported high level of comfort in the immediate or near-term receiving care in an orthopaedic clinic, urgent care clinic specifically for orthopaedics, or in an emergency room. Six percent of respondents reported a delay in seeking orthopaedic care despite COVID-19 concerns that occurred between studies. Respondents reported their primary reason for delaying care was because of concerns for risk of COVID-19 exposure from other patients (83%). More than 75% of respondents stated they are extremely or very likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to the public. Respondents had a generally negative outlook on pandemic efforts locally to globally. Conclusions: Despite dismal overall perceptions regarding the outlook of the pandemic;consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable obtaining orthopaedic care. The ability of healthcare providers and practices to adherence to safety protocols will remain essential to maintaining consumer trust and confidence.

Mouse alveolar monocyte RAW264.7 was used as blank control, and viral pneumonia cell model was prepared by infecting cells with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). NDR1 overexpression vector and siRNA interference sequences were synthesized, and overexpression/silence NDR1 cell model was fabricated. About 50 ng/mL interleukin 17 (IL-17) was given to stimulate. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qRCR), and Western blot were performed to detect cytokines and chemokines, mRNA of inflammatory factors, and signal molecule protein expression. Notably, RSV infection increased RSV-F mRNA in RAW264.7 cells and reduced NDR1 mRNA and protein. Secretion levels of IL-6, interferon  (IFN-), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL20) increased in the model group versus blank control (P< 0.05). IL-6, IFN-, tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-), and toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mRNA were up-regulated (P < 0.05). Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), p38 protein phosphorylation, human recombinant 1 (TBK1), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B) protein levels increased (P < 0.05). After overexpression of NDR1, the secretion levels of cytokines and chemokines, inflammatory factors mRNA, and signal molecule protein increased significantly. After NDR1 was silenced, cytokines and chemokines, inflammatory factors mRNA, and signal molecule protein were not significantly different versus blank control group (P > 0.05). In short, NDR1 regulated innate immune response to viral pneumonia induced by IL-17, which can be used as a new target for the treatment of IL-17-induced inflammatory response and autoimmune diseases.","output":"Molecular Mechanism of Biofilm Locator Protein Kinase Dbf2p-related kinase 1 in Regulating Innate Immune Response to Interleukin 17-induced Viral Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to describe the development of a general medicine student workbook to standardize acute care inpatient fourth-year pharmacy rotations among faculty with varied pharmacy practice sites. METHODS: Four faculty designed an advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) student workbook on general medicine topics consisting of short answer and multiple-choice questions to ensure standardization by exposing all students to the same topics. A pre- and posttest was administered on the first and last day of the five-week rotation block to evaluate the effects of the APPE workbook on student understanding of general medicine topics. A paired t-test was used to evaluate the significance of the difference in test scores. RESULTS: The average of the posttest exam was found to be significantly higher after the completion of the student workbook. The average grade on the pre-rotation 30-item exam was 22.8 (76.73%) and the post-rotation 30-item exam was 25.7 (86.26%), with a difference of 9.53% (P < .001, 95% CI = 7.11 to 11.96). CONCLUSIONS: Creating a standardized student workbook for an inpatient acute care rotation was a valuable addition. All students assigned to the faculty involved were exposed to the same topics despite variability in preceptors and practice sites. Overall the verbal feedback from the students was positive about the student workbook and discussions, especially since the information was applicable to their patients on rotation.

Comparative expression in bacterial, insect, mammalian and plant-based platforms enabled the identification of new antigen designs with superior quality and high suitability as diagnostic reagents. Both tests scored excellently in clinical validations with multi-centric specificity and sensitivity cohorts and showed unprecedented correlation with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers. Orthogonal testing increased assay specificity to 99.8%, thereby enabling robust serodiagnosis in low-prevalence settings.

To clearly recognize its impact, it is important to comprehend the complex relationship between Covid-19 and other diseases. It is also being observed that people with good immune system are less susceptible to the disease. It is perceived that if a correlation between Covid-19, other diseases, and diet is realized, then caregivers would be able to enhance their further course of medical action and recommendations. Network Analysis is one such technique that can bring forth such complex interdependencies and associations. In this paper, a Network AnalysisCbased approach has been proposed for analyzing the interplay of diets/foods along with Covid-19 and other diseases. Relationships between Covid-19, diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and diets have been curated, visualized, and further analyzed in this study so as to predict unknown associations. Network algorithms including Louvain graph algorithm (LA), K nearest neighbors (KNN), and Page rank algorithms (PR) have been employed for predicting a total of 60 disease-diet associations, out of which 46 have been found to be either significant in disease risk prevention/mitigation or in its progression as validated using PubMed literature.

The authors worked to fill this gap by quantifying the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility by income in Greater Houston, Texas. We determined human mobility using pseudonymized, spatially disaggregated cell phone location data. A longitudinal study across estimated income groups was conducted by measuring the total travel distance, radius of gyration, number of visited locations, and per-trip distance in April 2020 compared to the data in a baseline. An apparent disparity in mobility was found across estimated income groups. In particular, there was a strong negative correlation ( = -0.90) between a travelers estimated income and travel distance in April. Disparities in mobility adaptability were further shown since those in higher income brackets experienced larger percentage drops in the radius of gyration and the number of distinct visited locations than did those in lower income brackets. The findings of this study suggest a need to understand the reasons behind the mobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the pandemic.

They are designed to detect either a SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen or IgG and IgM antibodies binding to it. Among the binding antibodies, a special type of functional antibodies that block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 virus and its human receptor, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), are of particular interest to public as well as in vaccination management. However as of today, POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs remain under late stage of development.Scope and method:In this review, we first summarize the importance of awareness and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in the combat against COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, we compare the available methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Next, we describe challenges in the development of a rapid lateral flow test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Finally, we outline its product formats and applications in research and in disease management. Conclusion:Vaccine effectiveness is unknown for an individual unless measured. NAb level is the most viable measurement for vaccine effectiveness or immunity. A broadly accessible NAb POCT is urgently needed.","output":"Rapid lateral flow tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: After prolonged hospitalization, the assessment of nutritional status and the identification of adequate nutritional support is of paramount importance. In this observational study, we aimed at assessing the presence of a malnutrition condition in SARS-Cov2 patients after the acute phase and the effects of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program on nutritional and functional status. METHODS: We recruited 48 patients (26 males/22 females) admitted to our Rehabilitation Unit after discharge from acute Covid Hospitals in northern Italy with negative swab for SARS-Cov2. We used the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria to identify patients with different degrees of malnutrition. Patients underwent a 3 to 4-week individual multidisciplinary rehabilitation program consisting of nutritional intervention (energy intake 27to30 kcal/die/kg and protein intake 1-1.3 g/die/kg), exercise for total body conditioning and progressive aerobic exercise with cycle- and arm-ergometer (45 min, 5 days/week). At admission and discharge from our Rehabilitation Unit, body composition and phase angle (PhA) (BIA101 Akern), muscle strength (handgrip, HG) and physical performance (Timed-Up-and-Go, TUG) were assessed. RESULTS: At admission in all patients the mean weight loss, as compared to the habitual weight, was -12.1 (7.6)%, mean BMI was 25.9 (7.9) kg/m2, mean Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Index (ASMI) was 6.6 (1.7) kg/m2 for males and 5.4 (1.4) kg/m2 for females, mean phase angle was 2.9 (0.9), mean muscle strength (HG) was 21.1 (7.8) kg for males and 16.4 (5.9) kg for females, mean TUG value was 23.7 (19.2) s. Based on GLIM criteria 29 patients (60% of the total) showed a malnutrition condition. 7 out of those 29 patients (24%) presented a mild/moderate grade and 22 patients (76%) a severe grade. After a rehabilitation program of an average duration of 25 days (range 13-46) ASMI increased, with statistically significant differences only in females (p = 0.001) and HG improved only in males (p = 0.0014). In all of the patients, body weight did not change, CRP/albumin (p < 0.05) and TUG (p < 0.001) were reduced and PhA increased (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We diagnosed a malnutrition condition in 60% of our post SARS-Cov2 patients. An individualized nutritional intervention with adequate energy and protein intake combined with tailored aerobic and strengthening exercise improved nutritional and functional status.","output":"Nutritional status in post SARS-Cov2 rehabilitation patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the COVID-19 epidemic, Spain was one of the countries with the highest number of infections and a high mortality rate.

One particular device that has been the focus of several recent published works is the dynamic collimation system (DCS), which provides energy-specific collimation by intercepting the scanned proton beam as it nears to target edge with a set of orthogonal trimmer blades. While several computational studies have shown that this dynamic collimator can provide additional healthy tissue sparing, there has not been any rigorous experimental work to benchmark the theoretical models used in these initial studies. Therefore, it was the purpose of this work to demonstrate an experimental method that could integrate an experimental prototype with a clinical PBS system and benchmark the Monte Carlo methods that have been used to model the DCS. METHODS: An experimental DCS prototype was designed and built in house to actively collimate individual proton beamlets during PBS within a well-characterized experimental setup. Monte Carlo methods were initially used to assess construction tolerances and later benchmarked against measurements, including integral depth dose and lateral asymmetric beamlet profiles. The experimental apparatus and measurement geometry were modeled using MCNP6 benchmarked from measurements performed at the Northwestern Chicago Proton Center. RESULTS: Gamma analysis tests were used to evaluate the agreement between the measured and simulated profiles with a strict 1 mm/1% criteria and 5% dose threshold. Excellent agreement was observed between the simulated and measured profiles, which included 1 mm/1% gamma analysis pass rates of at least 100% and 95% for the integral depth dose (IDD) profiles and lateral profiles, respectively. Differences in the relative profile shape were observed experimentally between beamlets collimated on- and off-axis, which was attributed to the partial transmission of the beam through an unfocused collimator. Exposure rates resulting from the activation of the device were monitored with survey meter measurements and were found to agree with Monte Carlo estimates of the exposure rate to within 20%. CONCLUSION: A DCS prototype was constructed and integrated into a clinical dose delivery system. While the results of this work are not exhaustive, they demonstrate the effects of beam source divergence, device activation, and beamlet deflection during scanning, which were found to be successfully modeled using Monte Carlo methods and experimentally benchmarked. Excellent agreement was achieved between the simulated and measured lateral spot profiles of collimated beamlets delivered on- and off-axis in PBS. The Monte Carlo models adequately predicted the measured elevated plateau region in the integral depth-dose profiles from the low-energy scatter off the collimators.","output":"Experimental and Monte Carlo characterization of a dynamic collimation system prototype for pencil beam scanning proton therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Revisions made on October 21, 2020 Added links to the updated close contact definition Updated language to align with updated definition These interim considerations on SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies for non-healthcare workplaces during the COVID-19 pandemic are based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of COVID-19 as of the date of posting, July 22, 2020 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update these considerations as needed and as additional information becomes available Please check the CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance Purpose The purpose of this document is to provide employers with strategies for consideration of incorporating testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into a workplace COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plan Employers are encouraged to collaborate with state, territorial, tribal and local health officials to determine whether and how to implement the following testing strategies and which one(s) would be most appropriate for their circumstances These considerations are meant to supplement, not replace, any federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which workplaces must comply These strategies should be carried out in a manner consistent with law and regulation, including laws protecting employee privacy and confidentiality They should also be carried out consistent with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidance regarding permissible testing policies and procedures Employers paying for testing of employees should put procedures in place for rapid notification of results and establish appropriate measures based on testing results including instructions regarding self-isolation and restrictions on workplace access","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Testing Strategy: Considerations for Non-Healthcare Workplaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 spread rapidly and jeopardised the physicians with not only treatment but also with limited resources and new working style.

Focusing on 1-dimensional systems, we present a general method and derive explicit expressions of this joint distribution for several representative examples of Markovian search processes. In addition, we obtain a general scaling form, which holds also for non Markovian processes and captures the general dependence of the joint distribution on its space and time variables.

Several studies provide an initial indication of the possible role of pre-existing immunity, whether cross-immunity or not. The possible role of latent tuberculosis (TB) and malaria has been suggested to create innate cross heterogeneous immunity. In this study, we looked for the influence of these factors on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality in malaria-endemic countries.

Data subjected to testing included TB prevalence, Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccine coverage, malaria incidence, and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: Hierarchical multiple regression type of analysis was used for data analyses. TB prevalence per 100,000 population standardized to BCG coverage rates was taken as a direct factor in the test. Malaria incidence per 1000 population was considered an intermediate factor. The outcome was COVID-19 mortality per million population. RESULTS: The results showed with robust statistical support that standardized TB prevalence was significantly associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality.

Methods: We identified two age-based pediatric cohorts in the United States using the MHS Data Repository. We tracked them for BMI from 2009 to 2016. We calculated BMI percentiles and z-scores using validated growth charts, and biologically implausible BMI z-scores were removed from analyses. Using the Stuart-Maxwell test, we assessed the percent change in BMI categorization from 2009 to 2016 and stratified by age group. Results: Our cohort consisted of 130,675 pediatric patients (52.2% males and 47.8% females). The proportion in each BMI categorization changed significantly from 2009 to 2016 in all groups (p < 0.001).

METHODS Retrospective chart review of all transmasculine patients with phalloplasty undergoing penile prosthesis placement between 4/14/2017 and 2/11/2020 (80 patients). OUTCOMES Independent variables include implant type, previous genital surgeries, and simultaneous genital surgeries. Dependent variables include prosthesis infection and mechanical complication (device malfunction, dislodgement, erosion). RESULTS There was an overall complication requiring surgery rate of 36% and infection rate of 20% (15/67 for inflatable prostheses and 1/13 for semirigid), with 14% (11/80) experiencing infection requiring removal. Differences in infection rates appeared insignificant across categories of previous surgery or with simultaneous surgery, but we did notice a markedly lower rate for semirigid prostheses compared to inflatable. There was a significant relationship between infection and case number, with the probability of infection decreasing over time. Device loss at 9 months was 21% overall. Preoperative conditions of the neophallus such as prior stricture correction and perioperative factors such as simultaneous clean and clean-contaminated procedures seemed to pose no additional increase in complication rates. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Type and number of prior and simultaneous non-prosthetic surgeries should not be considered as a risk factor for penile prosthesis after phalloplasty for transmasculine patients, even those that are clean-contaminated STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Our cohort size is large compared to currently available studies, although not large enough to generate sufficient power for group comparisons. We have reported every genital surgical step between phalloplasty and penile prosthesis placement and recorded complications with subsequent devices after failure.

Controls were frequency matched to cases by age and length of stay. Final sample included 170 cases and 324 controls. Neighborhood-level factors were measured using American Community Survey data. Multilevel models were used to examine infection by census tract, deprivation index, race/ethnicity, insurance type, referral location, antibiotic use, and proton-pump inhibitor use. RESULTS Patients on Medicare compared to private insurance had 2.04 times (95% CI, 1.31-3.20) the odds of infection after adjusting for all covariables.

To determine optimal scanning parameters for commonly-used applicators. MATERIALS AND METHODS Applicators were placed in ex-vivo cow livers with implanted mock tumors, surrounded by bolus gel. Various CT scans were performed at 440mA with 5mm thickness changing kVp, scan time, ASiR, scan type, pitch, and reconstruction algorithm. Four radiologists blindly scored the images for image quality and artifact quantitatively. RESULTS A significant relationship between probe, kVp level, ASiR level, and reconstruction algorithm was observed concerning both image artifact and image quality (both p=<0.0001). Specifically, there are certain combinations of kVp, ASiR, and reconstruction algorithm that yield better images than other combinations. In particular, one probe performed equivalently or better than any competing probe considered here, regardless of kVp, ASiR, and reconstruction algorithm combination. CONCLUSION The findings illustrate the overall interaction of the effects of kVp, ASiR, and reconstruction algorithm within and between probes, so that radiologists may easily reference optimal imaging performance for a certain combinations of kVp, ASiR, reconstruction algorithm and probes at their disposal.

Concordantly, high app adoption rates were a stipulated prerequisite for success. Early studies on potential adoption were encouraging. Several factors predicting adoption rates were investigated, especially pertaining to user characteristics. Since then, several countries have released COVID-19 contact tracing apps. OBJECTIVE: This studys primary aim is to investigate the quality characteristics of national European COVID-19 contact tracing apps, thereby shifting attention from user to app characteristics. The secondary aim is to investigate associations between app quality and adoption. Finally, app features contributing to higher app quality were identified. METHODS: Eligible COVID-19 contact tracing apps were those released by national health authorities of European Union member states, former member states, and countries of the European Free Trade Association, all countries with comparable legal standards concerning personal data protection and app use voluntariness. The Mobile App Rating Scale was used to assess app quality. An interdisciplinary team, consisting of two health and two humanCcomputer interaction scientists, independently conducted Mobile App Rating Scale ratings. To investigate associations between app quality and adoption rates and infection rates, Bayesian linear regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: We discovered 21 national COVID-19 contact tracing apps, all demonstrating high quality overall and high-level functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. However, the average app adoption rate of 22.9% (SD 12.5%) was below the level recommended by simulation studies. Lower levels of engagement-oriented app design were detected, with substantial variations between apps. By regression analyses, the best-case adoption rate was calculated by assuming apps achieve the highest ratings. The mean best-case adoption rates for engagement and overall app quality were 39.5% and 43.6%, respectively. Higher adoption rates were associated with lower cumulative infection rates. Overall, we identified 5 feature categories (symptom assessment and monitoring, regularly updated information, individualization, tracing, and communication) and 14 individual features that contributed to higher app quality. These 14 features were a symptom checker, a symptom diary, statistics on COVID-19, app use, public health instructions and restrictions, information of burden on health care system, assigning personal data, regional updates, control over tracing activity, contact diary, venue check-in, chats, helplines, and app-sharing capacity. CONCLUSIONS: European national health authorities have generally released high quality COVID-19 contact tracing apps, with regard to functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. However, the apps engagement-oriented design generally was of lower quality, even though regression analyses results identify engagement as a promising optimization target to increase adoption rates. Associations between higher app adoption and lower infection rates are consistent with simulation study results, albeit acknowledging that app use might be part of a broader set of protective attitudes and behaviors for self and others. Various features were identified that could guide further engagement-enhancing app development.","output":"Quality and Adoption of COVID-19 Tracing Apps and Recommendations for Development: Systematic Interdisciplinary Review of European Apps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multi-heterogeneous sensor information fusion under traditional technology conditions was slow, inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent, which led to errors in data analysis and affect evaluation results.

Despite much effort in the development of DUV LEDs, the device temperature and ideality factor are key parameters of devices, which are often neglected. Here, we developed a simple and convenient method to study the behavior of a 280 nm AlGaN-based DUV LED, obtaining the electrical, optical, and thermal properties within one measurement. From the experimental results, we find that the light output power and wall-plug efficiency of the AlGaN-based DUV LED are strongly affected by device temperature, ideality factor (beta), and series resistance (R-s). beta decreases from 9.3 to 8.1 at 40 mA when the temperature increases from 302 to 317 K. We compared these results with simulations and found that the high potential barriers inside the device and the carrier concentration in n-type or p-type layers, especially the hole concentration in p-type layers, are the two key factors for the high value of the ideality factor from the LED structure. As the device temperature increases, carriers with higher energy would overcome some potential barriers and Mg acceptor activation would be more efficient, which are beneficial for carrier transportation. However, these also lead to the carrier overflow and weaken the radiative recombination rate. The trade-off role of device temperature in carriers between transportation and overflow is needed to be considered in the future development of DUV LEDs with higher efficiency and higher brightness.","output":"Temperature-dependent study on AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode for the origin of high ideality factor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To determine how several existing crisis standards of care triage protocols would have distinguished between patients with coronavirus disease 2019 requiring intensive care Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: Single urban academic medical center Patients: One-hundred twenty patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who required intensive care and mechanical ventilation Interventions: None Measurements and Main Results: The characteristics of each patient at the time of ICU triage were used to determine how patients would have been prioritized using four crisis standards of care protocols The vast majority of patients in the cohort would have been in the highest priority group using a triage protocol focusing on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment alone Prioritization based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and 1-year life expectancy would have resulted in only slightly more differentiation between patients Prioritization based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and 5-year life expectancy would have added significant additional differentiation depending on how priority groups were defined Conclusions: There is considerable controversy regarding the use of criteria other than prognosis for short-term survival in initial allocation of critical care resources under crisis standards of care triage protocols To the extent that initial triage protocols would not create sufficient differentiation between patients, effectively resulting in a first-come, first-served initial allocation of resources, it is important to focus on how resources would be reallocated in the event of ongoing scarcity","output":"Existing Crisis Standards of Care Triage Protocols May Not Significantly Differentiate Between Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Who Require Intensive Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After 12 months of viral circulation, the SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people around the world, leaving hundreds of thousands dead.

Methods: After confirming the positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for patients, we used a scoring system which included: the age of patient (less than 40 years and > 40 years), early vital signs at the time of admission, lab tests including C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood count (WBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, chest imaging findings, comorbidity and shortness of breath. Results: The clinical score obtained for each variable in this scoring system was a number between 0 and 3. The total score was a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 17. A higher score indicated an increase in the intensity and the need for intensive care. These scores were classified into 3 groups: 0-4, 5-10 and above 10. In the next stage, patients were divided into three groups: mild, moderate and severe. In this regard, patients with mild symptoms were suggested to receive home quarantine and home treatment, patients with moderate symptoms were recommended hospitalization and medical care, and finally patients with severe symptoms were inclined to intensive care.

It is also a region, like many parts of the country, marked by food insecurity, even amongst its rural agricultural populations. In a novel approach, this paper addresses the networks of exchanges of local food and their relationship to the agrobiodiversity of traditional riverine peoples (ribeirinho) households in the Central Amazon. Methodologically, it involves mapping the social networks and affinities between households, inventories of known species, and, finally, statistical tests of the relationships between network and subsequent agrobiodiversity. RESULTS: The diversity per area of each land type where food cultivation or management takes place shows how home gardens, fields and orchards are areas of higher diversity and intense cultivation compared to fallow areas. Our findings, however, indicate that a households income does appear to be strongly associated with the total agrobiodiversity across cultivation areas. In addition, a households agrobiodiversity is significantly associated with the frequency and intensity of food exchanges between households. CONCLUSIONS: Agrobiodiversity cannot be considered separate from the breadth of activities focused on sustenance and yields from the cash economy, which riverine people engage in daily. It seems to be connected to quotidian social interactions and exchanges in both predictable and occasionally subtler ways. Those brokers who serve as prominent actors in rural communities may not always be the most productive or in possession of the largest landholdings, although in some cases they are.

This study explored attitudes towards integration of traditional healers into the provision of HIV self-testing kits and sputum collection containers. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in 2019C2020 in Shiselweni region, Eswatini. Eight male traditional healers were trained on HIV and tuberculosis care including distribution of HIV self-testing kits and sputum collection containers. Attitudes towards the intervention were elicited through in-depth interviews with the eight traditional healers, ten clients, five healthcare workers and seven focus group discussions with community members. Interviews and group discussions were conducted in SiSwati, audio-recorded, translated and transcribed into English. Data were coded inductively and analysed thematically. RESULTS: 81 HIV self-testing kits and 24 sputum collection containers were distributed by the healers to 99 clients, with 14% of participants reporting a reactive HIV self-test result. The distribution of sputum containers did not result in any tuberculosis diagnoses, as samples were refused at health centres. Traditional healers perceived themselves as important healthcare providers, and after training, were willing and able to distribute HIV self-test kits and sputum containers to clients. Many saw themselves as peers who could address barriers to health-seeking among Swazi men that reflected hegemonic masculinities and patriarchal attitudes. Traditional healers were considered to provide services that were private, flexible, efficient and non-judgemental, although some clients and community members expressed concerns over confidentiality breaches. Attitudes among health workers were mixed, with some calling for greater collaboration with traditional healers and others expressing doubts about their potential role in promoting HIV and tuberculosis services. Specifically, many health workers did not accept sputum samples collected outside health facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Offering HIV self-testing kits and sputum containers through traditional healers led to high HIV yields, but no TB diagnoses. The intervention was appreciated by healers clients, due to the cultural literacy of traditional healers and practical considerations.

At present, only insufficient information is available on currently circulating PEDV strains in Europe and their impact on the European swine industry. In this case report, we present epidemic outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea in three farms in South-Western Germany. CASE PRESENTATION: Epidemic outbreaks of diarrhea affecting pigs of all age groups were reported in three farms, one fattening farm and two piglet producing farms, in South-Western Germany between May and November 2014. In the fattening farm yellowish, watery diarrhea without evidence of mucus or blood was associated with a massive reduction of feed consumption. Severity of clinical signs and mortality in young suckling pigs varied significantly between the two affected sow farms. While mortality in suckling piglets reached almost 70 % in one sow herd, no increase in suckling piglet mortality was observed in the second sow farm. In all three cases, PEDV was confirmed in feces and small intestines by RT-qPCR. Phylogenetic analyses based on full-length PEDV genomes revealed high identity among strains from all three herds. Moreover, the German strains showed very high nucleotide identity (99.4 %) with a variant of PEDV (OH851) that was isolated in the United States in January 2014. This strain with insertions and deletions in the S-gene (so called INDEL strains) was reported to show lower virulence. Slightly lower identities were found with other strains from the US and Asia. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic information on the distribution of PEDV strains in Europe is severely lacking. In this case report we demonstrate that acute outbreaks of PEDV occurred in southern Germany in 2014. Current strains were clearly different from isolates found in the 1980s and were closely related to a PEDV variant found in the US in 2014. Moreover, the present case report indicates that variant strains of PEDV, containing insertions and deletions in the S gene, which were reported to be of lower virulence, might be able to cause high mortality in suckling piglets.","output":"Emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in southern Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This document offers a proposal for the elaboration of a triage guideline in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic This proposal includes recommendations on the procedural norms and substantive norms that should govern the allocation and reallocation of therapeutic resources in conditions of extreme scarcity","output":"Proposal for the elaboration of a triage guideline in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of twenty-first century, we are in cruel grip of a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the associated illness being called as COVID-19. Since its outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, there are no medicines to cure the disease till date. Based on their experience, scientists say that developing a coronavirus vaccine could take at least a year. There are many steps in place before the vaccine comes for the distribution like its safety and cost-effectiveness, especially for the developing countries. In this scenario, the only way to prevent the disease is by following certain safety guidelines and to boost up the body's immune system. Zinc, a crucial trace element involved in several biological and metabolic processes, has been found to play a pivotal role in promoting and appropriately regulating the host defense mechanisms against viral infections. Zinc is naturally present in some foods, fortified in others and also available as dietary supplement. The current RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) of zinc is 12 and 10 mg for males and females respectively. Zinc is the second most common trace mineral after iron in the cell. It is present in all organs and tissues in the body as it forms catalytic component of all 6 classes of enzymes encompassing almost 2000 enzymes in the body. Zinc is biologically essential for cellular processes, including growth and development, as well as DNA synthesis and RNA transcription. Zinc deficiency results in a number of metabolic changes besides a compromised immune system.

From an academic standpoint, syndromic surveillance research is by nature multidisciplinary and has been attracting significant attention in recent years. This monograph presents a comprehensive review of the state of the art of syndromic surveillance research and system development efforts from the perspective of information science and technologies. On the basis of a detailed analysis of 50 local, state, national, and international syndromic surveillance systems and a review of about 200 academic publications, in this book we discuss the technical challenges, applicable approaches or solutions, and the current state of system implementation and adoption for key components of syndromic surveillance systems ranging from system architecture, data collection and sharing, data analysis, and data access and visualization. In addition, we present several case studies to compare several state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance systems. The purpose of these case studies is to illustrate the information technology-driven technical discussions in an integrated, real-world context.

In case of Senegal, the country was already facing number of challenges at the inception of the pandemic, including high rates of poverty, prevalence of food insecurity, combined with other biophysical and socioeconomic challenges faced generally in Sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: To understand farmer perceptions of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on agricultural systems and social well-being of smallholder farmers in Senegal. Particular attention was given to potential vulnerabilities and resilience in the targeted farming systems. METHODS: A survey was developed to better understand smallholder farmer perceptions regarding the anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on their agriculture practices and social well-being. The survey was administered (between June 5 and June 20) with smallholder farmers (n = 872) in 14 regions covering all agroecological zones. Variables of interest included perceptions of potential impact on farming systems, agricultural productivity, communities, economics, markets, labor, gendered division of labor, food security, and community well-being. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Across the three farming systems examined (cropping, livestock, and horticulture) significant majorities expressed concerns related to access to inputs, ability to plant (cropping, horticulture), reduction of yields (cropping, horticulture), ability to feed livestock, ability to sell livestock, and the ability to hire labor (horticulture). The majority of respondents also expressed concern that COVID-19 would make it more difficult to get enough food on a regular basis for their household (82.5%); that the markets where they purchase food will either be closed or significantly disrupted (79.5%); that the price of food would increase (73.5%); and the market where they sell their produce/livestock will be either closed or significantly disrupted (73.2%). SIGNIFICANCE: Anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on agriculture will be felt on both the biophysical aspects such as production and access to inputs and socioeconomic aspects such as access to labor, markets, or rapid shifts in demand. Results support the need to use farming systems approach to gather perceived and actual impacts of COVID-19 and warrants a more in-depth examination of agronomic and biophysical issues as well as the impact on the livelihoods and social well-being of families at community and household levels. Further examination will help identify the characteristics that strengthen smallholder farming systems resilience to adjust to anticipated and unanticipated shocks, such as COVID-19, to decrease the negative impacts and increase the rate of recovery.","output":"Smallholder farmer perceptions about the impact of COVID-19 on agriculture and livelihoods in Senegal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The condition of the COVID-19 pandemic can cause changes in social conditions and affect the nutritional status of infants.

However, the development of the next-generation synthetic materials that mimic key aspects of ECM, with hierarchically oriented supramolecular structures, which are simultaneously highly dynamic and responsive to external stimuli, remains a major challenge. Herein, we present supramolecular assemblies formed by motor amphiphiles (MAs), which mimic the structural features of the hydrogel nature of the ECM and additionally show intrinsic dynamic behavior that allow amplifying molecular motions to macroscopic muscle-like actuating functions induced by light. The supramolecular assembly (named artificial muscle) provides an attractive approach for developing responsive ECM mimetic scaffolds for human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). Detailed investigations on the photoisomerization by nuclear magnetic resonance and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, assembled structures by electron microscopy, the photoactuation process, structural order by X-ray diffraction, and cytotoxicity are presented. Artificial muscles of MAs provide fast photoactuation in water based on the hierarchically anisotropic supramolecular structures and show no cytotoxicity. Particularly important, artificial muscles of MAs with adhered hBM-MSCs still can be actuated by external light stimulation, showing their ability to convert light energy into mechanical signals in biocompatible systems. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, these results provide the potential for building photoactuating ECM mimetic scaffolds by artificial muscle-like supramolecular assemblies based on MAs and offer opportunities for signal transduction in future biohybrid systems of cells and MAs.","output":"Photoactuating Artificial Muscles of Motor Amphiphiles as an Extracellular Matrix Mimetic Scaffold for Mesenchymal Stem Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Caveolin-1 (CAV-1) can extensively regulate lipid transportation, cell growth and cell death.

METHODS: Patients (n = 35) of the Follow-Up PreEClampsia (FUPEC) Outpatient Clinic, Erasmus MC, the Netherlands, participated in an anonymous online survey. The main outcomes under study were their perceived determinants of physical activity. Responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen themes emerged from the analysis. Six themes corresponded with motivational processes (future health, perceived ability, attitude, future reward or regret, physical appearance, and doing it for others), two with volitional processes (scheduling and planning), and two with automatic processes (affect and stress). Three themes were classified as environmental factors (time constraint, social support, and physical environment). CONCLUSIONS: A range of facilitating and hindering factors were described by women with prior severe preeclampsia as the determinants of their physical activity.

Approximately 4-8 weeks after social distancing mandates commenced in the state of Massachusetts, 150 patients with fibromyalgia, chronic spine and postsurgical pain completed demographic, pain, social distancing, and validated psychosocial questionnaires. Patients self-reported an overall significant increase in pain severity and pain interference, compared to before social distancing, although both pain severity and interference were quite variable among individuals under conditions of social distancing. Several demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors were associated with greater pain severity and interference during social distancing. Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that female gender, non-white race, lower education, disability, fibromyalgia, and higher pain catastrophizing were independently associated with greater pain severity, while female gender and pain catastrophizing were independently associated greater pain interference.

It is not a fully understood disease with genetic and epigenetic susceptibility and about 80% substantial heritability. The CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1) gene is implicated in neurogenesis, memory, immunity, neuropsychology, and monoamine metabolism. Thus, it is one of the powerful genes involved in the pathogenesis of SCZ. Purpose: To evaluate the possible role of the CSMD1 genes mRNA expression and its serum protein as markers for the early diagnosis of the first-episode SCZ in familial high-risk (FHR) Egyptian children and young adults. Subjects and methods: This caseCcontrol study included 80 first-episode drug-na?ve SCZ patients from FHR Egyptian children and young adults and 80 healthy participants, as controls, from the FHR-susceptible children and young adults but did not develop SCZ. In this study, the CSMD1 genes mRNA expression and CSMD1 serum levels were measured in the peripheral blood, and these levels were correlated with the lipid profile of the study populations. Results: The CSMD1 genes mRNA expression and its protein levels were significantly decreased in the SCZ patients compared to controls. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis succeeded in distinguishing SCZ patients from those not having SCZ using cutoff points of 0.711 and 4.83 ng/mL for the CSMD1 genes mRNA expression and serum protein level, respectively. At these levels, the diagnostic sensitivities were 93.75 and 91.25%; specificity was 92.5%; positive predictive value (PPV) were 92.6 and 92.4%; and negative predictive values (NPVs) were 93.7 and 91.4%, respectively. Also, the ROC curve analysis succeeded in discriminating those with suicidal tendencies. Conclusion: CSMD1 genes mRNA expression might be a reliable and early diagnostic predictor of first-episode SCZ in the FHR Egyptian children and young adults.","output":"mRNA Expression of the CUB and Sushi Multiple Domains 1 (CSMD1) and Its Serum Protein Level as Predictors for Psychosis in the Familial High-Risk Children and Young Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to COVID-19, universities have been facing challenges in generating the best possible experience for students with online academic training programs. To analyze professors' expectations about online education and relate them to student academic performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, and considering the socio-demographic, entry, and prior university performance variables of students. A prospective longitudinal design was used to analyze the expectations of 546 professors (54.8% male) in T1. In T2, the impact of the expectations of 382 of these professors (57.6% men) was analyzed, who taught courses during the first semester to a total of 14,838 university students (44.6% men). Professors' expectations and their previous experience of online courses were obtained during T1, and the students' academic information was obtained in T2. A questionnaire examining the Expectations toward Virtual Education in Higher Education for Professors was used. 84.9% of the professors were considered to have moderate to high skills for online courses. Differences in expectations were found according to the professors' training level. The professors' self-efficacy for online education, institutional engagement, and academic planning had the highest scores. The expectations of professors did not directly change the academic performance of students; however, a moderating effect of professor's expectations was identified in the previous student academic performance relationship on their current academic performance.","output":"Professors' Expectations About Online Education and Its Relationship With Characteristics of University Entrance and Students' Academic Performance During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite various levels of preventive measures, in 2020 many countries have suffered severely from the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.

In this meta-analysis, we identified nine retrospective cohort studies that met inclusion criteria. Anticoagulation did not increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in brain metastasis. In the setting of glioma, anticoagulation resulted in 3.8-fold increase in intracranial hemorrhage. SUMMARY Background Venous thromboembolism commonly occurs in patients with brain tumors. Because of the high rate of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation is commonly questioned. Objective We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate whether therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with brain tumors. Patients/Methods A systematic literature search strategy was conducted. Summary statistics for ICH were obtained by calculating the odds ratio using a random effects model and heterogeneity across studies was estimated by the I(2) statistic. Results A total of nine retrospective cohort studies met the criteria for inclusion. The odds ratio (OR) for ICH in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation versus those who did not receive anticoagulation was 2.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-4.56; I(2) = 46%). In studies evaluating anticoagulation in patients with brain metastases, there was no apparent increased risk of ICH (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.61-1.88; I(2) = 0%). However, in patients with glioma there was an increase in risk of ICH associated with the administration of anticoagulation (OR, 3.75; 95% CI, 1.42-9.95; I(2) = 33%). Conclusions The risk of ICH in patients with brain tumors receiving therapeutic anticoagulation depends on the diagnosis of primary or metastatic brain tumors. Although anticoagulation was not associated with an increased risk of ICH in the setting of brain metastasis, its use resulted in a greater than 3-fold increased risk of ICH in patients with glioma.","output":"A meta-analysis of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with brain tumors receiving therapeutic anticoagulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dance as a treatment to support physical, cognitive and emotional functioning, has gained increased acceptance as a healthcare intervention for people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been far reaching with devastating effects for at-risk populations. To find alternative and safe treatment delivery options during the pandemic has been of utmost importance. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to evaluate the feasibility and the experience of digital dance for people with PD (Dance for PD?) and to examine change in self-reported quality of life, psychological health, subjective cognitive complaints and mental fatigue. METHODS: 23 participants with PD (mean age 70) partook in 10-h weekly digital Dance for PD sessions. Feasibility outcome measures were assessed at post-test. Web-based questionnaires examining quality of life, subjective memory complaints, depression, anxiety and mental fatigue were administered at pre- and post-test. Moreover, nine participants partook in focus group discussions at post-test. RESULTS: The results showed an acceptable feasibility to home-based digital Dance for PD, where 86% of the dance classes were completed, only minor negative side effects were reported (i.e., sore joints), and all experienced the dance classes as motivating and safe to do at home. The majority also reported positive effects on mood and physical functioning. The results from the questionnaires showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms (p = 0.006) and quality of life (p < 0.001) at post-test. In the focus groups, participants indicated that digital dance was a beneficial and enjoyable activity with a strong added value during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, they experienced that digital dance missed some important elements of live dance. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that digital Dance for PD is feasible and holds promise as a viable and safe method to keep people with PD dancing even when physical meetings are not possible. Beyond the pandemic, digital dance could be applied to a wide variety of patient groups including rural populations and patients for whom transportation may not be feasible for practical or financial reasons.

We analyse the French experience of Covid-19 in 2020 by critically reviewing major policy measures implemented during the first two waves of the pandemic. France has struggled to find the right balance between the rock of economic and social damage caused by containment measures and the hard alternative of a rapidly spreading pandemic. The response to the first wave, including a full lock-down, was an emergency response that revealed the low level of preparedness for pandemics and the overly hospital-centred provision of health care in France. During the second wave, this response evolved into a more level strategy trying to reconcile health needs in a broader perspective integrating socio-economic considerations, but without fully managing to put in place an effective health strategy. We conclude that to achieve the right balance, France will have to strengthen health system capacity and improve the cooperation between actors at central and local levels with greater participatory decision-making that takes into account local-level realities and the diversity of needs.","output":"France's response to the Covid-19 pandemic: between a rock and a hard place"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El presente documento describe las medidas adoptadas por el Gobierno nacional para garantizar la prestacin del servicio pblico de transporte en Colombia durante la crisis sanitaria causada por la pandemia del coronavirus covid-19.

World Health Organization (WHO) in its public advisory for COVID-19 pandemic has stressed on physical distancing and this has resulted in discontinuation of in-person undergraduate surgery lectures and demonstrations. Also WHO has laid out directions to deliver only essential health-care services, which has resulted in reduced patient load in didactic surgical clinics and fall in number of planned surgeries and adversely effected the teaching of undergraduate surgery students. So there is an urgent need to reschedule and revise the teaching activities for undergraduate surgery students. Therefore, with this background, we plan to propose certain web-based, distant learning novel strategies to keep the training of undergraduate surgery students rolling. These novel strategies include adopting social media platforms and flip classroom concept to replace in-person lectures, involvement of undergraduate surgery students in telemedicine consultation to substitute didactic clinics, use of multimodal computer-based programs, and use of high-end surgical videos for learning of basic surgical skills.

Serological assays also were carried out. RESULTS: Cultures of Candida from the tongue surfaces were positive in 7 (50.0%) of the 14 patients with HCV infection at least once during IFN therapy. C. albicans was the most common species isolated. The incidence of Candida during treatment with IFN did not increase above that before treatment. Additional oral mucosal lesions were observed in 50.0% (7/14) of patients: OLP in three (21.4%), angular cheilitis in three (21.4%) and recurrent aphthous stomatitis in one (7.1%). OLP occurred in one patient before treatment with IFN, in one during treatment and in one at the end of treatment. 85.7% of the oral lesions were treated with topical steroids. We compared the characteristics of the 7 patients in whom Candida was detected at least once during IFN therapy (group 1) and the 7 patients in whom Candida was not detected during IFN therapy (group 2). The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions (P=0.0075) and incidence of external use of steroids (P=0.0308) in group 1 were significantly higher than in group 2. The average body weight of group 1 decreased significantly compared to group 2 (P=0.0088).

We lack synthesis of the economic costs, impacts, benefit or value of abortion care at the micro-level (i.e., individuals and households). This scoping review examines the microeconomic costs, benefits and consequences of abortion care and policies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Searches were conducted in eight electronic databases and applied inclusion/exclusion criteria using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews. For inclusion, studies must have examined at least one of the following outcomes: costs, impacts, benefits, and value of abortion care or abortion policies. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted for descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Of the 230 included microeconomic studies, costs are the most frequently reported microeconomic outcome (n = 180), followed by impacts (n = 84), benefits (n = 39), and values (n = 26). Individual-level costs of abortion-related care have implications for the timing and type of care sought, globally. In contexts requiring multiple referrals or follow-up visits, these costs are multiplied. The ways in which people pay for abortion-related costs are diverse. The intersection between micro-level costs and delay(s) to abortion-related care is substantial. Individuals forego other costs and expenditures, or are pushed further into debt and/or poverty, in order to fund abortion-related care. The evidence base on the economic impacts of policy or law change is from high-income countries, dominated by studies from the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Delays underpinned by economic factors can thwart care-seeking, affect the type of care sought, and impact the gestational age at which care is sought or reached. The evidence base includes little evidence on the micro-level costs for adolescents. Specific sub-groups of abortion care-seekers (transgendered and/or disabled people) are absent from the evidence and it is likely that they may experience higher direct and indirect costs because they may experience greater barriers to abortion care.","output":"The microeconomics of abortion: A scoping review and analysis of the economic consequences for abortion care-seekers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and its risk factors in an elderly Iranian population METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019. The target population was the subjects aged 60 and over living in Tehran. Multistage cluster sampling was done to select the subjects from all Tehran districts. After an initial interview, all subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examinations including the measurement of visual acuity and refraction as well as slit lamp biomicroscopy to evaluate Meibomian glands. RESULTS: Of 3791 selected subjects, 3310 participated in the study. The data of 3284 participants were analyzed. The mean age of the subjects was 68.24  6.53 years (range: 60-97 years) and 57.8% of them were female. The total prevalence of MGD was 71.2% (68.3-74.1), and 38.1% (8.35-40.4), 30.3% (27.4-33.2), and 2.8% (2-3.6) of the subjects had MGD stage 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The prevalence of MGD was significantly higher in men (p < 0.001) and increased with age from 64.4% in the age group 60-64 years to 82.4% in subjects aged 80 years and over. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of MGD between smokers and nonsmokers; however, severe MGD was more common in smokers. The prevalence of MGD was 76.3% and 68.52% in subjects with and without a history of ocular surgery, respectively. The prevalence of MGD stage 3 and 4 was higher in subjects with a history of ocular surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In line with the results of other studies in Asian countries, this study found a high prevalence of MGD in an elderly population of Iran. It was found that male gender and advanced age were risk factors of MGD and smoking and history of ocular surgery might worsen this disease in MGD patients.","output":"Meibomian gland dysfunction in geriatric population: tehran geriatric eye study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Moral injury among physicians and other health professionals has attracted attention in the mainstream literature, this study aim to assess the psychometric properties of the 10-item Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professional (MISS-HP) among healthcare professionals in China. METHODS: A total of 583 nurses and 2423 physicians were recruited from across mainland China. An online survey was conducted from March 27 to April 26, 2020 (during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic) using the Chinese version of the MISS-HP. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to determine scale structure. RESULTS: Cronbachs  of the scale for both samples was acceptable (0.71 for nurses and 0.70 for physicians), as was test-retest reliability (ICCs for the individual items ranged from 0.41 to 0.74, with 0.77 for the overall scale in physicians). EFA suggested three factors, and the CFA indicated good fit to the data. Convergent validity was demonstrated with the 4-item Expressions of Moral Injury Scale (r = 0.45 for physicians, r = 0.43 for nurses). Discriminant validity was demonstrated by correlations with burnout and well-being (r = 0.34C0.47), and concurrent validity was suggested by correlations with depression and anxiety symptoms (r = 0.37C0.45). Known groups validity was indicated by a higher score in those exposed to workplace violence (B = 4.16, 95%CI: 3.21C5.10, p < 0.001).

This paper aims to present an innovative methodology to increase student awareness about the effects of economic decisions on sustainability. Design/methodology/approach This method uses a videogame and two board games to simulate three spheres of economic interaction, namely, local, national and international. For every sphere, three key economic sectors and their relationships with fundamental sustainable development goals (SDGs) are addressed. This study uses pre- and post-simulation data to analyze the students' perceptions regarding the usefulness of the simulations and their awareness about the effects of economic decisions on sustainability. Findings The implementation of this teaching and learning method demonstrated not only that active learning can effectively increase student awareness about the potential social and environmental consequences of economic decisions but also that students perceive games and simulations as useful teaching and learning tools. Social implications Students in these areas need to learn not only how to transform original ideas into successful projects but also to align financial results with social and environmental objectives. The methodology presented in this research allows to enhance learning from a multi-disciplinary perspective, helping the students to analyze different economic sectors and their connection with a number of SDGs through the lens of public economics.

Even after 11 years of this discovery, the role of this gene in AD has not yet been fully elucidated and the association of its variants was not validated in Latin American populations. We genotyped five CR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs rs6656401, rs3849266, rs2274567, rs4844610, and rs12034383) in up to 162 AD patients and 137 controls through PCR-SSP and iPLEX MassARRAY Platform (Sequenom), and measured soluble CR1 (sCR1) levels in plasma of 40 AD patients and 39 controls with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Homozygosity for haplotype rs3849266*C_rs2274567*A (CA/CA genotype) was associated with susceptibility to AD (OR = 2.94, p = 0.018). Patients presented higher sCR1 levels in plasma than controls (p = 0.038). Furthermore, patients that carry the rs2274567*G allele (p.1208Arg) presented higher sCR1 levels than A/A (p.1208His/His) homozygotes (p = 0.036). This is the first study to validate the association of CR1 polymorphisms with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, as well as to evaluate sCR1 levels in a Latin American population. SNPs present in the regulatory and coding regions of this gene may be playing a key role in the observed association, probably by interfering in A plaques clearance. Inhibition may be due to the increase in local sCR1 levels observed in patients, which may result from polymorphisms leading to larger isoforms of CR1 and/or structural alterations of the protein that makes it less functional, as well as increased vesiculation of the molecules.","output":"First Report of CR1 Polymorphisms and Soluble CR1 Levels Associated with Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) in Latin America."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: When in-person rehabilitation is not feasible, interventions delivered in remote telephone-based sessions may be an option. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether telephone-based reality orientation therapy (T-ROT) can improve cognition, mood, and neuropsychiatric symptoms among patients with major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) who are forced to isolate and also whether T-ROT can relieve the burden of distress among their caregivers. DESIGN: Nonrandomized interventional comparison study. SETTING: Individual telephone calls between practitioners and patients and their caregivers. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven patients (14 in the experimental group, 13 in the control group) with a major NCD and their primary caregivers. INTERVENTION: Ten T-ROT sessions and a pretest-posttest neuropsychological evaluation over 4 wk. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes measured included cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with major NCDs and correlations between changes in patient clinical condition and caregiver stress. Primary outcome measures were two measures of depressive symptoms, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and the Telephone Mini-Mental State Examination, administered at baseline and program discharge. RESULTS: T-ROT significantly outperformed nontreatment on all measures of depression, behavior, cognition, and caregiver burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: T-ROT combined with emotional support appears to be an effective intervention for monitoring and managing the behavioral symptoms of patients with major NCDs who are forced to isolate.

Limited data are available for convalescent patients. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of discharged COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we extracted data for 134 convalescent patients with COVID-19 in Guizhou Provincial Staff Hospital from February 15 to March 31, 2020. Cases were analyzed on the basis of demographic, clinical, and laboratory data as well as radiological features. RESULTS: Of 134 convalescent patients with COVID-19, 19 (14.2%) were severe cases, while 115 (85.8%) were non-severe cases. The median patient age was 33 years (IQR, 21.8 to 46.3), and the cohort included 69 men and 65 women. Compared with non-severe cases, severe patients were older and had more chronic comorbidities, especially hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disease (P < 0.05). Leukopenia was present in 32.1% of the convalescent patients and lymphocytopenia was present in 6.7%, both of which were more common in severe patients. 48 (35.8%) of discharged patients had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, which was more common in adults than in children (40.2% vs 13.6%, P = 0.018). A normal chest CT was found in 61 (45.5%) patients during rehabilitation. Severe patients had more ground-glass opacity, bilateral patchy shadowing, and fibrosis. No significant differences were observed in the positive rate of IgG and/or IgM antibodies between severe and non-severe patients.

This has elevated the importance of certain householdClevel characteristics for individuals current and future wellbeing. The multi-dimensional poverty and health inequalities literature suggests that poor health and socio-economic conditions cluster in the general population, which may exacerbate societal inequalities over time. This study investigates how COVID-19-related health- and socio-economic vulnerabilities occur at the household level, and how they are distributed across household types and geographical areas in the United Kingdom. Using a nationally representative cross-sectional study of UK households and applying principal components analysis, we derived summary measures representing different dimensions of household vulnerabilities critical during the COVID-19 epidemic: health, employment, housing, financial and digital. Our analysis highlights four key findings. First, although COVID-19-related health risks are concentrated in retirement-age households, a substantial proportion of working age households also face these risks. Second, different types of households exhibit different vulnerabilities, with working-age households more likely to face financial and housing precarities, and retirement-age households health and digital vulnerabilities. Third, there are area-level differences in the distribution of household-level -vulnerabilities across England and the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. Fourth, in many households, different dimensions of vulnerabilities intersect; this is especially prevalent among working-age households. The findings imply that the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to significantly vary by household type. Policy measures that aim to mitigate the health and socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic should consider how vulnerabilities cluster and interact with one another across different household types, and how these may exacerbate already existing inequalities.","output":"Intersecting household level health and socio-economic vulnerabilities and the COVID-19 crisis: An analysis from the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been shown that a single parenteral administration of vaccine containing bacterial ligands for TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR9 in mice induced rapid (24 h after administration) and effective (100%), but short-term (96 h) protection against lethal challenge with Salmonella typhimurium.

drastically impacted the economy. The relationship between different control measures and economic losses becomes a research hotspot. Methods: In this study, the SEIR infectious disease model was revised and coupled with an economic model to quantify this nonlinear relationship in Wuhan. The control measures were parameterized into two factors: the effective number of daily contacts (people) (r); the average waiting time for quarantined patients (day) (g). Results: The parameter r has a threshold value that if r is less than 5 (people), the number of COVID-19 infected patients is very close to 0. A central valley around r = 5~6 can be observed, indicating an optimal control measure to reduce economic losses. A lower value of parameter g is beneficial to stop COVID-19 spread with a lower economic cost. Conclusion: The simulation results demonstrate that implementing strict control measures as early as possible can stop the spread of COVID-19 with a minimal economic impact. The quantitative assessment method in this study can be applied in other COVID-19 pandemic areas or countries.","output":"Estimating Economic Losses Caused by COVID-19 under Multiple Control Measure Scenarios with a Coupled Infectious DiseaseEconomic Model: A Case Study in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unemployment rate has sharply increased as a result of the lockdown associated with the spread of COVID-19.

The empirical results uncover that Asian Americans are more negatively affected by the lockdown than any other racial group, net of education, immigration status, and other covariates. Surprisingly, the negative impact of the lockdown is entirely concentrated on less-educated Asian Americans. Regardless of gender, less-educated Asian Americans are substantially more likely to lose employment than equally educated Whites and are not more likely to regain employment during the reopening months.

Circularity endows 3'-5'-linked circRNAs with stability and resistance to exonucleolytic degradation which raises the question whether circRNAs may be relevant as potential therapeutic targets or agents. High stability in biological systems is the most remarkable property and a major criterion for why circRNAs could be exploited for a range of RNA-centred medical applications. Even though various biological roles and regulatory functions of circRNAs have been reported, their in-depth study is challenging because of their circular structure and sequence-overlap with linear mRNA counterparts. Moreover, little is known about their role in viral infections and in antiviral immune responses. We believe that an in-depth and detailed understanding of circRNA mediated viral protein regulations will increase our knowledge of the biology of these novel molecules. In this review, we aimed to provide a comprehensive basis and overview on the biogenesis, significance and regulatory roles of circRNAs in the context of antiviral immune responses and viral infections including hepatitis C virus infection, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis delta virus infection, influenza A virus infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection, kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus infection, human cytomegalovirus infection, herpes simplex virus infection, human immunodeficiency virus infection, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus infection, ORF virus infection, avian leukosis virus infection, simian vacuolating virus 40 infection, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus infection, and bovine viral diarrhoea virus infection.

A proportion of these patients also had in common that they used ACE-I, which alerted the medical community on the potential risk in coexisting with COVID-19. However, in more recent case-control studies, they found that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, including ACE-I, does not increase the risk of COVID-19 or require hospital admission due to this cause. Several scientific journals have provided access to preliminary reports, leaving the use of such information at the discretion of the medical and scientific community for promoting the development of studies that might confirm these preclinical and epidemiological findings experimentally. These may finally have an impact on the clinical practice decisions, in order to benefit patients with COVID-19.

Currently, our facility uses the pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) bronchodilator with Venturi mask modified spacer (VMMS) in patients visiting the Emergency Department (ED) for mild to moderate exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We sought to assess the outcomes and acceptance of pMDI-VMMS in the outpatient ED of a tertiary hospital in Malaysia. METHODS: We analysed the total visits and discharge rates during periods of using the nebulizer and current pMDI-VMMS methods. The acceptance of pMDI-VMMS by patients and assistant medical officers (AMOs) were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We analysed 3184 ED visits and responses from 103 patients and 32 AMOs. The direct discharge rate was similar for both nebulizer (n = 2162, 92.5%) and pMDI-VMMS method (n = 768, 90.7%) (p-value = 0.120). Twenty-eight patients (27.2%) favoured the pMDI-VMMS over the nebulizer, whereas 36 patients (35.0%) had no preference for either method. Sixty-four patients (62.1%) felt that the current pMDI-VMMS method was better or at least as effective in relieving their symptoms as a nebulizer. The current method was favoured over the nebulizer by twenty-seven AMOs (84.4%). Twenty-eight (87.5%) AMOs suggested that the current method was more effective than the nebulizer. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The bronchodilator delivered via pMDI-VMMS appeared to be comparable to nebulizer in treating mild to moderate asthma and COPD exacerbations in the outpatient ED. Most patients and AMOs accepted the use of pMDI-VMMS in the outpatient ED during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the propensity for information communication and technology to enhance the teaching and learning process, the acceptance or rejection of learning technology is essential. Technological acceptance model (TAM) has evolved to become a key model to depict the predictors of human behaviour towards prospective rejection or acceptance of technology (Granic and Marangunic, 2019). In their recent systematic review of the extensive literature on TAM, Granic and Marangunic (2019) found that most of TAM research originate from Asia (Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and China), Europe, North America, Middle East and Africa. To the best of the authors' knowledge, research on TAM has been very scarce in small island economies. This study aims to guide the empirical model of Al-Fraihat et al. (2020), which wants to uncover the quality of learning by understanding the intentions and satisfaction of tertiary education learners on the acceptance and use of information technology (IT) for e-learning, during the confinement period. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a quantitative approach. The proposed framework was borrowed from Al-Fraihat et al. (2020) and amended based on the contextual aspect of the study. The model proposed by Al-Fraihat et al. (2020) takes into consideration the quality of e-learning through technical system quality, information quality, service quality, educational system quality, support system quality, learner quality and instructor quality. The framework has as the basis the TAM where the perceived satisfaction, perceived usefulness, use and benefits of E-learning have been evaluated. This current study evaluated the quality of the e-learning platform from the students' perspective in the confinement period. The service quality construct has been broken into three different dimensions, namely, service quality from an IT perspective, service quality from an administration perspective and service quality from the faculty represented by the Head of Departments. Another dimension has been added so as to evaluate the learner's point of view when studying during confinement, namely, confinement and learning quality. Findings The findings of this study did not support H25, that is the hypothesis that perceived usefulness has a positive relationship with perceived satisfaction, in contradiction to similar previous studies that confirmed the relationship (Al-Sabawy et al., 2011;Al-Fraihat et al., 2020). However, interestingly, the findings of this research supported the relationship between perceived satisfaction and benefits (H26). This means that the greater the satisfaction of the learner, the greater the benefits on students. The results of this study further supported that there is a positive relationship between perceived usefulness and benefits (H27);there is a positive relationship between perceived usefulness and use (H28);and finally, there is a positive relationship between use and benefits (H29). Such relationships were also found in the existing literature (Al-Sabawy et al., 2011;Cidral et al., 2018;Al-Fraihat et al., 2020). The perception of the usefulness of the e-learning system determines the benefits, usefulness and system use. When the learners feel that the system is enhancing their learning, learning activities and performance, hence learning more effectively, they tend to see the e-learning system as useful and they are more likely to use the e-learning system/tool. The use of the tool/system, thus positively impacts the benefits that the learners derived from the system. Originality/value The COVID-19 and overnight decision for a country-wide lockdown drastically changed the education sector. School and all teaching institutions were closed. However, most universities had to review their teaching and learning models to introduce e-learning to ensure the semester's progress. Hence, the use of the various LMS tools became a necessity overnight. This study on e-learning in Mauritius uses the TAM as the theoretical foundation because the theory has long been extensively used to investigate the quality of learning eg. Davis (1989), Scherer et al. (2019), Al-Fraihat et al. (2020).","output":"An evaluation of the impact of confinement on the quality of e-learning in higher education institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CRISPR-Cas9 systems are enriched in human pathogenic bacteria and have been linked to cytotoxicity by an unknown mechanism.

Compared to CjeCas9, native Cas9 of Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas9) is more suitable for guide-dependent editing. However, in human cells, native SpyCas9 may still cause some DNA damage, most likely because of its ssDNA cleavage activity. This side effect can be completely prevented by saturation of SpyCas9 with an appropriate guide RNA, which is only partially effective for CjeCas9. We conclude that CjeCas9 plays an active role in attacking human cells rather than in viral defense. Moreover, these unique catalytic features may therefore make CjeCas9 less suitable for genome editing applications.","output":"Guide-free Cas9 from pathogenic Campylobacter jejuni bacteria causes severe damage to DNA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The healthcare system is at the centre of great attention, having to demonstrate the adequate use of constantly decreasing available resources against a growing healthcare demand In this context, the diseases characterized by the length of the healthcare assistance plan and high com-plexities in terms of treatments and complications must be considered The above may refer to the healthcare emergency following the spread of the COVID-19 virus, employing an enormous amount of resources from both a human and a financial point of view Using crisp-set qualitative comparative anal-ysis, we conducted a comparative study at the European level to study the performance of dif-ferent combinations of COVID-19 containment measures along with the response speeds The outcome of this analysis can assist in identifying which set of containment measures, in the event of an epidemic outbreak, is beneficial/detrimental This work considers combining theoretical considerations and empirical evidence related to the treatment of COVID-19, within what is the success of public health measures in Europe during the COVID-19 emergency ? 2020, Babes-Bolyai University All rights reserved","output":"The covid-19 emergency in european public health: An evaluation of measures in the transition from healthcare services to healthcare profiling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 has made COVID-19 a tremendous social, economic, and health burden Despite the efforts to understand the virus and treat the disease, many questions remain unanswered about COVID-19 mechanisms of infection and progression Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) infection can affect several organs in the body including the heart, which can result in thromboembolism, myocardial injury, acute coronary syndromes, and arrhythmias Numerous cardiac adverse events, from cardiomyocyte death to secondary effects caused by exaggerated immunological response against the virus, have been clinically reported In addition to the disease itself, repurposing of treatments by using \\"off label\\" drugs can also contribute to cardiotoxicity Over the past several decades, animal models and more recently, stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have been proposed for studying diseases and testing treatments in vitro In addition, mechanistic in silico models have been widely used for disease and drug studies In these models, several characteristics such as gender, electrolyte imbalance, and comorbidities can be implemented to study pathophysiology of cardiac diseases and to predict cardiotoxicity of drug treatments In this Mini Review, we (1) present the state of the art of in vitro and in silico cardiomyocyte modeling currently in use to study COVID-19, (2) review in vitro and in silico models that can be adopted to mimic the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiac function, and (3) provide a perspective on how to combine some of these models to mimic \\"COVID-19 cardiomyocytes environment \\"","output":"In vitro and In silico Models to Study SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Integrating Experimental and Computational Tools to Mimic \\"COVID-19 Cardiomyocyte\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the SARS epidemic, healthcare utilization and medical services decreased significantly. However, the long-term impact of SARS on hospital performance needs to be further discussed. METHODS: A municipal hospital in Taipei City was shut down for a month due to SARS and then became the designated SARS and infectious disease hospital for the city. This study collected the outpatient, inpatient and emergency service volumes for every year from April to March over four years. Average monthly service amount  standard deviation were used to compare patient volume for the whole hospital, as well as the outpatient numbers accessing different departments. The ARIMA model of outpatient volume in the pre-SARS year was developed. RESULTS: The average monthly service volume of outpatient visits for the base year 2002 was 52317  4204 visits per month, and number for 2003 and the following two years were 55%, 82% and 84% of the base year respectively. The average emergency service volume was 4382  356 visits per month at the base year and this became 45%, 77% and 87% of the base year for the following three years respectively. Average inpatient service volume was 8520  909 inpatient days per month at the base year becoming 43%, 81% and 87% of the base year for the following three years respectively. Only the emergency service volume had recovered to the level of a non-significant difference at the second year after SARS. In addition, the departments of family medicine, metabolism and nephrology reached the 2002 patient number in 2003. The ARIMA (2,1,0) model was the most suitable for outpatient volume in pre-SARS year. The MAPE of the ARIMA (2,1,0) model for the pre-SARS year was 6.9%, and 43.2%, 10.6%, 6.2% for following 3 years.

Recent dangerous coronaviruses are MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, causing respiratory illness and even failure of several organs. However, profound impact of coronavirus on host cells remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed transcriptome of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung-derived cells, and observed that infection of these coronaviruses all induced increase of retrotransposon expression with upregulation of TET genes. Upregulation of retrotransposon was also observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected human intestinal organoids. Retrotransposon upregulation may lead to increased genome instability and enhanced expression of genes with readthrough from retrotransposons. Therefore, people with higher basal level of retrotransposon such as cancer patients and aged people may have increased risk of symptomatic infection. Additionally, we show evidence supporting long-term epigenetic inheritance of retrotransposon upregulation. We also observed chimeric transcripts of retrotransposon and SARS-CoV-2 RNA for potential human genome invasion of viral fragments, with the front and the rear part of SARS-CoV-2 genome being easier to form chimeric RNA. Thus, we suggest that primers and probes for nucleic acid detection should be designed in the middle of virus genome to identify live virus with higher probability. In summary, we propose our hypothesis that coronavirus invades human cells and interacts with retrotransposon, eliciting more severe symptoms in patients with underlying diseases.

METHODS vanB VREfm were investigated using epidemiological data and WGS data. The SeqSphere+ software was used to analyse MLST and cgMLST, and de novo assemblies were annotated to determine insertion sites for the vanB transposon (Tn1549). A clone-specific vanB VREfm PCR assay was designed to detect the sequence bridging Tn1549 and the E. faecium chromosome (araA2) in the dominant cluster.

We examined age-related differences in emotions, cognitive attitudes, and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory, we expected to find a positive approach in older adults, which may translate into lower compliance with restrictive measures. Methods: We analyzed data (n = 306) from a nation-wide online survey conducted between April 1st and April 16th, 2020. We compared young (18-29 years), middle-aged (30-50 years), and older (65-85 years) adults' self-reported emotions, attitudes toward the emergency, and compliance with governmental rules. Results: Older adults showed lower negative emotions than young and middle-aged adults. Also, older adults were more confident about COVID-related information received, more favorable toward the restrictive measures, and perceived lower underestimation of the emergency compared to the other age groups. However, older people anticipated a longer time for the emergency to resolve. No age-related differences in compliance with the rules emerged. Conclusion: Older people showed a positive attitude toward the emergency. This attitude was confined in the here and now and did not extend to expectations for the future. Compliance with rules was high across our sample. However, less compliant individuals were also less confident in COVID-related information received by the media and official sources, suggesting the importance of providing precise and reliable information to promote adherence to restrictive measures.","output":"Age-related differences in the perception of COVID-19 emergency during the Italian outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A hackathon is best described as an innovation marathon. Derived from the words hacking and marathon, it brings together multidisciplinary teams to collaborate intensely over a short period of time to define a problem, devise a solution, and design a working prototype. International scientific meetings are conducive to successful hackathons, providing an audience of expert professionals who describe challenges and ensure the proposed solutions address end-user needs. Collaborations with local organizations and academic centers are crucial to attracting complementary specialties such as IT advisors, engineers, and entrepreneurs to develop sustainable projects. The core process of first identifying and deconstructing a problem followed by solution iteration is applicable to challenges at workplaces around the world. Ultimately, this model can be used to drive innovation and catalyze change in the global health community. The planning, execution, and outcomes of a hackathon event organized in conjunction with the International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance (IMED 2016) are described in this article. Physicians, public health practitioners, veterinarians, IT professionals, engineers, and entrepreneurs came together for 2 days to develop solutions at the intersection of emerging infectious diseases and climate change. Projects that resulted from the IMED 2016 Hackathon included environmental impact assessment software for humanitarian organization relief efforts; enhanced communication tools to prevent disease outbreaks; a participatory mobile application to speed the elimination of rabies in Indonesia; integrated disease surveillance platforms; and an improved search function for infectious disease outbreak reports in the ProMED-mail network.","output":"Planning an innovation marathon at an infectious disease conference with results from the International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance 2016 Hackathon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess whether there are differences in psychological empowerment between different health professionals working in a teaching hospital.

Soon after the discovery, EPAC has shown its significance in many diseases including its emerging role in infectious diseases. In a recent study, we demonstrated that EPAC, but not PKA, is a promising therapeutic target to regulate respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication and its associated inflammation. In mammals, there are two isoforms of EPACEPAC1 and EPAC2. Unlike other viruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Ebola virus, which use EPAC1 to regulate viral replication, RSV uses EPAC2 to control its replication and associated cytokine/chemokine responses. To determine whether EPAC2 protein has a broad impact on other respiratory viral infections, we used an EPAC2-specific inhibitor, MAY0132, to examine the functions of EPAC2 in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and adenovirus (AdV) infections. HMPV is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Pneumoviridae, which also includes RSV, while AdV is a double-stranded DNA virus. Treatment with an EPAC1-specific inhibitor was also included to investigate the impact of EPAC1 on these two viruses. We found that the replication of HMPV, AdV, and RSV and the viral-induced immune mediators are significantly impaired by MAY0132, while an EPAC1-specific inhibitor, CE3F4, does not impact or slightly impacts, demonstrating that EPAC2 could serve as a novel common therapeutic target to control these viruses, all of which do not have effective treatment and prevention strategies.","output":"Broad Impact of Exchange Protein Directly Activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2) on Respiratory Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, was discovered from Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases in December 2019, and was named by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020.

Data collection took place from March 6 to 11, 2020. In particular, the study examines variables that have been shown to predict health behavior in previous research outside the context of the present pandemic, including hope, optimism, perceived risk, fear, and mental health variables. Method: Participants (222 adults in 39 U.S. states) were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Online surveys included the Adult Hope Scale (AHS), Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Impact of Events Scale (IES-R), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Also included were items inquiring about COVID-19 perceived mortality risk, fear/anxiety, and preparedness. Results and Conclusion: Participants were asked to imagine that COVID-19 had different hypothetical levels of mortality risk, ranging from 1 to 10 percent mortality (at the time of data collection, the WHO estimated actual mortality of the disease at approximately 3 percent). For each level, participants rated the degree to which they would be willing to take steps to prepare and protect themselves from the disease on a 7-point scale. Nearly 49 percent of participants said they would be relatively unlikely (i.e., provided a rating below the midpoint of the scale) to take steps to protect themselves if the mortality rate were at the 3 percent level. Stepwise multiple regression including the aforementioned predictors showed that three variables accounted for unique variance in participants levels of current preparedness: COVID-19 fear/anxiety, posttraumatic stress (as measured by the IES-R), and hope. Implications of these results are briefly discussed in the context of raising preparedness given that future public health crises are likely inevitable.

The evidence base is evolving, but with small numbers in reported studies. The majority of published literature discusses SOC under general anaesthetic;typically propofol. We compared successful stone clearance, stricture assessment and safety under conscious sedation and propofol.MethodsA single centre retrospective analysis was performed of consecutive SOCs over 8 years at Bristol Royal Infirmary (tertiary referral centre for SW England and South Wales). Parameters included sedation/propofol usage, stone clearance, electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL), histology, final diagnosis and complications.ResultsBetween Jan 2013 C Nov 2020, 471 SOCs were performed on 352 patients (175f, 177m);mean age 65.7years (17-92), referred from 18 centres. 15 SOCs were performed in 2013 compared to 99 in 2019 before restrictions from the COVID19 pandemic.228 therapeutic SOCs + EHL were performed for stone clearance, 79.8% (n=182/228) under conscious sedation (median fentanyl dose 150mcg;midazolam 7mg;comfort score 2). Complete stone clearance rose from 79.7% in the conscious sedation group to 89.2% in with propofol sedation, although the difference was not significant (p=0.19).243 diagnostic SOCs were performed, 88.9% under conscious sedation. Similar to therapeutic SOCs, median fentanyl dose 150mcg;midazolam 7mg;and comfort score 2. Overall macroscopic assessment of strictures correlating with malignancy had a sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 90.2% (95%CI 82.7-95.2), 92.6% (95%CI 86.3-96.5) and 91.5% (87.0-94.8%) respectively. Diagnostic accuracy with macroscopic assessment was comparable between patients receiving conscious sedation (91.4%;95%CI 86.6-94.9) vs propofol sedation (92%;95%CI 74.0-99.0). Diagnostic accuracy with histological assessment appeared greater in patients receiving propofol sedation (95%;95%CI 75.1-99.9) compared to conscious sedation (84.7%;95%CI 78.5-89.6)28 adverse events were recorded (5.9%), with post ERCP cholangitis (2.3%) and pancreatitis (2.1%) the commonest causes. Complications were marginally higher in patients receiving propofol sedation (6.8%;n=5/73) vs those receiving conscious sedation (5.8%;n=23/398) but the difference was not significant (p=0.72).ConclusionsThis is the largest single centre retrospective analysis of SOCs. Successful stone clearance is similar to results found in literature from smaller studies. There was a trend to greater successful stone clearance with propofol. Conscious sedation has previously been described as a risk factor for inadequate visualisation, but we found very similar high levels of diagnostic accuracy in both groups. Both were generally well tolerated with low rates of adverse events.","output":"Single operator cholangioscopy C Does conscious sedation have a role?

Methods Electronic questionnaires assessing physical and emotional health, the value of virtual care, and access to resources were distributed to patients with postponed (PP) orthopaedic restorative surgeries and those within three-months post-operative (PO) at the time of the COVID-19 health care closures. The EQ-5D-3L was included as a standardized measure of general health. Chi-square tests compared responses between sexes and age groups. Unpaired t-tests compared the EQ VAS by sex, and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the EQ VAS by age. Results Females in the PO group were more likely to report that their recovery was delayed (49.5% vs 36%) and that closures had negatively affected their recovery (p = 0.013). Females in the PP group reported more symptoms of pain/discomfort on the EQ-5D-3L (p = 0.023). In the PP group, patients aged 25 to 44 years were most likely to identify pain as a concern (p = 0.54). In the PO group, patients younger than 45 years reported a significantly lower mean EQ VAS health state ( p = 0.017).

In cats, infections with feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are common. Several non-feline coronaviruses have been reported to infect feline cells as well as cats after experimental infection, supported by their ability to engage the feline receptor ortholog for cell entry. However, whether cats might become naturally infected with CoVs of other species is unknown. We analyzed coronavirus infections in cats by serological monitoring. In total 137 cat serum samples and 25 FCoV type 1 or type 2-specific antisera were screened for the presence of antibodies against the S1 receptor binding subunit of the CoV spike protein, which is immunogenic and possesses low amino acid sequence identity among coronavirus species. Seventy-eight sera were positive for antibodies that recognized one or more coronavirus S1s whereas 1 serum exclusively reacted with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and two sera exclusively reacted with porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV). We observed antigenic cross-reactivity between S1s of type 1 and type 2 FCoVs, and between FCoV type 1 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Domain mapping of antibody epitopes indicated the presence of conserved epitope(s) particularly in the CD domains of S1. The cross-reactivity of FCoV type 1 and PEDV was also observed at the level of virus neutralization. To conclude, we provide the first evidence of antigenic cross-reactivity among S1 proteins of coronaviruses, which should be considered in the development of serological diagnoses.

Effects of FOXN3 over-expression and depletion on glioma cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were assessed by CCK8, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, scratch wound healing assay and Transwell invasion assay, respectively. Moreover, the involvement of AKT/murine double minute 2 (MDM2)/p53 pathway was evaluated. Additionally, tumor transplantation model assay was performed to determine the effects of FOXN3 over-expression on glioma cell growth in vivo. Results showed that FOXN3 was significantly down-regulated in glioma tissues compared with normal tissues. Patients with lower FOXN3 expression exhibited a shorter overall survival time. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that FOXN3 over-expression significantly suppressed proliferation, survival and motility of glioma cells, whereas FOXN3 knockdown remarkably promoted glioma cell proliferation, survival and motility. Furthermore, FOXN3 over-expression inhibited the activation of AKT/MDM2/p53 signaling pathway in glioma cells, while FOXN3 depletion facilitated its activation. Additionally, tumor xenograft assays revealed that FOXN3 over-expression retarded glioma cell growth in vivo.

This study is aimed at determining which sociodemographic characteristics (age, family composition, achievement), confinement habits (schedule, new hobby, sleep duration, cellphone and computer use, sports, schoolwork), and sources of support (parents and teachers) are associated with more or less internalized symptoms in Canadian adolescents. Differences between boys and girls are also investigated. Between April 8 and 30 (2020) and through an online survey, 895 Canadian adolescents (74% girls) aged between 12 and 17 years (M = 14.7) were recruited. Path analysis was performed to identify significant associations between sociodemographic characteristics, confinement habits, support variables, and internalized symptoms. Independent samples t-tests and invariance tests were conducted to compare boys and girls. Results suggest that certain confinement habits (time spent using cellphones, doing sports and schoolwork, finding a new hobby) and support variables (parents working outside the home) were significantly and negatively associated with internalized symptoms. Regarding the sex differences, girls used their cellphones more and invariance test results showed that all associations between predictors and symptoms were statistically similar for boys and girls. This study's results help understand better adolescents' experience in confinement.

It retains activity against the Omicron BA.1 variant and is used to treat immunocompromised patients as they are at increased risk for a severe outcome of COVID-19. MethodsWe studied viral evolution in 47 immunocompromised patients infected with Omicron BA.1 or 2 and treated with sotrovimab. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed at baseline and weekly thereafter until Ct-value was [] 30. All RNA samples were sequenced to determine the variant and occurrence of mutations, in particular in the Spike protein, after treatment. ResultsTwenty-four (51%) of the 47 patients were male and their median age was 63 years. Thirty-one (66%) had undergone a solid organ transplantation and 13 (28%) had received prior B-cell depleting therapy. Despite a history of vaccination, 24 of 30 patients with available data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Spike antibodies prior to treatment with sotrovimab had very low or no antibodies. Median time to viral clearance (Ct-value [] 30) after treatment was 15 days (IQR 7-22). However, viral RNA with low Ct-values was continuously detected for at least 28 days after treatment in four patients infected with BA.1. Mutations in the Spike protein at position 337 or 340 were observed in all four patients. Similar mutations were also found after treatment of two patients with a BA.2 infection but both cleared the virus within two weeks. Thus following treatment with sotrovimab, spike mutations associated with reduced in vitro susceptibility were detected in 6 of 47 (13%) patients. ConclusionViral evolution towards resistance against sotrovimab can explain treatment failure in most immunocompromised patients and these patients can remain infectious after treatment. Therefore, documenting viral clearance after treatment is recommended to avoid that these patients unintentionally become a source of new, sotrovimab resistant, variants. Research on direct acting antivirals and possibly combination therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients is needed.","output":"High incidence of sotrovimab resistance and viral persistence after treatment of immunocompromised patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) is a family of large enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses which has been considered as a global health concern as it has a very high transmissibility potential.

Upon infection, the genome circularizes and persists as an episome in infected cells. More than 70 open reading frames exist, which encode proteins expressed during lytic and latent EBV infection. Lytic proteins encode viral proteins, which are necessary for the production of infectious virions, whereas latent proteins are needed to set up persistent infection by transforming and immortalizing host cells. EBV also encodes non-translated RNAs (e.g., EBER1 and EBER2), which are almost ubiquitously expressed and highly abundant in EBV-infected cells. Four EBV latency programs have been described with distinct sets of expressed proteins and viral RNAs: (1) Latency 0: EBER1 and EBER2 but no expression of proteins; (2) Latency 1 (true latency program): EBER1 and EBER2, EBNA1; (3) Latency 2 (default program): EBER1 and EBER2 and expression of EBNA1, latent membrane protein (LMP)-1, LMP2A, LMP2B; and (4) Latency 3 (growth program): EBER1 and EBER2 and expression of EBNA-leader protein (LP), EBNA 2C6, LMP1, LMP2A, LMP2B.

Since inflammation is associated with hypercoagulability and thrombosis, our goal was to compare the temporal inflammatory profile following hemorrhagic shock in patients with and without VTE. STUDY DESIGN Secondary analysis was performed on data collected from PROPPR. Blood samples collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours following admission were assayed on a 27-target cytokine panel, and compared between VTE (n=83) and non-VTE (n=475) patients. p<0.05 indicated significance. RESULTS Over time, both groups exhibited elevations in pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating (G-CSF) 57, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1, and anti-inflammatory mediators IL-1ra and IL-10 (P<0.05 vs admission). VTE patients showed amplified responses for IL-6 (6-72 hours) and IL-8 (6-24 hours), which peaked at later time points, and GCSF-57 (12-24 hours), MCP-1 (6-72 hours), and MIP-1 (2-12 hours) (P<0.05 vs non-VTE per time point) that peaked at similar time points to non-VTE patients. The anti-inflammatory responses were similar between groups, but the interleukin-mediated pro-inflammatory responses continued to rise after the peak anti-inflammatory response in the VTE group. The occurrence rate of adverse events was higher in VTE (97%) versus non-VTE (87%, p=0.009) and was associated with higher inflammation. CONCLUSION Patients with VTE following hemorrhagic shock exhibited a prolonged and amplified pro-inflammatory responses mediated by select interleukin, chemotactic, and glycoprotein cytokines that are not antagonized by anti-inflammatory mediators. This response is not related to randomization group, injury severity or degree of shock, but may be linked to adverse events.

Regarding Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), few programs have been tested; nevertheless, results are promising. The therapeutic alliance is an important factor predicting treatment outcome in BPD. However, we do not know yet to what extent BPD patients form a therapeutic alliance with an eHealth tool and how this relationship differs from the relationship with their human therapist. This study aims to address this question using priovi, an interactive schema therapy-based eHealth tool for BPD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore how patients perceived the therapeutic alliance with priovi and its differences compared to the alliance with their human therapist (N = 9). Interview data were analyzed following the procedures of qualitative content analysis. Additionally, the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SR) was administered in two versions (regarding the human therapist and priovi, N = 16) every three months during the treatment phase of one year. Results indicate that patients were able to form a good therapeutic relationship with priovi, but it differed from the relationship to their human therapist. Important categories were \\"priovi is helpful, supportive and always there\\" and \\"priovi is less flexible\\". WAI ratings for the task subscale were high in both relationships but significantly higher in WAItherapist compared to WAIpriovi in two measurements (nine-months measurement: t = 2.76, df = 15, p = 0.015; twelve-months measurement: t = 3.44, df = 15, p = 0.004). These results indicate that BPD patients can form a functioning alliance with an eHealth program and that eHealth programs may be especially useful for psychoeducation and cognitive exercises.","output":"Therapeutic Relationship in eHealth-A Pilot Study of Similarities and Differences between the Online Program Priovi and Therapists Treating Borderline Personality Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) Infections were first detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and the infection has recently spread worldwide and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization The disease presents with a spectrum of respiratory manifestations that range from asymptomatic cases, to patients with mild and severe symptoms, either with or without pneumonia Symptoms include fever, upper respiratory tract coryza, cough and acute lower respiratory tract infection Asthmatics have, thus far, only shown slightly higher risk for hospitalisation but not for mortality However, this may change in South Africa Asthmatics are advised to keep their asthma under control and to continue using controller medication It is critical for all of us, especially asthmatics, to practice 'social distancing', wash hands frequently and practise sneeze and cough etiquette","output":"Protecting Asthmatics from Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of late May 2020, more than 1.5 million people had tested positive for coronavirus infection in the United States; however, only 3% of Americans had been tested.

These may have serious adverse effects and potential drug interactions with psychotropic agents. We reviewed the common agents being used across the world for the treatment of COVID-19 and investigated their drug interaction potential with psychotropic agents using several drug interaction databases and resources. A preliminary search identified the following drugs as being used to treat COVID-19 symptoms: atazanavir (ATV), azithromycin (AZI), chloroquine (CLQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCLQ), dipyridamole, famotidine (FAM), favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), nitazoxanide, remdesivir, ribavirin and tocilizumab. Many serious adverse effects and potential drug interactions with psychotropic agents were identified. The most problematic agents were found to be ATV, AZI, CLQ, HCLQ, FAM and LPV/r in terms of both pharmacokinetic as well as serious pharmacodynamic drug interactions, including QTc prolongation and neutropenia. Significant caution should be exercised if using any of the medications being trialled for the treatment of COVID-19 until robust clinical trial data are available.

Because GSK983 is an ineffective antiviral in the presence of physiological uridine concentrations, we explored combining GSK983 with pyrimidine salvage inhibitors. We synthesized and evaluated analogs of cyclopentenyl uracil (CPU), an inhibitor of uridine salvage. We found that CPU was converted into its triphosphate in cells. When combined with GSK983, CPU resulted in large drops in cellular UTP and CTP pools. Consequently, CPU-GSK983 suppressed dengue virus replication in the presence of physiological concentrations of uridine. In addition, the CPU-GSK983 combination markedly enhanced the effect of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibition on viral infection.

Das Ziel der Befragung bestand einerseits darin, ein besseres Verst?ndnis zum Kulturtourismus in l?ndlichen R?umen zu entwickeln. W?hrend Besucher in den St?dten eher Formen der Hochkultur (Theater, Museen, Galerien) wahrnehmen, liegt das Augenmerk in l?ndlichen R?umen st?rker auf der Popul?r- und Alltagskultur (Traditionen, Volksfeste, Kulturlandschaft, landwirtschaftliche und handwerkliche Produkte). Das sdlich von Berlin in Brandenburg gelegene Untersuchungsgebiet erlebte im Corona-Jahr 2020 einen Besucheransturm. Trotz des zeitweiligen Lockdowns kam es insbesondere auf den Campingpl?tzen zu Rekordbesucherzahlen. Dabei reisten sowohl Besucher aus klassischen Quellgebieten wie Sachsen, Brandenburg und Berlin an, darber hinaus aber auch G?ste aus den alten Bundesl?ndern wie Bayern und Baden-Wrttemberg. Viele Touristen entdeckten 2020 dieses Gebiet zum ersten Mal. Typisch fr die Besucher sind ein hoher bis sehr hoher Bildungsstand, qualifizierte Berufsabschlsse sowie eine solide Einkommenssituation. Paare und Familien dominieren unter den Befragten. Die kulturellen Interessen der Besucher konzentrieren sich stark auf Restaurants/ Gastronomie, Stadt- und Dorfensemble, historische St?tten und Geb?ude, Kulturerbest?tten/-geb?ude sowie Kulturrouten. Dieser Fokus der Besucher harmoniert recht gut mit den kulturellen Angeboten in der l?ndlichen Region. Die Mehrheit der Einwohner begr?t den Tourismus im Gebiet. Die Anzahl der Besucher wird von den Einheimischen - selbst unter den Bedingungen einer hohen Auslastung 2020 - eher gelassen gesehen. Bel?stigungen durch Touristen empfinden nur 12%, eine Zunahme der Besucherzahl sehen nur 9% der Bewohner problematisch. Die meisten erwarten von einem ggf. verst?rkten Tourismus in ihrer Gegend eher positive Effekte. Viele hoffen, dass sich dadurch kulturelle Angebote verbessern, alte Geb?ude renoviert, Geh- und Radwege gebaut, Restaurants er?ffnet werden sowie kleine Gesch?fte berleben. Auch wird dem Tourismus tendenziell ein positiver Einfluss auf die Erhaltung lokaler Traditionen zugesprochen. Die Untersuchungen belegen auch, dass es im l?ndlichen Raum noch gro?e ungenutzte kulturtouristische Potenziale gibt, die auf ihre Entfaltung warten.

METHODS: According to whether or not their glucose metabolism was impaired, COVID-19 patients were subdivided into 2 groups: 1) with DM and IFG, 2) control group. Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory results, and final clinical results were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: 28 patients (16.3%) died during hospitalization, including 21 (29.2%) in group 1 and 7 (7.0%) in group 2 (P < 0.001). Fbg levels in groups 1 and 2 were higher than the normal range, at 5.6 g/L (IQR 4.5-7.2 g/L) and 5.0 g/L (IQR 4.0-6.1 g/L), respectively (P = 0.009). Serum ferritin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), triglycerides (TG) were significantly increased in group 1 compared to those in the control. TG levels were 1.3 mmol/L in the control, while that in group 1 was 1.8 mmol/L. Multiple linear regression showed that the predicting factors of Fbg in the control group were serum ferritin and CRP, R2 = 0.295; in group 1, serum ferritin, CRP, and TG, R2 = 0.473. CONCLUSIONS: Fbg in all COVID-19 patients is related to serum ferritin and CRP involved in inflammation. Furthermore, in COVID-19 patients with insulin resistance, Fbg is linearly positively correlated with TG. This suggests that regulation of TG, insulin resistance, and inflammation may reduce hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients, especially those with insulin resistance.","output":"Determinants of Increased Fibrinogen in COVID-19 Patients With and Without Diabetes and Impaired Fasting Glucose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A range of research reports that many gender and sexually diverse people drink alcohol at heavy levels. This study used 24 focus groups to explore shared understandings of alcohol use among gender and sexually diverse people living in New Zealand. An inductive, data-driven thematic analysis was employed to identify explanations for heavy drinking among gender and sexually diverse people. Three key explanations were articulated: alcohol is needed for socialising; drinking helps coping with stress; alcohol and drug treatment services are inadequate. These results demonstrate justifications for heavy drinking in certain contexts. This behaviour runs counter to public health approaches and messages that highlight low-risk levels of drinking or not drinking as desirable. Public health interventions should continue to address alcohol use at a whole population level but should be supplemented by policy and interventions that take into account the sociocultural contexts and structural conditions that encourage drinking among gender and sexually diverse people.","output":"Justifications for heavy alcohol use among gender and sexually diverse people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Individuals with cancer, especially advanced cancer, are faced with numerous difficulties associated with the disease, including an earlier death than expected. Those who are able to confront and accept the hardships associated with the disease in a way that aligns with their beliefs benefit from more positive psychological outcomes compared to those who are aware of their diagnosis but are unable to accept it. To date, there is limited research exploring factors contributing to illness and death acceptance in the context of advanced cancer in group therapy settings. Materials and Methods: The current study used a Directed Content Analysis approach on transcripts of online advanced cancer support groups to investigate if and how Yaloms existential factors played a role in the emergence of acceptance. Results: The online support group platform, combined with the help of facilitators, offered supportive environments for individuals seeking help with cancer-related distress by helping patients move towards acceptance. Some participants had already begun the process of accepting their diagnosis before joining the group, others developed acceptance during the group process, while a few continued to be distressed. Our analysis revealed the emergence of four themes related to illness acceptance: (1) Facilitator-Initiated Discussion, including sub-themes of Mindfulness, Relaxation and Imagery, Changing Ways of Thinking, and Spirituality; (2) Personal attitudes, including sub-themes of Optimism and Letting Go of Control; (3) Supportive Environment, including the sub-themes of Providing Support to Others and Receiving Support from Others; and (4) Existential Experience, which included sub-themes of Living with the Diagnosis for an Extended Amount of Time, Legacy and Death Preparations, and Appreciating life. Conclusions: With a paradigm shift to online delivery of psychological services, recognizing factors that contribute to acceptance when dealing with advanced cancer may help inform clinical practices.

While individual clerkships have shared their curricular adaptations via social and academic networking media, there is currently no organizational standard in establishing a non-clinical, Emergency Medicine (EM) virtual rotation (VR). The primary objective of this study was to describe EM clerkship directors' (CDs) perspectives on their experience adapting an EM VR curriculum during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A 21-item survey with quantitative and qualitative questions was disseminated between June and August 2020 to EM CDs via the Clerkship Director of Emergency Medicine (CDEM) Listserv to describe their experience and perspectives in adapting a VR during the spring of 2020. Results: We analyzed 59 out of 77 EM clerkship survey responses. Among respondents, 52% adapted a VR while 47.5% did not. Of those who adapted a VR, 71% of CDs had 2 weeks or less to develop the new curriculum, with 84% reporting usual or increased clinical load during that time. Clerkships significantly diversified their asynchronous educational content and utilized several instructional models to substitute the loss of clinical experience. Reflecting on the experience, 71% of CDs did not feel comfortable writing a standardized letter of evaluation for students based on the VR, with the majority citing inability to evaluate students' competencies in a clinical context. Conclusion: A crisis, such as COVID-19 necessitates change in all facets of medical education. While EM educators demonstrated the ability to create emergency remote learning with limited time, this was not equivalent to the formal development of pre-planned VR experiences. Future faculty development and curriculum innovation are required to fully transition an in-person immersive experience to a non-inferior virtual experience.","output":"Emergency Medicine Clerkship Director Experience Adapting Emergency Remote Learning During the Onset of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During COVID-19, stay at home orders have led to the rise of domestic violence and abuse claims in many localities globally, leaving community leaders unprepared to address the increase of domestic violence incidences.

While Open Tracheostomy (OT) is the preferred technique due to the excellent visualization of the surgical field and structures, Percutaneous Tracheostomy (PT) has proven to be a feasible minimally invasive alternative. However, PT's limitation relates to the inability to precisely enter the cervical trachea at the exact spot since the puncture is often performed based on crude estimation from anatomical laryngeal surface landmarks. Besides, there is no absolute control of the trajectory and force required to make the percutaneous puncture into the trachea, resulting in inadvertent injury to the cricoid ring, cervical esophagus, and vessels in the neck. Therefore, we hypothesize that a flexible mini-robotic system, incorporating the robotic needling technology, can overcome these challenges by allowing the trans-oral robotic instrument of the cervical trachea. This approach promises to improve current PT technology by making the initial trachea puncture from an inside-out approach, rather than an outside-in manner, fraught with several technical uncertainties.","output":"Pilot Study of Trans-oral Robotic-Assisted Needle Direct Tracheostomy Puncture in Patients Requiring Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder defined by a significantly reduced number of platelets in blood circulation. Due to low levels of platelets, ITP is associated with frequent bruising and bleeding. Current evidence suggests that low platelet counts in ITP are the result of multiple factors, including impaired thrombopoiesis and variations in immune response leading to platelet destruction during pathological conditions. Patient outcomes as well as clinic presentation of the disease have largely been shown to be case-specific, hinting towards ITP rather being a group of clinical conditions sharing common symptoms. The most frequent characteristics include dysfunction in primary haemostasis and loss of immune tolerance towards platelet as well as megakaryocyte antigens. This heterogeneity in patient population and characteristics make it challenging for the clinicians to choose appropriate therapeutic regimen. Therefore, it is vital to understand the pathomechanisms behind the disease and to consider various factors including patient age, platelet count levels, co-morbidities and patient preferences before initiating therapy. This review summarizes recent developments in the pathophysiology of ITP and provides a comprehensive overview of current therapeutic strategies as well as potential future drugs for the management of ITP.","output":"Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia: Novel Insights into Pathophysiology and Disease Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Ltude PR Psy Covid a pour objectif principal dtudier limpact psychologique des personnes ayant une polyarthrite rhumato?de au cours de la premire anne de pandmie covid-19.

However, the specific role of overall hospital size in open esophagectomy morbidity and mortality remains unclear. Materials and Methods: Patients aged >18 years who underwent open esophagectomy for primary malignant neoplasia of the esophagus between 2002 and 2014 were identified using the National Inpatient Sample. Minimally invasive procedures were excluded. Discharges were stratified by hospital size (large, medium, and small) and analyzed using trend and multivariable regression analyses. Results: Over a 13-year period, a total of 69,840 open esophagectomy procedures were performed nationally. While the proportion of total esophagectomies performed did not vary by hospital size, in-hospital mortality trends decreased for all hospitals (large (7.2% to 3.7%), medium (12.8% vs. 4.9%), and small (12.8% vs. 4.9%)), although this was only significant for large hospitals (P < 0.01). After controlling for patient demographics, comorbidities, admission, and hospital-level factors, hospital length of stay (LOS), total inflation-adjusted costs, in-hospital mortality, and complications (cardiac, respiratory, vascular, and bleeding) did not vary by hospital size (all P > 0.05). Conclusions: After risk adjustment, patient morbidity and in-hospital mortality appear to be comparable across all institutions, including small hospitals. While there appears to be an increased push for referring patients to large hospitals, our findings suggest that there may be other factors (such as surgeon type, hospital volume, or board status) that are more likely to impact the results; these need to be further explored in the current era of episode-based care.","output":"The Impact of Hospital Size on National Trends and Outcomes Following Open Esophagectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses have been recognised in the new years honours list for their continued work and commitment during another year dominated by COVID-19.","output":"New years honours recognise efforts during COVID-19 and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health threat, and thus, an early and effective set of predictors is needed to manage the course of the disease. OBJECTIVES: We aim to determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on lipid profile and to evaluate whether the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) could be used to predict in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective chart review study, a total of 139 confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose diagnoses are confirmed by PCR and computerized tomography results, are enrolled. The study population is divided into two groups: the deceased patient group and the survivor group. For each patient, fasting total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the triglyceride values are obtained from the laboratory tests required at the admission to hospital. Finally, the AIP is calculated as the base 10 logarithm of the triglyceride to HDL-C ratio. Distributional normality of the data is checked and depending on the normality of the data, either T test or Mann Whithey U test is employed to compare the two aforementioned study groups. RESULTS: Mean age of the study population is 49.2  20.8 and 61.2% (n = 85) is male. Out of the 139 patients 26 have deceased and the remaining 113 patients survived the disease. Mean age of the deceased patients was 71.8*8.9 and mean age of the survivor patients is 44.0*19.2 (p < 0.001). The deceased group had more patients with hypertension (50.0% vs. 23.0, p = 0.006), diabetes mellitus (35.6% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.002), cardiovascular diseases (23.1% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.001), chronic renal insufficiency (11.5% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.003) and atrial fibrillation (7.7% vs 0%, p = 0.003). The AIP values in the deceased group are found to be statistically higher (p < 0.001) than the survivor group. As a measure of mortality, the area under the operating characteristic curve for the AIP is calculated as 0.850 (95% confidence interval: 0.772-0.928) along with the optimal cut-off value of 0.6285 (78.6% sensitivity and 80.5% specificity). Furthermore, the AIP value is observed to be elevated in patients with pneumonia, intubation history, and intensive care admission during hospital stay (p = 0.002, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Finally, compared to the survivor group, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C values are lower (p = 0.004, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) and triglyceride levels are higher (p < 0.001) in deceased patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, we show that the AIP levels higher than 0.6285 can predict in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the AIP emerges as a good candidate to be used as an early biomarker to predict pneumonia, intubation and intensive care need. Hence, regular check of the AIP levels in COVID-19 patients can improve management of these patients and prevent deterioration of the disease.","output":"The atherogenic index of plasma as a predictor of mortality in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis led to a flurry of clinical trials activity.

The rapid generation of evidence and accelerated dissemination of results have led to new challenges for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (e.g. rapid, living, and scoping reviews). Pressure to regulatory agencies has also mounted with massive emergency authorizations, but some of them have had to be revoked. Pandemic circumstances have disrupted the way trials are conducted;therefore, new methods have been developed and adopted more widely to facilitate recruitment, consent, and overall trial conduct. Based on the COVID-19 experience and its challenges, planning of several large, efficient trials, and wider use of adaptive designs may change the future of clinical research.

Their risk factors and effective prevention methods for myopia across schoolchildren developmental stages are critically needed but remain uncertain due to the difficulty in implementing intervention measurements under normal life situation. We aimed to study the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on myopia development among over one-million schoolchildren. Methods We designed the ongoing longitudinal project of Myopic Epidemiology and Intervention Study (MEIS) to biannually examine myopia among millions of schoolchildren for ten years in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China. In the present study, we performed three examinations of myopia in 1,305 elementary and high schools for schoolchildren in June 2019, December 2019 and June 2020. We used the normal period (June-December 2019) and COVID-19 quarantine period (January-June 2020) for comparisons. Myopia was defined as an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/25 or less and a spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of -0.5 diopters (D) or less. High myopia was defined as an SER of -6.0 D or less. Findings In June 2019, 1,001,749 students aged 7-18 were eligible for examinations. In the 6-month and 12-month follow-up studies, there were 813,755 eligible students (81.2%) and 768,492 eligible students (76.7%), respectively. Among all students, we found that half-year myopia progression increased approximate 1.5 times from -0.263 D (95% CI, -0.262 to -0.264) during normal period to -0.39 D (95% CI, -0.389 to -0.391) during COVID-19 quarantine (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified grade rather than age was significantly associated with myopia (Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.10, 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.13; P < 0.001) and high myopia (HR: 1.40, 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.46; P < 0.001) after adjustment for other factors. The prevalence, progression, and incidence of myopia and high myopia could be categorized into two grade groups: I (grades 1-6) and II (grades 7-12). Specifically, COVID-19 quarantine for 6 months sufficiently increased risk of developing myopia (OR: 1.36, 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.40) or high myopia (OR: 1.30, 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.39) in Grade Group I, but decreased risk of developing myopia (OR: 0.45, 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.48) or high myopia (OR: 0.57, 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.59) in Grade Group II. Interpretation The finding that behavioral modifications for six months during COVID-19 quarantine sufficiently and grade-specifically modify myopia development offers the largest human behavioral intervention data at the one million scale to identify the grade-specific causal factors and effective prevention methods for guiding the formulation of myopia prevention and control policies.

These tensions are often examined using a deficit-based approach to policy analysis, which highlights policy gaps or demonstrates how what is written creates problems in practice. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study used an asset-based approach by scanning existing LTRC regulations in 4 Canadian jurisdictions for promising staff-related policy guidance for enhancing resident QoL. A modified objective hermeneutics method was used to determine how 63 existing policy documents might be interpreted to support Kanes 11 QoL domains. RESULTS: Analysis revealed regulations that covered all 11 resident QoL domains, albeit with an overemphasis on safety, security, and order. Texts that mentioned other QoL domains often outlined passive or vague roles for staff. However, policy texts were found in all 4 jurisdictions that provided clear language to support staff discretion and flexibility to navigate regulatory tensions and enhance resident QoL. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The existing policy landscape includes promising staff-related LTRC regulation in every jurisdiction under investigation. Newer policies tend to reflect more interpretive approaches to staff flexibility and broader QoL concepts. If interpreted through a resident QoL lens and with the right structural supports, these promising texts offer important counters to the rigidity of LTRC policy landscape and can be leveraged to broaden and enhance QoL effectively for residents in LTRC.","output":"Long-Term Residential Care Policy Guidance for Staff to Support Resident Quality of Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genome databases are the locations, which permits storing, sharing, retrieving and comparison of the information related to the genomes of various individuals and organisms.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online questionnaire survey on the sample of 3,000 respondents aged 15+ randomly selected from the Czech internet panel using socio-demographic quotas was performed shortly after the end of confinement measures in May 2020 (response rate 35.4%). Questions covered current prevalence and patterns of substance use (i.e. in the last 12 months) and other forms of addictive behaviours as well as changes in their behaviour during the confinement measures. Responses were provided on categorical scale;a factor of 0 to 2 was assigned to the categories to quantify the changes where 1 means no change. RESULTS: Respondents reporting the highest frequency of current use, especially the use of alcohol, cannabis and sedatives, further increased their intensity of use during the confinement measures by 5-10% on average, while less frequent users reduced it. The reduction of use during confinement measures increased with decreasing frequency of current use. Although the same correlation exists in tobacco smokers, decrease in intensity of use was observed also in daily smokers. On the population level, our results suggest a slight increase in total alcohol and sedatives consumption and a significant increase in the total consumption of gaming and social media. On the contrary, there was a significant reduction in the consumption of tobacco and online gambling (likely due to the ban on sports matches), and a slight reduction in the consumption of cannabis and other illicit drugs. CONCLUSION: People with intensive patterns of substance use increased their use during confinement measures. The same concerns gaming and social media. Without this insight the overall picture suggests rather overall reduction of consumption.

Following a U.K. national lockdown from March 20, 2020, we studied business practices and behaviors in licensed premises to inform COVID-19 policies. To our knowledge, no previous study worldwide has examined these issues. METHOD Before premises reopened in Scotland, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews (May-June 2020) with participants from hospitality trade associations, licensed premises, or in related roles (n = 18). Interviews focused on anticipated business practices and challenges relevant to minimizing COVID-19 transmission. Following reopening (July-August 2020), we conducted observations of relevant practices and behaviors in 29 bars purposively sampled for diversity, using a structured schedule. Interviews and observation reports were analyzed thematically. RESULTS Interviewees generally sought clarity, flexibility, and balance in government guidance on reopening, and they cited commercial and practical challenges to doing so safely. Alcohol consumption was perceived as an additional but potentially manageable challenge. Most observed premises had made physical and operational modifications; however, practices were variable. Observed incidents of concern included close physical interaction between customers and with staff, frequently featuring alcohol intoxication and rarely effectively stopped by staff.

Research relating to COVID-19 aims to determine the effects of the pandemic on vulnerable populations who are at high risk of developing negative health or psychosocial outcomes. Having an ongoing medical condition during a pandemic may lead to greater psychological distress. Increased psychological distress may be due to preventative public health measures (e.g. lockdown), having an ongoing medical condition, or a combination of these factors. METHODS: This study analyses data from an online cross-sectional national survey of adults in Ireland and investigates the relationship between comorbidity and psychological distress. Those with a medical condition (n = 128) were compared to a control group without a medical condition (n = 128) and matched according to age, gender, annual income, education, and work status during COVID-19. Participants and data were obtained during the first public lockdown in Ireland (27 March 2020-8 June 2020). RESULTS: Individuals with existing medical conditions reported significantly higher levels of anxiety (p < .01) and felt less gratitude (p &#8804; .001). Exploratory analysis indicated that anxiety levels were significantly associated with illness perceptions specific to COVID-19. Post hoc analysis revealed that psychological well-being was not significantly related to condition type (e.g. respiratory disorders).

TTE training is arduous and impacts on departmental output, and 30% of echo departments in England had no cardiac physiologists training in TTE in 2018. In the face of a waiting list crisis due to loss of accredited staff, we introduced a novel, multifaceted and integrated TTE training programme for Agenda for Change (AfC) band 5 cardiac physiologists in January 2018. The aim was to train these much more junior staff, who were largely na?ve to echo, to BSE accreditation standard at twice our previous rate. Methods The training programme included (i) a foundation course with selection for further training on the basis of competence, (ii) an introductory scanning module, (iii) pathologyspecific training lists, (iv) training lists booked at reduced capacity (4 not 6 patients per list), (v) a complementary lecture programme, (vi) four levels of supervision with directions for both trainees and trainers of goals each week and (vii) ongoing review of progress. The primary end-point was the number of trainees per year achieving BSE accreditation standard compared to a historical control group (January 2010 to January 2018) in our hospitals. Secondary end-points include the impact of the training programme on departmental capacity and the duration of training. Results In the control period, 7 sonographers were trained to BSE accreditation in a mean of 31 months (range 24 to 48 months), a training rate of 1.0 accredited sonographer/year. These staff were all AfC band 6, began training at an average age of 30 years, had a median of 4.7 years of prior postgraduate experience in cardiac physiology (range 0.75 to 5.25 years), and 4 had past echo training experience elsewhere. From January 2018 to Jan 2021, 11 physiologists entered the new training programme. These trainees were an average age of 25 years, median AfC Band of 5.0 and had a median of 1.5 years (range 0.25 to 11 yrs) of postgraduate experience in cardiac physiology. The training programme reduced departmental core echo capacity by 16% in the second year of implementation. Core capacity was recovered in the third year as trainees completed the programme. TTE out-patient waiting lists were maintained at less than 6 weeks by support from out-of-hours' work. Four trainees did not complete the programme. Five physiologists achieved full BSE accreditation by January 2021, in an average of 27 months of training (range 22 to 34 months) with some delays due to the 2020 Covid pandemic. This represents a training rate to independent scanning of 1.7 sonographers per year on the new programme. Conclusion A programme of intensive training of echo-na?ve very junior cardiac physiologists achieved a 70% increase in the rate of attainment of BSE accreditation compared to historical performance with training completed in a similar timescale.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use machine learning to construct a model for the analysis of risk factors and prediction of mortality among ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, 123 patients with COVID-19 in the ICU of Vulcan Hill Hospital were retrospectively selected from the database, and the data were randomly divided into a training data set (n=98) and test data set (n=25) with a 4:1 ratio. Significance tests, correlation analysis, and factor analysis were used to screen 100 potential risk factors individually. Conventional logistic regression methods and four machine learning algorithms were used to construct the risk prediction model for the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. The performance of these machine learning models was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Interpretation and evaluation of the risk prediction model were performed using calibration curves, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), etc, to ensure its stability and reliability. The outcome was based on the ICU deaths recorded from the database. RESULTS: Layer-by-layer screening of 100 potential risk factors finally revealed 8 important risk factors that were included in the risk prediction model: lymphocyte percentage, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, eosinophil percentage, creatinine, neutrophil percentage, and albumin level. Finally, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model established with the 8 important risk factors showed the best recognition ability in the training set of 5-fold cross validation (AUC=0.86) and the verification queue (AUC=0.92). The calibration curve showed that the risk predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual risk. In addition, using the SHAP and LIME algorithms, feature interpretation and sample prediction interpretation algorithms of the XGBoost black box model were implemented. Additionally, the model was translated into a web-based risk calculator that is freely available for public usage. CONCLUSIONS: The 8-factor XGBoost model predicts risk of death in ICU patients with COVID-19 well; it initially demonstrates stability and can be used effectively to predict COVID-19 prognosis in ICU patients.","output":"Prognostic Assessment of COVID-19 in the Intensive Care Unit by Machine Learning Methods: Model Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We characterized the cellular immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in 12- to 14-month-old BALB/c mice, a model that mimics features of the human disease. Following intranasal administration, the virus replicated in the lungs, with peak titers on day 2 postinfection. Enhanced production of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) correlated with migration of NK cells, macrophages, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) into the lungs. By day 7, histopathologic evidence of pneumonitis was seen in the lungs when viral clearance occurred. At this time, a second wave of enhanced production of cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, gamma interferon [IFN-gamma], IL-2, and IL-5), chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5), and receptors (CXCR3, CCR2, and CCR5), was detected in the lungs, associated with an influx of T lymphocytes. Depletion of CD8(+) T cells at the time of infection did not affect viral replication or clearance. However, depletion of CD4(+) T cells resulted in an enhanced immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of SARS-CoV from the lungs, which was associated with reduced neutralizing antibody and cytokine production and reduced pulmonary recruitment of lymphocytes. Innate defense mechanisms are able to control SARS-CoV infection in the absence of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and antibodies.

DISCUSSION: Rapidly shifting current events and an evolving pandemic required continuous updating of our approach. Using a variety of recruitment strategies and participation methods allowed us to quickly adapt and to reach a broad range of people with diverse needs and circumstances. Door-to-door recruitment had many unexpected benefits, allowing us to easily reach people that were working from home and leaving people with positive impressions of public health research. However, even when we were able to elicit a response from prospective participants, follow-up has remained a substantial challenge.

However, it is currently unclear whether spinal surgical procedures pose an additional risk of viral transmission to the surgical team. We reviewed the available evidence to ascertain the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) blood viremia and the virus blood transmissibility, as well as evidence of blood-aerosol generation and operating room contamination from spinal surgical procedures. There is established evidence of COVID-19 blood viremia, a viral pathogenic cycle via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors and similar blood transmission risk data from the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)/MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) era. Spinal surgical practices demonstrate significant blood-aerosol generation from the operative wound due to the use of common surgical instruments, such as electrocautery, as well as high-speed and high-impact devices. Based on the evidence, there is an established additional risk of viral transmission faced by surgical teams from blood-aerosols generated from the operative wound of COVID-19- infected patients via the inhalation of virus-laden aerosols and the subsequent initiation of the viral pathogenic cycle through binding with pulmonary ACE-2 receptors. Recognizing this additional risk amidst the ongoing pandemic serves as a caution to front-line surgical personnel to strictly adhere to personal protective equipment usage in operating rooms, to modify surgical techniques to reduce the hazard of surgical aerosol generation and COVID-19 viral exposure, and to consider it as an integral aspect of planning and adapting to the new normal operating practices.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 Transmission: Blood Viremia and Aerosol Generation from Spinal Surgery.

In particular, disproportionate use of antibiotics, high ICU burden and longer in-hospital stays during the pandemic have been proposed to aggravate the emergency posed by carbapenem-resistant isolates (CRI), specially through carbapenemase production. However, there have been few reports worldwide regarding changes in CRI incidence and little latinamerican literature. Objective: We set out to determine whether the incidence of CRI rose in a tertiary care center in Santa Fe, Argentina during the time period with active cases of COVID-19. Methods: Analytic epidemiologic study retrospectively designed. Two time periods were defined: P1 (without active cases of COVID-19) from September, 2019 to August, 2020 and P2 (starting at the onset of the first wave of COVID-19 in this institution) from September, 2020 to June 2021. All clinically-relevant microbiological samples -those meant for diagnostic purposes- taken during the study period from patients in the Internal Medicine and Surgical wards as well as the Intensive Care Units were included. Incidence was calculated by dividing the number of CRI during each time frame by the count of patient-day during that same period, multiplied by a hundred. Results: 9,135 hospitalizations, 50,145 patient-days of analysis. A total of 7285 clinical samples were taken, with an overall positivity for CRI of 12.1% (n=883). Overall CRI incidence during P2 was 2.5 times higher than in P1 (2.52 vs 0.955/100 patient-days, p <0.001). ICU CRI incidence raised from 6.78 to 8.69/100 patient-days in P2 (p=0.006). Conclusion: We found alarming rates of CRI in our center, 2.5 times higher than previous to the first COVID-19 wave, similar to other reports worldwide. To our knowledge, this is one of the few Latin-American reports on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on CRI incidence.","output":"An outbreak inside an outbreak: rising incidence of carbapenem-resistant isolates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

With decreasing Influenza epidemic and upcoming SARS-CoV-2 infections we proceeded further and analysed patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study, nasal breath of 75 patients (34m, 41f, aged 64.4  15.4 years) was investgated by MCC-IMS for viral infections. 14 were positively diagnosed for Influenza-A infection and 16 for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs. In one patient RT-PCR was highly suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 but initially inconclusive. The remaining 44 patients served as controls. Breath fingerprints for specific infections were assessed by a combination of cluster analysis and multivariate statistics. There was no significant difference in gender or age according to the groups. In the cross validation of the discriminant analysis 72 of the 74 patients could be correctly classified to the respective group. Even the inconclusive patient could be mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 group applying the discrimination functions.

We sought to investigate pulmonary hemodynamics and ventilation properties in patients with CARDS compared to patients with ARDS of pulmonary origin. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive adults with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients treated in our ICU in 04/2020 and a comparison of the data to matched controls with ARDS due to respiratory infections treated in our ICU from 01/2014 to 08/2019 for whom pulmonary artery catheter data were available. RESULTS: CARDS patients (n = 10) had ventilation characteristics similar to those of ARDS (n = 10) patients. Nevertheless, mechanical power applied by ventilation was significantly higher in CARDS patients (23.4  8.9 J/min) than in ARDS (15.9  4.3 J/min; P < 0.05). COVID-19 patients had similar pulmonary artery pressure but significantly lower pulmonary vascular resistance, as cardiac output was higher in CARDS vs. ARDS patients (P < 0.05). Shunt fraction and dead space were similar in CARDS compared to ARDS (P > 0.05) and were correlated with hypoxemia in both groups. The arteriovenous pCO2 difference (a?pCO2) was elevated (CARDS 5.5  2.8 mmHg vs. ARDS 4.7  1.1 mmHg; P > 0.05), as was the P(v-a)CO2/C(a-v)O2 ratio (CARDS mean 2.2  1.5 vs. ARDS 1.7  0.8; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients seems to differ only slightly from ARDS regarding ventilation characteristics and pulmonary hemodynamics.

Although morphological differences are observed in garlic, which is obligatory apomictically propagated, clonal propagation causes narrowing variation, a genetic bottleneck. This situation complicates breeding programs aiming improvements in preferred agronomic characteristics. For this reason, determining the morphological and molecular differences between garlic genotypes originating from Turkey is important for breeding studies. In this study, morphological and molecular characteristics of 39 garlic genotypes, which are widely cultivated in Turkey, were determined. Kahramanmara?4 genotype was different from other genotypes in terms of some morphological features (fresh weight, dry weight, and bulb diameter). In the molecular characterization study, 10 Inter-Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) primers were used, and it was determined that the genotype TekDi?31 of Tunceli region was different from other garlic genotypes. Genetic similarity coefficient was found to be high (0.85C1.0) in genotypes except for TekDi?31 garlic genotype.

In conclusion, this study revealed that the garlic plant, despite its clonal propagation, consisted of some level of morphological and partially molecular variation. Due to its mode of reproduction (vegetative), this variation may largely be due to point or chromosomal mutation.

Social capital has also been associated with behaviors that promote better health and reduce the impacts of diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, face masking, and vaccination have all been essential in controlling contagion. These behaviors have not been uniformly adopted by communities in the United States. Using different facets of social capital to explain the differences in public behaviors among communities during pandemics is lacking. Objective This study examines the relationship among public health behavior, vaccination, face masking, and physical distancing during COVID-19 pandemic and social capital indices in counties in the United States. Methods We used publicly available vaccination data as of June 2021, face masking data in July 2020, and mobility data from mobile phones movements from the end of March 2020. Then, correlation analysis was conducted with county-level social capital index and its subindices (family unity, community health, institutional health, and collective efficacy) that were obtained from the Social Capital Project by the United States Senate. Results We found the social capital index and its subindices differentially correlate with different public health behaviors. Vaccination is associated with institutional health: positively with fully vaccinated population and negatively with vaccination hesitancy. Also, wearing masks negatively associates with community health, whereases reduced mobility associates with better community health. Further, residential mobility positively associates with family unity. By comparing correlation coefficients, we find that social capital and its subindices have largest effect sizes on vaccination and residential mobility. Conclusion Our results show that different facets of social capital are significantly associated with adoption of protective behaviors, e.g., social distancing, face masking, and vaccination. As such, our results suggest that differential facets of social capital imply a Swiss cheese model of pandemic control planning where, e.g., institutional health and community health, provide partially overlapping behavioral benefits.","output":"Social Capital Dimensions are Differentially Associated with COVID-19 Vaccinations, Masks, and Physical Distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GuillainCBarr syndrome (GBS) is a rare autoimmune disorder.

As brain cells themselves can secrete TNF-like factors upon stimulation, we examined the effect of TNF- on IFN--mediated class II induction on astrocytes. TNF- alone had no effect on class II expression, but did synergize with IFN- for enhanced expression of class II antigens. The specificity of TNF- activity was demonstrated by blocking the amplifying effect of TNF- with a polyclonal anti-TNF- antibody. Kinetic analysis of the synergistic effect indicated that optimal TNF- enhancement of class II expression was observed when astrocytes were pretreated with IFN- 12C24 h prior to TNF- addition. A possible mechanism for the synergistic action between IFN- and TNF- may be increased TNF- receptor expression by IFN-. Astrocytes treated with IFN- for 24 h express more TNF- receptors (3900/cell) than do untreated astrocytes (2483/cell), with no significant change in the binding affinity (K(d)). These results suggest that the synergistic activity of TNF- requires an inductive signal from IFN-, which in part may be increased TNF- receptor expression. Altogether, our observations indicate that TNF- enhances ongoing class II major histocompatibility complex gene expression in rat astrocytes, which in this system is initially induced by IFN-.

We aimed to explore the clinical roles of NETs and the regulation of complement on the NET formation in COVID-19. METHODS: We recruited 135 COVID-19 patients and measured plasma levels of C5, C3, cell-free DNA and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA. Besides, the formation of NETs was detected by immunofluorescent staining and the cytotoxicity to vascular endothelial HUVEC cells was evaluated by CCK-8 assay. RESULTS: We found that the plasma levels of complements C3 and MPO-DNA were positively related to coagulation indicator fibrin(-ogen) degradation products (C3: r = 0.300, p = 0.005; MPO-DNA: r = 0.316, p = 0.002) in COVID-19 patients. Besides, C3 was positively related to direct bilirubin (r = 0.303, p = 0.004) and total bilirubin (r = 0.304, p = 0.005), MPO-DNA was positively related to lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.306, p = 0.003) and creatine kinase (r = 0.308, p = 0.004).

The pathological effect of the anaphylatoxin-NET axis on the damage of vascular endothelial cells could be relieved by recombinant carboxypeptidase B (CPB), a stable homolog of enzyme CPB2 which can degrade anaphylatoxins to inactive products.

Risk factors include pre-existing conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. There are currently no effective treatments. Our objective was to complete a meta-analysis to identify comorbidity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially conferring increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a computational approach. Results SNP datasets were downloaded from publicly available GWAS catalog for 141 of 258 candidate COVID-19 comorbidities. Gene-level SNP analysis was performed to identify significant pathways by using MAGMA program. SNP annotation program was used to analyze MAGMA-identified genes. COVID-19 comorbidities from six disease categories were found to have significant associated pathways, which were validated by Q-Q plots (p<0.05). The top 250 human mRNA gene expressions for SNP-affected pathways, extracted from publicly accessible gene expression profiles, were evaluated for significant pathways. Protein-protein interactions of identified differentially expressed genes, visualized with STRING program, were significant (p<0.05). Gene interaction networks were found to be relevant to SARS and influenza pathogenesis. Conclusion Pathways potentially affected by or affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified in underlying medical conditions likely to confer susceptibility and/or severity to COVID-19.

Currently designated variants of concern (VOCs) are B.1.1.7, B1.351, P.1, B.1.617.2 variants and B.1.1.529. Possible options for VOC are urgently required as they carry mutations in the virus spike protein that allow them to spread more easily and cause more serious illness. The primary targets for most therapeutic methods against SARS-CoV-2 are the S (Spike) protein and RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain), which alter the binding to ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2). The most popular of these strategies involves the use of drug development targeting the RBD and the NTD (N-terminal domain) of the spike protein and multiple epitopes of the S protein. Various types of mutations have been observed in the RBDs of B.1.1.7, B1.351, P. and B.1.620. The incidence of RBD mutations increases the binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor. The high binding affinity of RBD and ACE2 has provided a structural basis for future evaluation of antibodies and drug development. Here we discuss the variants of SARS-CoV-2 and recent updates on the clinical evaluation of antibody-based treatment options.

As large numbers of people continue to be infected, the efficacy and duration of natural immunity in terms of protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and severe disease is of crucial significance for the future. This narrative review provides an overview on epidemiological studies addressing this issue. National surveys covering 2020C2021 documented that a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a significantly reduced risk of reinfections with efficacy lasting for at least one year and only relatively moderate waning immunity. Importantly, natural immunity showed roughly similar effect sizes regarding protection against reinfection across different SARS-CoV-2 variants, with the exception of the Omicron variant for which data are just emerging before final conclusions can be drawn. Risk of hospitalizations and deaths was also reduced in SARS-CoV-2 reinfections versus primary infections. Observational studies indicate that natural immunity may offer equal or greater protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to individuals receiving two doses of an mRNA vaccine, but data are not fully consistent. The combination of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and a respective vaccination, termed hybrid immunity, seems to confer the greatest protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections, but several knowledge gaps remain regarding this issue.

To uncover the effective strategies implemented during the controlled phase, we develop a mathematical model that is able to describe the data from both phases of COVID-19 dynamics in Nepal. Using our best parameter estimates with 95% confidence interval, we found that during the controlled phase most of the recorded cases were imported from outside the country with a small number generated from the local transmission, consistent with the data. Our model predicts that these successful strategies were able to maintain the reproduction number at around 0.21 during the controlled phase, preventing 442,640 cases of COVID-19 and saving more than 1,200 lives in Nepal. However, during the outgrown phase, when the strategies such as border screening and quarantine, lockdown, and detection and isolation, were altered, the reproduction number raised to 1.8, resulting in exponentially growing cases of COVID-19. We further used our model to predict the long-term dynamics of COVID-19 in Nepal and found that without any interventions the current trend may result in about 18.76 million cases (10.70 million detected and 8.06 million undetected) and 89 thousand deaths in Nepal by the end of 2021.

It was believed until recently that the only possible mechanism of RNA recombination is replicative template switching, with synthesis of a complementary strand starting on one viral RNA molecule and being completed on another. The newly synthesized RNA is a primary recombinant molecule in this case. Recent studies have revealed other mechanisms of replicative RNA recombination. In addition, recombination between the genomes of RNA viruses can be nonreplicative, resulting from a joining of preexisting parental molecules. Recombination is a potent tool providing for both the variation and conservation of the genome in RNA viruses. Replicative and nonreplicative mechanisms may contribute differently to each of these evolutionary processes. In the form of trans splicing, nonreplicative recombination of cell RNAs plays an important role in at least some organisms.

Emergence of new DMTs in SPMS are changing the treatment landscape. There is a need to better understand current practice and the factors underlying it, to facilitate consensus on the overall management of SPMS and optimise diagnostic and management decisions. This survey project aimed to assess current practices for the diagnosis and management of patients with SPMS in the UK. METHODS Healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in the management of patients with SPMS from geographically distributed MS neurology centres in the UK participated in face-to-face or telephone interviews, facilitated by a semi-structured questionnaire. The survey data were descriptively analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS Fifty-nine HCPs (41 neurologists, 15 specialist nurses and 3 'other'), from 59 UK centres took part. Sixty-one percent (n = 36/59) of respondents applied a specific definition for SPMS, although only 6% of these (2/36) used the Lublin 2014 phenotype criteria. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score increase with an absence of relapses was an important consideration for SPMS diagnosis for 83% (n = 49/59) of respondents, and 36% (n = 21/59) considered this to be the most important piece of evidence that they look for when they suspect a patient is transitioning from RRMS to SPMS. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) estimated time between first suspicion and diagnosis of SPMS was 12 months (12-24 [n = 45/59]), with concerns over withdrawing DMTs and the psychological impact of a diagnosis on patients the most commonly reported reasons for reluctance to diagnose. Seventy-three percent (n = 43/59) of respondents followed specific guidelines for DMT management of patients transitioning from RRMS to SPMS, with most (86%, n = 37/43) using the NHS England algorithm. Ninety-eight percent (n = 58/59) use DMTs to treat patients they suspect may be transitioning to SPMS, and 51% (n = 30/59) reported using DMTs for newly diagnosed SPMS patients. Approximately 1 in 5 HCPs may consider continuing DMTs beyond EDSS 7.0 in certain circumstances. CONCLUSION The survey highlighted variation across the UK in SPMS definition, diagnosis and reported real-world management. Disparity in practice may result in unnecessary variations in treatment patterns and consequently outcomes. HCPs should be equipped to make timely and accurate decisions, which will be important in improving access to appropriate therapies for patients with SPMS.","output":"Results from SPECTRUM: A survey of healthcare professionals to understand current diagnosis and management practices for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work is an attempt to look at the legal and environmental implications of coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak in India.

In the event that the presence of antibodies correlated with immunity, 60% of participants reported that certificates should be offered to the general population. The results showed variations in perceptions of certificates depending on the context (73% agreed on certificates utility for travel, 72% for entering a country, and 32% for the right to work). Provided an effective vaccine was available, 55% of participants agreed that vaccination should be mandatory and 49% agreed that a vaccination certificate should be mandatory. About 68% reported a potential risk of discrimination and 28% a risk of deliberate infection. Differences were seen with age, gender and education level. This study shows that the general adult population in Geneva, Switzerland can envisage scenarios where COVID-19 immunity, and eventually vaccination, certificates would be useful. Seroprevalence estimates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain low to date, and the interpretability of serological testing and immunity remains undefined. However, the information from this study is important, especially the differences based on context and the socio-demographic variations, and should be taken into account if COVID-19-related certificates are to be implemented.","output":"Perceptions of immunity and vaccination certificates among the general population: a nested study within a serosurvey of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (SEROCoV-POP)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a known cause of enteric disease in cattle; however, its role in bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is poorly understood, with a dearth of evidence of the detection of the virus in respiratory tract lesions.

Methods - In this retrospective study, we asked orthopaedic trainees in the KSS (Kent, Surrey, Sussex) and London Deaneries to complete a survey regarding their experience in redeployment during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study took place in the Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and London regions of the United Kingdom over a period of 8 weeks from 15th of March 2020 until 15th of May 2020. The study was based at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust and participants were recruited from a number of secondary and tertiary care centres across the region. 120 orthopaedic trainees were contacted, working in 21 teaching hospitals. Of these, 40 trainees (30%) from 13 hospitals responded and completed the survey. Results - 50% of the surveyed trainees were redeployed to other specialties. Trainees spent varying amounts of time in the redeployed speciality and gave differing views on how comfortable they felt and how useful they felt the experience was. One-third of trainees experienced symptoms and/or tested positive for COVID-19 and the majority of these were redeployed to other specialties. Interpretation - Orthopaedic training appears to have taken a temporary back seat at this time but trainees have made a significant contribution to reinforcing key front-line specialties in the fight against COVID-19.","output":"Redeployment of the trainee orthopaedic surgeon during COVID-19: a fish out of water?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human resources are the main factor ensuring the efficiency of the company, especially in the middle of the disruption era and the Covid-19 pandemic.

Samples were taken from twelve full-fledged Indonesian Islamic Banks from 2014 to 2019. The efficiency frontier analysis results show that most Islamic banks within the period of research are operating more on variable returns to scale basis, and only one bank has consistently been able to increase the output of financial intermediation performance proportionally for each additional input of human resources cost. The pooled regression test results on the three bank performance models show that allocation of human resource funds in Islamic banks tends to have more effect on increasing operational profits rather than the distribution of funds to the public through financing mechanisms or investment in Islamic securities. Based on verified models, more innovation in training employees and investing in training costs are needed for employees to have a deeper understanding of the nature of risk-profit of financing and investment activities of Sharia/Islamic banks.

They are asymptomatic unknown carriers who can still infect those with whom they come into contact. Understanding what makes them immune could inform public health policies as to who needs to be protected and why, and possibly lead to a novel treatment for those who cannot, or will not, be vaccinated once a vaccine is available. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study were to learn if machine learning could identify patterns in the pathogen-host immune relationship that differentiate or predict COVID-19 symptom immunity and, if so, which ones and at what levels. The secondary objective was to learn if machine learning could take such differentiators to build a model that could predict COVID-19 immunity with clinical accuracy. The tertiary purpose was to learn about the relevance of other immune factors. METHODS: This was a comparative effectiveness research study on 53 common immunological factors using machine learning on clinical data from 74 similarly grouped Chinese COVID-19Cpositive patients, 37 of whom were symptomatic and 37 asymptomatic. The setting was a single-center primary care hospital in the Wanzhou District of China. Immunological factors were measured in patients who were diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the 14 days before observations were recorded. The median age of the 37 asymptomatic patients was 41 years (range 8-75 years); 22 were female, 15 were male. For comparison, 37 RT-PCR testCpositive patients were selected and matched to the asymptomatic group by age, comorbidities, and sex. Machine learning models were trained and compared to understand the pathogen-immune relationship and predict who was immune to COVID-19 and why, using the statistical programming language R. RESULTS: When stem cell growth factor-beta (SCGF-) was included in the machine learning analysis, a decision tree and extreme gradient boosting algorithms classified and predicted COVID-19 symptom immunity with 100% accuracy. When SCGF- was excluded, a random-forest algorithm classified and predicted asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of COVID-19 with 94.8% AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) curve accuracy (95% CI 90.17%-100%). In total, 34 common immune factors have statistically significant associations with COVID-19 symptoms (all c<.05), and 19 immune factors appear to have no statistically significant association. CONCLUSIONS: The primary outcome was that asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 could be identified by three distinct immunological factors and levels: SCGF- (>127,637), interleukin-16 (IL-16) (>45), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (>57). The secondary study outcome was the suggestion that stem-cell therapy with SCGF- may be a novel treatment for COVID-19. Individuals with an SCGF- level >127,637, or an IL-16 level >45 and an M-CSF level >57, appear to be predictively immune to COVID-19 100% and 94.8% (AUROC) of the time, respectively. Testing levels of these three immunological factors may be a valuable tool at the point of care for managing and preventing outbreaks. Further, stem-cell therapy via SCGF- and M-CSF appear to be promising novel therapeutics for patients with COVID-19.","output":"A Machine Learning Explanation of the Pathogen-Immune Relationship of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), and a Model to Predict Immunity and Therapeutic Opportunity: A Comparative Effectiveness Research Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This document aims to provide practical guidance for the assessment and management of patients with thrombocytopenia, with a particular focus on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a great health risk to the public. Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis of the virus plays a crucial role in treatment of the disease and saving lives. The current standard method for coronavirus detection is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method. However, laboratory-based RT-PCR test for SARS-COV-2 requires complex facilities and elaborate training of operators, thus suffering from limit testing capacity and delayed results. Consequently, isothermal PCR such as Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been emerging as a great alternative to the RT-PCR method. LAMP possesses some fundamental advantages such as amplification at a constant temperature, no need of a thermal cycler, a faster test result, and potentially a larger diagnostic capacity, while maintaining similar sensitivity and specificity, thus making it more suitable than the RT-PCR for monitoring a pandemic. Starting with a brief introduction of the working principle of LAMP method, this review summarizes recent progress in LAMP-enabled SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection. Lastly, future research directions are discussed.

METHODS: During March and April 2020, a protocolized approach was implemented in our unit to reduce the number of outpatient visits and hospital admissions throughout the maximum COVID-19 spread period. We compared emergency room (ER) visits, hospital admissions, and mortality with those of January and February 2020. RESULTS: When compared to the preceding months, during the COVID pandemic there was a 56.5% reduction in the ER visits and a 46.9% reduction in hospital admissions, without an increase in mortality (9 patients died in both time periods). A total of 18 patients required a visit to the outpatient clinic for decompensation of heart failure or others.

However, we have previously reported that heterologous schedules incorporating an adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AstraZeneca; hereafter referred to as ChAd) and an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, PfizerCBioNTech; hereafter referred to as BNT) at a 4-week interval are more reactogenic than homologous schedules. Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous schedules with the ChAd and BNT vaccines. METHODS: Com-COV is a participant-blinded, randomised, non-inferiority trial evaluating vaccine safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. Adults aged 50 years and older with no or well controlled comorbidities and no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by laboratory confirmation were eligible and were recruited at eight sites across the UK. The majority of eligible participants were enrolled into the general cohort (28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals), who were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive ChAd/ChAd, ChAd/BNT, BNT/BNT, or BNT/ChAd, administered at either 28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals. A small subset of eligible participants (n=100) were enrolled into an immunology cohort, who had additional blood tests to evaluate immune responses; these participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to the four schedules (28-day interval only). Participants were masked to the vaccine received but not to the prime-boost interval. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentration (measured by ELISA) at 28 days after boost, when comparing ChAd/BNT with ChAd/ChAd, and BNT/ChAd with BNT/BNT. The heterologous schedules were considered non-inferior to the approved homologous schedules if the lower limit of the one-sided 975% CI of the GMR of these comparisons was greater than 063. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done among participants receiving at least one dose of a study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 69254139. FINDINGS: Between Feb 11 and Feb 26, 2021, 830 participants were enrolled and randomised, including 463 participants with a 28-day prime-boost interval, for whom results are reported here. The mean age of participants was 578 years (SD 47), with 212 (46%) female participants and 117 (25%) from ethnic minorities. At day 28 post boost, the geometric mean concentration of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in ChAd/BNT recipients (12 906 ELU/mL) was non-inferior to that in ChAd/ChAd recipients (1392 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 92 (one-sided 975% CI 75 to ). In participants primed with BNT, we did not show non-inferiority of the heterologous schedule (BNT/ChAd, 7133 ELU/mL) against the homologous schedule (BNT/BNT, 14 080 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 051 (one-sided 975% CI 043 to ). Four serious adverse events occurred across all groups, none of which were considered to be related to immunisation. INTERPRETATION: Despite the BNT/ChAd regimen not meeting non-inferiority criteria, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations of both heterologous schedules were higher than that of a licensed vaccine schedule (ChAd/ChAd) with proven efficacy against COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation. Along with the higher immunogenicity of ChAd/BNT compared with ChAD/ChAd, these data support flexibility in the use of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using ChAd and BNT COVID-19 vaccines.

COVID-19 patients in the Xiangya ward of the West District of the Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, Hubei province, were included in this study from February 9 to March 20, 2020. Healthcare providers who volunteered as family members were assigned to patients. They practiced one-to-one care and provided continuous and whole care for the patients who were from admission to discharge. Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were used to evaluate the resilience and psychological status of COVID-19 inpatients upon hospital admission, 2 weeks after admission, and at their discharge from the hospital. RESULTS The questionnaire response rate of the \\"family member-like\\" strategies was 100%. Of the 60 patients, 39 (65.0%) were male, and 21 (35%) were female. The hospital stay was (27.53.5) days. All the 60 patients were cured and discharged without any death and serious complications. The total scores for CD-RISC were 8.836.86 at admission, 29.135.42 at 2 weeks after admission, and 33.876.14 at discharge, which were significantly improved at the 2 follow-ups (F=404.564, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis and repeated measurements also indicated that patients experienced significant improvements in tenacity (F=360.839, P<0.001), strength (F=368.217, P<0.001), and optimism (F=328.456, P<0.001) at the 2 follow-ups. The total scores of DASS-21 were 49.2711.30 at admission, 30.7716.71 at 2 weeks after admission, and 4.1711.03 at discharge, and the scores were significantly decreased at the 2 follow-ups (F=270.536, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis and repeated measurements also indicated that patients experienced significant decreases in depression (F=211.938, P<0.001), anxiety (F=285.592, P<0.001), and stress (F=287.478, P<0.001) at the 2 follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS \\"Family member-like\\" strategies had positive effects on improving psychological resilience and reducing the symptoms of anxiety and depression of COVID-19 patients. It might be an effective care method for COVID-19 patients. It should be incorporated into emergency care management to improve care quality during public health emergencies of infectious diseases.","output":"Application of \\"family member-like\\" care strategies among COVID-19 patients in an isolation ward."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India has been the latest global epicenter for COVID-19, a novel coronavirus disease that emerged in China in late 2019. We present a base mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India and its neighbour, Pakistan. The base model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is parameterized using cumulative COVID-19 mortality data from each of the two countries. The model was used to assess the population-level impact of the control and mitigation strategies implemented in the two countries (notably community lockdowns, use of face masks, and social-distancing). Numerical simulations of the basic model indicate that, based on the current baseline levels of the control and mitigation strategies implemented, the pandemic trajectory in India is on a downward trend (as characterized by the reproduction number of the disease dynamics in India below, but close to, unity). This downward trend will be reversed, and India will be recording mild outbreaks (i.e., pandemic waves), if the control and mitigation strategies are relaxed from their current levels (e.g., relaxed to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are increased by 20% or 40% from their current baseline values). Our simulations suggest that India could record up to 460,000 cumulative deaths by early September 2021 under the baseline levels of the control strategies implemented (up to 25,000 of the projected deaths could be averted if the control and mitigation measures are strengthened to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are reduced by 20% from their baseline values). Our simulations show that the pandemic in Pakistan is much milder, with an estimated projected cumulative mortality of about 24,000 by early September 2021 under the baseline scenario. The basic model was extended to assess the impact of back-and-forth mobility between the two countries. Simulations of the resulting metapopulation model show that the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan increases with increasing values of the average time residents of India spend in Pakistan. In particular, it is shown that the India- to-Pakistan mobility pattern may trigger a fourth wave of the pandemic in Pakistan (under certain mobility scenarios), with daily mortality peaking in mid-August to mid-September of 2021. Under the respective baseline control scenarios, our simulations show that the back-and-forth mobility between India and Pakistan could delay the time-to-elimination of the COVID-19 pandemic in the two countries by three to five months (specifically, under the respective baseline scenarios, elimination could be delayed in India and Pakistan to November 2022 and July 2022, respectively).","output":"Dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India and Pakistan: A metapopulation modelling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Approximately 5% to 15% of patients with COVID-19 require invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and, at times, tracheostomy. Details regarding the safety and use of tracheostomy in treating COVID-19 continue to evolve. Objective: To evaluate the association of tracheostomy with COVID-19 patient outcomes and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health care professionals (HCPs). Data Sources: EMBASE (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and Web of Science from January 1, 2020, to March 4, 2021. Study Selection: English-language studies investigating patients with COVID-19 who were receiving IMV and undergoing tracheostomy. Observational and randomized clinical trials were eligible (no randomized clinical trials were found in the search). All screening was performed by 2 reviewers (P.S. and M.L.). Overall, 156 studies underwent full-text review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We performed data extraction in accordance with Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We used a random-effects model, and ROBINS-I was used for the risk-of-bias analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 transmission between HCPs and levels of personal protective equipment, in addition to complications, time to decannulation, ventilation weaning, and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge in patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy. Results: Of the 156 studies that underwent full-text review, only 69 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 14 of these 69 studies (20.3%) were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 4669 patients were included in the 69 studies, and the mean (range) patient age across studies was 60.7 (49.1-68.8) years (43 studies [62.3%] with 1856 patients). We found that in all studies, 1854 patients (73.8%) were men and 658 (26.2%) were women. We found that 28 studies (40.6%) investigated either surgical tracheostomy or percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Overall, 3 of 58 studies (5.17%) identified a small subset of HCPs who developed COVID-19 that was associated with tracheostomy. Studies did not consistently report the number of HCPs involved in tracheostomy. Among the patients, early tracheostomy was associated with faster ICU discharge (mean difference, 6.17 days; 95% CI, -11.30 to -1.30), but no change in IMV weaning (mean difference, -2.99 days; 95% CI, -8.32 to 2.33) or decannulation (mean difference, -3.12 days; 95% CI, -7.35 to 1.12). There was no association between mortality or perioperative complications and type of tracheostomy. A risk-of-bias evaluation that used ROBINS-I demonstrated notable bias in the confounder and patient selection domains because of a lack of randomization and cohort matching. There was notable heterogeneity in study reporting. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that enhanced personal protective equipment is associated with low rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during tracheostomy. Early tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 may reduce ICU stay, but this finding is limited by the observational nature of the included studies.","output":"Association of Tracheostomy With Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Among Health Care Professionals: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article examines the outlook and challenges relating to the provision of system-based support of healthcare providers and social services in the course of delivering their healthcare, mental health and social services to elderly people, in particular amidst a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of WFH on the individuals' perception about their future financial situation and their mental well-being. We apply a difference-in-differences (DiD) framework using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) combined with the UKHLS COVID-19 survey conducted in April 2020. Our findings suggest that those who have not experienced a shift from working at the employer's premises to WFH became more concerned about their future financial situation. However, we find that WFH has a negative impact on mental well-being. On the other hand, we find no difference in the mental well-being when we consider those who work from home on occasion. The findings of this study have policy implications for government, firms and health practitioners. In particular, a balance between WFH and at the employer's premises may provide both financial security and maintain the mental and psychological well-being at satisfying levels.","output":"Implications of COVID-19: The Effect of Working From Home on Financial and Mental Well-Being in the UK."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assembly of Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) begins at a bacteriophage-like portal complex that nucleates formation of an icosahedral capsid with capsid-associated tegument complexes (CATCs) and facilitates translocation of an 150-kb dsDNA genome, followed by acquisition of a pleomorphic tegument and envelope. Because of deviation from icosahedral symmetry, KSHV portal and tegument structures have largely been obscured in previous studies. Using symmetry-relaxed cryo-EM, we determined the in situ structure of the KSHV portal and its interactions with surrounding capsid proteins, CATCs, and the terminal end of KSHVs dsDNA genome. Our atomic models of the portal and capsid/CATC, together with visualization of CATCs variable occupancy and alternate orientation of CATC-interacting vertex triplexes, suggest a mechanism whereby the portal orchestrates procapsid formation and asymmetric long-range determination of CATC attachment during DNA packaging prior to pleomorphic tegumentation/envelopment.

However, the impact of IV infection alone on the prognosis of ARDS patients compared to that of patients with other causes of ARDS has been poorly assessed. METHODS: We compared the 28-day survival from the diagnosis of ARDS with an arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio 150 mmHg between patients with and without IV infection alone. Data were collected prospectively and analysed retrospectively. We first performed survival analysis on the whole population; second, patients with IV infection alone were compared with matched pairs using propensity score matching. RESULTS: The cohort admitted from October 2009 to March 2020 consisted of 572 patients, including 73 patients (13%) with IV alone. On the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation, nonpulmonary Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were significantly lower in patients with IV infection than in the other patients. After the adjusted analysis, IV infection alone remained independently associated with lower mortality at day 28 (hazard ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.26C0.99, p=0.047). Mortality at day 28 was significantly lower in patients with IV infection alone than in other patients when propensity score matching was used (20% versus 38%, p=0.02).

We characterized seven anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies for binding activity, pairing capability, and neutralization activity to SARS-CoV-2 and three variant RBDs via lateral flow immunoassays. The results allowed us to group these antibodies into three distinct epitope bins. Our studies showed that two antibodies had broadly potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and these variant RBDs and that one antibody did not neutralize the South African (SA) and Brazilian P.1 (BR P.1) RBDs. The antibody escaped by the SA and BR P.1 RBDs retained binding activity to SA and BR P.1 RBDs but was unable to induce neutralization.

There is still a lack of understanding of its origin, transmission, and treatment methods. Understanding the influencing factors of the COVID-19 can help mitigate its spread, but little research on the spatial factors has been conducted. Therefore, this study explores the effects of urban geometry and socio-demographic factors on the COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. For each patient, the places they visited during the incubation period before going to hospital were identified, and matched with corresponding attributes of urban geometry (i.e., building geometry, road network, greenspace) and socio-demographic factors (i.e., demographic, educational, economic, household and housing characteristics) based on the coordinates. The local cases were then compared with the imported cases using the stepwise logistic regression, the logistic regression with case-control of time, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression to identify factors influencing local disease transmission. Results show that the building geometry, road network and certain socio-economic characteristics are significantly associated with COVID-19 cases. In addition, the results indicate that urban geometry is playing a more important role than the socio-demographic characteristics in affecting the COVID-19 incidences.

The myringoplasty aims at the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane using a graft material. Autologous platelet-rich plasma can be used along with the graft to have a successful outcome. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of autologous platelet-rich plasma on graft uptake in myringoplasty. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 76 patients. All patients were above 18 and below 55 years of age diagnosed with chronic suppurative otitis media and were planned for myringoplasty. The participants were randomly allotted to two groups by block randomization (block of 4). Intra-operatively, group I (n=38) received platelet-rich plasmaCsoaked gel foam and group II (n=38) was taken as the control group who received saline-soaked gel foam and examined by a blinded examiner at the end of 1st and 3rd months. RESULTS: The mean air-bone gap reduction post-operatively in the platelet-rich plasma group was 8.68  4.8 (P value 0.034) and 6.05  4.05 in the control group. The improvement in pure-tone average in the platelet-rich plasma group (P = 0.009) is more than that in the control group.

The effect of being born small versus appropriate for gestational age (SGA vs. AGA), and accelerated early growth pattern on FM and FFM accretion was also investigated. RESULTS: Newborns (262 total, 150 males) with mean birth weight of 2863  418 g were enrolled.

Therefore, we conducted an investigation of how individuals with ASD responded to Covid-19 in terms of comprehension and adherence to implemented measures; changes in their behavioral problems; and how their caregivers' anxiety levels relate with these behavioral changes. Our sample consisted of 87 individuals with ASD (15 girls; ages ranged from 3-29, with an average of 13.96  6.1). The majority of our sample had problems understanding what Covid-19 is and the measures it requires. They also had challenges in implementing social distance and hygiene-related regulations of the pandemic. The majority stopped receiving special education during this period.

PVP-I is safe, demonstrating a 99.9% reduction in MERS and SARS activity, far greater than chlorhexidine or benzalkonium-chloride [1]. As oral and nasal fluids contain greater than 107 COVID-19 viruses per mL, PVP-I is a theoretically useful PEP adjunct with PPE. However, the evidence for using PVP-I as PEP, is neither clear nor clinical, extrapolations were made assuming Covid-19 will be just as susceptible to PVP-I in-vivo, as MERS and SARS were in-vitro [1]. Placing those concerns aside, 15% of the population with Thyroid disease are excluded from PVP-I use, but a similar proportion, who are as yet undiagnosed for thyroid disease remain at physiological risk from inadvertent exposure to iodine in PVP-I [2]. In healthy patients, iodine exposure initiates the Wolff-Chaikoff effect;transiently reducing thyroid hormone levels and this is a valuable response to control hypermetabolic morbidity and mortality from the thyroid storm [3]. However, for patients with unrecognised thyroid dysfunction, iodine exposure can either lead to chronic hypothyroidism with no adaptation to Wolff-Chaikoff down-regulation, or it can lead to the Jos-Basedow phenomenon and critical thyroid storm initiation from a loss of negative feedback [3]. Therefore the 15% of patients excluded from PVP-I use are not placed at risk but those patients undiagnosed as yet not recognised as having a thyroid dysfunction will be placed at risk if exposed to PVP-I. If the bidirectional relationship between thyroid disease and kidney function is considered with regard to renal drug excretion;the association of cardiovascular and psychiatric illness with underlying and undiagnosed thyroid disease is problematic. With such patients, the risk of adverse pharmacokinetic drug interactions demands even closer attention if we are to use PVP-I for any patient. Given the positive relationship of thyroid function with RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system), the potential to amplify ACE 2 expression with PVP-Iodine exposure could increase COVID-19 infection risk as more ACE 2 receptors become activated and the potential for viral cellular entry increases [4]. Thyroid disease exhibits a 10:1 female to male predisposition [2], whereas the morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, with equal infectivity is predominantly male. Using PVP-I as PEP may be intuitive, but paradoxically counter-productive;as a greater risk of infection arises in patients more at risk from the effects of COVID-19 by using PVP-I. With 37 isotopes and as many molecular formulations, iodine has many benefits, for example;Silver-Iodide can precipitate rainfall and disinfect surfaces, but there are environmental and medical risks too. To realise the full PEP potential of PVP-I against COVID-19, the theoretical concerns outlined above require further analysis. Thyroid patients are not at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 [5] and this silver lining in a nebulous cloud of PEP should be recognised when considering measures that could potentially do more harm than good.","output":"Thyroid storm, clouds and silver linings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces the notion of quantitative resilience of a control system. Following prior work, we study linear driftless systems enduring a loss of control authority over some of their actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators producing possibly undesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time readings but no control. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still reach a target after a partial loss of control authority. However, after a malfunction, a resilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to its initial capabilities. We quantify this loss of performance through the new concept of quantitative resilience. We define such a metric as the maximal ratio of the minimal times required to reach any target for the initial and malfunctioning systems. Na?ve computation of quantitative resilience directly from the definition is a complex task as it requires solving four nested, possibly nonlinear, optimization problems. The main technical contribution of this work is to provide an efficient method to compute quantitative resilience. Relying on control theory and on two novel geometric results we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a single linear optimization problem.

Fatality data were collated using triangulation methodology. Percentage change in coastal drowning fatalities between 2019/20 financial year (FY) and the 15FY annual average (2004/5-2018/19) were calculated for the dominant bushfire period (August 2019-February 2020 inclusive) and COVID-19 restrictions in place for 2019/20FY (March-June 2020 inclusive). Relative risk (RR; with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) of coastal drowning was calculated against the average for overall, bushfire and COVID-19 periods, using coastal participation data as the denominator, weighted for the predicted decrease in the use of outdoor coastal areas due to these widespread events. Coastal drowning fatalities increased in 2019/20FY by 9% overall (bushfires: 6%; COVID-19: 9%). Swimming/wading drowning fatalities increased during the bushfire period (RR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.13-3.63), while boating and personal watercraft (PWC)-related fatalities increased during both the bushfire (RR = 2.92; 95% CI: 1.41-6.05) and COVID-19 period (RR = 3.86; 95% CI: 1.64-9.11).

Therefore, hyperoxia is often encountered in critically ill patients. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that hyperoxia may affect outcome, although mechanisms are unclear.

However, it remains unclear whether these observations can be ascribed to direct immunosuppressive effects of hyperoxia or to preserved tissue oxygenation. In contrast to these putative anti-inflammatory effects, hyperoxia may elicit an inflammatory response and organ damage in itself, known as oxygen toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that, in the absence of systemic inflammation, short-term hyperoxia (100% O2 for 2.5 hours in mice and 3.5 hours in humans) does not result in increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in both mice and healthy volunteers. Furthermore, we show that, compared with room air, hyperoxia does not affect the systemic inflammatory response elicited by administration of bacterial endotoxin in mice and man. Finally, neutrophil phagocytosis and ROS generation are unaffected by short-term hyperoxia.

Because the primary trial endpoint was vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic disease, there are limited data on the extent to which vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ability to infect others (infectiousness). Assumptions about VE against infection and infectiousness have implications for changes to infection prevention guidance for vaccinated populations, including testing strategies. METHODS: We use a stochastic agent-based SEIR model of a nursing home to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We model three scenarios, varying VE against infection, infectiousness, and symptoms, to understand the expected impact of vaccination in nursing homes, increasing staff vaccination coverage, and different screening testing strategies under each scenario. RESULTS: Increasing vaccination coverage in staff decreases total symptomatic cases in the nursing home (among staff and residents combined) in each VE scenario. In scenarios with 50% and 90% VE against infection and infectiousness, increasing staff coverage reduces symptomatic cases among residents. If vaccination only protects against symptoms, and asymptomatic cases remain infectious, increased staff coverage increases symptomatic cases among residents. However, this is outweighed by the reduction in symptomatic cases among staff. Higher frequency testing-more than once weekly-is needed to reduce total symptomatic cases if the vaccine has lower efficacy against infection and infectiousness, or only protects against symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging staff vaccination is not only important for protecting staff, but might also reduce symptomatic cases in residents if a vaccine confers at least some protection against infection or infectiousness.","output":"Mathematical modeling to inform vaccination strategies and testing approaches for COVID-19 in nursing homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People with multiple sclerosis (MS), who are often immunocompromised, require complex care and engage with a variety of health\\\\care providers to manage their health.

Previous studies showing the association of AIP with C-reactive protein (CRP) and microalbuminuria included hypertensive and diabetic patients. We aimed to determine the association of AIP with CRP and albuminuria in a normotensive and nondiabetic population. Methods: The study was conducted retrospectively. Two hundred thirty-three individuals without hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, malignancy, systemic inflammatory disease, nephrological disease, and active infection were determined and included in the study. Urinary albumin excretion was calculated from the albumin-creatinine ratio in fresh spot urine [urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR)]. AIP risk groups were compared in terms of clinical and laboratory findings, and the correlation between AIP and CRP and UACR was evaluated. Results: A total of 233 people, with a mean age of 45.4 years and 139 (69.7%) of whom were male, were included in the study. One hundred thirty-eight (59.2%) individuals were found to be in the low-risk group, 29 (12.5%) in the medium-risk group, and 66 (28.3%) in the high-risk group, according to the AIP value.

BACKGROUND: Disease disclosure is a critical component of prevention and control of a virus outbreak, and this is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding COVID patients' experiences and perspectives on disclosure could play a vital role in COVID management. DESIGN: A qualitative study. METHODS: A semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct qualitative in-depth interviews from April to June 2020. All the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed, and then, a thematic analysis was conducted. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) were applied to this study. RESULTS: A total of 26 COVID-confirmed patients were recruited for the in-depth interviews. Four themes emerged from the thematic analysis on disclosure: persons disclosed to, reasons for disclosure, reasons for nondisclosure and impact of disclosure. The participants disclosed their COVID diagnosis to different groups, including family, close friends, community members and workplace contacts. The main reasons for disclosure included the following: government policy, social responsibility, gaining support and fear of being blamed for nondisclosure. However, some participants decided not to disclose to some groups for fear of facing stigma and discrimination or to protect family members from discrimination. Despite the potential benefits of obtaining support after disclosure, many participants did experience stigma and discrimination, privacy exposure, psychological distress and social isolation. CONCLUSIONS: An individual's decision as to whether to disclose their COVID-positive status is affected by many factors. To prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the potential risks of disclosure, such as discrimination and privacy exposure, a balanced intervention should be designed to protect COVID patients and to secure any contact tracing. Therefore, the chances of discrimination could be decreased and patients' confidentiality could be protected.

The mechanism of action hinges on enhancing the natural ability of the immune system to eliminate malignant cells. The most important substances in this arena include inhibitors of PD?1, PD-L1 and CTLA?4. As a consequence, the spectrum of treatment-associated adverse reactions is shifting away from classical cytotoxic effects (e.g. pancytopenia and polyneuropathy) towards novel entities of immune-mediated complex diseases. These so-called immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can involve any organ system and mimic known classical autoimmune conditions. Timely recognition of irAEs is the key for rapid initiation of a suitable treatment and is especially challenging in the clinical routine as it requires an intensive interdisciplinary management. Nephrologists are particularly confronted with this kind of problem due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of their work.

Epidemiological studies are needed to be prepared for other outbreaks and to be effective in the disease management process. Based on this reason, in this study it was aimed to determine the epidemiological characteristics of Covid 19 possible and definite cases who applied to the university hospital during the pandemic process. Materials and Methods: This retrospective epidemiological study was carried out by analyzing the data of Covid 19 possible and definite cases, who applied to the university hospital operating as a pandemic hospital between 11 March / 01 June 2020. The data were summarized with descriptive statistics, tables and graphs. Results: Of the 1,383 patients, who applied with the suspicion of COVID-19, 55.5% were men and 84.5% were adults. The median age of children is 4.0 (1.5-10) years old;adults were 52.0 (36.0-67.0) years old. The median time between the outset of complaints and the date of admission to the hospital was 2 (1-3) days. 87.4% of adults and 87.9% of children had symptoms that supported COVID-19 infection. Among cases 7.8% were health care workers. The median age of the fatal cases was 71 (64-82) years old, 79.5% were male, 77.7% were retired. The most common comorbide diseases in these cases were hypertension (28.2%) and malignancy (28.2%). The case fatality rate was found as 2.8% in all patients and 48.4% in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Conclusions: As a result, Covid-19 affects all age groups. Hypertension and malignancy were the most common additional diseases in fatal cases. The risk of illness is higher in healthcare workers who have direct contact with the patients. According to our observations, preventive measures, rapid diagnosis and supportive treatment are valuable.

Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is cardioprotective in multiple cardiovascular injury models and modifies autophagy signaling, but its effect in cardiomyopathy induced by gene manipulation has not been reported. To investigate the cardiac effects of chronically reduced autophagy as a result of Atg5 knockdown and assess whether RIC can rescue the phenotype. Atg5 knockdown was induced with tamoxifen for 14 days in cardiac-specific conditional Atg5 flox mice. Autophagy proteins and cardiac function were evaluated by Western blot and echocardiography, respectively. RIC was induced by cyclical hindlimb ischemia and reperfusion using a tourniquet. RIC or sham procedure was performed daily during tamoxifen induction and, in separate experiments, chronically 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Cardiac responses were assessed by end of the study. Cardiac-specific knockdown of Atg5 reduced protein levels by 70% and was associated with a significant increase in mTOR, a reduction of LC3-II and increased upstream autophagy proteins including LC3-I, P62, and Beclin. The changes in biochemical markers were associated with development of an age-related cardiomyopathy during the 17-month follow-up indicated by increased heart weight body weight ratio, progressive decline in cardiac function, and premature death. RIC increased cardiac ATG5 and rescued some of the Atg5 knockdown-induced cardiomyopathy phenotype and associated morphological remodeling. We conclude that cardiac-specific Atg5 knockdown leads to the development of age-related cardiomyopathy.

DESIGN Randomized, controlled, single-site clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS Sixty patients with nonparalytic, nonrestrictive esotropia who were cooperative for surgery under topical anesthesia. METHODS Twenty-eight patients were assigned to topical anesthesia, and 32 patients were assigned to sub-Tenon's anesthesia. Visual acuity, refraction, and deviation angle were determined in all patients preoperatively and postoperatively, and stereoacuity was measured postoperatively. Deviation angle was measured by simultaneous and alternate prism and cover test, and stereoacuity was measured using Randot circles (Stereo Optical Co., Chicago, IL). The amount of surgery under topical anesthesia was adjusted intraoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The amount of surgery used in the 2 treatment groups (measured in millimeters and millimeter/degree of deviation angle) and 6-month motor and stereoacuity outcomes. RESULTS Patients in the topical group required 3.2 mm less surgery on average than those in the sub-Tenon's group (5.9 and 9.1 mm, respectively; 0.4 and 0.6 mm of recession/degree, respectively) (P<0.01). Motor success (84% and 75%, respectively, P=0.38) and stereoacuity (339.6 and 323.9 arc seconds, respectively, P=0.87) at 6 months were similar in the 2 groups.

Our objective was to characterize motor activities throughout the entire colon that possessed persistent rhythmicity and spanning at least 5 cm. METHODS High-resolution colonic manometry using an 84-channel water-perfused catheter was performed in 19 healthy volunteers. Rhythmic activity was assessed during baseline, proximal balloon distention, meal, and bisacodyl administration. KEY RESULTS Throughout the entire colon, a cyclic motor pattern occurred either in isolation or following a high-amplitude propagating pressure wave (HAPW), consisting of clusters of pressure waves at a frequency centered on 11-13 cycles/min, unrelated to breathing. The cluster duration was 1-6 minutes; the pressure waves traveled for 8-27 cm, lasting 5-8 seconds. The clusters itself could be rhythmic at 0.5-2 cpm. The propagation direction of the individual pressure waves was mixed with >50% occurring simultaneous. This high-frequency cyclic motor pattern co-existed with the well-known low-frequency cyclic motor pattern centered on 3-4 cpm. In the rectum, the low-frequency cyclic motor pattern dominated, propagating predominantly in retrograde direction. Proximal balloon distention, a meal and bisacodyl administration induced HAPWs followed by cyclic motor patterns. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES Within cyclic motor patterns, retrograde propagating, low-frequency pressure waves dominate in the rectum, likely keeping the rectum empty; and mixed propagation, high-frequency pressure waves dominate in the colon, likely promoting absorption and storage, hence contributing to continence. Propagation and frequency characteristics are likely determined by network properties of the interstitial cells of Cajal.","output":"The cyclic motor patterns in the human colon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dating apps such as Tinder have announced plans for a dating metaverse: the incorporation of XR technologies into the online dating process to augment interactions between potential sexual partners across virtual and physical worlds.

We measured inflammatory markers in individuals admitted to a psychiatric unit with acute psychosis who had toxicology positive for natural and/or synthetic cannabinoids (n = 59) compared to patients with negative cannabinoid toxicology (n = 60).

In our region the pandemic temporal trend was sinusoidal with peaks and valleys. A first outbreak was in March 2020, a reduction in May 2020 and a second outbreak in November 2020 MATHERIALS & METHODS: Our hospital was reorganized as one of the 13 Macro-Hubs identified in Lombardy and we retrospectively analysed consecutive STEMI patients hospitalized in the three different phases of COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We did not registered any difference in the number of STEMI hospitalized in the three phases. At multivariate analysis for the entire population COVID-19 infection was the strongest independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Focusing on COVID-19 patients they experienced a 5-time increased incidence of in-hospital mortality (COVID-19(pos) vs COVID-19(neg), 47.1% vs 8.6%; p <0.0001) mainly driven by a higher incidence of respiratory complications (COVID-19(pos) vs COVID-19(neg), 41.2% vs 6.2%; p<0.0001) with a similar incidence of cardiac death. DISCUSSION: Among STEMI admitted during different phases of pandemic, this study found an increased mortality in patients affected by COVID-19; the co-presence of COVID-19 infection leads to an increase of mortality mostly related to respiratory complications. Interestingly the different incidence in the general population of COVID-19 did not influenced the incidence of STEMI.

Demographic data and history of childhood trauma information (Adverse Childhood Experiences Tool) were collected with a phone survey prior to the interview. RESULTS Participants' (N = 23) were 32.5 years of age (4.1 SD), with the majority Caucasian (71.4%), Non-Hispanic (71.4%) and Medicaid recipients (100%). Participants reported a mean of 5.61 (SD=2.93) adverse childhood experiences, indicating a significant trauma burden. Major themes uncovered in the interview transcripts revealed emotional and OUD recovery support provided by the doula and increased maternal health literacy and self-advocacy. The presence of a doula during labor/delivery reduced maternal perceptions of stigma they perceived from their healthcare providers. CONCLUSION Doula engagement was associated with perceptions of increased emotional support, health literacy and self-advocacy in maternal health among women with OUD, which is significant given this population's trauma histories. This preliminary research has significant implications for improving the health of the mother child dyad affected by maternal OUD.","output":"Doula engagement and maternal opioid use disorder (OUD): Experiences of women in OUD recovery during the perinatal period."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To determine the false-positive rate of pulse oximetry screening at moderate altitude, presumed to be elevated compared with sea level values and assess change in false-positive rate with time. METHODS We retrospectively analysed 3548 infants in the newborn nursery in Albuquerque, New Mexico, (elevation 5400 ft) from July 2012 to October 2013. Universal pulse oximetry screening guidelines were employed after 24 hours of life but before discharge. Newborn babies between 36 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation, weighing >2 kg and babies >37 weeks weighing >1.7 kg were included in the study. Log-binomial regression was used to assess change in the probability of false positives over time. RESULTS Of the 3548 patients analysed, there was one true positive with a posteriorly-malaligned ventricular septal defect and an interrupted aortic arch. Of the 93 false positives, the mean pre- and post-ductal saturations were lower, 92 and 90%, respectively. The false-positive rate before April 2013 was 3.5% and after April 2013, decreased to 1.5%. There was a significant decrease in false-positive rate (p = 0.003, slope coefficient = -0.082, standard error of coefficient = 0.023) with the relative risk of a false positive decreasing at 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.97) per month. CONCLUSION This is the first study in Albuquerque, New Mexico, reporting a high false-positive rate of 1.5% at moderate altitude at the end of the study in comparison to the false-positive rate of 0.035% at sea level. Implementation of the nationally recommended universal pulse oximetry screening was associated with a high false-positive rate in the initial period, thought to be from the combination of both learning curve and altitude. After the initial decline, it remained steadily elevated above sea level, indicating the dominant effect of moderate altitude.","output":"Pulse oximetry screening for detection of congenital heart defects at 1646 m in Albuquerque, New Mexico."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which emerged at the end of 2019 and caused a worldwide pandemic, triggered numerous questions about the epidemiology of the novel COVID-19 disease and about wellknown coronavirus infections, which used to be given little attention due to their mild symptoms. THE PURPOSE: The routine screening-based multiyear retrospective observational study of prevalence and circulation patterns of epidemic-prone human coronaviruses in Moscow. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect RNA of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in nasal and throat swabs from 16,511 patients with an acute respiratory infection (ARI), aged 1 month to 95 years (children accounted for 58.3%) from January 2016 to March 2020, and swabs from 505 relatively healthy children in 2008, 2010 and 2011. Results. HCoVs were yearly found in 2.6-6.1% of the examined patients; the detection frequency was statistically higher in adults than in children, regardless of sex. At the height of the disease incidence in December 2019, HCoVs were detected in 13.7% of the examined, demonstrating a two-fold increase as compared to the multi-year average for that month. The statistical frequency of HCoV detection in ARI pediatric patients under 6 years was significantly higher than in their healthy peers (3.7 vs 0.7%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: HCoVs circulate annually, demonstrating a winter-spring seasonal activity pattern in the Moscow Region and reaching peak levels in December. Over the years of observation, the HCoV epidemic activity reached maximum levels in December 2019-February 2020 and decreased in March to the multi-year average. Amid a growing number of SARS-CoV-2 cases imported to Moscow in March 2020, the HCoV detection frequency dropped sharply, which can be explained by the competition between different coronaviruses and by the specificity of HCoV detection with the diagnostic test kit used in this study.","output":"[Analysis of human coronaviruses circulation]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND As mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. METHODS We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). FINDINGS Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 576 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 408-759 million [72%, 60-83]), 451 million (290-628 million [56%, 40-72]), 363 million (253-509 million [45%, 38-53]), 347 million (230-496 million [43%, 35-52]), and 341 million (235-460 million [42%, 32-53]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 27% (95% UI 23-31). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 104% (95% UI 90-118) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95% UI 6862-11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018-19 228). INTERPRETATION The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-to-date information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response.

We aim to identify the drivers of therapeutic aggressiveness during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional worldwide survey (conducted April 12 to 19, 2020) was aimed at physicians who managed patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Treatment preferences were collected in five different clinical scenarios. We used multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression to identify variables that were associated with the use of more aggressive therapies. Findings: The survey was completed by 852 physicians from 44 different specialties and 29 countries. The heterogeneity of therapeutic decisions increased as the clinical scenario worsened. Factors associated with aggressive therapeutic decisions were higher self-perceived expertise (high vs. null, OR 1.95, 95%CI 1.31-2.89), perceived quality of COVID-19 publications (high vs. null, OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.17-3.16), and female sex (OR 1.17, 95%CI 1.02-1.33).

Also known as antibody or health certificates, there is a clear demand for any technology that could allow people to return to work and other crowded places without placing others at risk. One of the major criticisms of such systems is that they could be misused to unfairly discriminate against those without immunity, allowing the formation of an \`immuno-privileged' class of people. In this work we are motivated to explore an alternative technical solution that is non-discriminatory by design. In particular we propose health tokens -- randomised health certificates which, using methods from differential privacy, allow individual test results to be randomised whilst still allowing useful aggregate risk estimates to be calculated. We show that health tokens could mitigate immunity-based discrimination whilst still presenting a viable mechanism for estimating the collective transmission risk posed by small groups of users. We evaluate the viability of our approach in the context of identity-free and identity-binding use cases and then consider a number of possible attacks. Our experimental results show that for groups of size 500 or more, the error associated with our method can be as low as 0.03 on average and thus the aggregated results can be useful in a number of identity-free contexts.

Nanomaterials can interact with viruses and have attracted much attention due to their large specific surface area and unique physicochemical properties. Ferrous sulfide nanoparticles (FeS NPs) with the characteristics of high reactivity, large specific surface area, and low cost are widely applied to environmental remediation, catalysis, energy storage and medicine. However, there is no report on the application of FeS NPs in the antiviral field. In this study, gelatin stabilized FeS nanoparticles (Gel-FeS NPs) were large-scale synthesized rapidly by the one-pot method of co-precipitation of Fe(2+) and S(2?). RESULTS: The prepared Gel-FeS NPs exhibited good stability and dispersibility with an average diameter of 47.3 nm. Additionally, they were characterized with good biocompatibility and high antiviral activity against PRRSV proliferation in the stages of adsorption, invasion, and replication. CONCLUSIONS: We reported for the first time the virucidal and antiviral activity of Gel-FeS NPs. The synthesized Gel-FeS NPs exhibited good dispersibility and biocompatibility as well as effective inhibition on PRRSV proliferation. Moreover, the Fe(2+) released from degraded Gel-FeS NPs still displayed an antiviral effect, demonstrating the advantage of Gel-FeS NPs as an antiviral nanomaterial compared to other nanomaterials.

Knowledge of the genomic epidemiology of tuberculosis can help tailor public health interventions. Our aims were to determine tuberculosis genomic epidemiology and characterize resistance mutations in the ethnically diverse city of Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, located at the nexus of Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Brunei. We used an archive of prospectively collected Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples paired with epidemiological data. We collected sputum and demographic data from consecutive consenting outpatients with pulmonary tuberculosis at the largest tuberculosis clinic from 2012 to 2014, and selected samples from tuberculosis inpatients from the tertiary referral centre during 2012C2014 and 2016C2017. Two hundred and eight M . tuberculosis sequences were available for analysis, representing 8 % of cases notified during the study periods. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that most strains were lineage 1 (195/208, 93.8 %), with the remainder being lineages 2 (8/208, 3.8 %) or 4 (5/208, 2.4 %). Lineages or sub-lineages were not associated with patient ethnicity. The lineage 1 strains were diverse, with sub-lineage 1.2.1 being dominant (192, 98 %). Lineage 1.2.1.3 isolates were geographically most widely distributed. The greatest diversity occurred in a border town sub-district. The time to the most recent common ancestor for the three major lineage 1.2.1 clades was estimated to be the year 1966 (95 % HPD 1948C1976). An association was found between failure of culture conversion by week 8 of treatment and infection with lineage 2 (4/6, 67 %) compared with lineage 1 strains (4/83, 5 %) (P<0.001), supporting evidence of greater virulence of lineage 2 strains. Eleven potential transmission clusters (SNP difference 12) were identified; at least five included people living in different sub-districts. Some linked cases spanned the whole 4-year study period. One cluster involved a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis strain matching a drug-susceptible strain from 3 years earlier. Drug resistance mutations were uncommon, but revealed one phenotypeCgenotype mismatch in a genotypically multidrug-resistant isolate, and rare nonsense mutations within the katG gene in two isolates. Consistent with the regionally mobile population, M. tuberculosis strains in Kota Kinabalu were diverse, although several lineage 1 strains dominated and were locally well established. Transmission clusters C uncommonly identified, likely attributable to incomplete sampling C showed clustering occurring across the community, not confined to households or sub-districts. The findings indicate that public health priorities should include active case finding and early institution of tuberculosis management in mobile populations, while there is a need to upscale effective contact investigation beyond households to include other contacts within social networks.","output":"Genomic epidemiology of tuberculosis in eastern Malaysia: insights for strengthening public health responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Approximately 55,000 women in the United Kingdom are diagnosed with new breast cancer annually.

Underweight was defined as a BMI <18.5 kg/m2, normal weight as 18.5-23.9 kg/m2, overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m2, and obesity as &#8805;28 kg/m2. RESULTS: Of the 383 patients, 53.1% were normal weight, 4.2% were underweight, 32.0% were overweight, and 10.7% were obese at admission. Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (P = 0.03) and fever (P = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese. Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99-3.43, P = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40-2.86, P = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and cancer, and drug used for treatment. Additionally, after similar adjustment, men who were obese versus those who were normal weight were at increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 5.66, 95% CI 1.80-17.75, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, obese patients had increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may continue to spread worldwide, clinicians should pay close attention to obese patients, who should be carefully managed with prompt and aggressive treatment.","output":"Obesity and COVID-19 Severity in a Designated Hospital in Shenzhen, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As part of a longitudinal household transmission study of pets living with persons with COVID-19 in Texas, two pets were confirmed to be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC).

We analyzed a cohort of patients with cancer and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) reported to the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) to identify prognostic clinical factors, including laboratory measurements and anticancer therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with active or historical cancer and a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis recorded between 17 March and 18 November 2020 were included. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity measured on an ordinal scale (uncomplicated, hospitalized, admitted to intensive care unit, mechanically ventilated, died within 30 days). Multivariable regression models included demographics, cancer status, anticancer therapy and timing, COVID-19-directed therapies, and laboratory measurements (among hospitalized patients). RESULTS: A total of 4966 patients were included (median age 66 years, 51% female, 50% non-Hispanic white); 2872 (58%) were hospitalized and 695 (14%) died; 61% had cancer that was present, diagnosed, or treated within the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Older age, male sex, obesity, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, and hematologic malignancy were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Among hospitalized patients, low or high absolute lymphocyte count; high absolute neutrophil count; low platelet count; abnormal creatinine; troponin; lactate dehydrogenase; and C-reactive protein were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Patients diagnosed early in the COVID-19 pandemic (January-April 2020) had worse outcomes than those diagnosed later. Specific anticancer therapies (e.g. R-CHOP, platinum combined with etoposide, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) were associated with high 30-day all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical factors (e.g. older age, hematological malignancy, recent chemotherapy) and laboratory measurements were associated with poor outcomes among patients with cancer and COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine how people consume chestnut honey as a form of traditional medicine and how it might protect them from COVID-19. METHODS: This study was carried out on 177 people (who had been snowball sampled) from a province in Turkey where chestnut honey is widely produced. The data was collected using a 20-open/closed-question online questionnaire form that asked the participants to report their sociodemographic details, how they consume chestnut honey, and about COVID-19. RESULTS: 41.8% of the participants reported that they used chestnut honey to protect themselves against COVID-19, 40.7% believed that chestnut honey helped to make them immune against COVID-19, and 37.3% felt that chestnut honey could treat COVID-19.

In urban environment operations, multipaths could be the dominant contributor to navigation errors. This paper presents a study on how the operation environment affects the lateral (horizontal) navigation performance when a self-built UAS is going near different types of urban obstructions in real flight tests. Selected test sites are representative of urban environments, including open carparks, flight paths obstructed by buildings along one or both sides, changing sky access when flying towards corners formed by two buildings or dead ends, and buildings with reflective glass-clad surfaces. The data was analysed to obtain the horizontal position error between Global Positioning System (GPS) position and ground truth derived from Real Time Kinematics (RTK), with considerations for (1) horizontal position uncertainty estimate (EPH) reported by the GPS receiver, (2) no. of visible satellites, and (3) percentage of sky visible (or sky openness ratio, SOR) at various altitudes along the flight paths inside the aforementioned urban environments. The investigation showed that there is no direct correlation between the measured horizontal position error and the reported EPH; thus, the EPH could not be used for the purpose of monitoring navigation performance. The investigation further concluded that there is no universal correlation between the sky openness ratio (SOR) seen by the UAS and the resulting horizontal position error, and a more complex model would need to be considered to translate 3D urban models to expected horizontal navigation uncertainty for the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) airspace.","output":"Investigation of Using Sky Openness Ratio as Predictor for Navigation Performance in Urban-like Environment to Support PBN in UTM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to identify the epidemiological profiles of violence against children, victims, and their aggressors, and their correlations between socioeconomic and demographic factors analyzed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This family of proteins plays an important role in the sculpting of the brain in the early stages of development by eliminating excessive and nonfunctional synapses and extra cells. Consequently, impairments in this process can underlie many neurological and mental illnesses. This view is particularly relevant to dopamine because it plays a pleiotropic role in motor control, motivation, and reward processing. In this study, we analyze the effects of the elimination of caspase-8 (CASP8) on the development of catecholaminergic neurons using neurochemical, ultrastructural, and behavioral tests. To do this, we selectively delete the CASP8 gene in cells that express tyrosine hydroxylase with the help of recombination through the Cre-loxP system. Our results show that the number of dopaminergic neurons increases in the substantia nigra. In the striatum, the basal extracellular level of dopamine and potassium-evoked dopamine release decreased significantly in mice lacking CASP8, clearly showing the low dopamine functioning in tissues innervated by this neurotransmitter. This view is supported by electron microscopy analysis of striatal synapses. Interestingly, behavioral analysis demonstrates that mice lacking CASP8 show changes reminiscent of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

This prospective study provides the first comparative evaluation of the effects of inhaled PGI2 and NO on pulmonary hemodynamics, systemic hemodynamics, and gas exchange in patients developing residual pulmonary hypertension after PEA. METHODS Thirteen patients were randomized to receive either NO (n = 6) or PGI2 (n = 7) inhalation when pulmonary hypertension persisted after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured before inhalation of the agent (T0); 30 min (T1), 3 h (T2), and 6 h after inhalation (T3); and the next morning (T4). The NO dose was started at 20 ppm and gradually tapered until extubation, and PGI2 was administered at a dose of 10 ng kg-1 min-1. RESULTS In both groups, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) significantly decreased over time until T4 (mean PAP: p < 0.0001; PVR: p = 0.003), while mean systemic arterial blood pressure significantly increased (p = 0.028).

Previous studies have shown that a combination of short- and long-read approaches is effective in reconstructing accurate plasmids. However, high-quality Illumina short reads mapped onto the long reads in the context of an AMR hybrid monitoring strategy have not yet been explored. Hence, this study aimed to improve the reconstruction of plasmids, including the localization of AMR genes, using the above-described parameters on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) results. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE) to confirm the number and sizes of plasmids detected by in silico-based predictions in Salmonella strains. Our results showed that de novo assembly did not detect the number of bacterial plasmids more accurately than reference-based assembly did. As this new hybrid mapping strategy surpassed de novo assembly in bacterial reconstruction, it was further used to identify the presence and genomic location of AMR genes among three Salmonella enterica serovar Schwarzengrund isolates. The AMR genes identified in the bacterial chromosome among the three Salmonella enterica serovar Schwarzengrund isolates included: AAC(3)-IV, AAC(6)-Iy, aadA2, APH(4)-Ia, cmlA1, golS, mdsA, mdsB, mdsC, mdtK, qacH, sdiA, sul2, sul3, and TEM-1 genes.

Demographic factors, especially age and comorbidities, are major determinants of the outcome in COVID-19 infection. This study examines the extra pulmonary parameter of bone mineral density (BMD) from an initial chest computed tomography as an associated variable of pre-existing comorbidities like chronic lung disease or demographic factors to determine the later patient's outcome, in particular whether treatment on an intensive care unit (ICU) was necessary in infected patients. METHODS: We analyzed 58 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infections that received an unenhanced CT at admission at one of the included centers. In addition to the extent of pulmonary involvement, we performed a phantomless assessment of bone mineral density of thoracic vertebra 9 - 12. RESULTS: In a univariate regression analysis BMD was found to be a significant predictor of the necessity for intensive care unit treatment of COVID-19 patients. In the subgroup requiring intensive care treatment within the follow-up period a significantly lower BMD was found. In a multivariate logistic regression model considering gender, age and CT measurements of bone mineral density, BMD was eliminated from the regression analysis as a significant predictor. CONCLUSION: Phantomless assessed BMD provides prognostic information on the necessity for ICU treatment in course of COVID-19 pneomonia. We recommend using the measurement of BMD in an initial CT image to facilitate a potentially better prediction of severe patient outcomes within the 22 days after an initial CT scan. Consequently, in the present sample, additional bone density analysis did not result in a prognostic advantage over simply considering age. Significantly larger patient cohorts with a more homogenous patient age should be performed in the future to illustrate potential effects.

DESIGN: A systematic review adopting a framework synthesis approach was conducted. An electronic search of the literature was undertaken in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Social Work Abstract and CINAHL via EBSCO, Global Health, Cochrane library, the Trip database and ProQuest between 1995 and 2020. Search terms included bereavement care, ethnic minority populations and the UK setting. RESULTS: From 3,185 initial records, following screening for eligibility, and full-text review of 164 articles, seven studies were identified. There was no research literature outlining the role of family, friends and existing networks; and a real absence of evidence about outcomes and levels of satisfaction for those from an ethnic minority background who receive bereavement care. From the limited literature, the overarching theme for barriers to bereavement care was unfamiliarity and irregularities. Four identified subthemes were lack of awareness; variability in support; type and format of support; and culturally specific beliefs. The overarching theme for facilitators for bereavement care was accessibility with the two subthemes being readily available information and inclusive approaches. Three studies reported on examples of different models of care provision. CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals a stark lack of evidence about bereavement care for ethnic minority populations. In particular, understanding more about the role of family, friends and existing support systems, alongside outcomes and satisfaction will begin to develop the evidence base underpinning current provision. Direct user-representation through proactive engagement and co-design approaches may begin to determine the most appropriate models and format of bereavement care for ethnic minority communities to inform service design and delivery.","output":"Bereavement care for ethnic minority communities: A systematic review of access to, models of, outcomes from, and satisfaction with, service provision"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Government responses to the pandemic varied in terms of timing, duration, and stringency, seeking to protect healthcare systems, whose pre-pandemic state varied significantly. Therefore, the severity of Covid-19 and, thus, excess mortality have been unequal across counties. This paper explores the geography of excess mortality and its underlying factors in 2020, highlighting the effects of health policies pre-pandemic and strategies devised by governments to cope with Covid-19. METHODS: Excess mortality is estimated for 79 high, medium and low-income countries. The factors of excess mortality are examined employing median quantile regression analysis. RESULTS: Health privatization, healthcare underfunding, and late implementation of containment and mitigation strategies were powerful drivers of excess mortality. By contrast, the results suggest a negative association of excess mortality with health expenditure, number of doctors and hospital beds, share of population covered by health insurance and test and trace capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence highlights the importance of sufficiently funded healthcare systems with universal access and strong primary healthcare in the battle against the pandemic.

The mobile and acid-soluble heavy metal fractions in soils, and the heavy metal contents in plants, were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Pb concentrations in soils exceeded background values. Pb content at the battery manufacturing plant was above the maximum permitted concentration. The percentages of the mobile heavy metal fractions decreased in the following order: Mn > Zn > Cu > Fe. The greatest heavy metal accumulation in soils and plants was found at the battery manufacturing and metallurgical plants examined in our study. Heavy metals accumulation in the aboveground part of Tussilago farfara decreased in the following order: Fe > Zn > Cu > Mn > Pb > Cd. The accumulation of heavy metals stimulated the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments by 6C30%. Heavy metals provoked oxidative stress in cells, increasing the concentration of lipid peroxidation in products by up to 80%. Plant phenolics and flavonoids in the urban area of our study decreased compared to those in the control by 1.05, reaching up to 6.5 times. The change in coltsfoot catalase activity both increased and declined.

This study examines the dynamic correlation between global crude oil futures and seven agricultural commodity futures by applying the consistent dynamic conditional correlation and dynamic equicorrelation models. The empirical results show that the dynamic correlation between the global crude oil futures market and China's agricultural futures market is weak compared to the global agricultural futures market. In particular, soybean oil has the strongest correlation with crude oil, while Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) corn and Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange wheat have the weakest correlation with crude oil. There is an indirect linkage between crude oil futures and DCE soybean meal and DCE soybean oil. Moreover, the dynamic correlation between crude oil and agricultural commodities increased during the financial crisis, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, and the crude oil crash crisis. Brent crude oil has a stronger co-movement with China's agricultural commodities than West Texas Intermediate crude oil and can better hedge the risk of agricultural commodities.

METHODS: SSPs were invited to participate in the Dave Purchase Memorial survey in August 2020. We collected programmatic data on services provided in 2019 and at the time of the survey in 2020. We conducted descriptive analyses using Chi-square and McNemars tests. RESULTS: At the time of the survey, >60% of SSPs reported increased monthly syringe and naloxone distribution and expansion of home-based and mail-based naloxone delivery in Fall 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately three-quarters of SSPs decreased or stopped providing on-site HIV and HCV testing. Nearly half of SSPs offering on-site medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in 2019 increased provision of MOUD in 2020. The proportion of SSPs offering on-site mental health care services and primary care services statistically significantly decreased from 2019 to Fall 2020, but telehealth offerings of these services increased. CONCLUSIONS: Many SSPs that offered health services in 2019 and remained operational in 2020 increased telehealth provision of mental health and primary care services, increased MOUD provision, and expanded harm reduction services, but most SSPs reduced or stopped on-site HIV and HCV testing.

At the time, these divergences were described as temporary departures from normalcy. In retrospect, it would be more accurate to regard the millennial paradigm itself as the abnormality: as a model of governance designed for rare moments of calm. In the last two decades, a different paradigm has emerged. American government has become the ultimate bearer of societal risks. Repeatedly, it has adopted extraordinary measures to protect public safety and the economy. However, the American state lacks the capacity to anticipate and manage these massive risks competently.

In occupational health, there is evidence that empathy prevents work distress. However, in the case of lifelong learning, the evidence is still scarce. In addition, recent studies suggest that the development of lifelong learning varies in physicians and nurses and that it is sensitive to the influence of cultural stereotypes associated with professional roles. This study was performed with the purpose of determining the specific role that empathy and lifelong learning play in the reduction in occupational stress. This study included a sample composed by 40 physicians and 40 nurses with high dedication to clinical work in ambulatory consultations from a public healthcare institution in Paraguay. Somatization, exhaustion, and work alienation, described as indicators of occupational stress, were used as dependent variables, whereas empathy, lifelong learning, gender, discipline, professional experience, civil status, and family burden were used as potential predictors. Three multiple regression models explained 32% of the variability of somatization based on a linear relationship with empathy, lifelong learning, and civil status; 73% of the variability of exhaustion based on a linear relationship with empathy, somatization, work alienation, and discipline; and 62% of the variability of work alienation based on a linear relationship with lifelong learning, exhaustion, and discipline. These findings indicate that empathy and lifelong learning play important roles in the prevention of work distress in physicians and nurses.

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term results of SG in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Diabetic patients who underwent SG at a single center between 2009 and 2011 were included. Outcomes assessed included postoperative complications, weight loss, and resolution or improvement in co-morbidities with an emphasis on diabetes, including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and medication status. RESULTS Fifty-one diabetic patients underwent SG, 35 females and 16 males, with a collective mean age of 49 years and a mean body mass index of 43.2 kg/m2. On average, patients had had diabetes for 5.4  7.3 years before surgery. Mean HbA1C and fasting glucose levels were 7.9  1.6% and 166.9  63 mg/dL, respectively. Eleven patients (22%) were insulin dependent at the time of surgery. Average body mass index at a mean follow-up of 5 years after surgery was 34.4  5.8 kg/m2, with an average HbA1C of 6.6  1% and an average fasting glucose of 123  60 mg/dL.

These policies, like remote instruction (SQ), reduce potential contact but also have broad side-effects on campus by hampering local economy, students learning outcomes, and community wellbeing. In this paper, we demonstrate that university policymakers can mitigate these tradeoffs by leveraging anonymized data from their WiFi infrastructure to learn community mobility (WF) and in turn explore more granular policies like localized closures (LC). WF can construct contact networks that capture behavior in a variety of spaces, highlighting new potential transmission pathways and temporal variation in contact behavior. Additionally, WF enables us to design LC policies that close super-spreader locations on campus. On simulating disease spread with contact networks from WF, we find that LC maintains the same reduction in cumulative infections as SQ while showing greater reduction in peak infections and internal transmission. Moreover, LC reduces campus burden by closing fewer locations, forcing fewer students into completely online schedules, and requiring no additional isolation. WF can empower universities to conceive and assess a variety of closure policies to prevent future outbreaks.","output":"WiFi mobility models for COVID-19 enable less burdensome and more localized interventions for university campuses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of thermal ablation for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2015 to March 2020, data pertaining to patients who received thermal ablation for pHPT at 4 centers were retrospectively analyzed. The median follow-up duration was 18.1months (IQR: 6.5-42.2 months). A cure referred to the reestablishment of normal values of serum calcium and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) throughout the entire follow-up period, at least more than 6 months. The technical success, effectiveness, and safety of treatment were analyzed. RESULTS 119 patients (mean age, 57.2  16.3 years; 81 female) with 134 parathyroid nodules were enrolled. The mean maximum diameter of the parathyroid glands was 1.6  0.9 cm. Ninety-six patients underwent microwave ablation (MWA), and 23 patients underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The technical success rate was 98.3% and the cure rate was 89.9%. Significant differences were found in the maximum diameter between the cured patients and the patients who did not undergo ablation of the target lesions. Except the cases with pHPT nodules<0.6cm in diameter, the cure rate was 95%. There were no difference in cure rates at 6 months between the MWA and RFA (MWA vs. RFA, 90.6% vs. 87.0%; 2=0.275, p = 0.699). The volume reduction rate of the ablation zone was 94.6% at 12 months.

The search was conducted in the following electronic databases: Medline (PubMed), SciELO, and Cochrane Library Plus. The most common cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 are vesicular eruptions, petechial/purpuric rashes, acral lesions, liveoid lesions, urticarial rash, and maculopapular-erythematous rash. These manifestations may be the first presenting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as is the case with acral lesions, vesicular eruptions, and urticaria. In relation to severity, the presence of liveoid lesions may be associated with a more severe course of the disease. Treatment used for dermatological lesions includes therapy with anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and antihistamines.

We have used a bioinformatic approach to aid in designing an epitope peptide-based vaccine against the spike protein of the virus. Five antigenic B cell epitopes with viable antigenicity and a total of 27 discontinuous B cell epitopes were mapped out structurally in the spike protein for antibody recognition. We identified eight CD8+ T cell 9-mers and 12 CD4+ T cell 14-15-mer as promising candidate epitopes putatively restricted by a large number of MHC I and II alleles, respectively. We used this information to construct an in silico chimeric peptide vaccine whose translational rate was highly expressed when cloned in pET28a (+) vector. With our In silico test, the vaccine construct was predicted to elicit high antigenicity and cell-mediated immunity when given as a homologous prime-boost, triggering of toll-like receptor 5 by the adjuvant linker. The vaccine was also characterized by an increase in IgM and IgG and an array of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Upon in silico challenge with SARS-CoV-2, there was a decrease in antigen levels using our immune simulations.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants and the case fatality ratio (CFR) (dependent variables) in all Italian regions were calculated in January 2021 at John Hopkins University Coronavirus Center. The independent variables were: -Minimum average temperatures in the same month (January) of 2020, -Average pollution of PM10 in the air in each region in the last year available reported on a 0-10 scale to 0 = total absence of PM10 to 10 maximum pollutions. -Number of places in hotels occupied per inhabitants in 2020. Linear regression and Multiple Regression Analysis were carried out. RESULTS: The spread of the COVID-19 in the Italian regions seems to be related to pollution of PM10, the number of beds occupied in hotels (as an index of mobility and temperature (indirect correlation). On the contrary, the CFR correlates inversely with temperature but not with pollution. Measuring the concomitant effect of two independent variables by means of Multiple Regression Analysis, temperature and pollution show a synergistic effect on COVID-19 incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The study seems to confirm the literature on the influence of temperature on the lethality of COVID-19 but adds the new results of an inverse relationship between the spread of the virus and low temperature in regions between the Mediterranean area (which includes southern Italy and Sicily and Sardinia islands) and the cold European temperate zone which includes the northern regions under the Alps.

This study aimed to understand people with cancer and carers experiences with telehealth for cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews conducted with people with cancer and carers via telephone or online video link between December 2020 and May 2021. Participants were recruited through cancer networks and social media. Interviews were transcribed and thematic analysis undertaken. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients and 5 carers were interviewed. Telephone-based appointments were most common. Responses to telehealth were influenced by existing relationships with doctors, treatment/cancer stage and type of appointment. Four themes were derived: (i) benefits, (ii) quality of care concerns, (iii) involving carers, and (iv) optimising use of telehealth. Benefits included efficiency and reduced travel. Quality of care concerns identified subthemes: transactional feel to appointments; difficulties for rapport; suitability for appointment type and adequacy for monitoring. Both patients and carers noted a lack of opportunity for carers to participate in telephone-based appointments. Aligning appointment mode (i.e. telehealth or in person) with appointment purpose and ensuring telehealth was the patients choice were seen as essential for its ongoing use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: While telehealth has benefits, its potential to reduce the quality of interactions with clinicians made it less attractive for cancer patients.

Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to the response capacity of hospitals at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.","output":"Geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare in Brazil using a balanced float catchment area approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As chloroquine (CHQ) is part of the Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experimental treatment guideline, pediatric dosing guidelines are needed. Recent pediatric data suggest that existing World Health Organization (WHO) dosing guidelines for children with malaria are suboptimal. The aim of our study was to establish best-evidence to inform pediatric CHQ doses for children infected with COVID-19. A previously developed physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for CHQ was used to simulate exposure in adults and children and verified against published pharmacokinetic data. The COVID-19 recommended adult dosage regimen of 44 mg/kg total was tested in adults and children to evaluate the extent of variation in exposure. Based on differences in area under the concentration-time curve from zero to 70 hours (AUC0-70h ) the optimal CHQ dose was determined in children of different ages compared with adults. Revised doses were re-introduced into the model to verify that overall CHQ exposure in each age band was within 5% of the predicted adult value. Simulations showed differences in drug exposure in children of different ages and adults when the same body-weight based dose is given. As such, we propose the following total cumulative doses: 35 mg/kg (CHQ base) for children 0-1 month, 47 mg/kg for 1-6 months, 55 mg/kg for 6 months-12 years, and 44 mg/kg for adolescents and adults, not to exceed 3,300 mg in any patient.

The aim of this narrative review is to provide a summary of the literature that addresses the challenges of students and residents of human medicine in the first 4 months of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic in order to identify gaps and find implications for improvement within the current situation and for potential future scenarios. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search and content analysis (CA) of articles available in English language that address the challenges of students and residents of human medicine in the first 4 months of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We retrieved 82 articles from a wide range of journals, professional backgrounds and countries. CA identified five recurring subgroup topics: faculty preparation, ?uncertainties and mental health?, ?clinical knowledge?, ?rights and obligations? and ?(self-) support and supply?. Within these subgroups the main concerns of (re-)deployment, interruption of training and career, safety issues, transmission of disease, and restricted social interaction were identified as potential stressors that hold a risk for fatigue, loss of morale and burnout. DISCUSSION: Students and residents are willing and able to participate in the fight against Covid-19 when provided with appropriate deployment, legal guidance, safety measures, clinical knowledge, thorough supervision, social integration and mental health support. Preceding interviews to decide on reasonable voluntary deployment, the use of new technology and frequent feedback communication with faculties, educators and policymakers can further help with a successful and sustainable integration of students and residents in the fight against the pandemic. CONCLUSION: It is critical that faculties, educators and policymakers have a thorough understanding of the needs and concerns of medical trainees during pandemic times. Leaders should facilitate close communication with students and residents, value their intrinsic creativeness and regularly evaluate their needs in regards to deployment, knowledge aspects, safety measures, legal concerns and overall well-being.","output":"Challenges of students and residents of human medicine in the first four months of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic C Implications for future waves and scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

METHODS: We queried the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) to identify patients undergoing urological surgery in 2015C2016. We evaluated the 30-day incidence and factors associated with postoperative CDI and 30-day hospital readmission and length of stay as secondary outcomes. Among the subset of patients undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion (surgery with highest CDI incidence) we used multivariable logistic regression analysis to evaluate independent clinical and demographic factors associated with postoperative CDI. RESULTS: We identified 98,463 patients during the study period. The overall 30-day incidence of CDI was 0.31%, but varied considerably across surgery type. The risk of CDI was greatest following radical cystectomy with urinary diversion (2.72%) compared to all other urologic procedures (0.19%) and was associated with increased risk of hospital readmission (p < 0.0001), re-operation (p < 0.0001), and longer mean length of stay (p < 0.0001) in this cohort. Among patients undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion, multivariable logistic regression revealed that preoperative renal failure (OR: 5.30, 95% CI 1.13C24.9, p = 0.035) and blood loss requiring transfusion (OR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.15C2.44, p = 0.0075) were independently associated with CDI. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative cohort, the incidence of CDI was low but varied substantially across surgery types. CDI was most common following radical cystectomy and associated with potentially modifiable factors such as blood transfusion and significantly longer length of stay.

Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of PBMCs in Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infected and control chickens at 21 days post infection (DPI) to determine chicken PBMCs subsets and their specific molecular and cellular characteristics. Eight cell populations and their potential marker genes were identified in PBMCs. T cell populations had the strongest response to (ALV-J) infection, based on the detection of the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and could be further grouped into four subsets: activated CD4(+) T cells, Th1-like cells, Th2-like cells, and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, pseudotime analysis results suggested that chicken CD4(+) T cells could potentially differentiate into Th1-like and Th2-like cells. Moreover, ALV-J infection activated CD4(+) T cell was probably inclined to differentiate into Th1-like cells. Compared to the control PBMCs, ALV-J infection also had an obvious impact on PBMCs composition. B cells showed inconspicuous response and their numbers decreased in PBMCs from ALV-J infected chicken. Proportions of cytotoxic Th1-like cells and CD8(+) T cells increased in the T cell population of PBMCs from ALV-J infected chicken, which were potentially key mitigating effectors against ALV-J infection. More importantly, our results provide a rich resource of gene expression profiles of chicken PBMCs subsets for a systems-level understanding of their function in homeostatic condition as well as in response to viral infection.","output":"Chicken Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Response to Avian Leukosis Virus Subgroup J Infection Assessed by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In these early years of the twenty-first century, it can often seem that across the globe we are living in a world of crisis.

In particular, enveloped viruses are one of the main causes of viral outbreaks, as recently demonstrated by SARS-CoV-2. An effective strategy to counteract these viruses could be to target the envelope by using surface-active compounds. Rhamnolipids (RLs) are microbial biosurfactants displaying a wide range of bioactivities, such as antibacterial, antifungal and antibiofilm, among others. Being of microbial origin, they are environmentally-friendly, biodegradable, and less toxic than synthetic surfactants. In this work, we explored the antiviral activity of the rhamnolipids mixture (M15RL) produced by the Antarctic bacteria Pseudomonas gessardii M15 against viruses belonging to Coronaviridae and Herpesviridae families. In addition, we investigated the rhamnolipids mode of action and the possibility of inactivating viruses on treated surfaces. Our results show complete inactivation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 by M15RLs at 6 g/mL, and of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2 at 25 and 50 g/mL, respectively. Concerning activity against HCoV-OC43, 80% inhibition of cytopathic effect was recorded, while no activity against naked Poliovirus Type 1 (PV-1) was detectable, suggesting that the antiviral action is mainly directed towards the envelope. In conclusion, we report a significant activity of M15RL against enveloped viruses and demonstrated for the first time the antiviral effect of rhamnolipids against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Antiviral Activity of the Rhamnolipids Mixture from the Antarctic Bacterium Pseudomonas gessardii M15 against Herpes Simplex Viruses and Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals who encounter false information on social media may actively spread it further, by sharing or otherwise engaging with it. Much of the spread of disinformation can thus be attributed to human action. Four studies (total N = 2,634) explored the effect of message attributes (authoritativeness of source, consensus indicators), viewer characteristics (digital literacy, personality, and demographic variables) and their interaction (consistency between message and recipient beliefs) on self-reported likelihood of spreading examples of disinformation. Participants also reported whether they had shared real-world disinformation in the past. Reported likelihood of sharing was not influenced by authoritativeness of the source of the material, nor indicators of how many other people had previously engaged with it. Participants level of digital literacy had little effect on their responses. The people reporting the greatest likelihood of sharing disinformation were those who thought it likely to be true, or who had pre-existing attitudes consistent with it. They were likely to have previous familiarity with the materials. Across the four studies, personality (lower Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, higher Extraversion and Neuroticism) and demographic variables (male gender, lower age and lower education) were weakly and inconsistently associated with self-reported likelihood of sharing.

Yet, there are no approved vaccines or drugs to make the disease less deadly, while efforts are underway. Remdesivir, a nucleotide-analogue antiviral drug developed for Ebola, is determined to prevent and stop infections with COVID-19, while results are yet controversial. Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: We will search MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov and Google scholar databases for articles published as of 30 June 2020 and we will complete the study on 30 August 2020. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. We will include RCTs that assessed the efficacy of remdesivir versus placebo or standard of care. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical recovery. The secondary endpoints will be proportion of participants relieved from clinical symptoms defined at the time (in hours) from initiation of the study treatment, all-cause mortality, discharged date, frequency of respiratory progression and treatment-emergent adverse events. RevMan V.5.3 software will be used for statistical analysis. Random effects model will be carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcome data and risk ratio for dichotomous outcome data between remdesivir and placebo or standard of care.

METHODS Seventy consecutive Chinese patients (49 females; mean age 34.7+/-8.8 [range 18-56] years) received LSG for the treatment of obesity from May 2006 to Nov 2007 as a stand-alone procedure for weight reduction. Mean baseline body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) were 108.9+/-22.1 kg (range 71.0-164.9 kg) and 40.7+/-7.8 kg/m(2) (range 27.4-68.4 kg/m(2)), respectively. Outcome measures were collected and assessed in a prospective manner. RESULTS All procedures were performed laparoscopically with no conversion. There was neither mortality nor any postoperative complications that required reoperation. Major complication occurred in two patients (2.9%; esophagogastric junction [EGJ] leak and stomach tube stricture). Mean follow-up was 7.1+/-5.0 months. Mean procedure time was 90.6+/-39.4 min, and mean hospital stay was 3.8+/-2.3 days. Mean BMI loss was 6.3+/-2.5, 9.0+/-3.4 and 12.3+/-4.5 kg/m(2) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Mean percent of excess BW loss was 48.5+/-28.4, 69.7+/-31.7, and 63.5+/-29.4 at 3, 6, and 12 months.

Incorporating a methodology that allows for the measurement of \\"patterns of behavior\\" instead of singular aspects of parent marijuana use (e.g., age of onset or frequency at any one age or ages), we investigated the simultaneous effects of parental age of onset, frequency, and duration of marijuana use across 3 periods of the life course (i.e., adolescence, emerging adulthood, and adulthood) on the timing of first marijuana use among offspring. Using prospective data from 2 companion studies, the Rochester Youth Development Study and the Rochester Intergenerational Study, we used group-based trajectory models to estimate trajectories (or patterns) of parental marijuana use spanning ages 14 to 31 among a birth cohort of 462 parents. We then examined the relationship between parental trajectories of marijuana use and the timing of the onset of marijuana use through age 25 among firstborn offspring. Both late-onset persistent use by parents and increasing chronic use spanning adolescence to adulthood by parents were associated with an increased likelihood of onset of marijuana use among offspring. The results underscore the importance of patterns of marijuana use for IG continuity in contrast to singular measures (e.g., age of onset among parents), which can obfuscate important IG patterns of continuity. Prevention and intervention programs should consider the entire history of parent use to better identify children most at risk for the onset of marijuana use in adolescence and emerging adulthood.

Objective: Our objective was to perform a 10-year follow-up descriptive assessment of the availability of flexible work-life policies for faculty in medical schools in the Big Ten Conference. Design: In this descriptive study, a modified objective scoring system was used to evaluate the flexibility of faculty work-life policies at 13 medical schools in the Big Ten Conference. Policy information was obtained from institutional websites and verified with the human resources offices. Scores from the 2011 study and 2020 were compared. Results: Michigan State and Ohio State Universities offered the most flexible policies (score 17.75/22) with the Universities of Maryland and Minnesota following (score 16/22). The largest delta scores, indicating more flexible policies in the past decade, were at University of Minnesota (5.25) and University of Michigan (5). Policies for parental leave and part-time faculty varied widely. Most schools earned an additional point in the newly added category of flexible scheduling and return-to-work policies. Nearly every institution reported dedicated lactation spaces and improved childcare options. Limitations: Limitations included missing policy data and interpretation bias in reviewing the policy websites, unavailable baseline data for schools that joined the Big Ten after the 2011 study, and unavailable baseline data for the additional category of return-to-work policies. Conclusions: While progress has been made, every institution should challenge themselves to review flexibility in work-life policies for faculty. It is important to advance a healthy competition with the goal to achieve more forward-thinking policies that improve retention, recruitment, and advancement of faculty. Big Ten institutions can continue to advance their policies by providing greater ease of access to options, further expansion of parental leave and childcare support, and offering more flexible policies for part-time faculty.","output":"Flexibility in Faculty Work-Life Policies at Medical Schools in the Big Ten Conference: A Ten-Year Follow-up Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An infection of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that originated from Wuhan city of China in December 2019 converted rapidly into pandemic by March 11, 2020 To date, the number of confirmed cases and deaths has risen exponentially in more than 200 countries, with an estimated crude mortality ratio of at least over 2% The unpreparedness to tackle the unprecedented situation of coronavirus has contributed to the rising number of cases, which has generated an immense sense of fear and anxiety amongst the public It has further resulted in the inadequacy and unavailability of essential medical supplies, physicians, and healthcare workers (HCW) Although the chief focus is on minimizing transmission through prevention, combating infection, and saving lives by ramping up the development of treatment and vaccines, very little attention is on the critical issue of physician burnout, resident burnout, and the psychological well-being of HCW Until now, no significant steps have been taken by the authorities to minimize the COVID-19 specific contributing factors for burnout The COVID-19 has posed strain on the entire healthcare system already, and it is vital to remediate the issue of physician and resident burnout urgently with concrete actions to avoid subsequent potential short-term and long-term adverse implications","output":"How Essential Is to Focus on Physician's Health and Burnout in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The impact of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on psychosocial and behavioral responses of the non-healthcare workforce is unknown.

METHODS: This population-based study compared comprehensive, linked primary care physician billing data from Jan. 1 to July 28, 2020, with the same period in 2019. We identified Ontario residents with at least 1 office or virtual (telephone or video) visit during the study period.

The relationship between vaccine hesitancy and conspiracy beliefs may be a key determinant of the success of vaccination campaigns. This study provides a conceptual framework to explain the impact of pathways from conspiracy beliefs to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy with regard to medical mistrust, confidence, complacency and knowledge of vaccines. Methods: A non-probability study was conducted with 1015 respondents between 17 April and 28 May 2021. Conspiracy beliefs were measured using the coronavirus conspiracy scale of Coronavirus Explanations, Attitudes, and Narratives Survey (OCEANS), and vaccine conspiracy beliefs scale. Medical mistrust was measured using the Oxford trust in doctors and developers questionnaire, and attitudes to doctors and medicine scale. Vaccine confidence and complacency were measured using the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine confidence and complacency scale. Knowledge of vaccines was measured using the vaccination knowledge scale. Vaccine hesitancy was measured using the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy scale. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the measurement models for conspiracy beliefs, medical mistrust, confidence, complacency, and knowledge of vaccines and vaccine hesitancy. The structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to analyze the direct and indirect pathways from conspiracy beliefs to vaccine hesitancy. Results: Of the 894 (88.1%) respondents who were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine without any hesitancy, the model fit with the CFA models for conspiracy beliefs, medical mistrust, confidence, complacency and knowledge of vaccines, and vaccine hesitancy was deemed acceptable.

There is a recommendation that the focus of these assessments can rather be on practical outcomes, especially when capacity issues arise. This implies that the decision-making capacity of the patient is only practically important when the treatment team is willing to proceed against the patients wishes. This shifts the focus from a potentially difficult assessment to the simpler question of whether the patients capacity will change the treatment approach. Clinicians should attend to any possible underlying issues, instead of focusing strictly on capacity.

Our hospital was immediately closed and re-opened after 15 days as a reference Covid Hospital. Among services involved in a process of destruction and rebirth there was also the Vascular Access Team. METHODS: We analyzed our Vascular Access Team activity comparing data from the first month (March) in which basically it did not work and data from the following month (April) in which we began to re-build the Team adapting it to the new reality. RESULTS: In all patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit a Centrally Inserted Central Catheter multilumen was placed, but in March only 5.5% of patients admitted to Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit had a catheter different from the short peripheral cannula while in April it was possible to guarantee a more suitable catheter 31.7% of patients admitted to Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit (p < 0.000). In April, compared to March, a significant higher number of Midline were implanted in Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit (36/139 vs 12/238 p < 0.000) where also a higher number of Centrally Inserted Central Catheter and Femoral Inserted Central Catheter were implanted (8/139 vs 1/238 p = 0.003). This change allowed us to implant more vascular accesses in Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit favoring Midline with a longer average duration. Only one patient with Midline developed a catheter vein thrombosis, and in only one patient the device was removed for suspected infection. CONCLUSIONS: The experience we gained will allow us to be more prepared in the future and our experience has highlighted that a structured Vascular Access Team is necessary to respond adequately to COVID-19 patients' needs, to ensure the effectiveness of the maneuver, to reduce complications and to avoid the waste of resources, always working in safe condition.","output":"The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic outbreak on the vascular access team operations after conversion to COVID-19 dedicated hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli are now broadly placed into 6 classes based on virulence mechanisms. One of these classes, enterotoxigenic E coli, is the most common cause of diarrhea in beef and dairy calves in the first 4 days of life. Two other diarrheagenic classes, enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC), are important causes of disease in human beings, but less well substantiated causes of diarrhea in calves. E coli strains that cause hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans, express high levels of Shiga toxin, cause attaching-effacing (A/E) lesions in intestinal epithelial cells, and possess a specific 60-MDa EHEC plasmid are known as EHEC. One feature EHEC and EPEC have in common is the causation of intestinal epithelial lesions known as attaching and effacing (A/E). Attaching-effacing E coli (AEEC) is a designation for those E coli strains known to cause A/E lesions or at least carry the genes for this trait, and therefore include organisms that fall into either the EHEC or EPEC classes. Because cattle are carriers of many different serotypes of EHEC, much emphasis has been placed on the public health and food safety concerns associated with the fecal shedding of these organisms. However, much less emphasis has been given to their roles as diarrheagenic pathogens of cattle. The goal of this article is to address the question of pathogenicity, with a review that focuses on the results of studies of natural and experimental infections with these organisms.

The mature complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process platforms available in many foundries can be extended to fabricate MEMS sensors to offer the advantage of relatively easier commercialization. Moreover, by leveraging the characteristics of CMOS process platforms, the integration of multiple sensors and sensing circuits to form a compact sensing system can also be achieved. This review paper will focus on introducing the miniaturized environmental sensing devices implemented and integrated using the CMOS-MEMS technologies. In general, the CMOS chips for environment sensing are firstly fabricated using the foundry-available CMOS processes, and then the post-CMOS micromachining processes are performed to implement the CMOS-MEMS environment sensors. This paper respectively reviews five different environment sensors (including the infrared, pressure (barometer), humidity/temperature, and gas sensors) using the CMOS-based MEMS technologies. The advantages and design concerns of sensors fabricated by different CMOS and post-CMOS processes are introduced and discussed.

Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The urokinase receptor system is a key regulator of the intersection between inflammation, immunity, and coagulation, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has been identified as an immunologic risk factor for AKI. Whether suPAR is associated with COVID-19-related AKI is unknown. METHODS In a multinational observational study of adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we measured suPAR levels in plasma samples from 352 adult patients that had been collected within 48 hours of admission. We examined the association between suPAR levels and incident in-hospital AKI. RESULTS Of the 352 patients (57.4% were male, 13.9% were black, and mean age was 61 years), 91 (25.9%) developed AKI during their hospitalization, of whom 25 (27.4%) required dialysis. The median suPAR level was 5.61 ng/ml. AKI incidence rose with increasing suPAR tertiles, from a 6.0% incidence in patients with suPAR <4.60 ng/ml (first tertile) to a 45.8% incidence of AKI in patients with suPAR levels >6.86 ng/ml (third tertile). None of the patients with suPAR <4.60 ng/ml required dialysis during their hospitalization. In multivariable analysis, the highest suPAR tertile was associated with a 9.15-fold increase in the odds of AKI (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.64 to 22.93) and a 22.86-fold increase in the odds of requiring dialysis (95% CI, 2.77 to 188.75). The association was independent of inflammatory markers and persisted across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Admission suPAR levels in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are predictive of in-hospital AKI and the need for dialysis.

In response to the pandemic, national and international societies have recommended interim changes to the management of patients with liver diseases. These modifications included the implementation of telehealth, postponement or cancelation of elective procedures, and other non-urgent patient care-related activities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 117 patients who received RE for HCC from 2 academic centers were reviewed and stratified by ALBI grade, C-P class, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. The overall survival (OS) according to these 3 criteria was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The utilities of C-P class and ALBI grade as prognostic indicators were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify additional predictive factors. RESULTS Patients with ALBI grade 1 (n=49) had superior OS than those with ALBI grade 2 (n=65) (P=0.01). Meanwhile, no significant difference was observed in OS between C-P class A (n=100) and C-P class B (n=14) (P=0.11). For C-P class A patients, the ALBI grade (1 vs. 2) was able to stratify 2 clear and nonoverlapping subgroups with differing OS curves (P=0.03). Multivariate Cox regression test identified alanine transaminase, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, and ALBI grade as the strongest prognostic factors for OS (P<0.10). CONCLUSIONS ALBI grade as a prognosticator has demonstrated clear survival discrimination that is superior to C-P class among HCC patients treated with RE, particularly within the subgroup of C-P class A patients.

METHODS: Consecutive older patients with hip fracture undergoing surgery were included from January 2014 to December 2021. Monocyte count was measured on admission, and Doppler ultrasonography was performed for DVT screening prior to surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between monocyte count and DVT. RESULTS: A total of 674 patients were finally included, and 128 patients (19.0%) were diagnosed with preoperative DVT. Patients with DVT exhibited a higher monocyte count than patients without DVT [0.55 (0.43-0.72)  10(9)/L versus 0.49 (0.38-0.63)  10(9)/L, P = 0.007]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a high monocyte count (> 0.6  10(9)/L) was independently associated with a higher risk of DVT (OR = 1.705, 95% CI: 1.121-2.593, P = 0.013), and for every 0.1  10(9)/L increase in monocyte count, the risk of DVT increased by 8.5% (OR = 1.085, 95% CI: 1.003-1.174, P = 0.041).

Radionuclide molecular imaging of HER2 expression in disseminated PC would aid in the selection of patients who are likely responders to HER2 targeting therapy. In this study, we evaluated whether ABY-025 Affibody molecule, a small ( 7-kDa) HER2-binding scaffold protein, produces superior tumor-to-nontumor ratios compared with those obtained through the use of radiolabeled humanized anti-HER2 antibody, trastuzumab. The influence of (111)In vs. (125)I radiolabel was evaluated for both tracers. METHODS ABY-025 was labeled with (111)In using 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid chelator, site-specifically coupled to the C-terminus via the maleimido derivative. Trastuzumab was labeled with (111)In using a CHX-A diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelator. An indirect radioiodination with [(125)I]-N-succinimidyl-para-iodobenzoate was used for both targeting proteins. Biodistribution of all labeled targeting proteins was evaluated in mice bearing DU-145 PC xenografts. RESULTS The use of residualizing (111)In-label facilitated better tumor uptake and better tumor-to-nontumor ratios for both targeting agents. [(111)In]-ABY-025 provided tumor uptake of 7.10.8% injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) and tumor-to-blood ratio of 4713 already at 6 h postinjection. The maximum tumor-to-nontumor ratios with [(111)In]-CHX-DTPA-trastuzumab were achieved at 72 h postinjection, whereas tumor uptake was 114% ID/g and tumor-to-blood ratio was 187.

Consequently, the MS care unit requires a multidisciplinary approach, including an infectious disease specialist to minimise the risk of infectious complications related both to the disease and DMTs. Materials and methods: We retrospectively evaluated the infectious disease consultations performed from 2015 to 2019 in our MS centre. Results: We identified 107 patients with at least one infectious disease consultation out of 1088 patients. We found a progressive increase in the number of consultations from 2015 to 2019. Nearly half of the consultations were requested at the time of starting MS treatment. The most frequent requests were represented by chronic or acute infections. The most prevalent infectious agents were Herpesviridae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antibiotic or antiviral treatment and prophylactic treatment or vaccination represented together the most frequent outcomes of the consultations. Finally, a treatment delay was significantly associated with the advice of a prophylactic treatment or of a vaccination. Conclusion: There is an increasing awareness of the potential infectious complications of MS and of exposure to DMTs. The interaction between the MS neurologist and infectious disease specialist is fundamental to minimise the infectious risk related to the disease and to the DMTs, with a progressive shift from complication management to a broader prevention workup at the time of MS diagnosis, including both vaccination and prophylactic treatments.","output":"The Expanding Role of the Infectious Disease Expert in the Context of the MS Centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The CSO 2019 figures, (pre-Covid 19), show that of those persons who used the internet every day, 58% used the internet I several times a day i , while 16% used the internet I nearly all the time i and 3% stated that they used the internet I all the time i .

Currently, during the treatment of COVID-19 (in ICU), invasive Candidiasis and Candida colonization should be prevented to avoid the increase, in mortality, in SAPSII, and in length of stay. Our aim was to characterize and analyze the infection of CA for eradication. Methods: : We characterized and analyzed the infection source and infection field which are carrier field, diffusion field, and spread field, by using a new infection examination (diagnostic) system (IEDS) comprising a new dental formula (measurement analysis) medium (DFM) with time, space, and phase, and the simultaneous relative differential equations (C4RDE). Results: : This study showed that CA was not an endogenous microorganism, but a fungus that infected teeth causing dental caries that was successfully eradicated from all teeth of 353 Japanese patients. Conclusion: Our methods help to eradicate the infection source, prevent critical infection, and reduce mortality. The IEDS is a powerful tool that can be applied for any infection easily. It is possible for the dentists to characterize CA by IEDS and eradicate CA from the oral cavity.

Dermatology programs have developed various ways to decrease the number of reviewed applications, from cutoff s for Step 1 board scores to Alpha Omega Alpha membership to secondary applications. While this can decrease the applicant pool, it limits a more holistic review of applications. We propose an application cap of 20 programs, which will decrease the number of applications each program receives 3- to 5-fold. Each applicant can approach the process more thoughtfully in choosing the best programs for them and will save money in application fees. As program directors rank \\"perceived interest\\" in their residency program as a primary factor for selecting applicants, a cap will allow program directors to know that all applicants are interested in their specific program.

Epitopes used to produce antibodies are generally linear peptides and thus possess multiple confirmations that do not reflect the actual topology of the targeted part in the native protein. On the other hand, macrocyclic epitopes could constitute closer mimics of the native protein topology and, as such, could generate superior antibodies. In this study, we demonstrated the vital effect of the size and the three-dimensional shape of epitopes on the activity of the developed antibodies against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular dynamics studies showed the greater stability of the cyclic epitopes compared with the linear counterparts, which was reflected in the affinity of the produced antibodies.

Here, an independent prospective validation of these results was performed using an overlap-fraction (OF) calculation of various FDG-uptake based thresholds. Data from twelve patients treated at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center with lung cancer were analyzed. All patients underwent two FDG-PET-CT scans, one pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) and one approximately three months after treatment (post-RT). Of the twelve analyzed patients, eight patients showed residual FDG uptake on the post-RT scan and were included for analysis. One of these patients had a residue that was not clearly distinguishable from the surrounding tissue due to FDG avid inflammation. Therefore, seven patients remained for further analysis. The mean volume of the residual metabolic-active areas post-RT was 14.610.0% (meanSD) of the mean volume of the gross tumour volume (GTV) pre-RT. The residual metabolic-active areas largely corresponded with the pre-RT GTV (OF=93.77.2%).

Convalescent plasma has been used to treat a number of infections during pandemics, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the existing literature and registered clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for treating coronaviruses, and discuss issues of feasibility, and donor and patient selection. SOURCES: A review of articles published in PubMed was performed on July 13, 2020, to summarize the currently available evidence in human studies for convalescent plasma as a treatment for coronaviruses. The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry and clinicaltrials.gov were searched to summarize the currently registered randomized clinical trials for convalescent plasma in COVID-19. CONTENT: There were sixteen COVID-19, four MERS-CoV, and five SARS-CoV reports describing convalescent plasma use in humans. There were two randomized control trials, both of which were for COVID-19 and were terminated early. Most COVID-19 reports described a potential benefit of convalescent plasma on clinical outcomes in severe or critically ill patients with few immediate adverse events. However, there were a number of limitations, including the concurrent use of antivirals, steroids, and other treatments, small sample sizes, lack of randomization or control groups, and short follow-up time. Data from SARS-CoV and COVID-19 suggest that earlier administration likely yields better outcomes. The ideal candidates for recipients and donors are not known. Still, experience with prior coronaviruses tells us that antibodies in convalescent patients are probably short-lived. Patients who had more severe disease and who are earlier in their course of recovery may be more likely to have adequate titres. Finally, a number of practical challenges were identified. IMPLICATIONS: There is currently no effective treatment for COVID-19, and preliminary trials for convalescent plasma suggest there may be some benefits. However, research to date is at high risk of bias, and randomized control trials are desperately needed to determine the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic option.","output":"Treatment of COVID-19 with convalescent plasma: lessons from past coronavirus outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is essential to sustainable development.

Accurate, non-invasive diagnostic methods using CT imaging can help developing an optimal therapeutic regimen for both conditions. OBJECTIVES: To compare the initial CT imaging features in COVID-19 with those in other types of viral pneumonia. METHODS: Clinical and imaging data of 51 patients with COVID-19 and 69 with other types of viral pneumonia were retrospectively studied. All significant imaging features (Youden index >0.3) were included for constituting the combined criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis, composed of two or more imaging features with a parallel model. McNemar's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the validity indices (sensitivity and specificity) among various criteria. RESULTS: Ground glass opacities (GGO) dominated density, peripheral distribution, unilateral lung, clear margin of lesion, rounded morphology, long axis parallel to the pleura, vascular thickening, and crazy-paving pattern were more common in COVID-19 (p <0.05). Consolidation-dominated density, both central and peripheral distribution, bilateral lung, indistinct margin of lesion, tree-in-bud pattern, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenectasis, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening were more common in other types of viral pneumonia (p < 0.05).

Using expedited literature review methodology, we provide guidance regarding management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios during the pandemic. METHODS: We grouped FPMRS conditions into those in which virtual management differs from direct in-person visits and conditions in which treatment would emphasize behavioral and conservative counseling but not deviate from current management paradigms. We conducted expedited literature review on four topics (telemedicine in FPMRS, pessary management, urinary tract infections, urinary retention) and addressed four other topics (urinary incontinence, prolapse, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction) based on existing systematic reviews and guidelines. We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Behavioral, medical, and conservative management will be valuable as first-line virtual treatments. Certain situations will require different treatments in the virtual setting while others will require an in-person visit despite the risks of COVID-19 transmission.

The most severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also leads to life-threatening ARDS. Neutrophil counts are positively correlated with disease severity in ARDS. Neutrophil activation not only plays a significant role in immune defense against infections, but also causes tissue damage and leads to inflammatory diseases. Activated neutrophils rapidly migrate to inflamed lung tissue, releasing toxic granular contents and generating neutrophil extracellular traps. In the last few decades, it has become apparent that neutrophils occupy a central role in ARDS pathology. In this review, we summarize the neutrophil inflammatory responses and their relationships to ARDS. According to the current literature, understanding the function of neutrophils may be helpful in the treatment of ARDS.","output":"Understanding the Role of Neutrophils in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growing evidence suggests that ABO blood group may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with group O individuals less likely to test positive and group A conferring a higher susceptibility to infection and propensity to severe disease. The level of evidence supporting an association between ABO type and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 ranges from small observational studies, to genome-wide-association-analyses and country-level meta-regression analyses. ABO blood group antigens are oligosaccharides expressed on red cells and other tissues (notably endothelium). There are several hypotheses to explain the differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection by ABO type. For example, anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies (e.g. present in group O individuals) could bind to corresponding antigens on the viral envelope and contribute to viral neutralization, thereby preventing target cell infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus and SARS-CoV spike (S) proteins may be bound by anti-A isoagglutinins (e.g. present in group O and group B individuals), which may block interactions between virus and angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2-receptor, thereby preventing entry into lung epithelial cells. ABO type-associated variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 activity and levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII could also influence adverse outcomes, notably in group A individuals who express high VWF levels. In conclusion, group O may be associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and group A may be associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection along with severe disease. However, prospective and mechanistic studies are needed to verify several of the proposed associations. Based on the strength of available studies, there are insufficient data for guiding policy in this regard.","output":"ABO blood group and COVID-19: a review on behalf of the ISBT COVID-19 working group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: American Indians have significant barriers to cancer prevention and control due to a number of social structural factors. North Carolina has the largest American Indian population east of the Mississippi River with eight tribes and four urban Indian centers, yet there have been few coordinated strategies to address cancer disparities in this population. Engagement with tribal communities is vital in successful implementation of research and outreach activities. Methods: The Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) received a supplement to their P30 Cancer Center Support Grant to inform Community Outreach and Engagement initiatives through The Healing Walk project which was designed to determine the most pressing cancer concerns for American Indian communities in North Carolina and identify needs for research training for American Indian students. Feedback was obtained from tribal leaders, educators, and college students through one large and three mini-round table discussions and solicited by email throughout late 2018 and 2019. The final round table occurred two days before the 2020 COVID 19 mitigation mandates. Results: Community interviews produced a wealth of information on the self-reported issues within American Indian populations in North Carolina. Tribal community leaders identified systemic and demographic issues that contribute to health disparities among their people. These issues include: lack of trust in the medical community, structural barriers to care leading to late-stage diagnosis, perceptions related to cancer, high rates of cancer risk factors, including obesity and tobacco use, and historical trauma. Students identified factors which contribute to barriers in pursuing careers in cancer research, including a lack of American Indian mentors, financial barriers, mental health challenges that arise in attending majority institutions, and a lack of culturally competent research training. Conclusions: By relying on the viewpoints of tribal leaders, the WFBCCC can accurately address the needs of the communities and develop cancer prevention and control initiatives that are culturally responsible, such as Tribal Health Ambassadors. In accordance with the majority of the requests both students and educators made, the WFBCCC is creating an undergraduate research program for engaging AI students. Focusing on community identified areas of need, students will develop a research question relative to the health concerns of their tribe. The goal of this research program is two fold. First, to enable tribal communities to accurately assess cancer risk, incidence, and mortality, and with that knowledge reduce the current health disparities in AI populations. Second, to provide American Indian students with the opportunity to not only serve their community, but to give them the tools and experience to help understand and eliminate cancer disparities in their tribal communities.","output":"Engaging the American Indian community in North Carolina to assess cancer research and training opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Several comprehensive stroke centers (CSC) have reported increased delays to reperfusion in acute stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is unknown whether the pandemic is associated with worse functional outcomes in EVT-treated patients. Methods: We performed an observational cohort study of consecutive adult patients evaluated for suspected stroke at our CSC (located in Montreal, a Canadian pandemic epicenter) between March 30 and May 15 2020 (prospective pandemic cohort) and 2019 (retrospective non-pandemic cohort). We excluded in-hospital strokes. We compared short-term (in-house door-to-puncture and door-torecanalization delays, TICI 2b/3, complications during EVT) and long-term (90-day mRS 2 and death) outcomes with univariate analyses. We assessed the effect of the pandemic on 90-day mRS while controlling for clinical confounders. Results: Overall, 111 and 106 patients were included in the pandemic and non-pandemic cohorts, respectively. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the pandemic cohort was 3% (3/104). Among ischemic stroke patients, 31/77 (40%) and 41/71 (58%) underwent EVT in each respective cohort (p=0.03). Among EVT-treated patients, baseline characteristics and NIHSS scores were similar (median [interquartile range]: 20 [12-25] vs 18 [14-20], p=0.18), but pre-stroke mRS was lower in the exposed cohort (0 [0-1] vs 1 [0-2], p=0.04). Door-to-puncture (87 [65-102] vs 56 [47-74] min, p=0.07) metrics were similar, but door-to-recanalization (122 [99-126] vs 89 [67-97] min, p&lt;0.01) metrics were longer during the pandemic. The proportions of patients with TICI 2b/3 (94 vs 85%, p=0.27)and with complications during EVT (23 vs 22%, p=0.95) were similar, as were those for 90-day mRS2 (42 vs 37%, p=0.64) and death (19 vs 20%, p=0.99). The logistic multivariate regression did notdisclose an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and 90-day mRS 2 (aOR 0.70, 95% CI0.06-7.95).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in elderly patients with HCC and to investigate cause-specific excess deaths associated with increasing number of elderly patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We enrolled 1401 naive patients with HCC who were treated initially by RFA from 1999 to 2011. Patients below 75 years of age were categorized as 'younger' and those at least 75 as 'elderly'. Differences in the demographic and laboratory data of these patients were assessed, along with Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival using the log-rank test. In addition, we assessed the causes of death, defined as liver related and liver unrelated, by competing risk analysis and risk factors for respective causes of death by a proportional subdistribution model. RESULTS Overall, 353 patients were categorized as elderly. Elderly patients were more likely to be women, infected with hepatitis C virus, and score better in the Child-Pugh classification. The mortality at 5 years was lower in the elderly than in the younger patients (47.3 vs. 37.1%; P<0.001). Competing risk analysis showed a significant difference in liver-unrelated death (P<0.001) between the two groups, whereas there were no significant differences in liver-related death (P=0.64). By the proportional subdistribution model, age was a significant risk factor only for liver-unrelated death. CONCLUSION RFA provided satisfactory 5-year survival rates in elderly patients with HCC.

Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes respiratory infection by binding to ACE2 receptors present on alveolar epithelial cells, studies have been published linking the disease to the small intestine enterocytes and its microbiome. Dysbiosis of microbiome, mainly intestinal and lung, can affect the course of the disease. Environmental factors, such as reduced intake of commensal bacteria from the environment or their products in the diet, play an important role in microbiome formation, which can significantly affect the immune response. In elderly, obese or chronically ill people, the microbiota is often damaged. Therefore, we speculate that a good microbiome may be one of the factors responsible for lower CFR from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

However, when higher rates of oxygen flow are needed, patients are often stepped up to high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). BiPAP, CPAP, and HFNC may be beneficial alternatives to IMV for COVID-19-associated ARF.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, proceedings of four conferences and bibliographies (to June 2020) for randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared extubation with immediate application of NIV to continued invasive weaning in intubated adults and reported mortality (primary outcome) or other outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened citations, assessed trial quality and abstracted data. RESULTS: We identified 28 trials, of moderate-to-good quality, involving 2066 patients, 44.6% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Non-invasive weaning significantly reduced mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.74; high quality), weaning failures (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.81; high quality), pneumonia (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.41; high quality), intensive care unit (ICU) (mean difference (MD) -4.62 days, 95% CI -5.91 to -3.34) and hospital stay (MD -6.29 days, 95% CI -8.90 to -3.68). Non-invasive weaning also significantly reduced the total duration of ventilation, duration of invasive ventilation and duration of ventilation related to weaning (MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.07) and tracheostomy rate. Mortality, pneumonia, reintubation and ICU stay were significantly lower in trials enrolling COPD (vs mixed) populations.

Those areas include behavior change interventions, research across the activity continuum, telerehabilitation, neuroplasticity, heterogeneity of outcomes, inclusion of targeted samples, combined interventions involving exercise training, and multi-site trials. EXPERT OPINION: Additional research addressing those areas will greatly expand the opportunity for translation of exercise and physical activity into the clinical care of persons with MS.","output":"Current perspectives on exercise training in the management of multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inferior olive (IO), a nucleus in the ventral medulla, is the only source of climbing fibers that form one of the two input pathways entering the cerebellum. IO has long been proposed to be crucial for motor control and its activity is currently considered to be at the center of many hypotheses of both motor and cognitive functions of the cerebellum. While its physiology and function have been relatively well studied on single-cell level in vitro, presently there are no reports on the organization of the IO network activity in living animals. This is largely due to the extremely challenging anatomical location of the IO, making it difficult to subject to conventional fluorescent imaging methods, where an optic path must be created through the entire brain located dorsally to the region of interest. Here we describe an alternative method for obtaining state-of-the-art -level calcium imaging data from the IO network. The method takes advantage of the extreme ventral location of the IO and involves a surgical procedure for inserting a gradient-refractive index (GRIN) lens through the neck viscera to come into contact with the ventral surface of the calcium sensor GCaMP6s-expressing IO in anesthetized mice. A representative calcium imaging recording is shown to demonstrate the feasibility to record IO neuron activity after the surgery. While this is a non-survival surgery and the recordings must be conducted under anesthesia, it avoids damage to life-critical brainstem nuclei and allows conducting large variety of experiments investigating spatiotemporal activity patterns and input integration in the IO. This procedure with modifications could be used for recordings in other, adjacent regions of the ventral brainstem.","output":"In vivo Calcium Imaging in Mouse Inferior Olive"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, and was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Diabetes is an established risk associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with COVID-19 has not been reported yet. Methods In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The clinical features, treatment strategies and prognosis data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was followed up until March 12, 2020. Results Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male. Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more complications, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%). Cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21) and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the fatality due to COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders.

METHODS An email-based survey was used to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on clinical workflow, clinical training, education, and trainee well-being. The impact of the International Council on Perioperative Neuroscience Training (ICPNT) accreditation was also assessed. RESULTS Responses were received from 14 program directors (88% response rate) in 10 countries and from 36 fellows in these programs. Clinical training was adversely affected because of the cancellation of elective neurosurgery and other changes in case workflow, the introduction of modified airway and other protocols, and redeployment of trainees to other sites. To address educational demands, most programs utilized online platforms to organize clinical discussions, journal clubs, and provide safety training modules. Several initiatives were introduced to support trainee well-being during the pandemic. Feelings of isolation and despair among trainees varied from 2 to 8 (on a scale of 1 to 10). Fellows all reported concerns that their clinical training had been adversely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because of decreased exposure to elective subspecialty cases and limited opportunities to complete workplace-based assessments and training portfolio requirements. Cancellation of examination preparation courses and delayed examinations were cited as common sources of stress. Programs accredited by the ICPNT reported that international networking and collaboration was beneficial to reduce feelings of isolation during the pandemic.

We hypothesized that an aggressive enteral nutrition (EN) protocol would result in higher macronutrient delivery and fewer late infections. METHODS We enrolled adult surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving >72 hours of EN from July 2012 to June 2014. Our intervention consisted of increasing protein prescription (2.0-2.5 vs 1.5-2.0 g/kg/d) and compensatory feeds for EN interruption. We compared the intervention group with historical controls. To test the association of the aggressive EN protocol with the risk of late infections (defined as occurring >96 hours after ICU admission), we performed a Poisson regression analysis, while controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and exposure to gastrointestinal surgery. RESULTS The study cohort comprised 213 patients, who were divided into the intervention group (n = 119) and the historical control group (n = 94). There was no difference in age, sex, BMI, admission category, or Injury Severity Score between the groups. Mean APACHE II score was higher in the intervention group (17  8 vs 14  6, P = .002). The intervention group received more calories (19  5 vs 17  6 kcal/kg/d, P = .005) and protein (1.2  0.4 vs 0.8  0.3 g/kg/d, P < .001), had a higher percentage of prescribed calories (77% vs 68%, P < .001) and protein (93% vs 64%, P < .001), and accumulated a lower overall protein deficit (123  282 vs 297  233 g, P < .001). On logistic regression, the intervention group had fewer late infections (adjusted odds ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.83).

Among infectious agents, viruses, such as the \\"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2\\" (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent responsible for the currently ongoing \\"Coronavirus disease 2019\\" (COVID-2019) pandemic, have a particularly high mutation rate. Taking into account the mutational landscape of an infectious agent, it is important to shed light on its evolution capability over time. As new, more infectious strains of COVID-19 emerge around the world, it is imperative to estimate when these new strains may overtake the wild-type strain in different populations. Therefore, we developed a general-purpose framework to estimate the time at which a mutant variant is able to takeover a wild-type strain during an emerging infectious diseases outbreak. In this study, we used COVID-19 as a case-study, but the model is adaptable to any emerging pathogens. Methods and findings: We devise a two-strain mathematical framework, to model a wild- and a mutant-type viral population and fit cumulative case data to parameterize the model, using Ontario as a case study. We found that, in the context of under-reporting and the current case levels, a variant strain is unlikely to dominate until March/April 2021. Current non-pharmaceutical interventions in Ontario need to be kept in place longer even with vaccination in order to prevent another outbreak. The spread of a variant strain in Ontario will mostly likely be observed by a widened peak of the daily reported cases. If vaccine efficacy is maintained across strains, then it is still possible to have an immune population by end of 2021.

Sharing such data, however, can lead to serious privacy issues, because individuals could be re-identified, not only based on possible nodes attributes, but also from the structure of the network around them. The risk associated with re-identification can be measured and it is more serious in some networks than in others. While various optimization algorithms have been proposed to anonymize networks, there is still only a limited theoretical understanding of which network features are important for the privacy problem. Using network models and real data, we show that the average degree of networks is a crucial parameter for the severity of re-identification risk from nodes neighborhoods. Dense networks are more at risk, and, apart from a small band of average degree values, either almost all nodes are uniquely re-identifiable or they are all safe. Our results allow researchers to assess the privacy risk based on a small number of network statistics which are available even before the data is collected. As a rule-of-thumb, the privacy risks are high if the average degree is above 10. Guided by these results, we explore sampling of edges as a strategy to mitigate the re-identification risk of nodes. This approach can be implemented during the data collection phase, and its effect on various network measures can be estimated and corrected using sampling theory.

Here we used unbiased abundance proteomics, phosphoproteomics, mRNA sequencing and viral replication assays to show that B.1.1.7 isolates more effectively suppress host innate immune responses in airway epithelial cells. We found that B.1.1.7 isolates have dramatically increased subgenomic RNA and protein levels of Orf9b and Orf6, both known innate immune antagonists. Expression of Orf9b alone suppressed the innate immune response through interaction with TOM70, a mitochondrial protein required for RNA sensing adaptor MAVS activation, and Orf9b binding and activity was regulated via phosphorylation. We conclude that B.1.1.7 has evolved beyond the Spike coding region to more effectively antagonise host innate immune responses through upregulation of specific subgenomic RNA synthesis and increased protein expression of key innate immune antagonists.

All of the included trials showed a reduced incidence of infection in children with sickle cell disease (SS or S0Thal) receiving prophylactic penicillin. In trials which investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.86), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% CI 0.09 to 2.71). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous sickle cell disease, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.","output":"Prophylactic antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 infection poses a serious threat to global health for millions of people. In addition to therapeutic treatment methods, preventive measures are also important in controlling the pandemic. As a result, billions of people are quarantined in their homes to prevent the spread of coronavirus. However, social isolation may result in immobility, which can lead to musculoskeletal problems and an increased level of pain, depending on the weakness of the muscles. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of social isolation during the recent COVID-19 pandemic on patients with chronic low back pain. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 patients who underwent a spine intervention within the past year were enrolled in this prospective and cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study was performed in the interventional pain unit of a tertiary rehabilitation center in Turkey. METHODS: Patient data were obtained by telephone interview and included information pertaining to demographics, pain history, an assessment of pain, analgesic use, activity levels, and an evaluation of stress and sleep habits. Additionally, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to evaluate patient activity levels. RESULTS: It was detected that social isolation has increased the intensity of low back pain experienced by patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that patients who benefited from spinal injections administered in the prepandemic period experience less severe low back pain (P = 0.000) and took fewer analgesics (P = 0.000) during the pandemic. The findings of our study revealed that there was a significant reverse correlation between IPAQ walking scores and the prepandemic Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores (P = 0.015, r = -0.201) and the pandemic VAS scores (P = 0.000, r = -0.313).By contrast, the level of benefit from injections decreased (P < 0.05) and the duration of spinal intervention was shortened in patients with high IPAQ sitting scores (P < 0.05). LIMITATIONS: The limitations of the study are the small number of patients and the fact that our results are based on patients self-reported data. CONCLUSIONS: Social isolation has had an increasing effect on low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of our study showed a significant relationship between activity level and pain intensity. We also found that patients who have benefited from spinal injections administered in the prepandemic period experience less severe low back pain during the pandemic.","output":"The Effect of Social Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain Who Underwent a Spine Intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The significance of chronic kidney disease on susceptibility to COVID\\\\19 and subsequent outcomes remains unaddressed.

The means they used to communicate the global pandemic reveal their strategies and the narratives they chose to create in their nations social consciousness. In Israel, the crisis broke out after three election cycles, such that the government in charge of the crisis was an interim government under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was operating under three criminal indictments. This study sought to examine the ways in which Prime Minister Netanyahu and two senior Israel Ministry of Health officialsDirector General Moshe Bar Siman Tov and Prof. Sigal Sadetsky, Head of Public Health Servicescommunicated information about the health crisis in Israel during what has been termed the first wave and the beginning of the second wave. METHODS AND SAMPLE: The research adopted qualitative methods (discourse, content and thematic analysis) to analyze the communication strategies and compare them to health and risk communication. Triangulated data collection from different data sources was used to increase the credibility and validity of the results. The research sample comprised the following sources from March 3 through June 21, 2020: transcripts of 19 press conferences and 12 press interviews, 95 emergency regulations signed by Prime Minister Netanyahu, and 52 articles in major Israeli newspapers. RESULTS: Netanyahu and the Health Ministry Director General used an apocalyptic narrative to communicate COVID-19 to the public. The main strategies used in constructing this narrative were intimidation, lack of information transparency, giving the public conflicting instructions contrary to the health and risk communicating approach, and using a health crisis to promote political intentions and actions. CONCLUSION: Communicating health crises to the public, particularly ongoing crises like COVID-19, requires that leaders implement the health and risk communication approach and create a cooperative narrative that does not rely on a strategy of intimidation, but rather on empathy and on fact-based and transparent information.","output":"When Politics Meets Pandemic: How Prime Minister Netanyahu and a Small Team Communicated Health and Risk Information to the Israeli Public During the Early Stages of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The SHAPER-PND study will analyse the clinical and implementation effectiveness of 10-week in-person singing sessions for postnatal depression in new mothers.

However, COVID-19 patients lead to pulmonary fibrosis, such a serious threat to the prognosis of complications were also worthy of our attention. First of all, we proposed the possible mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis caused by SARS-CoV-2, based on the published data of COVID-19 ((i) Direct evidence: pulmonary fibrosis was found in autopsy and pulmonary puncture pathology. (ii) Indirect evidence: increased levels of fibrosis-related cytokines[transforming growth factor [TGF]- ?, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]- &#945;, interleukin [IL]-6, etc] in peripheral blood of severe patients.) What is more, we summarized the role of three fibrosis-related signaling pathways (TGF- ? signal pathway, WNT signal pathway and YAP/TAZ signal pathway) in pulmonary fibrosis.

Commercial assays specific for the S1 monomer, for the N protein, or within a newly developed Luminex assay using the S protein trimer were found to be equally sensitive in antibody detection in the acute-infection-phase samples. Interestingly, compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the postinfection cohort. Seroprevalence in a positive patient contacts group (n = 177) was underestimated by N protein assays by 10.9 to 32.2%, while the randomly selected general population group (n = 311) was reduced by up to 45% relative to the S protein assays. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was significantly more sensitive compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies. IMPORTANCE In the present study, we have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in sera of acute and postinfection phase subjects. Our results indicate that antibody responses against viral S and N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute phase of infection, but that responses against N appear to wane in the postinfection phase where those against the S protein persist over time. The most sensitive serological assay in both acute and postinfection phases used the native S protein trimer as the binding antigen, which has significantly greater conformational epitopes for antibody binding compared to the S1 monomer protein used in other assays. We believe these results are extremely important in order to generate correct estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population. Furthermore, the assessment of antibody responses against the trimeric S protein will be critical to evaluate the durability of the antibody response and for the characterization of a vaccine-induced antibody response.","output":"Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike versus Nucleoprotein Antibody Responses Impact the Estimates of Infections in Population-Based Seroprevalence Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in disruption to routine health services delivery as strict lockdowns were implemented in India and health workforce redeployed for COVID-19 focused responses. We assess the perceptions about COVID-19, the impact of the lockdown on access to health services and continuum of care for Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among a cohort of adults in rural India. METHODOLOGY: Since 2018, we have been following up a cohort of persons with non-communicable diseases in a high NCD burden region in Srikakulam District of Andhra Pradesh under the STOP CKDu study. We conducted this mixed methods study, administered through a structured telephonic questionnaire and interview to determine the awareness, perceptions and their compliance to ongoing treatment schedules. RESULTS: Overall, 68% of the participants exhibited adequate knowledge of symptoms of COVID-19, while 43% were not aware of the mode of transmission of the virus. In all, 822 (36.1%) participants reported at least one NCD condition. Among them, 115 (14%) missed their follow-up visit, 110 (13.4%) reported facing challenges in medication procurement and 11.6% either developed new complaints or experienced worsening of pre-existing symptoms. A total of 233 (28.5%) used a telemedicine facility and took telephonic advice from (private) physicians. As the access to medicines was restricted due to the lockdown, majority of the respondents were depending on rural medical practitioners (RMPs) for the procurement of medication. CONCLUSION: Our finding implies the need for the future guidelines on adaptation of telehealth approaches within health systems to maintain the continuum of care, digital health tools to facilitate the patient's appointments including virtual follow-up visits for those with NCDs coupled with regular engagement by frontline healthcare workers at the local levels, evidence informed public health messaging taking into consideration the social and behavioural aspect and uninterrupted essential primary healthcare services.","output":"Continuum of care for non-communicable diseases during COVID-19 pandemic in rural India: A mixed methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne illness in the United States, is most frequently caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. Although early antibiotic treatment can prevent development of severe illness and late manifestations, diagnosis is challenging in patients who do not present with a typical erythema migrans rash. To support a diagnosis of Lyme disease in such cases, guidelines recommend 2-tiered serologic testing. However, 2-tiered testing has numerous limitations, including ambiguity in interpretation and lower sensitivity in early disease. We developed a diagnostic approach for Lyme disease based on the T-cell response to B. burgdorferi infection by immunosequencing T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires in blood samples from 3 independent cohorts of patients with laboratory-confirmed or clinically diagnosed early Lyme disease, as well as endemic and non-endemic controls. We identified 251 public, Lyme-associated TCRs that were used to train a classifier for detection of early Lyme disease with 99% specificity. In a validation cohort of individuals with early Lyme disease, TCR testing demonstrated a 1.9-fold increase in sensitivity compared to standard 2-tiered testing (STTT; 56% versus 30%), with a 3.1-fold increase <=4 days from the onset of symptoms (44% versus 14%). TCR positivity predicted subsequent seroconversion in 37% of initially STTT-negative patients, suggesting that the T-cell response is detectable before the humoral response. While positivity for both tests declined after treatment, greater declines in posttreatment sensitivity were observed for STTT compared to TCR testing. Higher TCR scores were associated with clinical measures of disease severity, including abnormal liver function test results, disseminated rash, and number of symptoms. A subset of Lyme-associated TCRs mapped to B. burgdorferi antigens, demonstrating high specificity of a TCR immunosequencing approach. These results support the clinical utility of T-cell-based testing as a sensitive and specific diagnostic for early Lyme disease, particularly in the initial days of illness.","output":"Immunosequencing of the T-cell receptor repertoire reveals signatures specific for diagnosis and characterization of early Lyme disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implementing endovascular stroke care often impedes neurologic assessment in patients who need sedation or general anesthesia. Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) may help physicians monitor cerebral tissue viability, but data in hyperacute stroke patients receiving endovascular treatment are sparse. In this observational study, the NIRS index regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) was measured noninvasively before, during, and after endovascular therapy via bilateral forehead NIRS optodes. During the study period, 63 patients were monitored with NIRS; 43 qualified for analysis. Before recanalization, 10 distinct rSO2 decreases occurred in 11 patients with respect to time to intubation. During recanalization, two kinds of unilateral rSO2 changes occurred in the affected hemisphere: small peaks throughout the treatment (n=14, 32.6%) and sustained increases immediately after recanalization (n=2, 4.7%). Lower area under the curve 10% below baseline was associated with better reperfusion status (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction  2b, P=0.009). At the end of the intervention, lower interhemispheric rSO2 difference predicted death within 90 days (P=0.037).

Here we use home cage activity monitoring to measure the effect of differences in home cage light spectrum and intensity on key circadian activity parameters in mice. Due to the relative positioning of any individually ventilated cage (IVC) with regard to the animal facility lighting, notable differences in light intensity occur across the IVC rack. Although all mice were found to be entrained, significant differences in the timing of activity onset and differences in activity levels were found between mice housed in standard versus red filtering cages. Furthermore, by calculating the effective irradiance based upon the known mouse photopigments, a significant relationship between light intensity and key circadian parameters are shown. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the important role of the circadian photopigment melanopsin in circadian entrainment, melanopic illuminance is shown to correlate more strongly with key circadian activity parameters than photopic lux. Collectively, our results suggest that differences in light intensity may reflect an uncharacterized source of variation in laboratory rodent research, with potential consequences for reproducibility. Room design and layout vary within and between facilities, and caging design and lighting location relative to cage position can be highly variable.

However, few population-wide data studied severity and death in multiracial populations. We aim to examine the current disparity in the COVID-19 continuum, including hospitalizations, severity, and death. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Data on 67,094 laboratory documented COVID-19 cases nested from the state-wide OneFlorida research consortium through August 3, 2020, were assessed to decide differences and disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. A COVID-19 outcome continuum outlining the proportions of cases transitioning from diagnosis to death was constructed (Figure 1). OneFlorida partners provide health care to more than 40% of Floridians in the nations third-largest and very diverse state. OneFlorida partners encompass hospitals, practice/clinic settings, and physicians, which provide care for 15 million patients across all of Floridas 67 counties. It is part of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Among cases, 25,443 (37.9%) were non-Hispanic Whites, 11,709 (17.5%) were non-Hispanic Blacks, and 16,119 (24.0%) were Hispanics. Among COVID-19 patients, Blacks and Hispanics had a higher frequency of emergency department (ED) visits (45.7% and 46.0%, respectively), whereas admission rates were higher in Blacks (15.6%) and Whites (15.9%) than in Hispanics (11.5%). Blacks had the highest rates of intubation (3.6%) and in-hospital deaths (2.7%) compared to Whites (2.5% and 2.3%, respectively) and Hispanics (1.3% and 1.4%, respectively), Figure 1.

METHODS The distribution of proximal femoral marrow on MR imaging of 148 health care workers with recovered SARS including 106 cases treated with varied dosage of steroids and 42 cases without steroid, and 97 age and sex matched health adults as controls were observed. The index of marrow conversion (signal intensity of the femoral neck and intertrochanteric area divided by signal intensity of the greater trochanter multiplied by 100%) was quantitatively measured and compared between SARS patients treated with steroid and without steroid and the normal control group. RESULTS In 106 cases treated with steroid of the 148 health care workers, femoral head osteonecrosis was found in 4 cases, bilateral femoral marrow edema in 2 cases, femoral marrow infarction in 1 case. The index of marrow conversion in the normal controls, in SARS patients treated without and with steroids was (79.4 +/- 6.8)%, (86.9 +/- 7.4)%, (88.6 +/- 5.9)%, respectively. There was significantly statistical difference between groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION In addition to fat conversion in the proximal femoral marrow due to steroid treatment, the infection of SARS itself may promote an excessively conversion of the red marrow to yellow marrow of the femoral neck in SARS patients.","output":"[Investigation of proximal femoral marrow with magnetic resonance imaging in recovered patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of pathogens enables the sources and patterns of transmission to be identified during specific disease outbreaks and promises to transform epidemiological research on communicable diseases.

These include elucidation of the mechanisms of cross species transmission, the potential modes of pathogen transmission, and which people in the population contribute most to transmission. Particular attention is paid to the ability of WGS to resolve individual patient to patient transmission events. Importantly, WGS data seem to be sufficiently discriminatory to target cases linked to community or hospital contacts and hence prevent further spread, and to investigate genetically related cases without a clear epidemiological link. Approaches to combine evidence from epidemiological with genomic sequencing observations are summarised.

METHODS: Retrospectively, two research centers case series of 67 consecutive hospitalized cases including 53 adult and 14 children cases with COVID-19 between 23 Jan 2020 and 15 Feb 2020 from Jinan and Rizhao were enrolled in this study. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children and adults were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Most cases in children were mild (21.4%) and conventional cases (78.6%), with mild clinical signs and symptoms, and all cases were of family clusters. Fever (35.7%) and dry cough (21.4%) were described as clinical manifestations in children cases. Dry cough and phlegm were not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults (p = 0.03). In the early stages of the disease, lymphocyte counts did not significantly decline but neutrophils count did in children compared with adults (p = 0.02). There was a lower level of CRP (p = 0.00) in children compared with adults. There were 8 (57.1%) asymptomatic cases and 6 (42.9%) symptomatic cases among the 14 children cases. The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients (p = 0.03). Even among asymptomatic patients, 5 (62.5%) cases had lung injuries including 3 (60%) cases with bilateral involvement, which was not different compared with that of symptomatic cases (p = 0.58, p = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.","output":"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children compared with adults in Shandong Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its subsequent spread outside of Wuhan, China, led to the human society experiencing a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the development of vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments are ongoing, government authorities in China have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions as primary barriers to curb the spread of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the decline of COVID-19 cases coincided with the implementation of such interventions, we searched for evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of these interventions, since artifactual factors, such as the environment, the pathogen itself, and the phases of epidemic, may also alter the patterns of case development. METHODS: We surveyed common viral respiratory infections that have a similar pattern of transmission, tropism, and clinical manifestation, as COVID-19 under a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the current pandemic season. We then compared this data with historical data from previous seasons without such interventions. RESULTS: Our survey showed that the rates of common respiratory infections, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections, decreased dramatically from 13.7% (95% CI, 10.82-16.58) and 4.64% (95% CI, 2.88-7.64) in previous years to 0.73% (95% CI, 0.02-1.44) and 0.0%, respectively, in the current season.

Participants searched for a letter T on the ground among letter Ls in a large virtual space that was devoid of complex visual cues or landmarks. The T appeared in one target-rich quadrant of the floor space on half of the trials during the training phase. The target-rich quadrant appeared in front of half of the participants and behind the other half. LPL was considerably greater in the former condition than in the latter.

Molecules with known pharmacokinetics and already approved for human use have been demonstrated or predicted to be suitable to be used either directly or as a base for a scaffold-based drug design. Among these substances, quercetin is known to be a potent in vitro inhibitor of 3CLpro, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. However, its low in vivo bioavailability calls for modifications to its molecular structure. In this work, this issue is addressed by using rutin, a natural flavonoid that is the most common glycosylated conjugate of quercetin, as a model. Combining experimental (spectroscopy and calorimetry) and simulation techniques (docking and molecular dynamics simulations), we demonstrate that the sugar adduct does not hamper rutin binding to 3CLpro, and the conjugated compound preserves a high potency (inhibition constant in the low micromolar range, K(i) = 11 M). Although showing a disruption of the pseudo-symmetry in the chemical structure, a larger steric volume and molecular weight, and a higher solubility compared to quercetin, rutin is able to associate in the active site of 3CLpro, interacting with the catalytic dyad (His41/Cys145). The overall results have implications in the drug-design of quercetin analogs, and possibly other antivirals, to target the catalytic site of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.","output":"Rutin Is a Low Micromolar Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease 3CLpro: Implications for Drug Design of Quercetin Analogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 has disrupted many of the preventive service sectors designed to promote infant mental health.

The efficacy of RTS,S against natural infection is low and short-lived, and mapping epitopes of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies may allow for rational improvement of CSP vaccines. Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) was used here to display the junctional epitope (mAb CIS43), Region I (mAb 5D5), NPNAx5, and NPNAx20 epitope of CSP (mAbs 317 and 580). Protection studies in mice revealed that Region I did not elicit protective antibodies, and polyclonal antibodies against the junctional epitope showed equivalent protection to NPNAx5. Combining the junctional and NPNAx5 epitopes reduced immunogenicity and efficacy, and increasing the repeat valency to NPNAx20 did not improve upon NPNAx5.

During this time, a perceived decrease in hospital presentations nationwide was noted. This was also the experience of the Department of General Surgery, Bay of Plenty District Health Board (BOPDHB). We sought to quantify this reduction by analysing the frequency and severity of three common acute general surgical presentations; appendicitis, cholecystitis and diverticulitis. METHODS Data on presentations of patients with appendicitis, cholecystitis and diverticulitis were retrospectively collected for the national lockdown period (25 March 2020-27 April 2020) and the immediate pre-lockdown period (21 February 2020-25 March 2020). Data collected included patient demographics, duration of symptoms, method of diagnosis, treatment, severity of disease, length of stay and complications. RESULTS A reduction of 62.2% was noted in the frequency of appendicitis during the lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period. Patients presented later during lockdown and had a higher complication rate (5.4% versus 42.8%). Similarly, a 39.2% reduction in presentations of cholecystitis during lockdown was found. The lockdown group of patients had a longer length of stay (6.9 versus 4 days) and only one patient (9.1%, 1/11) was managed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the lockdown period, compared to 52.9% of patients (9/17) over the pre-lockdown period. No difference in frequency or severity of acute diverticulitis presentations between the two periods was found. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 lockdown led to fewer presentations, but these were often delayed, with more complications and a longer length of stay.

RESULTS: In total, nine themes were identified as: The prevalence of alcohol problems: a wake-up call; a reminder to intervene immediately; an altered view of the responsibility of the employer; initiating conversations about alcohol: a useful toolbox; an imprecise, yet positive, memory; increased awareness of issues related to alcohol culture; I have not heard a word about a new alcohol policy; the alcohol policy: a mere piece of paper; and alcohol problem prevention: hardly a low-hanging fruit. Participants experiences of the skills training were positive overall. CONCLUSION: Various aspects of the skills training were appreciated by managers and HR-officers, including insight of prevalence statistics and employer responsibilities. Participants emphasized the value of repeated skills training occasions for retaining knowledge. Future research may investigate further in what way skills training may affect managers willingness to engage in workplace alcohol prevention. Since the implementation of any policy had gone unnoticed to participants, a reason for which could be related to the notion of the existing policy as good enough in its current condition, implementation and organizational issues, or a reluctance to address alcohol-related matters unless necessary; future research may focus on investigating in what manner alcohol policies are in fact utilized within organizations.","output":"Swedish Managers and HR-Officers Experiences and Perceptions of Participating in Alcohol Prevention Skills Training: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As global water resources are decreasing and the demand for it is constantly increasing, the problem of proper water management is becoming more pressing. Poland is one of the largest producers of vegetables in Europe, including carrots, with significant exports. However its freshwater resources are relatively small. The paper presents the results of research on the water footprint (WF) life cycle assessment (LCA) in conventional and organic carrot production. The methodology of calculating WF was used in accordance with PN-EN ISO 14046. It was found, e.g., that WF for organic production of carrot (WF = 1.9 m3 ha-1) is over five times lower, as compared to conventional production (WF = 10.4 m3 ha-1). In the case of conventional production, the fertilization process (67.0-67.7%) has the greatest impact on the shaping of WF in the individual impact categories, i.e. Human Health, Ecosystem Quality and resources. In organic production, the WF-shaping factor is carrot harvesting (41.9-43.1%). The research can be used to develop pro-ecological carrot production technologies, as well as to shape sustainable development plans in agricultural areas. It can also be used to outline policy directions regarding foreign trade in water-consuming agricultural products.","output":"Assessing the impact of water use in conventional and organic carrot production in Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may contribute to poor outcomes in adults with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To determine the effect of OSA on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Methods: The current prospective observational study was conducted in three hospitals in Istanbul, Turkey from March 10 to June 22, 2020. The participants were categorized as modified high-risk (mHR), or low-risk (mLR)-OSA according to a modified version of the Berlin questionnaire. Snoring patterns (intensity and/or frequency), breathing pauses and morning/daytime sleepiness, without taking obesity and hypertension into account, were used in the regression models. Results: The primary outcome was clinical improvement defined as a decline of 2 categories from admission on a 7-category ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included worsening (increase of 1 category), need for hospitalization, supplemental oxygen and intensive care. In total, 320 eligible patients were enrolled. According to the modified scoring, 70 (21.9%) had mHR-OSA. Among 242 patients requiring hospitalization, clinical improvement within 2 weeks occurred in 75.4 % of the mHR-OSA group compared to 88.4 % of the modified low-risk (mLR-OSA) group (P = 0.014). In multivariate regression analyses, mHR-OSA (adjusted OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.19-0.92) predicted the delayed clinical improvement. In the entire study population (n=320), mHR-OSA was associated with clinical worsening and need for supplemental oxygen. Snoring patterns, especially louder snoring, were significantly predicted delayed clinical improvement, worsening, need for hospitalization, supplemental oxygen, and intensive care. Conclusions: Adults with mHR-OSA in our Covid-19 cohort had poorer clinical outcomes than those with mLR OSA independent of age, sex and comorbidities.

However, high-resolution manometry (HRM) and EPT require increased equipment costs over conventional systems and evidence demonstrating a significant diagnostic advantage of EPT over CLT is limited. Our aim was to investigate whether the inter-rater agreement and/or accuracy of esophageal motility diagnosis differed between EPT and CLT. METHODS Forty previously completed patient HRM studies were selected for analysis using a customized software program developed to perform blinded independent interpretation in either EPT or CLT (six pressure sensors) format. Six experienced gastroenterologists with a clinical focus in esophageal disease (attendings) and six gastroenterology trainees with minimal manometry experience (fellows) from three academic centers interpreted each of the 40 studies using both EPT and CLT formats. Rater diagnoses were assessed for inter-rater agreement and diagnostic accuracy, both for exact diagnosis and for correct identification of a major esophageal motility disorder. RESULTS The total group agreement was moderate (=0.57; 95% CI: 0.56-0.59) for EPT and fair (=0.32; 0.30-0.33) for CLT. Inter-rater agreement between attendings was good (=0.68; 0.65-0.71) for EPT and moderate (=0.46; 0.43-0.50) for CLT. Inter-rater agreement between fellows was moderate (=0.48; 0.45-0.50) for EPT and poor to fair (=0.20; 0.17-0.24) for CLT. Among all raters, the odds of an incorrect exact esophageal motility diagnosis were 3.3 times higher with CLT assessment than with EPT (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 2.4-4.5; P<0.0001), and the odds of incorrect identification of a major motility disorder were 3.4 times higher with CLT than with EPT (OR: 3.4; 2.4-5.0; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Superior inter-rater agreement and diagnostic accuracy of esophageal motility diagnoses were demonstrated with analysis using EPT over CLT among our selected raters. On the basis of these findings, EPT may be the preferred assessment modality of esophageal motility.","output":"Diagnosis of Esophageal Motility Disorders: Esophageal Pressure Topography vs. Conventional Line Tracing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors recount the challenges they overcame to deliver content and assessments while engaging students at their newly established medical school.","output":"Challenges Faculty Faced Transitioning to e-Learning Platforms during the Current Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are in the midst of a pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Safe and effective vaccines are needed to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Vaccine candidates against COVID-19 have been developed at an unprecedented speed, with more than 200 vaccine candidates currently under investigation. Among those, 20 candidates have entered the clinical Phase 3 to evaluate efficacy, and three have been approved by the European Medicines Agency. The aim of immunization is to act against infection, disease and/or transmission. However, the measurement of vaccine efficacy is challenging, as efficacy trials need to include large cohorts with verum and placebo cohorts. In the future, this will be even more challenging as further vaccine candidates will receive approval, an increasing number of humans will receive vaccinations and incidence might decrease. To evaluate novel and second-generation vaccine candidates, randomized placebo-controlled trials might not be appropriate anymore. Correlates of protection (CoP) could be an important tool to evaluate novel vaccine candidates, but vaccine-induced CoP have not been clearly defined for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

CEUS with bolus delivery via a central venous catheter of 2.4 ml Sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles from the arterial phase (10C15 s) to the late phase of 5 min. Digital storage of cine sequences of the lung sound with abdomen for independent assessment with the subsequently performed contrast-enhanced dual-source CT. RESULTS: In 11 intubated and ventilated patients (arithmetic mean 62 years, 48 to 78 years, 3 women) with confirmed severe COVID-19 infections, a peripherally accentuated consolidation with irregular hyperemia was found in the CEUS and also in the CT examination. Of the 5 cases with pulmonary arterial embolisms, signs of right ventricular failure were found. In all cases, using CEUS low perfused areas of the pleura with adjacent hyperemia could be detected, while, with CT segmental contrast medium, gaps with subpleural compressions were found. Interstitial changes near the pleura led to B-lines and to ground glass opacities in the CT. Near the diaphragm a delayed arterial contrast of the liver was observed.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of 3,77,129 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected during January, 2020 to December, 2020 from all across the world for the presence of D614G and L37F mutations. Out of 3,77,129 SARS-CoV-2 strains analysed, 14, 598 (3.87%) were found to harbour both the D614G and L37F mutations. Majority of these double mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains were identified in Europe (11097) followed by North America (1915), Asia (980), Oceania (242), Africa (219), and South America (145). Geographical root surveillance revealed their first emergence during February-March in all the six continents. Temporal prevalence analysis from February, 2020 to December, 2020 showed a gradual upsurge in their frequencies worldwide, which strongly demonstrated the adaptive selection of these double mutants. Evolutionary analysis depicted that these double mutants emerged as a new clade in the dendrogram (named as A2a/3), and were sub-divided into four distinct clusters (Cluster I, II, III and IV) according to different sets of coexisting mutations.

RESULTS: Reported incidence of RA was 5.98 (0.37) per 10 000 person-years and prevalence was 0.91% (0.014) in 2017. In 71 411 RA patients, long-term DMARD prescribing initially rose post-diagnosis from 41.6% in 1998 to 67.9% in 2009. Corticosteroid prescribing changed little, overall [22.2% in 1998, 19.1% in 2016; incident risk ratio (IRR) 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.03] and across the life course from the first to fifteenth year (22.2% to 16.9%). NSAID prescribing declined from 57.7% in 1998, and significantly so from 2008, to 27.1% in 2016 (IRR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.56). This continued across the life course (41.2% to 28.4%).

As technology advances and wage share increases, less labour is required to achieve the same task, and more job functions move to new areas with lower labour costs. This cascade results in a ladder of economic betterment that is footed in a succession of countries, and has improved standards of living and human flourishing. The recent international crisis precipitated by COVID-19 has underlined the vulnerability of many industries to disruptions in global supply chains. As a response to this, onshoring of functions which had been moved to other nations decreases risk, but would increase labour costs if it were not for automation. Robotics, by facilitating onshoring, risks pulling up the ladder, and suppressing the drivers for economic development.

Overwhelming evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central factor in PD pathophysiology, which impairs energy metabolism. While, several other studies have shown probiotic supplementations to improve host energy metabolism, alleviate the disease progression, prevent gut microbiota dysbiosis and alter commensal bacterial metabolites. But, whether probiotic and/or prebiotic supplementation can affect energy metabolism and cause the impediment of PD progression remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated 8-weeks supplementation effects of probiotic [Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 (AP-32)], residual medium (RM) obtained from the AP-32 culture medium, and combination of AP-32 and RM (A-RM) on unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats. We found that AP-32, RM and A-RM supplementation induced neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons along with improved motor functions in PD rats. These effects were accompanied by significant increases in mitochondrial activities in the brain and muscle, antioxidative enzymes level in serum, and altered SCFAs profile in fecal samples. Importantly, the AP-32 supplement restored muscle mass along with improved motor function in PD rats, and produced the best results among the supplements. Our results demonstrate that probiotic AP-32 and A-RM supplementations can recover energy metabolism via increasing SCFAs producing and mitochondria function. This restoring of mitochondrial function in the brain and muscles with improved energy metabolism might additionally be potentiated by ROS suppression by the elevated generation of antioxidants, and which finally leads to facilitated recovery of 6-OHDA-induced motor deficit. Taken together, this work demonstrates that probiotic AP-32 supplementation could be a potential candidate for alternate treatment strategy to avert PD progression.","output":"Probiotic Supplementation Facilitates Recovery of 6-OHDA-Induced Motor Deficit via Improving Mitochondrial Function and Energy Metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dear Editor, the article by Martora F. et al. on a COVID-19 related atypical form of pityriasis rosea (PR)1 that was recently published in your journal prompted us to make some observations.

The implication that genes encoding the cohesin subunits or cohesin regulators must be tightly controlled and resistant to variability in expression has not yet been formally tested. METHODS: Here, we identify spatial-regulatory connections with potential to regulate expression of cohesin loci (Mitotic: SMC1A, SMC3, STAG1, STAG2, RAD21/RAD21-AS; Meiotic: SMC1B, STAG3, REC8, RAD21L1), cohesin-ring support genes (NIPBL, MAU2, WAPL, PDS5A, PDS5B) and CTCF, including linking their expression to that of other genes. We searched the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalogue for SNPs mapped or attributed to cohesin genes by GWAS (GWAS-attributed) and the GTEx catalogue for SNPs mapped to cohesin genes by cis-regulatory variants in one or more of 44 tissues across the human body (expression quantitative trail locus-attributed). RESULTS: Connections that centre on the cohesin ring subunits provide evidence of coordinated regulation that has little tolerance for perturbation. We used the CoDeS3D SNP-gene attribution methodology to identify transcriptional changes across a set of genes coregulated with the cohesin loci that include biological pathways such as extracellular matrix production and proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Remarkably, many of the genes that are coregulated with cohesin loci are themselves intolerant to loss-of-function. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of robust regulation of cohesin genes and implicate novel pathways that may be important in the human cohesinopathy disorders.","output":"Low tolerance for transcriptional variation at cohesin genes is accompanied by functional links to disease-relevant pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dynatrol USA www dynatrolusa com Turbidity Sensor Requires Minimal Maintenance The Triton TR82 turbidity analyzer is an intelligent plug-and-play optical sensor that provides accurate, dependable water quality measurement Fluorine content analysis in solid samples is a requirement in a variety of industries for quality control, environmental monitoring, and remediation In particular, the analyzer is useful for measuring the concentration of fluorine in polymer processing additives (PPA) - a critical parameter that plastic manufacturers measure to prepare polymer masterbatches and ensure final product quality ABB Group www abb com Skid-Mounted Reverse Osmosis System Purifies Water The SIRION Pro is a skidmounted reverse osmosis (RO) system that can be integrated into standardized treatment lines to purify industrial water","output":"New Products"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains one of the top public health issues of global concern.

METHODS: Fasting venous whole blood and lipid levels along with body composition measurements were obtained from young, healthy, endurance-trained NCAA Division III student-athletes and untrained individuals. Assays (ELISA) were conducted to analyze fasting plasma (CRP, IL-6, and TNF) and isolated lymphocyte NF-B activation (lymphocytes were isolated from whole blood samples through differential centrifugation and Ficoll-Paque). A Spearmans rank order correlation coefficient was used for associations between variables and a regression analysis was performed to determine which measurement accounted for the inflammation in this young and apparently healthy population. RESULTS: While the inflammatory markers were not associated with each other, CRP levels were associated with body composition and following regression analyses, body fat percentage (P>0.05) was a significant factor for elevated CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic physical exercise eliciting lower body fat percentages in young adults may have a positive protective impact through anti-inflammatory status, minimizing disease risk in a young population.

Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in acute respiratory distress syndrome has increased. Occasionally, both are used. We hypothesized that methylprednisolone could improve lung compliance and ease weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients in our veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation unit treated with methylprednisolone over a 20 month period. Methylprednisolone was initiated for inability to wean off veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was calculated at cannulation, methylprednisolone initiation, and decannulation. Demographics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-specific data, and ventilator data were collected. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for differences in dynamic compliance. RESULTS: A total of 12 veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients received methylprednisolone. Mean age was 50 (15) years. Seven had influenza. Methylprednisolone was started on median Day 16 (interquartile range: 11-22) of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In total, 10 patients had veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation on median Day 12 (7-22) after methylprednisolone initiation. Two patients died before decannulation. The 10 decannulated patients had initial median dynamic compliance (mL  cm H2O-1) of 12 (7-23), then 16 (10-24) at methylprednisolone initiation, and then 44 (34-60) at decannulation. Dynamic compliance was higher at decannulation than methylprednisolone initiation (p = 0.002), and unchanged from cannulation to methylprednisolone initiation for all patients (p = 0.97). A total of 10 patients had significant infections. None had significant gastrointestinal bleed or wound healing issues. CONCLUSION: Methylprednisolone may be associated with improved compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome allowing for decannulation from veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. High rates of infection are associated with methylprednisolone use in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Further studies are required to identify appropriate patient selection for methylprednisolone use in patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","output":"Methylprednisolone may be associated with improved lung compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim/Background: The present study was aimed at investigating the public perceptions about extended services by community pharmacists in Jouf region of Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic.

And the global feature fusion module, including the channel attention module, the self-attention module, and the fusion operation, is designed to enhance the important features of the MR image. Moreover, the spectral normalization process is introduced to make the discriminator network stable. 40 sets of 3D magnetic resonance images (each set of images contains 256 slices) are used to train the network, and 10 sets of images are used to test the proposed method.

Though there has been advent of improvements in medical sciences and novel technological innovations therein, yet the reach of the same to the masses is questionable. Statistics indicate that there has been an increase in the people falling at a higher age bracket, all throughout the world. In India, the rural population embracing almost 6,40,000 villages have an unfortunate tale to narrate with more than 11% having no admittance to any sort of healthcare facilities. With the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent need for far reaching screening to contain the same, there are new challenges of outreach constraints in densely populated countries like India. What further poses grave concern is the rural urban divide in the availability of healthcare amenities. All this calls for a progressive transformation and integration of medical sciences with information technology. The divide can be lessened with the aid of telehealth monitoring systems using IOT. In countries like India, where there is little access to doctors and medical infrastructure, such system would be an apt solution for interaction between the patients and the medical practitioners. Most of the villages in India are deprived of even rudimentary Public Health Centers, thus making it difficult for the resident villagers to receive even preliminary treatment. The telehealth monitoring system comes to rescue in such apathetic situations where it facilitates monitoring and measuring the physical vitals like pulse, levels of oxygen in the blood, rate of breath, glucose levels, temperature, lung capacity, ECG, and so on.

This study aimed to report clinical characteristics of 15 consecutive cases of COVID-19-associated mania or hypomania seen in three general hospitals in Qatar in the early months of the pandemic in 2020. Methods: This study is a retrospective case-note review of 15 cases of COVID-19-associated mania or hypomania (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction test), seen as inpatient consultations out of the first 100 consecutive patients managed by consultation-liaison psychiatric teams in Qatar between 2 March 2020 and 7 July 2020. Results: The mean age of the 15 patients was 40 years. Twelve patients had mania, and three had hypomania. Regarding the physical severity of COVID-19, 10 patients were asymptomatic, two had upper respiratory tract symptoms alone and three had pneumonia. None of the patients were intubated. Potential risk factors for mania/hypomania included pandemic-related psychosocial stress before admission (n = 9), past history of mania/bipolar disorder (n = 6) or psychosis (n = 2), raised inflammatory markers (n = 7) and steroid use (n = 3). None had a history of recent substance misuse. Other than one patient with advanced cancer, none had comorbidity regarded as likely to have caused mania or hypomania. Three patients had mild white matter ischaemic changes on brain imaging. Standard pharmacological treatment for mania (i.e. antipsychotic medication supplemented by prn benzodiazepines) was effective. Ten patients were discharged home from the COVID-19 facility where they presented, but five required transfer to Qatar's psychiatric hospital for further treatment of mania. Conclusion: The association of mania or hypomania with COVID-19 may be spurious (e.g. representing an initial presentation of bipolar disorder) or causal. The reported cases illustrate a range of potential aetiological mechanisms by which COVID-19 could cause mania or hypomania.

METHODS: A cross\\\\sectional study was conducted between March 23 and May 1, 2020, utilising a self\\\\administered web\\\\based questionnaire to examine a sample of medical doctors (n = 270) working at different healthcare institutions in Jordan. Likert scale was used to code the data and generate means and percentages. RESULTS: The most practiced on\\\\duty precautionary measures were cleaning hands with water and disinfectant for more than 20 seconds (47.4%), followed by proper hygiene before and during meals (38.9%). The most practiced off\\\\duty measures were taking off clothes before entering the residential place (65.9%) and prohibiting visitors (58.1%). Overall, the mean work protection percentage score was 73.8% (range: 28%\\\\100%), while the mean home safety percentage score was 71.3% (range: 25%\\\\100%). Work protection score was positively correlated with the home safety score. Female doctors were found to be more precautious at home than males. Doctors with chronic illness(es) were found to be less precautious than their healthier counterparts. Participants who isolated themselves expressed the highest level of home safety practice. Doctors who reported to smoke were found more precautious at home and doctors who preferred to work during lockdowns were more precautious at the workplace.

Ventilation has been widely recognized as an efficient engineering control measure for airborne transmission. Room ventilation with an increased supply of clean outdoor air could dilute the expiratory airborne aerosols to a lower concentration level. However, sufficient increase is beyond the capacity of most of the existing mechanical ventilation systems that were designed to be energy efficient under non-pandemic conditions. We propose an improved control strategy based on source control, which would be achieved by implementing intermittent breaks in room occupancy, specifically that all occupants should leave the room periodically and the room occupancy time should be reduced as much as possible. Under the assumption of good mixing of clean outdoor supply air with room air, the evolution of the concentration in the room of aerosols exhaled by infected person(s) is predicted. The risk of airborne cross-infection is then evaluated by calculating the time-averaged intake fraction. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated for a case study of a typical classroom. This strategy, together with other control measures such as continuous supply of maximum clean air, distancing, face-to-back layout of workstations and reducing activities that increase aerosol generation (e.g., loudly talking and singing), is applicable in classrooms, offices, meeting rooms, conference rooms, etc.","output":"Intermittent occupancy combined with ventilation: An efficient strategy for the reduction of airborne transmission indoors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We will review clinical impacts and explore overlapping symptoms and neurobiological functional domains.

OBJECTIVE This study aims to examine students' users' attitudes and experiences and clinical facilitators' perspectives on student performances in the clinical setting post-virtual patient training. DESIGN A descriptive qualitative study design was used. SETTING Nursing faculty at a local university in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS 24 nursing undergraduates and six clinical facilitators. METHODS This study is a follow-up of an experimental study on the Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence (VCAAI). The study took place from the academic year 2017/2018 ended in November 2019. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted. All interviews and focus group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS Two overarching themes (students' virtual patient user experience and clinical facilitators' evaluations of students' clinical communication skills) comprising six themes were generated. Themes under students' user experience included: 1) attitudes toward virtual patient training, 2) virtual patient's role in student development, and 3) enhanced features and implementation suggestions. Themes under clinical facilitators' evaluations included: 1) insights on students' communication skills and 2) approaches to improve communication skills. An overlapping theme titled 'value of technology in teaching communication' comprised of mutual feedback from both students and clinical facilitators. Early implementation, continued accessibility, enhancing realism and technological improvements to the VCAAI were listed as key areas for program improvement, while increased situational sensitivity and language training are recommended to further enhance students' communication skills. CONCLUSION The mixed attitudes toward virtual patient interactions and recognitions of the benefits of virtual patient simulations suggest the potential effectiveness of the use of virtual patients in teaching effective nursing communication skills. However, the lack of authenticity and other limitations need to be addressed before official implementations of such trainings with virtual patients to undergraduate nursing curricula.","output":"Communication skills training using virtual reality: A descriptive qualitative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although bats are natural reservoirs of many pathogens, few studies have been conducted on the genetic variation and detection of selection in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. These genes are critical for resistance and susceptibility to diseases, and hostCpathogen interactions are major determinants of their extensive polymorphism. Here we examined spatial patterns of diversity of the expressed MHC class II DRB gene of three sympatric Neotropical bats, Carollia perspicillata and Desmodus rotundus (Phyllostomidae), and Molossus molossus (Molossidae), all of which use the same environments (e.g., forests, edge habitats, urban areas). Comparison with neutral marker (mtDNA D-loop) diversity was performed at the same time. RESULTS: Twenty-three DRB alleles were identified in 19 C. perspicillata, 30 alleles in 35 D. rotundus and 20 alleles in 28 M. molossus. The occurrence of multiple DRB loci was found for the two Phyllostomidae species. The DRB polymorphism was high in all sampling sites and different signatures of positive selection were detected depending on the environment. The patterns of DRB diversity were similar to those of neutral markers for C. perspicillata and M. molossus. In contrast, these patterns were different for D. rotundus for which a geographical structure was highlighted. A heterozygote advantage was also identified for this species. No recombination or gene conversion event was found and phylogenetic relationships showed a trans-species mode of evolution in the Phyllostomids. CONCLUSIONS: This study of MHC diversity demonstrated the strength of the environment and contrasting pathogen pressures in shaping DRB diversity. Differences between positively selected sites identified in bat species highlighted the potential role of gut microbiota in shaping immune responses. Furthermore, multiple geographic origins and/or population admixtures observed in C. perspicillata and M. molossus populations acted as an additional force in shaping DRB diversity. In contrast, DRB diversity of D. rotundus was shaped by environment rather than demographic history.

Herein, we introduce, a new sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor based on Thionine(Th)-redox immobilized f-MWCNT(f-carboxylic functionalized)+PEDOT.PSS modified glassy carbon/screen-printed electrode (GCE/f-MWCNT+PEDOT@Th) for quick (20 min), low-sample volume (1 L) and low concentration (10-9 g/mL) analysis of HSA. The GCE/f-MWCNT+PEDOT@Th showed a highly stable and fouling-free surface-confined redox feature at an apparent standard electrode potential, Eo=-0.25 V vs Ag/AgCl with a surface-excess value, Th=1410-9 mol cm-2. A sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was prepared by sequential immobilization of 1 L respective solutions without any linking agent on the chemically modified electrode followed by incubation at 37C for 35 min and testing its bioelectrocatalytic H2O2 (500 M) reduction reaction in pH 7 PBS. Interrelated solution phased and experimental conditions were systematically optimized. Under an optimal working condition, the as-prepared bioelectrode, CME-Ab1p-SkM-HSA-Ab1m-Ab2HRP showed a reliable calibration plot of HSA in a concentration window, 10-910-4 g/mL. The obtained calibration plot was parallel to the ELISA of HSA in a limited concentration window, 10-710-4 g/mL. As a proof of concept, electrochemical immunosensing of urinary HSA has been demonstrated.

One approach to rapid testing is to leverage the volatile organic compound (VOC) signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Detection dogs, a biological sensor of VOCs, were utilized to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 positive urine and saliva patient samples had a unique odor signature. The virus was inactivated in all training samples with either detergent or heat treatment. Using detergent-inactivated urine samples, dogs were initially trained to find samples collected from hospitalized patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, while ignoring samples collected from controls. Dogs were then tested on their ability to spontaneously recognize heat-treated urine samples as well as heat-treated saliva from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Dogs successfully discriminated between infected and uninfected urine samples, regardless of the inactivation protocol, as well as heat-treated saliva samples. Generalization to novel samples was limited, particularly after intensive training with a restricted sample set. A unique odor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection present in human urine as well as saliva, provides impetus for the development of odor-based screening, either by electronic, chemical, or biological sensing methods. The use of dogs for screening in an operational setting will require training with a large number of novel SARS-CoV-2 positive and confirmed negative samples.","output":"Discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 infected patient samples by detection dogs: A proof of concept study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic showing no signs of abating, resuming neglected tropical disease (NTD) activities, particularly mass drug administration (MDA), is vital.

We investigated if and how the fear of COVID-19 had impacted visiting green areas and consequently the quality of life. Methods: The assessments were taken through a questionnaire-based survey of the university students living inside the campus in two universities (Konkuk and Sejong universities) in Seoul, South Korea in 2021 (n=255). Measuring three variables, the participants were asked to self-estimate their fear of COVID-19 and quality of life during the pandemic, and the time and frequency of the park visit. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to explore the potential relationship between the three main observed variables. Results: In the case of the campus students, visiting the green area cannot play a mediating impact on the effect of the COVID-19 fear and quality of life. Likewise, the data did not support the effect of COVID-19 fear on the quality of life for this group of students, however, significant correlations were found between the COVID-19fear and visiting green spaces (P<0.05) (positive effect on visiting, and negative effect on the time of visit). Conclusion: Students perceived not a considerable improvement in their quality of life after visiting green areas. It might be due to the fear of staying outdoor for a long time (frequency) during the pandemic, and students lifestyles.

Therefore, the genetic diversity and structure of Guadua aff. chaparensis and Guadua aff. lynnclarkiae were evaluated with the use of microsatellite molecular markers (SSR). It was verified that the average genetic diversity for the populations studied was considered high ( H ^ e =0.5) compared to other species of bamboo. All populations had rare and private alleles, and none of them presented significant values of inbreeding. The populations were divergent ( G ^ ST = 0.46), resulting in a low apparent gene flow. The Bayesian analysis showed that among the 350 individuals analyzed, five groups (K=5) were formed, with little similarity among the groups (Populations), although two of them presented clonal individuals. According to the results obtained, it can be conclude that populations should be treated as having unique characteristics, mainly when accessed for management and for in situ and ex situ conservation studies.","output":"Genetic structure and diversity of native Guadua species (Poaceae: Bambusoideae) in natural populations of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ubiquitinCproteasome system is responsible for the degradation of proteins and plays a critical role in key cellular processes. While the constitutive proteasome (cPS) is expressed in all eukaryotic cells, the immunoproteasome (iPS) is primarily induced during disease processes, and its inhibition is beneficial in the treatment of cancer, autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Oxathiazolones were reported to selectively inhibit iPS over cPS, and the inhibitory activity of several oxathiazolones against iPS was experimentally determined. However, the detailed mechanism of the chemical reaction leading to irreversible iPS inhibition and the key selectivity drivers are unknown, and separate characterization of the noncovalent and covalent inhibition steps is not available for several compounds. Here, we investigate the chemical reaction between oxathiazolones and the Thr1 residue of iPS by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to establish a plausible reaction mechanism and to determine the rate-determining step of covalent complex formation. The modelled binding mode and reaction mechanism are in line with the selective inhibition of iPS versus cPS by oxathiazolones. The k(inact) value of several ligands was estimated by constructing the potential of mean force of the rate-determining step by QM/MM simulations coupled with umbrella sampling. The equilibrium constant K(i) of the noncovalent complex formation was evaluated by classical force field-based thermodynamic integration. The calculated K(i) and k(inact) values made it possible to analyse the contribution of the noncovalent and covalent steps to the overall inhibitory activity. Compounds with similar intrinsic reactivities exhibit varying selectivities for iPS versus cPS owing to subtle differences in the binding modes that slightly affect K(i), the noncovalent affinity, and importantly alter k(inact), the covalent reactivity of the bound compounds. A detailed understanding of the inhibitory mechanism of oxathiazolones is useful in designing iPS selective inhibitors with improved drug-like properties.","output":"Mechanistic and thermodynamic characterization of oxathiazolones as potent and selective covalent immunoproteasome inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Coronavirus has crossed the geographical borders of various countries without any restrictions.

Results: There were 21,638 infected, 7,913 recovered and 2,299 death cases with COVID-19 in Iran during the study period. By March 22, CF shows that, most cases are attributed to Tehran province, while ACF shows that most are attributed to Semnan province. There was a positive significant correlation between CF of the infected cases and province population sizes (r=0.45), HDI (r=0.58);province population density (r=0.47);a negative significant correlation between the CF of the infected cases and distance from original epicenter (r=-0.47). KMCA results based on CF showed very high level of outbreak was in Tehran while KMCA based on ACF showed very high level of outbreak were in Semnan and Qom provinces. Conclusions: Special attention is needed for the provinces nearer to the original epicenter which are high risk spots in terms of the severe prevalence of COVID-19.

Here, we analyzed whether these lectins differ in their mode of ligand engagement. LSECtin and DC-SIGNR, which we found to be co-expressed by liver, lymph node and bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial cells, bound to soluble Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) with comparable affinities. Similarly, LSECtin, DC-SIGN and the Langerhans cell-specific lectin Langerin readily bound to soluble human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) GP. However, only DC-SIGN captured HIV-1 particles, indicating that binding to soluble GP is not necessarily predictive of binding to virion-associated GP. Capture of EBOV-GP by LSECtin triggered ligand internalization, suggesting that LSECtin like DC-SIGN might function as an antigen uptake receptor. However, the intracellular fate of lectinCligand complexes might differ. Thus, exposure to low-pH medium, which mimics the acidic luminal environment in endosomes/lysosomes, released ligand bound to DC-SIGN/R but had no effect on LSECtin interactions with ligand.

The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

A qualitative study design involving the critical incident technique through an online survey was applied. Sociodemographic data and open-ended responses were collected. While participants' characteristics were analyzed through descriptive statistics, qualitative data were thematically analyzed employing the framework method. 149 GPs responded to the survey and 99 participants completed the survey (dropout rate = 33%). Eight themes emerged indicating factors related to the organization of the healthcare system and factors related to the clinical management of patients, that were perceived as impacting on the GPs' care provision. The analysis revealed difficulties in communicating with other local services. This, together with the lack of coordination among services, was reported as a major challenge. Primary care was perceived as having been undervalued and criticalities in the organization of GP courses, led in a bureaucratic fashion, posed at risk some trainees to be infected. The digital technologies adopted for remote patient consultations were seen as useful tools for daily practice helping the GPs to stay emotionally connected with their patients. Besides, the improvement in the GP-patient relationship in terms of solidarity between patients and doctors and compliance to rules, had a positive impact. Moreover, many respondents addressed the importance of professional collaboration and teamwork, in terms of both support in practical issues (to find PPE, diagnostics and guidelines) and emotional support. At the same time, the lack of resources (e.g., PPE, swabs) and of specific guidelines and protocols impacted on the care provision. Our findings suggest that GPs in Italy are at risk of being left behind within the epidemic management.

METHODS: A descriptive study of a qualitative designusing focus group discussionswas conducted after one year of establishing DRCs in 5 pilot large hospitals. The number of participants in each focus group ranged from 8 to10, and the total number of participants was 45 HCPs (nurses and doctors). Questions were consecutively asked in each focus group. The moderator asked the main questions from the guide and then used probing as needed. A second researcher observed the conversation and took field notes. RESULTS: Overall, there was an agreement among the majority of DRC members across all hospitals that the DRC was successful in identifying the exact cause of neonatal deaths and stillbirths as well as associated modifiable factors. There was also a consensus that the DRC contributed to an improvement in health services provided for pregnant women and newborns as well as protecting human rights and enabling women to be more interdependent in taking decisions related to family planning.

Here, we investigated the mechanisms of action of RC-106, a novel pan-SR modulator, to characterize therapeutically exploitable role of SRs in tumors. Two PC cell lines were used in all the experiments. Terminal UPR activation was evaluated by quantifying BiP, ATF4 and CHOP by Real-Time qRT-PCR, Western Blot, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Cell death was studied by flow cytometry. Post-transcriptional gene silencing was performed to study the interactions between SRs and UPR key proteins. RC-106 activated ER stress sensors in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It also induced ROS production accordingly with ATF4 upregulation at the same time reducing cell viability of both cell lines tested. Moreover, RC-106 exerted its effect through the induction of the terminal UPR, as shown by the activation of some of the main transducers of this pathway. Post-transcriptional silencing studies confirmed the connection between SRs and these key proteins. Overall, our data highlighted a key role of SRs in the activation of the terminal UPR pathway, thus indicating pan-SR ligands as candidates for targeting the UPR in pancreatic cancer.","output":"Pan-Sigma Receptor Modulator RC-106 Induces Terminal Unfolded Protein Response In In Vitro Pancreatic Cancer Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to provide insight into the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) on breast cancer screening, breast surgery, and genetics consultations. METHODS: User data from a risk assessment company were collected from February 2 to April 11, 2020. The use of risk assessment was used as a proxy for the use of 3 breast cancer services, namely, breast imaging, breast surgery, and genetics consultation. Changes in the use of these services during the study period were analyzed. RESULTS: All 3 services experienced significant declines after the COVID\\\\19 outbreak. The decline in breast surgery began during the week of March 8, followed by breast imaging and genetics consultation (both of which began during the week of March 15). Breast imaging experienced the most significant reduction, with an average weekly decline of 61.7% and a maximum decline of 94.6%. Breast surgery demonstrated an average weekly decline of 20.5%. When surgical consultation was stratified as breast cancer versus no breast cancer, the decrease among in nonCbreast cancer patients was more significant than that of patients with breast cancer (a decline of 66.8% vs 11.5% from the pre\\\\COVID average weekly volume for nonCbreast cancer patients and patients with breast cancer, respectively).

Because of the COVID-19 lockdown of the cities in China, sources of the particulate matter including gasoline burning vehicles, dust producing building sites, coal-fired factories, almost all stopped working since the end of January 2020. It was not until early April that outdoor activities recovered. Ten cities were selected as the observation sites in the period from 12/19/2019 to 04/30/2020, covering the periods of the pre-closure, the closure and the gradual resumption. 11720 groups of data were obtained and four indicators were applied to assess the characteristics of the particle pollution in the period. The quality of the atmospheric environment was visually influenced by human activities in the four months. The PM10 concentrations decreased slightly in February and March, and then began to increase gradually after April with the gradual recovery of production. The concentrations of PM2.5 reduced greatly in most regions especially in northern cities, during the closure and maintained a relatively stable level in the following three months. The trends of PM10 and PM2.5 indicated that the reduced human activities during the COVID-19 lockdown made the concentrations of the particulate matter in the air decreased, and the difference between the PM10 and PM2.5 trends might be due to the different sources of the two particles and their different aerodynamics. However, during the closure, the pollution of the particulate matter in the cities still remained at a high level, which indicated that some ignored factors except the outdoor production activities, automobile exhaust and sites' dust might have been contributing much to the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, and the traceability of the particulate matter should be paid further attention in environmental management.

We describe the development of an educational curriculum and quality improvement program to support continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) performed primarily by non-nephrology providers in Sri Lanka. METHODS We developed a program of education, outcome tracking, and expert consultation to support providers in Kandy, Sri Lanka. Education included videos and in-person didactics covering core topics in CAPD. Event-tracking sheets recorded root causes and management of infections and hospitalizations. Conferences reviewed clinical cases and overall clinic management. We evaluated the patient census, peritonitis rates, and root causes and management of infections over 1 year. RESULTS The curriculum was published through the International Society of Nephrology online academy. High provider turnover limited curriculum assessments. The CAPD patient census rose from 63 to 116 during the year. The peritonitis rate declined significantly, from 0.8 episodes per patient-year in the first 6 months to 0.4 in the latter 6 months, though the most common root causes of peritonitis, related to contamination events and hygiene, persisted. The appropriate ascertainment of culture data and prescription of antibiotics also increased. CONCLUSIONS Our project supported the expansion of a CAPD program in a resource-limited setting, while also improving peritonitis outcomes.

However, the relationship between abdominal obesity and CXR severity score is not fully explored. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association of different adiposity indexes, including waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), with CXR severity score in 215 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results: Patients with abdominal obesity had significantly higher CXR severity scores (Figure 1A) and higher rates of these scores than those without abdominal obesity (P&lt;0.001;P=0.001, respectively) while there were no significant differences between BMI classes (P=0.104;P=0.271, respectively) (Figure 1B). Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio correlated more closely with CXR severity score than BMI (r=0.43, P&lt;0.001;r=0.41, P&lt;0.001;r=0.17, P=0.012, respectively). The AUCs for waist circumference and WHtR were significantly higher than those for BMI for distinguishing a high CXR severity score (8) (0.68 [0.60-0.75] and 0.67 [0.60-0.74] vs 0.58 [0.51-0.66], P=0.001) (Figure 2).

Additional analyses focused on the reduction in working capacity after vaccination and the influence of the time of day when vaccines were administered. METHODS: We conducted a survey on COVID-19 vaccinations and eventual reactions among 73,000 employees of 89 hospitals of the Helios Group. On May 19th, 2021 all employees received an email, inviting all employees who received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 to participate using an attached link. Additionally, the invitation was posted in the groups intranet page. Participation was voluntary and non-traceable. The survey was closed on June 21st, 2021. RESULTS: 8375 participants reported on 16,727 vaccinations. Reactogenicity was reported after 74.6% of COVID-19 vaccinations. After 23.0% vaccinations the capacity to work was affected. ChAdOx induced impairing reactogenicity mainly after the prime vaccination (70.5%), while mRNA-1273 led to more pronounced reactions after the second dose (71.6%). Heterologous prime-booster vaccinations with ChAdOx followed by either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 were associated with the highest risk for impairment (81.4%). Multivariable analyses identified the factors older age, male gender and vaccine BNT162b as independently associated with lower odds ratio for both, impairing reactogenicity and incapacity to work. In the comparison of vaccine schedules, the heterologous combination ChAdOx + BNT162b or mRNA-1273 was associated with the highest and the homologue prime-booster vaccination with BNT162b with the lowest odds ratios. The time of vaccination had no significant influence. CONCLUSIONS: Around 75% of the COVID-19 vaccinations led to reactogenicity and nearly 25% of them led to one or more days of work loss. Major risk factors were female gender, younger age and the administration of a vaccine other than BNT162b2. When vaccinating a large part of a workforce against COVID-19, especially in professions with a higher proportion of young and women such as health care, employers and employees must be prepared for a noticeable amount of absenteeism. Assuming vaccine effectiveness to be equivalent across the vaccine combinations, to minimize reactogenicity, employees at risk should receive a homologous prime-booster immunisation with BNT162b2.

Here, we report that induced mild pulmonary morbidities rendered SARS-CoV-2-refractive CD-1 mice susceptible to this virus. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infection after application of low doses of the acute lung injury stimulants bleomycin or ricin caused severe disease in CD-1 mice, manifested by sustained body weight loss and mortality rates greater than 50%. Further studies revealed markedly higher levels of viral RNA in the lungs, heart, and serum of low-dose ricin-pretreated mice compared with non-pretreated mice. Furthermore, lung extracts prepared 2-3 days after viral infection contained subgenomic mRNA and virus particles capable of replication only when derived from the pretreated mice. The deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection were effectively alleviated by passive transfer of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies generated against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Thus, viral cell entry in the sensitized mice seems to depend on viral RBD binding, albeit by a mechanism other than the canonical ACE2-mediated uptake route. This unique mode of viral entry, observed over a mildly injured tissue background, may contribute to the exacerbation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathologies in patients with preexisting morbidities.","output":"Mice with induced pulmonary morbidities display severe lung inflammation and mortality following exposure to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While poor mental health and psychiatric disorders attributed to stressful work conditions are a public health concern in many countries, the health consequences of the occupational stress experienced by school principals is an understudied issue. Although current data is lacking, some research suggests that principals have a stressful work situation that eventually may lead to burnout and exhaustion disorder, thus negatively affecting the ability of principals to function as leaders. To gauge the situation in Sweden, and as a basis for future preventive actions, we examined to what extent principals displayed signs of exhaustion and whether the prevalence rates of exhaustion differed across school levels, length of work experience as a principal, and gender. METHODS: Principals (N = 2219; mean age 49 years [SD 7 years]; 78% women) working at least 50% in pre-schools, compulsory schools, upper secondary schools or adult education completed a cross-sectional web survey entailing two validated inventories: The Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale (KEDS) and the Lund University Checklist for Incipient Exhaustion (LUCIE). Data was analysed using traditional non-parametric methods. Gender stratification achieved covariate balance when analysing school level and length of work experience. RESULTS: Altogether, 29.0% of the principals met the exhaustion criteria in KEDS. The prevalence rates for the four LUCIE-steps of increasing signs of exhaustion were: no signs of stress, 48.8%; weak signs of stress, 25.6%; clear signs of stress but no exhaustion, 15.4%; possible exhaustion disorder, 10.2%. Compared with male principals, female principals reported more signs of possible exhaustion disorder in both LUCIE and KEDS. School level was not associated with reports of exhaustion symptoms in neither LUCIE nor KEDS. Among male principals, length of work experience was associated with exhaustion symptoms in KEDS. CONCLUSIONS: A large group of Swedish principals working in pre-schools, compulsory schools, upper secondary schools or adult education displayed a symptomatology of signs of exhaustion that if sustained might lead to poor health. This observation suggests that education authorities, or other relevant stakeholders, ought to take some form of preventive action. However, effective combinations of individual, group, organisational, and/or societal preventive activities remain to be identified and tested.","output":"Prevalence of exhaustion symptoms and associations with school level, length of work experience and gender: a nationwide cross-sectional study of Swedish principals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a major toll on the health and state of our global population. With tough decisions for allocating resources(i.e. vaccines) and attention toward particular areas are being made, forecasting through machine learning has become more important than ever. Moreover, as vaccines are being brought to the public and cases are going down, it is time that we reflect on where the pandemic has taken the most toll: in order for us to make future reform. This research illustrates different models and algorithms for COVID-19 forecasting: Auto Regressive models and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs). The results show the true potential of RNNs to work with sequential and time-series data to forecast future cases and deaths in different states. As the paper utilizes the tanh activation function and multiple LSTM layers, the research will show the importance of machine learning and its ability to help politicians make decisions when it comes to helping states during the pandemic and future reform. The data will also pre-process the time-series data using rolling statistics and will clean the data for the auto-regressive model and RNN layers to be applied. Thus, we show that along with Recurrent Neural Network layers, activation functions also play a crucial role in the accuracy of the forecast.

Whether these differences in care exist in the universal healthcare system in United Kingdom is unknown. METHODS: Patients admitted with a diagnosis of AMI and OHCA between 2010 and 2017 from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) were studied. All patients were stratified based on ethnicity into a Black, Asian, or minority ethnicity (BAME) group vs a White group. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the predictors of clinical outcomes and treatment strategy. RESULTS: From 14,287 patients admitted with AMI complicated by OHCA, BAME patients constituted a minority of patients (1185 [8.3%]), compared with a White group (13,102 [91.7%]). BAME patients were younger (median age [interquartile range]) for BAME group, 58 [50-70] years; for White group, 65 [55-74] years). Cardiogenic shock (BAME group, 33%; White group, 20.7%; P < 0.001) and severe left ventricular impairment (BAME group, 21%; White group, 16.5%; P < 0.003) were more frequent among BAME patients. BAME patients were more likely to be seen by a cardiologist (BAME group, 95.9%; White group, 92.5%; P < 0.001) and were more likely to receive coronary angiography than the White group (odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.88). The BAME group had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52) and re-infarction (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.06-2.18) than the White group.

METHODS A scoping review was conducted. A systematic search for articles published in 2000-2021 was performed in CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus; further, relevant journals and grey literature websites were hand searched. Key search terms included 'telemedicine', 'telehealth' and 'nursing homes'. RESULTS Twenty-six articles were included. A narrative synthesis of evidence was conducted. The review identified four themes: (1) Presence of multidisciplinary care, (2) perceived usefulness of telemedicine, (3) perceived ease of use and (4) expanded role of nursing home staff. The presence of multidisciplinary care providers provided a wide range of telemedicine services to residents and promoted interprofessional collaboration between acute and long-term care. Telemedicine was perceived to increase timely onsite management by remote specialists, which enabled care quality improvement. However, technical problems associated with equipment usage reduced the ease of use of telemedicine. Concerns emerged from the expanded role of nursing home staff, which could negatively affect clinical decision-making and create medico-legal risks. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Telemedicine is valuable in distance-based care, especially in the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic, for supporting continuity of care to nursing home residents.

Our objective is to assess whether and why the pandemic crisis affected food waste level. Unlike previous studies that addressed the issue at a consumer level, our research focuses on pre-consumption waste covering stages of the agrifood supply chain from input suppliers to retailers. Considering the importance of waste reduction for the sustainability of food production, the study provides an insight into the ability of the agrifood supply chain to cope with a major shock and its resilience. A multinomial logit regression model is used to estimate the effect of Covid-19, testing whether the ability to innovate, the role in the supply chain, the magnitude of the shock and policy support were drivers of changes in food waste. We find that three main factors affect the change in a firms food-waste level during the Covid-19 pandemic: The magnitude of the disruption of the sale channel, the firms ability to adapt the business model to the new pandemic environment, and the adoption of public policies mitigating the lockdown effects. The first driver was associated with an increase in food waste, while the others were associated with a decrease.","output":"Covid-19 Pandemic and Food Waste: An Empirical Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the relationship between social activities and frailty during the restriction on outings due to COVID-19.

In teaching, standardized patients (SPs) are increasingly being used to present conversation situations with students and provide feedback afterwards. In order to maintain this teaching concept under pandemic conditions, a digital model was developed that should offer both high security and high authenticity. Methodology: A total of 176 teaching units of 45 minutes each were conducted digitally from May to August 2020. During the teaching units, medical students conducted interviews with SPs portraying various patients. The online conference software HeiConf was used for this purpose. During the teaching units, a total of 354 students were able to practice conversation techniques such as NURSE and SPIKES. After the teaching units, feedback was provided by students and SPs. Results: The digital lessons about medical conversation with SPs received positive feedback from SPs and students. The authenticity of the role portrayal of SPs seemed to be unaffected by the new format. Students were successful in training and observing conversation techniques. However, aspects of non-verbal communication, atmosphere and group dynamics as well as further discussions could not be carried out to the same extent as in the usual classroom teaching. Conclusion: The conversion of SP-based teaching to a digital format was successful in a short period of time and was able to prevent a cancellation of teaching units about medical conversation. Concrete conversation techniques could be tried out digitally by students. Due to the deficits of digital teaching in terms of non-verbal communication and atmosphere, a blended-learning format is planned for the future. In the first instance, concrete conversation techniques will be learned online in order to focus more on profound aspects of communication and discussions in a later physical teaching unit with SPs, thus enabling a learning experience that is as authentic as possible.","output":"Authentic SP-based teaching in spite of COVID-19 C is that possible?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One contemporary issue is how environmental pollution and climate can affect the dissemination and severity of COVID-19 in humans. We documented the first case of association between particulate matter 2.5 m (PM(2.5)) and COVID-19 mortality rates that involved rural and medium-sized municipalities in northwestern Mexico, where direct air quality monitoring is absent. Alternatively, anthropogenic PM(2.5) emissions were used to estimate the PM(2.5) exposure in each municipality using two scenarios: 1) considering the fraction derived from combustion of vehicle fuel; and 2) the one derived from modeled anthropogenic sources. This study provides insights to better understand and face future pandemics by examining the relation between PM(2.5) pollution and COVID-19 mortality considering the population density and the wind speed. The main findings are: (i) municipalities with high PM(2.5) emissions and high population density have a higher COVID-19 mortality rate; (ii) the exceptionally high COVID-19 mortality rates of the rural municipalities could be associated to dust events, which are common in these regions where soils without vegetation are dominant; and (iii) the influence of wind speed on COVID-19 mortality rate was evidenced only in municipalities with <100 inhabitants per km(2). These results confirm the suggestion that high levels of air pollutants associated with high population density and an elevated frequency of dust events may promote an extended prevalence and severity of viral particles in the polluted air of urban, suburban, and rural communities. This supports an additional means of dissemination of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, in addition to the direct human-to-human transmission.","output":"The link between COVID-19 mortality and PM(2.5) emissions in rural and medium-size municipalities considering population density, dust events, and wind speed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has arguably impacted every dimension of social living  be that employment, schooling, healthcare or recreational activities.

As such, our research focuses on outlining the factors that determine if an individual is less likely to take this pandemic seriously (i.e. is taking fewer measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19). We have analyzed the results of a U.S. wide COVID-impact survey using random forest classification (RFC) to associate individual demographic factors to measures taken against the pandemic such as washing/sanitizing hands. Our results indicate that the top three influential factors are household size, the number of adults living in one household and the health of the respondent (poor to excellent).

Although in many cases the infection causes very weak symptoms, it can be severe in patient with diverse chronical diseases and immunological compromising patients. Pregnancy is a unique condition in which mother and fetus peacefully collaborate. Diverse endocrine-immune mechanisms, mostly under progesterone control work together to protect the fetus from maternal immunocompetent cell activation driven rejection. The physiological shift to Th2 dominant environment, while favourable for fetus, it makes mothers susceptible to infective pathogens, making pregnancy during COVID-19 pandemic challenging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies involving COVID-19 in pregnancy and those analysing changes of immune system induced by COVID-19 were searched in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect. Databases were searched using a keyword COVID-19/coronavirus, that was combined with following terms: immune system, pregnancy, oestrogen, or progesterone. Search included studies published up to 01.07.2020. Almost 1,500 articles were found, but only 18 met criteria.

A diverse range of nosocomial pathogens have been found on lanyards, but there are very few studies describing how to successfully disinfect lanyards to break the chain of transmission. Recently, a steam disinfector-dryer device has come on the market, which performs rapid disinfection against nosocomial pathogens and also dries the contents of the device. It was the aim of this study to evaluate steam disinfection-drying as a method to eliminate pathogens from lanyards. METHODS Thirty-eight strips of new, unused, and autoclaved polyester neck lanyards (4  2 cm) were inoculated with 30 (12 Gram-positive + 18 Gram-negative) bacteria and one yeast organism. The inoculated lanyard fabric (five organisms per lanyard strip) was placed into a steam disinfector-dryer device and disinfected for 5 minutes and dried for 30 minutes, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Following disinfection and drying, the presence of viable organisms on lanyard fabric was evaluated using enhanced microbiological broth culture methods for 48 hours. Control lanyard strips were treated with organisms and left at room temperature without undergoing disinfection and drying procedures. FINDINGS Steam disinfection-drying eradicated all test organisms from treated lanyards, with no culturable organisms detected following disinfection-drying, even when employing enhanced bacteriological culture conditions. All test organisms remained viable on the control lanyards. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE Steam disinfection-drying offers a simple method of decontaminating lanyards, producing dry lanyards for immediate reuse.

RESULTS: 2368 patients underwent open heart surgery from June 2020 until July 2021 in our centre. Of these, 0.5% (12 patients) were identified as Covid positive pre-operatively. Mean age of patients were 59.1  14.8 years old. Mean Ejection Fraction was 46.4  12.9. Most patients (75%) were asymptomatic with covid infection and only one patient were admitted to hospital for Covid infection. Mean duration from Covid PCR positive swab to surgery were 46.3  32.7days. Most of the patients (66.7%) underwent operation on an emergency or urgent basis. Median time to extubation was 1 day. Median ICU length of stay was 1 day. 25% patients required non-invasive ventilation post-operatively and one patient was discharged home on long term oxygen therapy. There were 2 deaths- none of which were covid related mortality. CONCLUSION: Cardiac surgery could be performed safely in patients with pre-operative Covid-19 infection after a period of recovery, especially in the asymptomatic to mild category of infection. Multi-disciplinary team approach may be useful in deciding the timing of surgery for complex cases.","output":"Outcome of adult cardiac surgery following COVID-19 infection in unvaccinated population in a national tertiary centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In vivo serial passage of non-pathogenic viruses has been shown to lead to increased viral virulence, and although the precise mechanism(s) are not clear, it is known that both host and viral factors are associated with increased pathogenicity. Under- or overnutrition leads to a decreased or dysregulated immune response and can increase viral mutant spectrum diversity and virulence. The objective of this study was to identify the role of viral mutant spectra dynamics and host immunocompetence in the development of pathogenicity during in vivo passage. Because the nutritional status of the host has been shown to affect the development of viral virulence, the diet of animal model reflected two extremes of diets which exist in the global population, malnutrition and obesity. Sendai virus was serially passaged in groups of mice with differing nutritional status followed by transmission of the passaged virus to a second host species, guinea pigs. Viral population dynamics were characterized using deep sequence analysis and computational modeling. Histopathology, viral titer and cytokine assays were used to characterize viral virulence. Viral virulence increased with passage and the virulent phenotype persisted upon passage to a second host species. Additionally, nutritional status of mice during passage influenced the phenotype. Sequencing revealed the presence of several non-synonymous changes in the consensus sequence associated with passage, a majority of which occurred in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and polymerase genes, as well as the presence of persistent high frequency variants in the viral population. In particular, an N1124D change in the consensus sequences of the polymerase gene was detected by passage 10 in a majority of the animals. In vivo comparison of an 1124D plaque isolate to a clone with 1124N genotype indicated that 1124D was associated with increased virulence.","output":"Sendai virus intra-host population dynamics and host immunocompetence influence viral virulence during in vivo passage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent discovery of novel alphacoronaviruses (alpha-CoVs) in European and Asian rodents revealed that rodent coronaviruses (CoVs) sampled worldwide formed a discrete phylogenetic group within this genus. To determine the evolutionary history of rodent CoVs in more detail, particularly the relative frequencies of virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission, we recovered longer fragments of CoV genomes from previously discovered European rodent alpha-CoVs using a combination of PCR and high-throughput sequencing. Accordingly, the full genome sequence was retrieved from the UK rat coronavirus, along with partial genome sequences from the UK field vole and Poland-resident bank vole CoVs, and a short conserved ORF1b fragment from the French rabbit CoV. Genome and phylogenetic analysis showed that despite their diverse geographic origins, all rodent alpha-CoVs formed a single monophyletic group and shared similar features, such as the same gene constellations, a recombinant beta-CoV spike gene, and similar core transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). These data suggest that all rodent alpha CoVs sampled so far originate from a single common ancestor, and that there has likely been a long-term association between alpha CoVs and rodents. Despite this likely antiquity, the phylogenetic pattern of the alpha-CoVs was also suggestive of relatively frequent host-jumping among the different rodent species.","output":"Shared Common Ancestry of Rodent Alphacoronaviruses Sampled Globally"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study aims to determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and its sociodemographic correlates.

Angiotensin 2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and atherogenic molecule converted by ACE2 to reducing inflammation and vasodilating in action angiotensin (1-7). Angiotensin (1-9), that is a product of angiotensin 1 metabolism and precursor of angiotensin (1-7), also exerts cell protective properties.

ACE2, unlike ACE, is not inhibited by ACE inhibitors at the doses used in humans during the treatment of arterial hypertension. Membrane ACE2 is one of the receptors that allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. ACE2 after SARS-CoV-2 binding is internalized and degraded. Hence ACE2 activity on the cell surface is reduced leading to increase the concentration of angiotensin 2 and decrease the concentration of angiotensin (1-7).

Using RNA-seq to profile a series of human prostate cancer specimens laser capture microdissected on the basis of MYC immunohistochemistry, MYC activity, and MEIS1 expression were inversely correlated. Knockdown of MYC expression in prostate cancer cells increased the expression of MEIS1 and increased the occupancy of MYC at the MEIS1 locus.

Patients with myeloma, leukemia, or insufficient data were excluded. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), and prognostic index (PI) were evaluated for their prognostic potential, with the NLR, PLR, and PNI risk stratifications dichotomized around median values and the pre-established risk categorizations from literature utilized for the mGPS and PI. 1,071 eligible patients were randomly assorted into a training set (TS, n=529) and validation set (VS, n=542) matched for age (67.913.3 TS, 68.513.5 VS), presence of 1 comorbidity (52.1% TS, 49.8% VS), development of 1 Covid-19 complication (27% TS, 25.9% VS), and active malignancy at Covid-19 diagnosis (66.7% TS, 61.6% VS). Among all 1,071 patients, deceased patients tended to categorize into poor risk groups for the NLR, PNI, mGPS, and PI (P<0.0001) with a return to pre-Covid-19 diagnosis NLR, PNI, and mGPS categorizations following recovery (P<0.01). In the TS, higher mortality rates were associated with NLR>6 (44.6% vs 28%, P<0.0001), PNI<40 (46.6% vs 20.9%, P<0.0001), mGPS (50.6% for mGPS2 vs 30.4% and 11.4% for mGPS1 and 0, P<0.0001), and PI (50% for PI2 vs 40% for PI1 and 9.1% for PI0, P<0.0001).

Enrichment is often achieved by leukocyte depletion of infected blood prior to storage. However, leukocyte depletion is difficult in low-resource settings and limits analysis to prospectively-collected samples. As a result, approaches such as selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) are being used to enrich for parasite DNA. However, sWGA has had limited success in generating reliable sequencing data from low parasitaemia samples. In this study, enzymatic digestion with MspJI prior to sWGA and whole genome sequencing was evaluated to determine whether this approach improved genome coverage compared to sWGA alone. The potential of sWGA to cause amplification bias in polyclonal infections was also examined. METHODS: DNA extracted from laboratory-created dried blood spots was treated with a modification-dependent restriction endonuclease, MspJI, and filtered via vacuum filtration. Samples were then selectively amplified using a previously reported sWGA protocol and subjected to WGS. Genome coverage statistics were compared between the optimized sWGA approach and the previously reported sWGA approach performed in parallel. Differential amplification by sWGA was assessed by comparing WGS data generated from lab-created mixtures of parasite isolates, from the same geographical region, generated with or without sWGA. RESULTS: MspJI digestion did not enrich for parasite DNA. Samples that underwent vacuum filtration (without MspJI digestion) prior to sWGA had the highest parasite DNA concentration and displayed greater genome coverage compared to MspJI + sWGA and sWGA alone, particularly for low parasitaemia samples. The optimized sWGA (filtration + sWGA) approach was successfully used to generate WGS data from 218 non-leukocyte depleted field samples from Malawi. Sequences from lab-created mixtures of parasites did not show evidence of differential amplification of parasite strains compared to directly sequenced samples. CONCLUSION: This optimized sWGA approach is a reliable method to obtain WGS data from non-leukocyte depleted, low parasitaemia samples. The absence of amplification bias in data generated from mixtures of isolates from the same geographic region suggests that this approach can be appropriately used for molecular epidemiological studies.","output":"Optimization of parasite DNA enrichment approaches to generate whole genome sequencing data for Plasmodium falciparum from low parasitaemia samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability of newly developed preservative-free (PF) latanoprost generic [TJO-002] and compare it with benzalkonium chloride (BAK)-preserved latanoprost [Xalatan?] in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT).

The core strength of neural networks is the ability to render accurate predictions for a bewildering variety of data. Residual modulation is recognised as the most advanced reversible steganographic algorithm for digital images and the pivot of which is the predictive module. The function of this module is to predict pixel intensity given some pixel-wise contextual information. This task can be perceived as a low-level vision problem and hence neural networks for addressing a similar class of problems can be deployed. On top of the prior art, this paper analyses the predictive uncertainty and endows the predictive module with the option to abstain when encountering a high level of uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis can be formulated as a pixel-level binary classification problem and tackled by both supervised and unsupervised learning. In contrast to handcrafted statistical analytics, learning-based analytics can learn to follow some general statistical principles and simultaneously adapt to a specific predictor. Experimental results show that steganographic performance can be remarkably improved by adaptively filtering out the unpredictable regions with the learning-based uncertainty analysers.","output":"Less is More: Reversible Steganography with Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Analytics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persons living with dementia (PLWD) are at increased risk for COVID-19 and associated poor outcomes, including: incident delirium, hospitalization, severe symptoms, intensive care admission, and even death. PLWD are likely to rely on family caregivers to maintain their health and well-being in the community. Under normal circumstances, caregiving can be stressful and complex, and the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to change and exacerbate the stresses of family caregiving. As a part of a larger study using descriptive qualitative methodology to explore the family caregiver understanding and experiences related to delirium in caring for a person with dementia, 14 participants (age x? =67, SD= 13.8) were asked about the impact of COVID-19 on their caregiving for PLWD. Thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews using Dedoose generated four overarching themes associated with the family caregivers perspective of changes in caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) Cautious of COVID-19 exposure, 2) We cant go in, 3) Feeling of isolation for both the PLWD and caregiver, and 4) Six-feet distance. The current study highlights the importance of understanding the needs of PLWD during a pandemic based upon the perspective of their family caregivers and will inform the development of ways to safely incorporate family caregivers in the interdisciplinary care team. Caregivers are integral to the care of PLWD across settings of care and should be partners even during a pandemic. Solutions for care include integrating technology for individualized approaches.

However, the evaluation of certain genes that participate in the metabolism and transport of these drugs has not been fully explored. A lack of response to treatment and a lower survival have been observed that may be due to the presence of the ABCB1 drug resistance gene. Our research group analyzed whether the expression levels of the ABCB1 gene are associated with comorbidities, treatments, overall survival and risk of death in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: The expression levels of the ABCB1 gene were analyzed by RT-qPCR in 61 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The association between the levels of expression, the risk variables and different treatments were determined by the Chi-Square test and the Fishers exact test. Global Survival (GS) was determined by the KaplanCMeier method. The impact of high levels of expression and the risk of death was performed by odds ratio. RESULTS: The different risk variables showed that patients with either high or absent levels of ABCB1 gene expression presented a greater risk of death (OR 3.08, 95%, CI 1.02C9.26) as well as need for ventilatory support (OR 2.8, 95%, CI 0.98 ?8.5).

Electronic logbooks are increasingly applied in low-resource settings, but there is limited research on their quality. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of an app-based surgical e-logbook system shortly after its implementation in a low-income country and to identify potential areas of improvement for the system. METHODS: Entries in the e-logbook system were cross-checked with hospital records and categorized as matched or overreported. Moreover, the hospital records were checked for underreported procedures. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with users of the e-logbook system. RESULTS: A total of 278 e-logbook database entries and 379 procedures in the hospital records from 14 users were analyzed. Matches were found in the hospital records for 67.3% of the database entries. Moreover, 32.7% of the database entries were overreported and 50.7% of the procedures in the hospital records were underreported. A previous study of an analog surgical logbook system in the same setting estimated that 73.1% of the entries were matches or close matches. Interviews with 12 e-logbook users found overall satisfaction but also identified potential areas of improvement, including the need for more training in the use of the system, modifications to improve user-friendliness, and better access to the necessary technology. CONCLUSIONS: A reliable documentation system is necessary to evaluate the quality of health workforce training. The early evaluation of a surgical e-logbook system in a low-income country showed that the collected data should be approached with caution. The quantitative analysis suggests that the e-logbook system needs to be improved in terms of accuracy. In interviews, users reported that digitalization of the logbook system was a much-needed innovation but also identified important areas of improvement. Recognition of these aspects at an early stage facilitates guidance and adjustment of further implementation and might improve the accuracy of the system.

OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to assess if tranexamic acid is safe, reduces haematoma expansion and improves outcomes in adults with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). DESIGN The TICH-2 (Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary IntraCerebral Haemorrhage) study was a pragmatic, Phase III, prospective, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial. SETTING Acute stroke services at 124 hospitals in 12 countries (Denmark, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK). PARTICIPANTS Adult patients (aged  18 years) with ICH within 8 hours of onset. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Exclusion criteria were ICH secondary to anticoagulation, thrombolysis, trauma or a known underlying structural abnormality; patients for whom tranexamic acid was thought to be contraindicated; prestroke dependence (i.e. patients with a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score > 4); life expectancy < 3 months; and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of < 5. INTERVENTIONS Participants, allocated by randomisation, received 1 g of an intravenous tranexamic acid bolus followed by an 8-hour 1-g infusion or matching placebo (i.e. 0.9% saline). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The primary outcome was functional status (death or dependency) at day 90, which was measured by the shift in the mRS score, using ordinal logistic regression, with adjustment for stratification and minimisation criteria. RESULTS A total of 2325 participants (tranexamic acid, n = 1161; placebo, n = 1164) were recruited from 124 hospitals in 12 countries between 2013 and 2017. Treatment groups were well balanced at baseline. The primary outcome was determined for 2307 participants (tranexamic acid, n = 1152; placebo, n = 1155). There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary outcome of functional status at day 90 [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.03; p = 0.11]. Although there were fewer deaths by day 7 in the tranexamic acid group (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99; p = 0.041), there was no difference in case fatality at 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10; p = 0.37). Fewer patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) after treatment with tranexamic acid than with placebo by days 2 (p = 0.027), 7 (p = 0.020) and 90 (p = 0.039). There was no increase in thromboembolic events or seizures. LIMITATIONS Despite attempts to enrol patients rapidly, the majority of participants were enrolled and treated > 4.5 hours after stroke onset. Pragmatic inclusion criteria led to a heterogeneous population of participants, some of whom had very large strokes. Although 12 countries enrolled participants, the majority (82.1%) were from the UK. CONCLUSIONS Tranexamic acid did not affect a patient's functional status at 90 days after ICH, despite there being significant modest reductions in early death (by 7 days), haematoma expansion and SAEs, which is consistent with an antifibrinolytic effect. Tranexamic acid was safe, with no increase in thromboembolic events.

As a consequence, other strands of conservative thinking are being marginalised. The article concludes by suggesting that the British hard right may have hubristically overinterpreted the Brexit result and recent Conservative Party electoral successes in 2019 and 2021, and this has led to a narrowing of the British conservative mind.","output":"A Narrowing of the British Conservative Mind?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 7th Birt-Hogg-Dub (BHD) International Symposium convened virtually in October 2021.

A historical analytical perspective is impractical due to the lack of reliable climatic data for the earlier Games and the evolution of a myriad of factors that impinge on competitive performance at elite level. Nevertheless, the endurance running events, particularly the marathon, are considered in detail with respect to exposure to environmental forces. Heat, humidity, air pollution, altitude and the geographical features of the race course are considered selectively and dealt with in order of chronology and global climatic zones. We focus on diverse climate zones and particular environmental conditions in order to scrutinize their likely influences on competitive performance, especially in the Olympic marathon races. Notwithstanding the limitations of a narrative approach, performances are related to particular weather data and mitigating influences. Travel difficulties are addressed where these affected a majority of competitors. Environmental stress was associated with the ill-timing and poor organization of the earlier Games. While many of these detrimental and injurious features have been alleviated since then, other environmental stress factors are less prone to mitigation and thus remain a sometimes severe challenge to endurance races. The unique environment conditions for outdoor endurance races in temperate climate zones tend to be highly variable and therefore difficult to predict.","output":"Environmental factors in the summer Olympics in historical perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged researchers and policy makers to identify public safety measures forpreventing the collapse of healthcare systems and reducingdeaths.

Federal and state legislation was analyzed to summarize the strategies implemented in Brazil. Social distancing measures adopted by the population appear effective, particularly when implemented in conjunction with the isolation of cases and quarantining of contacts. Therefore, social distancing measures, and social protection policies to guarantee the sustainability of these measures, should be implemented. To control COVID-19 in Brazil, it is also crucial that epidemiological monitoring is strengthened at all three levels of the Brazilian National Health System (SUS).

With no vaccine available, the public is advised to practice non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) including social distancing, mask-wearing, and washing hands. However, little is known about public perceptions of the effectiveness of these measures, and high perceived effectiveness is likely to be critical in order to achieve widespread adoption of NPI. METHODS: In May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among U.S. adults (N = 3,474). The primary outcome was a six-item measure assessing perceived effectiveness of recommended behaviors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 (not at all effective) to 5 (extremely effective). The sample was divided into \\"higher\\" and \\"lower\\" perceived effectiveness groups. Covariates included demographics, healthcare characteristics, and health beliefs. Variables that were significant at p<0.01 in bivariate analyses were entered into a multivariable logistic regression and a best-fit model was created using a cutoff of p<0.01 to stay in the model. RESULTS: Mean age was 45.5 years and most participants were non-Hispanic White (63%) and female (52.4%). The high perceived effectiveness group was slightly larger than the low perceived effectiveness group (52.7% vs. 47.3%). Almost all health belief variables were significant in the best-fit regression model. COVID-19-related worry (aOR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.64-2.02), and perceived threat to physical health (aOR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.20-1.45) were positively associated with perceived effectiveness while perceived severity of COVID-19 (0.84; 95% CI = 0.73-0.96) and perceived likelihood of infection (0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) switched directions in the adjusted model and were negatively associated with perceived effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: This research indicates people generally believe NPI are effective, but there was variability based on health beliefs and there are mixed rates of engagement in these behaviors. Public health efforts should focus on increasing perceived severity and threat of SARS-CoV-2-related disease, while promoting NPI as effective in reducing threat.","output":"Public perceptions of the effectiveness of recommended non-pharmaceutical intervention behaviors to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No vaccine against the hepatitis E virus (HEV) is currently licensed in Europe. In contrast, HEV-239 (Hecolin?, Xiamen Innovax Biotech Co., Xiamen, China), a vaccine against HEV genotype 4, has been available in China for 10 years. Challenges for the development of vaccines arise mainly from the differences between the genotypes with regard to distribution, transmission routes and risk groups. Other obstacles include the envelopment of HEV in blood by host membranes, replication in various organs outside the liver and weaker immune responses in vulnerable groups. This article reviews the current status of vaccines against HEV that are available and in advanced preclinical evaluation, with a focus on vaccine development strategies. Challenges and limitations are described. Current vaccine candidates focus on protein-based immunisation with the aim of inducing protective, neutralising antibody responses. The goal of the HEV-239 pivotal trial with more than 100,000 study participants was to prevent acute symptomatic infections. However, it is unclear to what extent asymptomatic infections were prevented by the vaccine and whether it is effective enough in patients at risk for a complicated course, such as patients with liver cirrhosis, immunosuppressed individuals and pregnant women. Efficient in vitro models are increasingly enabling the development of monoclonal neutralising antibodies for passive immunisation or therapy. Future vaccines should demonstrate clear protection against all genotypes in addition to a very good safety profile.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Academic university hospital-based infertility clinic. PATIENT(S): Five hundred thirty-nine female patients with infertility who presented for their initial visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Demographic characteristics, infertility history, insurance coverage, desired treatment outcome, acceptability of multifetal reduction, and knowledge of the risks of multifetal pregnancies were assessed using a previously published 41-question survey. Univariate analysis was performed to assess patient factors associated with the desire for multiple births. Independent factors associated with this desire were subsequently assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULT(S): Nearly a third of women preferred multiples over a singleton gestation. Nulliparity, lower annual household income, older maternal age, marital status, larger ideal family size, openness to multifetal reduction, and lack of knowledge of the maternal/fetal risks of twin pregnancies were associated with pregnancy desire. Older age (OR (95% CI) 1.66 (1.20C2.29)), nulliparity (OR (95% CI) 0.34 (0.20C0.58)), larger ideal family size (OR (95% CI) 2.34 (1.73C3.14)), and lesser knowledge of multifetal pregnancy risk (OR (95% CI) 0.67 (0.55C0.83)) were independently associated with desire. CONCLUSION(S): A large number of patients undergoing fertility treatment desire multifetal gestation. Although a lack of understanding of the risks associated with higher order pregnancies contributes to this desire, additional individual specific variables also contribute to this trend. Efforts to reduce the incidence of multiples should focus not only on patient education on comparative risks of multiples vs singleton pregnancies but also account for individual specific reservations.","output":"The parent trap: desire for multifetal gestation among patients treated for infertility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 poses the greatest challenge for the entire world since the Second World War. Governments are forced to define strict measures to avoid the spreading of the virus, which may further impose psychological burden for the majority of the population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychological distress in Austria during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: From 25 March to 3 April 2020, an anonymous online survey was conducted. Target group included all members of the Austrian population older than 16 years. The survey addressed the following areas (1) and sociodemographic data, (2) physical and mental health; (3) knowledge and concerns about COVID-19; (4) contact with infected people; (5) prevention efforts; (6) need for further information. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used to assess mental health. Analyses were based on 4126 individuals (74% female, age: M = 38.68, SD = 13.36). RESULTS: 43.3% rated the psychological impact as moderate (5.6%) or severe (37.7%). 26.5% reported moderate (13.3%) to severe (13.2%) depression; 20.3% moderate (8.9%) to severe (11.4%) anxiety and 21.2% reported to suffer from moderate (10.5%) or severe stress (10.7%). Being female, higher age, lower levels of education, concern about family members, internet as main source of information, student or pupil status, poor self-rated health, and downplaying the seriousness of the problem were significantly associated with higher psychological burden. Protective factors were the possibility to work in home office, frequent (indirect) contact with family or friends, the availability of virus-specific information, confidence in the diagnosis capability, and physical activity during the crisis. CONCLUSION: This study is among the first in Europe on the psychological correlates of the COVID-19 pandemic. 37.7% of the Austrian study population reported a severe psychological impact on the event and 1 in 10 is considered to suffer from severe depression, anxiety or stress. The present findings inform about the identification of protective factors, psychologically vulnerable groups and may guide the development of psychological interventions.","output":"Psychological correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in the Austrian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The disruption of health services due coronavirus disease (COVID) is expected to dramatically alter cancer care; however, the implications for care quality and outcomes remain poorly understood. We undertook a scoping review to evaluate what is known in the literature about how cancer treatment has been modified as a result of the COVID pandemic in patients receiving treatment for solid tumours, and what domains of quality of care are most impacted. METHODS: Citations were retrieved from MEDLINE and EMBASE (1 Jan 2019 to 28 Oct 2020), utilizing search terms grouped by key concept (oncology, treatment, treatment modifications and COVID). Articles were excluded if they dealt exclusively with management of COVID-positive patients, modifications to cancer screening, diagnosis or supportive care, or were not in English. Articles reporting on guidelines, consensus statements, recommendations, literature reviews, simulations or predictive models, or opinions in the absence of accompanying information on experience with treatment modifications in practice were excluded. Treatment modifications derived from the literature were stratified by modality (surgery, systemic therapy and radiotherapy) and thematically grouped. To understand what areas of quality were most impacted, modifications were mapped against the Institute of Medicines quality domains. Where reported, barriers and facilitators were abstracted and thematically grouped to understand drivers of treatment modifications. Findings were synthesized into a logic model to conceptualize the inter-relationships between different modifications, as well as their downstream impacts on outcomes. RESULTS: In the 87 retained articles, reductions in outpatients visits (26.4%), and delays/deferrals were commonly reported across all treatment modalities (surgery: 50%; systemic therapy: 55.8%; radiotherapy: 56.7%); as were reductions in surgical capacity (57.1%), alternate systemic regimens with longer treatment intervals or use of oral agents (19.2%), and the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens (40.0%). Delivery of effective, timely and equitable care were the quality domains found to be most impacted. The most commonly reported facilitator of maintaining cancer care delivery levels was the shift to virtual models of care (62.1%), while patient-initiated deferrals and cancellations (34.8%), often due to fear of contracting COVID (60.9%), was a commonly reported barrier. CONCLUSIONS: As it will take a considerable amount of time for the cancer system to resume capacity and adjust models of care in response to the pandemic, these treatment delays and modifications will likely be prolonged, and will negatively impact quality of care and patient outcomes.","output":"Impact of the Early Phase of the COVID Pandemic on Cancer Treatment Delivery and the Quality of Cancer Care: A Scoping Review and Conceptual Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Family caregivers of people with mental disorders face a number of burdens and stressors, such as associative stigma and burnout.

It was first launched in 2012 as the BCI 601, with a newer internal part (BCI 602) released in 2019. With the new size and shape, the BCI 602 can be used in patients previously excluded due to insufficient anatomical conditions, especially in patients with congenital defects of the outer and middle ear. Objectives: the purpose of this study is to evaluate the objective and subjective benefits of the new Bonebridge BCI 602 in children who have hearing impairment due to conductive or mixed hearing loss. Safety and effectiveness of the device was assessed. Methods: the study group included 22 children aged 8C18 years (mean age 14.7 years) who had either conductive or mixed hearing loss. All patients were implanted unilaterally with the new Bonebridge BCI 602 implant. Pure tone audiometry, speech recognition tests (in quiet and noise), and free-field audiometry were performed before and after implantation. Word recognition scores were evaluated using the Demenko and Pruszewicz Polish Monosyllabic Word Test, and speech reception thresholds in noise were assessed using the Polish Sentence Matrix Test. The subjective assessment of benefits was carried outusing the APHAB (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit) questionnaire. Results: after implantation of the Bonebridge BCI 602 all patients showed a statistically significant improvement in hearing and speech understanding. The mean word recognition score (WRS) changed from 12.1% before implantation to 87.3% after 6 months. Mean speech reception threshold (SRT) before implantation was +4.79 dB SNR and improved to ?1.29 dB SNR after 6 months. All patients showed stable postoperative results. The APHAB questionnaire showed that difficulties in hearing decreased after implantation, with a statistically significant improvement in global score. Pre-operative scores (M = 35.7) were significantly worse than post-operative scores at 6 months (M = 25.7). Conclusions: the present study confirms that the Bonebridge BCI 602 is an innovative and effective solution, especially for patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss due to anatomical ear defects. The Bonebridge BCI 602 system provides valuable and stable audiological and surgical benefits. Subjective assessment also confirms the effectiveness of the BCI 602.

Children are not spared from infection nor complications of COVID-19, and the recent recommendation for boosters in individuals ages 12 years or older calls for broader understanding of the adolescent immune profile after mRNA vaccination. We tested the durability and cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serologic responses over a six-month time course in vaccinated adolescents against the SARS-CoV-2 D614G ('wild type';) and Omicron antigens. Serum from 77 adolescents showed that anti-Spike antibodies wane significantly over six months. After completion of a two-vaccine series, cross-reactivity against Omicron-specific receptor-binding domain (RBD) was seen. Functional humoral activation against wild type and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 also declines over time in vaccinated adolescent children. Evidence of waning mRNA-induced vaccine immunity underscores vulnerabilities in long-term pediatric protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, while cross-reactivity highlights the additional benefits of vaccination.

Clinicians and public health experts should be aware of emerging infectious causes of encephalitis, mechanisms by which they are transmitted, and clinical manifestations of disease. RECENT FINDINGS A number of arthropod-borne viral infections -- transmitted chiefly by mosquitoes and ticks -- have emerged in recent years to cause outbreaks of encephalitis. Examples include Powassan virus in North America, Chikungunya virus in Central and South America, and tick-borne encephalitis virus in Europe. Many of these viruses exhibit complex life cycles and can infect multiple host animals in addition to humans. Factors thought to influence emergence of these diseases, including changes in climate and land use, are also believed to underlie the emergence of the rickettsial bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, now recognized as a major causative agent of acute encephalitis syndrome in South Asia. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of bats as carriers of viruses. Recent studies have begun to uncover mechanisms by which the immune systems of bats are poised to allow for viral tolerance. Several bat-borne infections, including Nipah virus and Ebola virus, have resulted in recent outbreaks of encephalitis.

Evidence-based systematic evaluation of data on hypertension and dyslipidemia is critical for effective patient-centric management to reduce the overall risk of CVDs in Egypt. This semi-systematic review aimed to quantify and identify data gaps in the prevalence and distribution of patient journey touchpoints including awareness, screening, diagnosis, treatment, adherence, and control of hypertension and dyslipidemia to provide the basis for research prioritization, practice guidance, and health care reforms in Egypt. MAIN BODY: Structured search was conducted on MEDLINE and Embase to identify articles published in English between January 2010 and December 2019 that reported key patient journey touchpoints in hypertension and dyslipidemia management. Unstructured search was conducted on public or government websites with no date restriction. Data from all sources were extracted and presented descriptively. In total, 22 studies published between 1995 and 2020 on hypertension and dyslipidemia were included in the final analyses. The prevalence of hypertension in Egypt ranged from 12.1 to 59%. Studies reported awareness (37.5% and 43.9%), diagnosis (42% and 64.7%), treatment (24% and 54.1%), and adherence to antihypertensive medication (51.9%) to be low. Furthermore, the percentage of patients who had their blood pressure controlled ranged from 8 to 53.2%. The prevalence of dyslipidemia varied in the general population (range 19.2C36.8%) but was higher in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (50.9% and 52.5%) and coronary artery disease (58.7%). A national report indicated that 8.6% of the general population was screened for dyslipidemia; however, no data was available on the diagnosis and treatment rates. Among ACS patients, 73.9% were treated for dyslipidemia. Data indicated low levels of medication adherence (59%) among dyslipidemia patients, with overall low control rates ranging from 5.1 to 34.4% depending on CVD risk in populations including ACS patients. CONCLUSION: Data on patient journey touchpoints of hypertension and dyslipidemia are limited in Egypt, indicating the need for more systematic and high-quality evidence-based studies covering different aspects of patient-centric management for better management of CVD and its risk factors.

COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading out in China and all over the world. The virus causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has been known to be genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but distinct from it. Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can be characterized by mild upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection involving non-life threatening pneumonia, and life-threatening pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome. It affects all age groups, including newborns, to the elders. Particularly, pregnant women may be more susceptible to COVID-19 since pregnant women, in general, are vulnerable to respiratory infection. In pregnant women with COVID-19, there is no evidence for vertical transmission of the virus, but an increased prevalence of preterm deliveries has been noticed. The COVID-19 may alter immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface, and affect the well-being of mothers and infants. In this review, we focused on the reason why pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19 and the potential maternal and fetal complications from an immunological viewpoint.","output":"Why are pregnant women susceptible to COVID-19?

However, how non-enveloped viruses hijack cell machinery to promote non-lytic release in EVs, and their functional roles, remain to be clarified. Here we used Bluetongue virus (BTV) as a model of a non-enveloped arthropod-borne virus and observed that the majority of viruses are released in EVs, both in vitro and in the blood of infected animals. Based on the cellular proteins detected in these EVs, and use of inhibitors targeting the cellular degradation process, we demonstrated that these extracellular vesicles are derived from secretory lysosomes, in which the acidic pH is neutralized upon the infection. Moreover, we report that secreted EVs are more efficient than free-viruses for initiating infections, but that they trigger super-infection exclusion that only free-viruses can overcome. Author summary Recent discoveries of non-enveloped virus secreted in EVs opened the door to new developments in our understanding of the transmission and pathogenicity of these viruses. In particular, how these viruses hijack the host cellular secretion machinery, and the role of these EVs compared with free-virus particles remained to be explored. Here, we tackled these two aspects, by studying BTV, an emerging arthropod-borne virus causing epidemics worldwide. We showed that this virus is mainly released in EVs, in vivo and in the blood of infected animals, and that inhibition of the cell degradation machinery decreases the release of infectious EVs, but not free-virus particles. We found that BTV must neutralize the pH of lysosomes, which are important organelles of the cell degradation machinery, for efficient virus release in EVs. Our results highlight unique features for a virus released in EVs, explaining how BTV transits in lysosomes without being degraded. Interestingly, we observed that EVs are more infectious than free-virus particles, but only free-viruses are able to overcome the super-infection exclusion, which is a common cellular defense mechanism. In conclusion, our study stresses the dual role played by both forms, free and vesicular, in the virus life cycle.","output":"A non-enveloped arbovirus released in lysosome-derived extracellular vesicles induces super-infection exclusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lack of guidelines for implementing distance learning, lack of infrastructure, lack of competencies, and security-related problems were the challenges met during the pandemic. These challenges firstly fall on the administration of a higher education institution. To assist in solving the challenges of the pandemic for the administration of a higher education institution, the paper presents several models for the organization of the processes of distance learning. These models are as follows: a conceptual model of distance learning, a model of strategic planning of distance learning, a model of the assessment before the start of distance learning, a model of the preparation for distance learning, and a model of the process of distance learning and remote work. Student profile, lecturer profile, organizational environment, assessment, and planning of the infrastructure of information and communication technology (ICT), assessment and planning of the virtual learning environment, and assessment of distance learning competencies of participants of the study process are also considered. The developed models are based on five main processes of instructional design, i.e., analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The models provide guidelines for the administration of higher education institutions on the preparation and delivery of distance learning during the pandemic.

There is a dire need for novel effective antivirals to treat COVID-19, as the only approved direct-acting antiviral to date is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CL(pro) (M(pro)). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CL(pro) regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the preclinical 3CL(pro) inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549(+ACE2) cells). We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549(+ACE2) cells and validates PF-00835231s early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231s efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549(+ACE2) cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in nonhuman in vitro models. IMPORTANCE The arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CL(pro) (M(pro)), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CL(pro)-targeting regimen in clinical trials. Using 3D in vitro models of the human airway epithelium, we demonstrate the antiviral potential of PF-00835231 for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A Comparative Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Antivirals Characterizes 3CL(pro) Inhibitor PF-00835231 as a Potential New Treatment for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep learning has enabled automated medical image interpretation at a level often surpassing that of practicing medical experts.

Moreover, we showed that model confidence was positively correlated with Grad-CAM localization performance, suggesting that saliency maps were safer for clinicians to use as a decision aid when the model had made a positive prediction with high confidence.

In this study, the function of DC/L-SIGN in SARS-CoV infection was examined in detail. The results of our study clearly demonstrate that both proteins serve as receptors independently of ACE2 and that there is a minimal level of synergy between DC/L-SIGN and ACE2. As expected, glycans on spike (S) glycoprotein are important for DC/L-SIGN-mediated virus infection.

PEDV showed extensive cell tropism, and we cannot ignore the potential risk of cross-species transmission. However, the mechanism of adaptation and cell tropism of PEDV remains largely unknown and in vitro isolation of PEDV remains a huge challenge, which seriously impedes the development of vaccines. In this study, we confirmed that the spike (S) protein determines the adaptability of PEDV to monkey Vero cells and LLC-PK1 porcine cells, and isolated exchange of S1 and S2 subunits of adaptive strains did not make PEDV adapt to cells. Further, we found that the cellular adaptability of rCH/SX/2016-S(HNXP) depends on S1 and the first half of S2 (S3), and the 803L and 976H of the S2 subunit are critical for rCH/SX/2016-S1(HNXP)+S3(HNXP) adaptation to Vero cells.

They may be offered to those who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease and need to improve their diet, increase physical activity, stop smoking, or reduce alcohol consumption. Despite the popularity of these interventions, there is no overall summary and comparison of the effectiveness of different modes of delivery of a digital intervention to inform policy. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to summarize the effectiveness of digital interventions in improving behavioral and health outcomes related to physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, or diet in nonclinical adult populations and to identify the effectiveness of different modes of delivery of digital interventions. METHODS: We reviewed articles published in the English language between January 1, 2009, and February 25, 2019, that presented a systematic review with a narrative synthesis or meta-analysis of any study design examining digital intervention effectiveness; data related to adults (18 years) in high-income countries; and data on behavioral or health outcomes related to diet, physical activity, smoking, or alcohol, alone or in any combination. Any time frame or comparator was considered eligible. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Reviews, and gray literature. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used to assess review confidence ratings. RESULTS: We found 92 reviews from the academic literature (47 with meta-analyses) and 2 gray literature items (1 with a meta-analysis). Digital interventions were typically more effective than no intervention, but the effect sizes were small. Evidence on the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with face-to-face interventions was mixed. Most trials reported that intent-to-treat analysis and attrition rates were often high. Studies with long follow-up periods were scarce. However, we found that digital interventions may be effective for up to 6 months after the end of the intervention but that the effects dissipated by 12 months. There were small positive effects of digital interventions on smoking cessation and alcohol reduction; possible effectiveness in combined diet and physical activity interventions; no effectiveness for interventions targeting physical activity alone, except for when interventions were delivered by mobile phone, which had medium-sized effects; and no effectiveness observed for interventions targeting diet alone. Mobile interventions were particularly effective. Internet-based interventions were generally effective. CONCLUSIONS: Digital interventions have small positive effects on smoking, alcohol consumption, and in interventions that target a combination of diet and physical activity. Small effects may have been due to the low efficacy of treatment or due to nonadherence. In addition, our ability to make inferences from the literature we reviewed was limited as those interventions were heterogeneous, many reviews had critically low AMSTAR-2 ratings, analysis was typically intent-to-treat, and follow-up times were relatively short.

DESIGN: A prospective, observational study. SETTING: A tertiary university medical center in southern Israel. PATIENTS: Twenty-three hospitalizations for PNAE and 217 hospitalizations for NPAE were included in the study. Paired sera were obtained for each of the hospitalizations and were tested serologically for 12 pathogens. Only a significant change in antibody titers or levels was considered diagnostic. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the two groups for any of the parameters related to COPD or comorbidity. The clinical type of the exacerbation was not significantly different between the groups. Compared to NPAE, patients with PNAE had lower Po(2) values at hospital admission (p = 0.004) but higher rates of abrupt onset (p = 0.005), ICU admissions (p = 0.006), invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.01), mortality (p = 0.007), and longer hospital stay (p = 0.001). In 22 PNAE hospitalizations (96%) and in 153 NPAE hospitalizations (71%), at least one infectious etiology was identified (p = 0.001). Mixed infection was found in 13 patients with PNAE (59%) and in 59 patients with NPAE (39%; not significant [NS]). Viral etiology was identified in 18 patients with PNAE (78%) compared with 99 patients with NPAE (46%; p = 0.003). Pneumococcal etiology was found in 10 patients with PNAE (43%) and in 38 patients with NPAE (18%; p = 0.006). An atypical etiology was identified in 8 patients with PNAE (35%) and 64 patients with NPAE (30%; NS). CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired pneumonia is common among patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of COPD and is generally manifested by more severe clinical and laboratory parameters. In PNAE, compared to NPAE, viral and pneumococcal etiologies are more common, but the rate of atypical pathogens is similar. The therapeutic significance of these findings should be investigated further.","output":"Pneumonic vs Nonpneumonic Acute Exacerbations of COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In recent decades, several viruses have jumped from animals to humans, triggering sizable outbreaks.

Its 95 amino acids are divided into two structural domains (SD), the first spanning amino acids 1C48 (SD1) and the second 49C95 (SD2). Interestingly, the domains are nearly identical but differ in their affinities for carbohydrates. With the aim of enhancing understanding of the binding properties of scytovirin, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of scytovirin complexed with Man4. We set up three systems: (i) Man4 bound to both domains (SD1 + SD2) using the full-length protein; (ii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein, containing only SD1 and (iii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein containing only SD2. Contrary to other reports, binding free energy results suggest that Man4 can bind simultaneously to SD1 and SD2 binding regions, but SD1 individually has the best values of energy and the best affinity for Man4. Decomposition of the binding free energy showed that the residues that interact with Man4 were different in the three systems, suggesting that the binding mechanism of Man4 varies between full-length protein, SD1 and SD2. The results presented here may help to formulate strategies to use scytovirin and promote mutagenesis studies to improve the antiviral activity of scytovirin.","output":"In silico analysis of the cyanobacterial lectin scytovirin: new insights into binding properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Chest radiographic (CXR) features, particularly portable CXR findings, of COVID-19 have not yet been systematically described, either as a baseline tool or as a follow-up method, despite the continuing global pandemic. There is a marked paucity of articles detailing the CXR findings vis--vis a multitude of articles dedicated to the CT features of COVID-19. The purpose of this article is to describe the morphological and distributional patterns of the lung opacities in CXR and to classify the spectrum of essential features on portable AP chest radiographs of PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital in Scandinavia. To our knowledge, this is the first article to describe the morphological and topographical features of CXRs in COVID-19-positive cases. METHODS A retrospective analysis of twenty (20) RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital between 12.03.2020 to 10.04.2020 was done in this study. Morphology and distribution of the opacities were reviewed by two senior consultants and analysed for patterns. RESULTS Most patients had ground-glass opacities (80-85%) and interspersed interstitial opacities (70-75%), often with a characteristic appearance. The opacities were mostly bilateral (80%) and distributed in the lower zones (and to some extent mid zones) and in the middle and peripheral regions, with a tendency to merge towards the hilar areas. There were high interobserver agreements among various parameters and no significant statistical difference between observer 1 and 2. CONCLUSION Chest radiographics show characteristic patterns and distributions, which can be used as an adjunct in the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 patients in specific clinical contexts.","output":"Morphological patterns and distributions in portable chest radiographs of COVID-19-positive cases admitted to a tertiary care hospital: An early experience from Scandinavia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this research is to assess the internal structure and reliability of the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ) in a sample comprising 739 students (64% of them women), attending second-half classes at a private university in the Caribbean Region of Colombia.

A successful match into an ophthalmology residency was achieved by 144 (83.7%) applicants. Applicants applied to (mean  SD) 79.7  22.8 ophthalmology residency programs, received 13.1  8.9 invitations to interview, and attended 11.1  5.8 interviews. Most applicants (N = 126; 71.2%) and PDs (N = 22; 78.6%) expressed a preference for in-person interviews over virtual interviews. If given a choice regarding the future direction for interviews, most applicants were unsure (N = 68; 38.4%) or would prefer to hold interviews virtually (N = 62; 35.0%); PDs felt that interviews should go back to being in-person (39.3%) or were unsure (28.6%). Most PDs (N = 21; 72.4%) reported an increased number of applications received by their respective programs this year compared to previous years. While applicants (N = 108; 61.0%) mostly felt that there should not be a cap on the number of applications, 19 (67.9%) PDs supported a limit on application numbers. Applicants spent an average (SD) of $2320.96 ($1172.86) on the application process this year, which is significantly less than 2018-2019 data.Conclusions: The ophthalmology residency application process was especially complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many applicants and PDs were glad that interviews were held virtually this year, they were less certain regarding future years. The virtual format led to a significantly lower financial burden for applicants and may lead some to prefer this format in the future; if a hybrid model is offered for virtual/in-person interviews, these two interview modes should be compared equally.","output":"Ophthalmology Residency Match in the Covid-19 Era: Applicant and Program Director Perceptions of the 2020-2021 Application Cycle."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children with suspected pulmonary hypertension must undergo extensive and invasive evaluations to establish a definitive diagnosis.

Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light is effective against RNA and DNA viruses and could be useful for decontamination of high-touch fomites that are shared by multiple users. METHODS: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of UV-C light for rapid decontamination of plastic airport security bins inoculated at 3 sites with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bacteriophages MS2, PhiX174, and Phi6, an enveloped RNA virus used as a surrogate for coronaviruses. Reductions of 3 log(10) on inoculated plastic bins were considered effective for decontamination. RESULTS: UV-C light administered as 10-, 20-, or 30-second cycles in proximity to a plastic bin reduced contamination on each of the test sites, including vertical and horizontal surfaces. The 30-second cycle met criteria for decontamination of all 3 test sites for all the test organisms except bacteriophage MS2 which was reduced by greater than 2 log(10) PFU at each site. CONCLUSIONS: UV-C light is an attractive technology for rapid decontamination of airport security bins. Further work is needed to evaluate the utility of UV-C light in real-world settings and to develop methods to provide automated movement of bins through a UV-C decontamination process.","output":"Evaluation of Ultraviolet-C Light for Rapid Decontamination of Airport Security Bins in the Era of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prunus sibirica and Prunus mume are closely related plant species that differ in cold tolerance. Hybrids of P. sibirica and true mume, belonging to the apricot mei group, inherited strong cold resistance from P. sibirica. These materials are favourable for research on the molecular mechanisms of cold resistance. However, no suitable reference genes have been identified for analysing gene expression patterns between P. sibirica and P. mume. Ten candidate reference genes were assessed, namely, actins (ACT2-1, ACT2-2, ACT2-3, ACT2-4), protein phosphatase 2A-1 (PP2A-1), ubiquitins (UBQ2, UBQ3), ubiquitin extension protein (UBQ1) and tubulins (TUB1, TUB2), with four distinct algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder). UBQ2 was recognized as the best reference gene in stems and buds across materials (P. sibirica; 'Xiaohong Zhusha', 'Beijing Yudie', and 'Xiao Lve' for true mume; and 'Dan Fenghou', 'Fenghou', and 'Yanxing' for apricot mei) under cold stress. In addition, the temporal and spatial expression patterns of PmCBF6 and PmLEA10 among seven varieties during winter periods were analysed using UBQ2 as a reference gene. The expression differed significantly among cultivars, which may contribute to their differences in cold tolerance. This paper confirmed the strong cold tolerance of apricot mei. And the best internal reference gene suitable for seven varieties was selected: UBQ2. Based on the above results, the expression of PmCBF6 and PmLEA10 genes during wintering in seven varieties was analysed. The molecular mechanisms of cold resistance were found to be possibly different in different varieties of P. sibirica and P. mume.","output":"Screening of optimal reference genes for qRT-PCR and preliminary exploration of cold resistance mechanisms in Prunus mume and Prunus sibirica varieties."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research note, we examine Finnboat, a traditional Finnish family firm, from the interrelated perspectives of crisis behavior and innovation. The firm under study has endured three major crises: the economic recession of the 1990s, the 2008C2009 financial crisis, and the coronavirus pandemic. Our study shows that Finnboat has undertaken only very modest, if any, innovations during stable periods but has conducted a series of radical business-model and technology innovations, triggered by the different crises. This finding implies that during crises, a risk-averse family firm can productively engage into risk-taking and innovative behavior, effectively engaging in a preference reversal. We also find evidence of a deliberate accumulation of slack resources during periods of calm, which are mobilized to back up innovation and renewal efforts when a crisis hits. Our findings highlight family firms potential to endure crises by adopting a temporal separation logic to the risk-aversion vs. risk-taking paradox, and relatedly, by strategically managing the resource portfolio. Based on the case study, we suggest several research directions, approaches, and methodologies for studying family firm behavior and change during and in-between crises.","output":"Surviving the coronavirus pandemic and beyond: Unlocking family firms innovation potential across crises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present study was to systematically assess existing evidence on the possible association between chronic endodontic infections and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

OBJECTIVE To investigate the associations between nine phthalate metabolites (mPAEs) and systolic/diastolic BP, pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and the risk of HBP. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1044 primary school children (6-8 years old) were enrolled from Shenzhen, China, between 2016 and 2017. Nine mPAEs were analyzed from urine using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. A multivariable linear regression model was used to explore the associations between phthalate exposure and systolic/diastolic BP, PP, and MAP. A binary logistic regression model was used to examine the associations between phthalate exposure and the risk of HBP. RESULTS Monomethyl phthalate (MMP) concentrations were significantly higher in HBP children than normal BP children. MMP, monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobutyl phthalate (MnBP), mono(5-carboxy-2-ethylpentyl) phthalate, mono-[(2-carboxy methyl)hexyl] phthalate (MCMHP), the sum of four short-chain mPAEs (LMW), and the sum of all nine mPAEs (9mPAEs) were significantly positively associated with increases in systolic BP z-score, while only MMP was significantly positively associated with diastolic BP z-score. MMP, MiBP, MnBP, MCMHP, LMW, and 9mPAEs were significantly associated with increases in PP, while MMP and MnBP were significantly associated with increases in MAP. MMP was significantly associated with the risk of HBP, with an odds ratio of 1.87 (95% CI: 1.23, 2.85). CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that dimethyl phthalate exposure increases the risk of HBP.

To improve efforts to track and characterize COVID-19 vaccination progress in the United States, we integrate CDC and state-provided vaccination data, identifying and rectifying discrepancies between these data sources. We find that COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the US exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity at the county level and we statistically identify spatial clusters of undervaccination, all withfoci in the southern US. We also identify vaccination progress at the county level as variable through summer 2021; many counties stalled in vaccination into June 2021 and few recovered by July, with transmission of the Delta variant rapidly rising. Using a comparison with a mechanistic growth model fitted to our integrated data, we classify vaccination dynamics across time at the county scale.

We report herein the design and identification of AV6 analogues which possess the zinc-binding group of HDAC inhibitors and have dual acting mechanism for the reactivation of HIV-1 from latency. Evaluation of compounds for the reactivation of HIV-1 latency identified two excellent active compounds 12c and 12d. Further bioassays revealed that these two compounds reactivated latent HIV-1 through dual mechanism, the inhibition of HDACs and NFAT-required for early HIV-1 gene expression. Additionally, it was found that 12c and 12d could reactivate HIV-1 transcription by releasing P-TEFb from the inactive complex 7SK snRNP. At last, molecular docking identified their orientation and binding interactions at the active site of HDAC2.

GcMAF (Group-specific component Macrophage-Activating Factor) is a mammalian protein with an incredible potency to directly activate macrophages. Since the late 1980s Yamamoto's investigations were published in numerous journals but in order to understand the details of his research, a minute survey of many of his patents was required. But even then, regrettably, a precise description of his experiments was sometimes lacking. This overview tries to summarize all of Yamamoto's research on GcMAF, as well as some selected more recent papers from other investigators, who tried to verify and/or reproduce Yamamoto's reports. In my opinion the most important result of the GcMAF research deserves widespread renewed attention: human GcMAF injections (100 ng per week, intramuscular or intravenous) can help to cure patients with a great variety of cancers as well as patients infected with pathogenic envelope viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), influenza, measles and rubella (and maybe also SARS-CoV-2). From Yamamoto's data it can be calculated that GcMAF is a near-stoichiometric activator of macrophages. Yamamoto monitored the progress of his immunotherapy via the serum level of an enzyme called nagalase (-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity at pH 6). I have extensively discussed the properties and potential catalytic site of this enzyme activity in an Appendix entitled: \\"Search for the potential active site of the latent -N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity in the glycoproteins of some envelope viruses\\".","output":"Immunotherapy with GcMAF revisited - A critical overview of the research of Nobuto Yamamoto."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE In this study, 4-Hz log files were evaluated with an independent secondary Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm to reduce the workload for patient-specific quality assurance (QA) in clinical routine. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 30 randomly selected clinical prostate VMAT plans were included. The used treatment planning system (TPS) was Monaco (Elekta, Crawley), and the secondary dose calculation software was SciMoCa (Scientific-RT, Munich). Monaco and SciMoCa work with a Monte Carlo algorithm. A plausibility check of Monaco and SciMoCa was performed using an ionization chamber in the BodyPhantom (BP). First, the original Monaco RT plans were verified with SciMoCa (pretreatment QA). Second, the corresponding 4-Hz log files were converted into RT log file plans and sent to SciMoCa as on-treatment QA. MLC shift errors were introduced for one prostate plan to determine the sensitivity of on-treatment QA. For pretreatment and on-treatment QA, a gamma analysis (2%/1mm/20%) was performed and dosimetric values of PTV and OARs were ascertained in SciMoCa. RESULTS Plausibility check of TPS Monaco vs. BP measurement and SciMoCa vs. BP measurement showed valid accuracy for clinical VMAT QA. Using SciMoCa, there was no significant difference in PTV Dmean between RT plan and RT log file plan. Between pretreatment and on-treatment QA, PTV metrics, femur right and left showed no significant dosimetric differences as opposed to OARs rectum and bladder. The overall gamma passing rate (GPR) ranged from 96.10% to 100% in pretreatment QA and from 93.50% to 99.80% in on-treatment QA. MLC shift errors were identified for deviations larger than -0.50 mm and +0.75 mm using overall gamma criterion and PTV Dmean. CONCLUSION SciMoCa calculations of Monaco RT plans and RT log file plans are in excellent agreement to each other. Therefore, 4-Hz log files and SciMoCa can replace labor-intensive phantom-based measurements as patient-specific QA.","output":"Evaluation of 4-Hz log files and secondary Monte Carlo dose calculation as patient-specific quality assurance for VMAT prostate plans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides an overview of the UK government policy in relation to relationships and sex education in schools. It focuses on the latest statutory guidance which requires primary and secondary schools in England to teach pupils about different types of relationships, including same-sex relationships. We outline the current policy frameworks and present a rationale for why Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer (LGBTQ+) identities and relationships should be present in the curriculum. We critically interrogate the government response and we present a framework to support the implementation of a whole school approach to LGBTQ+ inclusion. We draw on Meyer's model of minority stress to explore risks to children and young people if they are not provided with an LGBTQ+ curriculum.","output":"Running Scared?

Adhering to standards of care and ethical and legal requirements necessitates a cogent process for conducting, and then documenting, other-directed violence (ODV) risk screening, assessment, and management. In this 5-part series, we describe a model for achieving therapeutic risk management of the potentially violent patient, with essential elements involving: clinical interview augmented by structured screening or assessment tools; risk stratification in terms of temporality and severity; chain analysis to intervene on the functions of ODV ideation and behavior; and a personalized safety plan to mitigate/manage risk. In this fourth column of the series, we describe chain analysis as a critical tool for assessing and intervening on ODV ideation and behavior. We identify the pathways of reinforcement that can cause ODV to persist, and how to navigate potential barriers to completing ODV chains. Using a case example, we demonstrate how to apply chain analysis to ODV ideation and behavior and offer interventional strategies that can be used to disrupt the chain and ultimately reduce the risk for violence.","output":"Therapeutic Risk Management for Violence: Chain Analysis of Other-directed Violent Ideation and Behavior."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the clinical features of recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and therapeutic response. METHODS Recurrence was analyzed retrospectively in SARS patients referred to our hospital from April to May this year to understand the clinical features, the recurrent related factors, the response of treatment and the outcomes. RESULTS One hundred and twenty three patients with SARS were referred to the First Hospital of Peking University from 8, April to 14, May this year and of whom 51 were the critical. Twenty-five patients experienced recurrence, account for 20.3% of total patients (25/123) and 31.4% of critical patients. The clinical features included recurrent fever, worsened breathlessness, exacerbation in radiological lesions and elevated LDH, etc.. These patients were treated with glucocorticoids. Eleven of them were mechanical ventilated. Twenty-one patients recovered. Pulmonary fibrosis were left in 2 patients and another 2 patients died. CONCLUSION The recurrence of symptoms in SARS patients is one of the common clinical feature of critical patients with SARS. Mechanism of recurrence in SARS patient is unknown. Management with glucocorticoids and noninvasive ventilation can control the progression in these patients effectively.","output":"[Clinical features and management of recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to viral infection, neutrophils release inflammatory mediators as part of the innate immune response, contributing to pathogen clearance through virus internalization and killing. Pre-existing co-morbidities, correlating to incidence of severe COVID-19, are associated with chronic airway neutrophilia and examination of COVID-19 lung tissue revealed a series of epithelial pathologies associated with infiltration and activation of neutrophils. To determine the impact of neutrophil-epithelial interactions on the infectivity and inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a co-culture model of airway neutrophilia. We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the airway epithelium alone does not result in a notable release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, however in the presence of neutrophils, the inflammatory response is both polarized and significantly augmented, epithelial barrier integrity in impaired and viral load of the airway epithelium increased. This study reveals a key role for neutrophil-epithelial interactions in determining inflammation, infectivity, and outcomes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Neutrophil-epithelial interactions augment infectivity and pro-inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the human central nervous system, and they play an important role in the regulation of neuronal physiology. In neurological disorders, astrocyte disintegration leads to the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from tissue into the bloodstream. Elevated serum levels of GFAP can serve as blood biomarkers, and a useful prognostic tool to facilitate the early diagnosis of several neurological diseases ranging from stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. This systematic review synthesizes studies published between January 2012 and September 2021 that used GFAP as a potential blood biomarker to detect neurological disorders. The following electronic databases were accessed: MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. In all the databases, the following search strategy was used: GFAP OR glial fibrillary acidic protein AND neurological OR neurodegenerative AND plasma OR serum. The initial search identified 1152 articles. After the exclusion criteria were applied, 48 publications that reported GFAP levels in neurological disorders were identified. A total of16 different neurological disorders that have plasmatic GFAP levels as a possible biomarker for the disease were described in the articles, being: multiple sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, COVID-19, epileptic seizures, Wilson Disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder, glioblastoma, spinal cord injury, asthma, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and Friedreich's ataxia. Our review shows an association between GFAP levels and the disease being studied, suggesting that elevated GFAP levels are a potentially valuable diagnostic biomarker in the evaluation of different neurological diseases.","output":"Serum glial fibrillary acidic protein is a body fluid biomarker: A valuable prognostic for neurological disease - A systematic review."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(D,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/20.md","filePath":"doctor/20.md"}'),V={name:"doctor/20.md"},z=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(R)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
