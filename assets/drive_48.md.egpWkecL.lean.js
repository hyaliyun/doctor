This study analysed trends in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality from the beginning of pandemic in Croatia, in relation to schools opening and closing. Methods Data on COVID-19 positive patients in Croatia from week 9 of 2020 to week 10 of 2021 in Croatia were analysed using joinpoint regression. Analysis also included hospitalizations and mortality trends for age groups 26 to 65 and 66+ from week 30 of 2020. Study design Retrospective data review. Results Schools opened in fall after the summer holidays in week 37. Joinpoint regression analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 in all age groups until 50th week, except in the 19-25 age group which saw an increase until 49th week. During the period of increase there were periods of moderate increases and rapid increases in incidence that were present between 39/41 week and 43/44 week in all age groups except in those 0-6 years [from 40th till 43rd week in age groups 7-14 and 15-18, average percentage change (APC)=87.41, p=0.035, and APC=83.47, p=0.013; from 39th till 43rd in 19-25, APC=91.90, p=0.002; from 40th till 44th in 26-65, APC=74.79, p<0.001; from 41st till 44th in 66+, APC=81.95, p=0.004]. Steeper increase in hospitalizations was seen in 40th week for age groups 26 to 65 (40th C 45th week APC=34.67, p<0.001) and 66+ (40th C 45th week APC=38.76, p<0.001). Steeper increase in mortality started in 41st week for both age groups 26 to 65 and 66+ (41st C 46th week APC=59.59, p<0.001 and 41st C 45th week APC=70.28, p<0.001). Schools were closed for winter holidays in week 51. A steep decrease occurred in week 50 for cases, and in week 51 for mortality and hospitalizations. There was no significant increase in hospitalizations and mortality after schools were re-opened in week 03 of 2021 (primary schools) and week 07 (secondary schools). Conclusion COVID-19 morbidity and mortality trends in Croatia observed in fall 2020 in Croatia perhaps cannot completely exclude potential association of school opening in all age groups. However, in winter 2021 effect was completely lacking and numbers were independent of schools dynamics. The observed inconsistent pattern indicates that there were no association of school openings and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality trends in Croatia and that other factors were leading to increasing and decreasing numbers. This emphasizes the need to consider the introduction of other effective and less harmful measures by stakeholders, or at least to use school closures as a last resort.","output":"COVID-19 Incidence, Hospitalizations and Mortality Trends in Croatia and School Closures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"'The Mask' has become a byword and a precious possession universally.

The current paper proposes a concept that supports the performance of students by analyzing three ways of distance learning, namely text, text and illustrations, including charts, video. An electroencephalogram headset allows the detection of brainwaves and the developed web application enhances the process of distance learning. The electrodes of the headset are placed at contact with the user head and monitor the activity of the left and right frontal regions, along with the temporal lobe. Mood, focus, stress, relaxation, engagement, excitement and interest are triggered as numerical values by using the headset. The users provide information about their daily activities, including learning and evaluation processes. According to the study, users had the highest long term attention while using text and illustrations, followed by watching videos. This is caused by the fact that the text contained the code for the programs which were presented in the video. Also, the users feel comfortable while using the application and they started to pay more attention to the connection between stress, health, education and well being. The results triggered by the headset had higher values while students studied for the first time using videos. When they wanted to remember the information, the text and illustrations way of learning was the best option. Based on the study outcomes, the instructional design can be enhanced. Moreover, the results improved as the students became more equilibrated and confident in themselves. Teachers, professors and parents are able to collaborate and enhance training.

One of the common viral targets is the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha). In this report, we show that phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha was severely suppressed in human and animal cells infected with the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). To understand whether this suppression is through inhibition of protein kinase R (PKR), the double-stranded-RNA-dependent kinase that is one of the main kinases responsible for phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha, cells infected with IBV were analyzed by Western blotting. The results showed that the level of phosphorylated PKR was greatly reduced in IBV-infected cells. Overexpression of IBV structural and nonstructural proteins (nsp) demonstrated that nsp2 is a weak PKR antagonist. Furthermore, GADD34, a component of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which dephosphorylates eIF-2alpha, was significantly induced in IBV-infected cells. Inhibition of the PP1 activity by okadaic acid and overexpression of GADD34, eIF-2alpha, and PKR, as well as their mutant constructs in virus-infected cells, showed that these viral regulatory strategies played a synergistic role in facilitating coronavirus replication. Taken together, these results confirm that IBV has developed a combination of two mechanisms, i.e., blocking PKR activation and inducing GADD34 expression, to maintain de novo protein synthesis in IBV-infected cells and, meanwhile, to enhance viral replication.","output":"Inhibition of protein kinase R activation and upregulation of GADD34 expression play a synergistic role in facilitating coronavirus replication by maintaining de novo protein synthesis in virus-infected cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused overwhelming changes in individual and community daily-life, resulting from the public health measures implemented to contain it, and also from its psychological and socio-economic consequences. These shifts and consequences impacted the entire population, but some groups are more likely to be affected by these changes, including higher education students. OBJECTIVES: a) to investigate mental health status and its determinants among higher-education students in Portugal and Switzerland; and b) to explore adjustment patterns used by these students to overcome the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design was conducted in two phases. First, an online survey was conducted among higher education students in Portugal and Switzerland, in Portuguese and French respectively. A convenience sampling method was used. Second, some participants from the first phase were invited to participate in four online focus group discussions (two in each country) using a maximum variation sampling method. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 1,880 students. Portuguese students revealed higher levels of stress and anxiety, but lower depression symptoms and less resilient coping compared to Swiss respondents. Hope was identified as an explanatory variable for mental health symptoms in students from both countries. In the focus groups (n = 27), 13 adjustment strategies were found, which were subdivided into three spheres: personal, social, and contextual. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic had a mild to moderate impact on most of the evaluated mental health variables. Nevertheless, the students reacted and mobilized positive short-term strategies, which need to be reinforced in order to prevent long-term psychological harm. In addition, our results can inform psychosocial interventions to minimize psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress due to sanitary crises or other population-wide problems or disasters.","output":"Psychological Responses and Strategies Towards the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Higher Education Students in Portugal and Switzerland: A Mixed-Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simulation-based learning is important for rare, high mortality cases, which are unlikely to be witnessed during clinical rotations but are likely to be encountered during future practice such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Recently, two single-incision platforms, robotic and SPIDER, have attempted to ameliorate such problems. This study aimed to compare three different techniques of single-incision cholecystectomy: standard laparoscopic, robotic, and SPIDER approaches. METHODS The authors retrospectively collected data from their first 166 single-incision robotic cholecystectomies (SIRCs) and compared the findings with the data from their first 166 SILCs and the first 166 s-generation SPIDER procedures. All the SILCs were performed with three trocars placed in one umbilical incision and with gallbladder retraction using a Prolene stitch on the right upper quadrant. All the robotic cases were managed using the da Vinci Single-Site Surgical System, and all the SPIDER procedures were performed using the SPIDER Surgical System. RESULTS The SILC, SIRC, and SPIDER groups consisted respectively of 129 (76.3%), 131 (78.9%), and 136 (81.9%) women with the respective mean ages of 44.5  14.3, 51.6  15.9, and 46.4  15.2 years. The mean body mass indexes (BMIs) were respectively 29.1  5.6, 29.4  6.2, and 27.5  4.8 kg/m(2), and the mean surgical times were 37.1  13.3, 63.0  25.2, and 52.8  18.7 min. The total hospital stays were respectively 1.3  5.3, 1.2  2.2, and 1.5  2.6 days, and complications were seen respectively in three SILC cases (1.8%), three SIRC cases (1.8%), and two SPIDER cases (1.2%). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study demonstrate similar results among the three platforms for most of the parameters measured. The SILC procedure appears to be superior to SIRC and SPIDER in terms of surgical time, but selection bias could be the cause. The SILS, SIRC, and SPIDER procedures all are similar in terms of complication profile.

This human-to-human doorstep interaction arises in some other situations also. There is a finite probability that the person standing in front of the door coughs or sneezes during such an interaction.

Different possible scenarios varying in wind direction, wind velocity, ventilation in the vicinity of door, and extent of door opening have been postulated and simulated. The results obtained from numerical simulations show that in the presence of wind, the dynamics of transmission of droplets is much faster than the dynamics of their evaporation. Thus wind velocity and direction have a significant impact on the fate of the droplets. The simulation results show that even if the door is opened by a very small degree, cough droplets enter through the door.

FRSWs are known to be at risk of developing traumatic stress-related conditions; however, little is known about the effects of COVID-19 stressors on the mental wellbeing of FRSWs. We tested two hypotheses: (1) COVID-19-related stressors (ie, risk perception, stress, burnout, and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) will predict decreased mental wellbeing and (2) protective factors will mediate the relationship between COVID-19 stressors and mental wellbeing. Methods The study consisted of a cross-sectional online survey exploring the effects of COVID-19 on the mental wellbeing of FRSWs (n=555) in the UK, using data collected during third lockdown (between Jan 25 and March 31, 2021). The survey, advertised on social media and fire and rescue service intranets, included the COVID-19 Perceived Risk Scale, Stress Measure, Burnout Scale, PTSD ChecklistCCivilian Version, and the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. FRSWs' perspectives on what they found helpful in maintaining their wellbeing throughout the pandemic were also explored. Quantitative data were assessed via a regression model and mediation analysis, and content analysis was done on the qualitative data collected through open-ended questions asking FRSWs about the effects on COVID-19 on their mental wellbeing and their support needs. The institutional ethics committee granted ethical approval and participants gave informed consent. Findings Negative associations between lower scores on mental wellbeing and higher scores on COVID-19 risk factors were found for COVID-19-related stress (r=?049, p<00001) and burnout (r=?062, p<00001) scores. The independent variables, COVID-19 risk perception, stress, burnout, and PTSD outcomes, accounted for 5090% of variance (F=11800 [5C543], p<00001) and were each significant in contributing to the model. The overall mediation model was significant (F=34114 [1C553], p<0001) explaining 3850% of the variance, with team resilience and adaptive coping significantly contributing towards the model. Qualitative data analysis showed that FRSWs' emphasised the need for psychological input, peer support, supportive management, and visible leadership when adapting to the challenges of the pandemic and maintaining wellbeing. Interpretation Risks to FRSWs' mental wellbeing associated with COVID-19 stressors might be buffered by fostering team-based resilience, adaptive coping, and peer support. Offering psychological input for FRSWs who need it and adopting a trauma-informed work environment is encouraged. Supportive management and visible leadership could help FRSWs to adapt to the constant change and challenges associated with COVID-19 and in preparedness for transitioning from the response to the recovery phase of the pandemic.

Reproducible methods for fit testing face masks are scarce and many require sophisticated testing equipment. The purpose of this experimental research was twofold: (a) to develop a simple and reproducible method for assessing face mask fit at key facial areas;and (b) to utilize the method to examine the fit of various commercially available fabric-based face masks on different head shapes at key facial areas. The mask fit test method was developed to assess face mask fit in six key face mask/head correspondence areas: bridge of nose;cheek/area below the eyes (including the nasolabial fold);chin;ear loops;sides of mask near the ears;and sides of nose. Proper fit was indicated when no excessive tightness or gaping occurred. The mask fit test method was used to assess the fit of eight types of commercially available face masks on five three-dimensional printed headforms. The five headforms were created from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health standards for head shapes and sizes. Six evaluators utilized the mask fit test method to score the eight face masks on each headform. Overall, only two face masks had proper fit for the majority of the headforms. All other face masks exhibited loose or gaping fit. General trends included superior fit for larger headforms and poor fit for all face masks evaluated on the smaller phantom. Facial areas that commonly produced large gaps were the bridge of nose, cheeks, and sides of nose. Thus, this study recommends improved design and sizing of face masks to properly fit a larger segment of the population.","output":"Evaluating the fit-effectiveness of fabric-based reusable face masks on 3D printed NIOSH headforms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Established in 2019, the Roundtable on Black Men and Black Women in STEM convenes a broad array of stakeholders that focus on the barriers and opportunities encountered by Black men and Black women as they navigate the pathways from K-12 and postsecondary education to careers in science, engineering, and medicine.

METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study evaluated patients aged >18 years who underwent mechanical ventilation in the ICU for at least 48 h. The patients were categorized into the low- and high-dose rehabilitation groups based on the median RATs. The primary outcome was the rate of ADL dependence at discharge, defined as a Barthel index of <70. The association between low or high doses of rehabilitation and the primary outcome was assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted by baseline factors. RESULTS: The rate of ADL dependence at discharge was significantly lower in the high-dose rehabilitation group (low dose 81% vs. high dose 22%, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed a significantly lower ADL dependence at discharge among those who received high-dose rehabilitation (P<0.001). Increased RATs during the entire ICU admission period and during ICU admission after meeting the criteria for physiological stability was significantly associated with lower ADL dependence at discharge (P<0.001). Moreover, a higher RATs from low-level activity before meeting the criteria for physiological stability also showed a significant association with lower ADL dependence at discharge (P=0.047).

The purpose of our study was to determine whether long-tract fistulas (>4 cm) correlated with successful closure. METHODS All patients undergoing transsphincteric cryptoglandular fistula repair with anal fistula plugs were enrolled in a prospective database. Patients with Crohn's disease were excluded. Fistula tract length was measured intraoperatively by subtracting the remaining plug length from the original plug size. All procedures used standardized techniques and postoperative care pathways. The primary outcome was complete fistula closure assessed through both postoperative outpatient visits and a follow-up telephone questionnaire. RESULTS Forty-one patients with 42 fistula tracks were enrolled over a 39-month period. Complete closure was achieved in 18 of 42 (43%) fistulas at a mean follow-up of 25 months. Closure was not associated with gender, age, tract location, duration of seton, or length of follow-up. Successful closure was significantly associated with increased tract length, because fistulas longer than 4 cm were nearly 3 times more likely to heal compared with shorter fistulas ((14/23, 61%) vs (4/19, 21%), P = .004; relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI 1.14-7.03). CONCLUSIONS Anal fistula plug repair of cryptoglandular anorectal fistulas is more successful for long-tract fistulas. Although the overall success is modest, limiting surgical indications to fistulas exceeding 4 cm may maximize benefits of the plug technique.","output":"Tract length predicts successful closure with anal fistula plug in cryptoglandular fistulas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seemed in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

In a first experiment, vaccinated chickens were challenged with an IBV Ark99-type virulent strain (AL/4614/98). Despite extensive sequence similarity between the vaccines, the more heterogeneous commercial ArkDPI was more efficient at reducing viral loads in challenged chickens, while respiratory signs and tracheal lesions were reduced similarly by either vaccine. A distinct subpopulation of the Ark challenge virus showing asparagine at S1 position 56 was consistently negatively selected by immune pressure originating from vaccination with either vaccine. Antibody levels and antibody avidity to Ark-type S1 protein were greater in CEK-ArkDPI-vaccinated chickens compared to chickens vaccinated with the more diverse commercial ArkDPI vaccine. Synchronous replication of a homogeneous virus population likely elicits clonal expansion and affinity maturation of a greater number of responding B cells compared to a diverse virus population continuously changing its proportion of phenotypes during replication. The results of a second experiment showed that during initial vaccine virus replication (24 and 48 hr postvaccination), the virus population showing increased diversity (commercial ArkDPI) achieved higher concentrations of IBV RNA in the trachea compared to the more homogenous virus. mRNA expression of genes associated with innate immune responses in the trachea 48 hr postvaccination generally showed greater upregulation in chickens vaccinated with the heterogeneous commercial ArkDPI vaccine compared to the CEK-adapted virus. The greater upregulation of these genes is likely associated with higher virus replication achieved by the heterogeneous commercial vaccine. Thus, while the adaptive antibody response was favored by the more homogenous structure of the CEK-ArkDPI vaccine population (higher antibody levels and antibody avidity), the innate immune response was favored by the more diverse viral population of the commercial ArkDPI. We confirmed previous results that distinct subpopulations in wild Ark challenge virus become selected by immune pressure originating from vaccination, and we concluded that the population structure of IBV vaccines impacts innate immune response, antibody avidity, and protection.","output":"Infectious Bronchitis Virus Population Structure Defines Immune Response and Protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Pneumococcal colonisation is regarded as a pre-requisite for developing pneumococcal disease. In children previous studies have reported colonisation to be a symptomatic event and described a relationship between symptom severity/frequency and colonisation density. The evidence for this in adults is lacking in the literature. This study uses an experimental human pneumococcal challenge model to explore whether pneumococcal colonisation (or co-colonisation with a respiratory virus) is a symptomatic event in healthy adults. Methods Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 were recruited and inoculated intra-nasally with either Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 6B, 23F) or saline as a control. Respiratory viral swabs were obtained prior to inoculation. Nasal and non-nasal symptoms were then assessed using a modified Likert score between 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (cannot function). The rate of symptoms reported between groups was compared and a correlation analysis performed. Results Data from 54 participants were analysed. 46 were inoculated with S. pneumoniae (29 with 6B, 17 with 23F) and 8 received saline. In total, 14 became experimentally colonised (30.4%), all of which were inoculated with 6B serotype. There was no statistically significant difference in nasal (p= 0.45) or non-nasal symptoms (p=0.28) between the pneumococcal inoculation group and the saline group. There was no direct correlation between colonisation density and symptom severity in those who were colonised. In the 22% (12/52) who were co-colonised with pneumococcus and respiratory viruses there was no statistical difference in either nasal or non-nasal symptoms (virus positive p=0.74 and virus negative p=1.0).

In spring 2014, a sudden rise in the number of notified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections occurred across Saudi Arabia with a focus in Jeddah. Hypotheses to explain the outbreak pattern include increased surveillance, increased zoonotic transmission, nosocomial transmission, and changes in viral transmissibility, as well as diagnostic laboratory artifacts. Methods. Diagnostic results from Jeddah Regional Laboratory were analyzed. Viruses from the Jeddah outbreak and viruses occurring during the same time in Riyadh, Al-Kharj, and Madinah were fully or partially sequenced. A set of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms distinctive to the Jeddah outbreak were determined from additional viruses. Viruses from Riyadh and Jeddah were isolated and studied in cell culture. Results. Up to 481 samples were received per day for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. A laboratory proficiency assessment suggested positive and negative results to be reliable. Forty-nine percent of 168 positive-testing samples during the Jeddah outbreak stemmed from King Fahd Hospital. All viruses from Jeddah were monophyletic and similar, whereas viruses from Riyadh were paraphyletic and diverse. A hospital-associated transmission cluster, to which cases in Indiana (United States) and the Netherlands belonged, was discovered in Riyadh. One Jeddah-type virus was found in Riyadh, with matching travel history to Jeddah. Virus isolates representing outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh were not different from MERS-CoV EMC/2012 in replication, escape of interferon response, or serum neutralization. Conclusions. Virus shedding and virus functions did not change significantly during the outbreak in Jeddah.

PEEP keeps the alveoli open at the end of expiration, thus reducing atelectrauma and shunt. However, excessive PEEP may contribute to alveolar overdistension. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive bedside tool that monitors in real-time ventilation distribution. Aim of this narrative review is summarizing the techniques for EIT-guided PEEP titration, while providing useful insights to enhance comprehension on advantages and limits of EIT for current and future users. EIT detects thoracic impedance to alternating electrical currents between pairs of electrodes and, through the analysis of its temporal and spatial variation, reconstructs a two-dimensional slice image of the lung depicting regional variation of ventilation and perfusion. Several EIT-based methods have been proposed for PEEP titration. The first described technique estimates the variations of regional lung compliance during a decremental PEEP trial, after lung recruitment. The optimal PEEP value is represented by the best compromise between lung collapse and overdistension. Later on, a second technique assessing alveolar recruitment by variation of the end-expiratory lung impedance was validated. Finally, the global inhomogeneity index and the regional ventilation delay, two EIT-derived parameters, showed promising results selecting the optimal PEEP value as the one that presents the lowest global inhomogeneity index or the lowest regional ventilation delay. In conclusion EIT represents a promising technique to individualize PEEP in mechanically ventilated patients. Whether EIT is the best technique for this purpose and the overall influence of personalizing PEEP on clinical outcome remains to be determined.","output":"Electrical impedance tomography: A compass for the safe route to optimal PEEP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected food security across the world. As governments respond in different ways both with regards to containing the pandemic and addressing food insecurity, in parallel detailed datasets are being collected and analysed. To date, literature addressing food insecurity during the pandemic, using these datasets, has tended to focus on individual countries. By contrast, this paper provides the first detailed multi-country cross-sectional snapshot of the social dimensions of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic across nine African countries (Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, South Africa, and Uganda). Econometric analysis reveals that female-headed households, the poor, and the less-formally educated, appear to suffer more in terms of food insecurity during this global pandemic. Importantly, our findings show that the negative consequences of the pandemic are disproportionately higher for lower-income households and those who had to borrow to make ends meet rather than relying on savings; impacts are country-specific; and there is considerable spatial heterogeneity within country food insecurity, suggesting that tailored policies will be required. These nine countries employ both food and cash safety nets, with the evidence suggesting that, at least when these data were collected, cash safety nets have been slightly more effective at reducing food insecurity. Our results provide a baseline that can be used by governments to help design and implement tailored policies to address food insecurity. Our findings can also be used as lessons to reshape policies to tackle the heterogeneous impacts of climate change.","output":"Food Insecurity, Safety Nets, and Coping Strategies during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multi-Country Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To examine the feasibility of early laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy for ureteral obstruction due to hysterectomy injury. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a 10-y experience from 2 institutions in patients who underwent early (<30 d) or late (>30 d) laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy for ureteral injury after hysterectomy. Evaluation of the surgery included the cause of the stricture and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS A total of 9 patients with distal ureteral injury after hysterectomy were identified. All injuries were identified and treated as early as 21 d after hysterectomy. Seven of 9 patients underwent open hysterectomy, and the remaining patients had vaginal and laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. All ureteroneocystostomy cases were managed laparoscopically without conversion to open surgery and without any intraoperative complications. The Lich-Gregoir reimplantation technique was applied in all patients, and 2 patients required a psoas hitch. The mean operative time was 206.6 min (range, 120-280 min), the mean estimated blood loss was 122.2 cc (range, 25-350 cc), and the mean admission time was 3.3 d (range, 1-7 d). Cystography showed no urine leak when the ureteral stent was removed at 4 to 6 wk after the procedure. Ureteroneocystostomy patency was followed up with cystography at 6 mo and at least 10 y after ureteroneocystostomy. CONCLUSION Early laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation may offer an alternative surgical approach to open surgery for the management of distal ureteral injuries, with favorable cosmetic results and recovery time from ureteral obstruction due to hysterectomy injury.","output":"Laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy for ureteral injuries after hysterectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El mundo, despus de la pandemia de la COVID-19, no ser el mismo que exista y ni tan siquiera eso es deseable.

However, the uncontrollable self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically, facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity. Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire scores for final depression detection.

Results from longitudinal mediation showed that baseline RE would positively predict T3 overeating through T2 negative affect, but not T2 mortality threat. This study supports and extends the counterregulatory eating hypothesis that RE positively predicts future overeating, especially through negative emotions.

Consequently, the search of modern, effective methods and means of learning and training for healthcare specialists is relevant. Quarantine restrictions of educational communication have sharpened attention, firstly, to telecommunication means, secondly, to active learning methods, and thirdly, to the mobilization of internal reserves to expand the practical educational component. This is how the idea of simulated professional support arose. It was realized by the students of physical therapy during the rehabilitation period of a university lecturer. It was the postoperative period of endoprosthesis and simulated professional support was provided with the help of telenursing. The essence of the simulation was that the real rehabilitation period had already passed, but it was agreed to repeat it for a didactic purpose. 46 first-year students of the specialty \\"Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy\\" took part in the experiment. At first, they were trained a set of exercises (according to the recommendations of the clinic), while paying attention to the practical, psychological and pedagogical aspects of interaction. Then, students conducted rehabilitation classes with the help of telecommunication means, which lasted for a month. An incoming survey was conducted (based on motivation of professional activity): among the students and it showed that 32 of them (69.6%) are positively professionally motivated, 45 respondents (97.8%) felt subjective satisfaction with their professional choice.

Methods: Rapid qualitative research was carried out between March and April 2020 via phone interviews with one representative from each of four community-based organizations and 16 health-care workers involved in a trial of community-based services for young people. In addition, information on COVID-19 was collected from social media platforms, news outlets and government announcements. Data were analysed thematically. Findings: Four themes emerged: (i) individuals were overloaded with information but lacked trusted sources, which resulted in widespread fear and unanswered questions; (ii) communities had limited ability to comply with prevention measures, such as social distancing, because access to long-term food supplies and water at home was limited and because income had to be earned daily; (iii) health-care workers perceived themselves to be vulnerable and undervalued because of a shortage of personal protective equipment and inadequate pay; and (iv) other health conditions were sidelined because resources were redirected, with potentially wide-reaching implications. Conclusion: It is important that prevention measures against COVID-19 are appropriate for the local context. In Zimbabwe, communities require support with basic needs and access to reliable information to enable them to follow prevention measures.

The liver is an important organ for the metabolism of sugar, protein, and fat. Liver cirrhosis with hypoproteinemia (LCH) can lead to metabolic disorders of the nutrients such as sugar, protein, and fat, as well as insufficient protein intake, digestion and absorption disorders, and continuous leakage of plasma protein into the abdominal cavity. Severe hypoproteinemia leads to a poor prognosis in patients. For every 10 g/L decrease in peripheral blood albumin, the risk of secondary liver disease complications will increase by 89% and the mortality rate increased by 24%C56%. Therefore, it is necessary to take urgent measures to treat liver cirrhosis with hypoalbuminemia and effectively treat and reverse the deterioration of the disease caused by hypoalbuminemia, so as to reduce the burden of secondary liver disease. Emerging evidence suggests that protein balance disorders, auxin resistance, and hyperleptinemia are key steps in the development of cirrhosis and hypoproteinemia.

At a voltage of 5 V, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses can be rapidly inactivated with disinfection efficiency reaching 95% in only 30 s and 99.99% in 5 min. Mass spectrometry analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that the reactive oxygen species generated on the anode can oxidize the peptide chains and induce cleavage of the peptide backbone of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, and thereby disables the virus.

This study aims to investigate the nasal airflow dynamics during respiration with and without an N95 respirator driven by airflow through the nasal cavity to assess the effect of the respirator on breathing conditions during respiration. To achieve the objective of this study, transient computational fluid dynamics simulations have been utilized. The nasal geometry was reconstructed from high-resolution Computed Tomography scans of a healthy 25-year-old female subject. The species transport method was used to analyze the airflow, temperature, carbon dioxide (CO(2)), moisture content (H(2)O), and temperature distribution within the nasal cavity with and without an N95 respirator during eight consecutive respiration cycles with a tidal volume of 500 ml. The results demonstrated that a respirator caused excessive CO(2) inhalation by approximately [Formula: see text] greater per breath compared with normal breathing. Furthermore, heat and mass transfer in the nasal cavity was reduced, which influences the perception of nasal patency.

There are valid concerns that the latest Omicron variant might have increased infectivity and pathogenicity. In addition, the sheer number of S protein mutations in the Omicron variant raise concerns of potential immune evasion and resistance to therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies. However, structural insights that underpin the potential increased pathogenicity are unknown. Here we adopted an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach to predict the structural changes induced by mutations of the Delta and Omicron variants in the spike (S) protein using Alphafold. This was followed by docking the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the predicted S proteins for Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta, and Omicron variants. Our in-silico structural analysis indicates that S protein for Omicron variant has a higher binding affinity to ACE-2 receptor, compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 and Delta variants. In addition, the recognition sites of the receptor binding domains for Delta and Omicron variants showed lower electronegativity compared to Wuhan-Hu-1. Importantly, further molecular insights revealed significant changes induced at fusion protein (FP) site, which may mediate enhanced viral entry.

The healthcare system suffered from a shortage of ICU beds and oxygenation support devices. In our Institution, most patients received chest CT at admission, only interpreted visually. Given the proven value of quantitative CT analysis (QCT) in the setting of ARDS, we tested QCT as an outcome predictor for COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a single-centre retrospective study on COVID-19 patients hospitalised from January 25, 2020, to April 28, 2020, who received CT at admission prompted by respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea or desaturation. QCT was performed using a semi-automated method (3D Slicer). Lungs were divided by Hounsfield unit intervals. Compromised lung (%CL) volume was the sum of poorly and non-aerated volumes (- 500, 100 HU). We collected patient's clinical data including oxygenation support throughout hospitalisation. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two patients (163 males, median age 66, IQR 54-6) were included; 75% received oxygenation support (20% intubation rate). Compromised lung volume was the most accurate outcome predictor (logistic regression, p < 0.001). %CL values in the 6-23% range increased risk of oxygenation support; values above 23% were at risk for intubation. %CL showed a negative correlation with PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p < 0.001) and was a risk factor for in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: QCT provides new metrics of COVID-19. The compromised lung volume is accurate in predicting the need for oxygenation support and intubation and is a significant risk factor for in-hospital death. QCT may serve as a tool for the triaging process of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: a? Quantitative computer-aided analysis of chest CT (QCT) provides new metrics of COVID-19. a?

Due to the scarcity of COVID-19 testing kits, especially in developing countries, there is a crucial need to rely on alternative diagnosis methods. Deep learning architectures built on image modalities can speed up the COVID-19 pneumonia classification from other types of pneumonia. The transfer learning approach is better suited to automatically detect COVID-19 cases due to the limited availability of medical images. This paper introduces an Optimized Transfer Learning-based Approach for Automatic Detection of COVID-19 (OTLD-COVID-19) that applies an optimization algorithm to twelve CNN architectures to diagnose COVID-19 cases using chest x-ray images. The OTLD-COVID-19 approach adapts Manta-Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) algorithm to optimize the network hyperparameters values of the CNN architectures to improve their classification performance. The proposed dataset is collected from eight different public datasets to classify 4-class cases (COVID-19, pneumonia bacterial, pneumonia viral, and normal).

We present a new satellite remote sensing method for detecting moving trucks on roads using Sentinel-2 data. The method exploits a temporal sensing offset of the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument, causing spatially and spectrally distorted signatures of moving objects. A random forest classifier was trained (overall accuracy: 84%) on visual-near-infrared-spectra of 2500 globally labelled targets. Based on the classification, the target objects were extracted using a developed recursive neighbourhood search. The speed and the heading of the objects were approximated. Detections were validated by employing 350 globally labelled target boxes (mean F1 score: 0.74). The lowest F1 score was achieved in Kenya (0.36), the highest in Poland (0.88). Furthermore, validated at 26 traffic count stations in Germany on in sum 390 dates, the truck detections correlate spatio-temporally with station figures (Pearson r-value: 0.82, RMSE: 43.7). Absolute counts were underestimated on 81% of the dates. The detection performance may differ by season and road condition. Hence, the method is only suitable for approximating the relative truck traffic abundance rather than providing accurate absolute counts. However, existing road cargo monitoring methods that rely on traffic count stations or very high resolution remote sensing data have limited global availability. The proposed moving truck detection method could fill this gap, particularly where other information on road cargo traffic are sparse by employing globally and freely available Sentinel-2 data. It is inferior to the accuracy and the temporal detail of station counts, but superior in terms of spatial coverage.","output":"Detecting Moving Trucks on Roads Using Sentinel-2 Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identification of the most relevant protective antigens has represented a considerable obstacle for the development of subunit vaccines against viral infections, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection.

However, the mechanisms of action remain unclear. Placebo effects contribute to the efficacy of face-to-face mental health interventions and may also be a potential mechanism of action in smartphone-based interventions. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate whether different types of efficacy expectancies as potential factors underlying placebo effects could be successfully induced in a smartphone-based digital placebo mental health intervention, ostensibly targeting mood and stress. METHODS We conducted a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, superiority trial with a multi-arm parallel design. Participants underwent an Android smartphone-based digital placebo mental health intervention for 20 days. We induced prospective efficacy expectancies via initial instructions on the purpose of the intervention and retrospective efficacy expectancies via feedback on the success of the intervention at days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. A total of 132 healthy participants were randomized to a prospective expectancy-only condition (n=33), a retrospective expectancy-only condition (n=33), a combined expectancy condition (n=34), or a control condition (n=32). As the endpoint, we assessed changes in efficacy expectancies with the Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire, before the intervention and on days 1, 7, 14, and 20. For statistical analyses, we used a random effects model for the intention-to-treat sample, with intervention day as time variable and condition as two factors: prospective expectancy (yes vs no) and retrospective expectancy (yes vs no), allowed to vary over participant and intervention day. RESULTS Credibility (=-1.63; 95% CI -2.37 to -0.89; P<.001) and expectancy (=-0.77; 95% CI -1.49 to -0.05; P=.04) decreased across the intervention days. For credibility and expectancy, we found significant three-way interactions: intervention dayprospective expectancyretrospective expectancy (credibility: =2.05; 95% CI 0.60-3.50; P=.006; expectancy: =1.55; 95% CI 0.14-2.95; P=.03), suggesting that efficacy expectancies decreased least in the combined expectancy condition and the control condition. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study investigating whether efficacy expectancies can be successfully induced in a specifically designed placebo smartphone-based mental health intervention. Our findings may pave the way to diminish or exploit digital placebo effects and help to improve the efficacy of digital mental health interventions.

In this study, nasal breath of 75 patients (34m, 41f, aged 64.4  15.4 years) was investgated by MCC-IMS for viral infections. 14 were positively diagnosed for Influenza-A infection and 16 for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs. In one patient RT-PCR was highly suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 but initially inconclusive. The remaining 44 patients served as controls. Breath fingerprints for specific infections were assessed by a combination of cluster analysis and multivariate statistics. There was no significant difference in gender or age according to the groups.

OBJECTIVES: We estimated the association between patients' characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome in Mexico. METHODS: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalisation and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalisation and adverse outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 236a??439 patients were included, with 89a??756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalised and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalisation and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome.

The survey was conducted with spectators at a home match for Victorina Himeji, a professional women's volleyball club in Japan. Two hundred and seventeen spectators rated their worries about becoming infected with COVID-19 after being in the arena as well as their attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal that spectators visiting the arena had significant levels of worry related to the attendees (e.g., \\"Gathering crowds of people in the arena\\" and \\"Possibility that someone in the arena is infected with COVID-19\\"). Furthermore, younger people were more worried about COVID-19 infection than other age groups, although no significant difference in attitudes appeared among the age groups. The findings of this study suggest the importance of practicing social distancing in the arena as well as measuring spectators' body temperature before they enter the arena.

The health system was rapidly overwhelmed by the pandemic. It became evident that patients suffering from timesensitive medical emergencies like stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, trauma and acute myocardial infarction required timely, effective and safe pathways to be treated. The problem was addressed by a regional decree that created a hub-and-spoke system for time-sensitive medical emergencies. METHODS We report the re-organizational changes adopted at a hub hospital (despite having already destined to COVID-19 patients most resources), and the number of emergent procedures for medical emergencies on the first 30-day of activity. These data were compared with the hospital activity in the same period of the previous year. RESULTS Organizational changes were implemented in few hours. Dedicated pathways for non-COVID-19 patients affected by a medical emergency were set up in the emergency department, in the labs and in the operating theater. Ten intensive beds were implemented from a high-dependency unit; two operating rooms were reserved 24h/day to neurosurgical or trauma emergencies. The number of emergent procedures was not different from that of the previous year, no admission refusal, no treatment delay and no viral transmission to the treated patients were recorded. No viral transmission to health care workers was observed. CONCLUSIONS Re-organization of a hospital in order to adopt a hub-and-spoke model resulted feasible and allowed to face acute coronary syndrome and other time-sensitive medical emergencies timely and safely.","output":"Caring for acute coronary syndrome and other time-sensitive medical emergencies during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Northern Italy: report from a hub centre."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study attempted to understand the dimensions of changing agrarian livelihoods because of haphazard adaptation of capitalistic shrimp aquaculture. Specifically, using multi-temporal Google-based geodatabase, we quantified the artificial conversion of agrarian landscape in an inland freshwater region of coastal Bengal. Further, we examined the long-term viability of transformed livelihoods by adopting a modified version of the Sustainable Livelihood Approach (SLA). The assessment of changing livelihoods was based on empirical information acquired through field surveys, focus group discussion (FGD) and key informant interviews (KII). Results from the geostatistical analysis depicted that the shrimp culture in the research area was very recent. In 2010, only 0.03 percent of the total area was occupied by shrimp ponds. However, within a decade and an expansion rate of 18 percent/annum, the conversion spread to 1/3 of the total study area. The findings also clarified that the adaptation of shrimp cultivation increased the overall profit by 6400 USD/ha/year over agricultural output, and resulted in a quick rise in the standard of living for the shrimp farmers. However, in the long run, due to decreasing productivity and salinization of the surrounding land, the conversion resulted in massive depeasantization, augmentation of wasteland, and biased wealth accumulation led to a wide rich-poor gap. Therefore, the entire ecosystem will suffer in the near future, if the local government does not strictly impose Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).","output":"From rice fields to brackish water farms: changing livelihoods in agrarian coastal Bengal, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Cytokine release syndrome with elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels is associated with multiorgan damage and death in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our objective was to perform a living systematic review of the literature concerning the efficacy and toxicity of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data sources were Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus up, preprint servers and Google up to October 8, 2020. Study eligibility criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies at low or moderate risk of bias. Participants were hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Interventions included tocilizumab versus placebo or standard of care. We pooled crude risk ratios (RRs) of RCTs and adjusted RRs from cohorts, separately. We evaluated inconsistency between studies with I2. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Of 1156 citations, 24 studies were eligible (five RCTs and 19 cohorts). Five RCTs at low risk of bias, with 1325 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on short-term mortality; pooled RR was 1.09 (95%CI 0.80-1.49, I2 = 0%). Four RCTs with 771 patients examined the effect of tocilizumab on risk of mechanical ventilation; pooled RR was 0.71 (95%CI 0.52-0.96, I2 = 0%), with a corresponding number needed to treat of 17 (95%CI 9-100). Among 18 cohorts at moderate risk of bias with 9850 patients, the pooled adjusted RR for mortality was 0.58 (95%CI 0.51-0.66, I2 = 2.5%). This association was observed over all degrees of COVID-19 severity. Data from the RCTs did not show a higher risk of infections or adverse events with tocilizumab: pooled RR 0.63 (95%CI 0.38-1.06, five RCTs) and 0.83 (95%CI 0.55-1.24, five RCTs), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative moderate-certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of mechanical ventilation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. While RCTs showed that tocilizumab did not reduce short-term mortality, low-certainty evidence from cohort studies suggests an association between tocilizumab and lower mortality. We did not observe a higher risk of infections or adverse events with tocilizumab use.

As mitochondrial function declines with age, this could be an important factor in why older populations are more susceptible. Key factors which ensure optimal mitochondrial health are generally those that ensure healthy ageing, such as a good lifestyle with plenty of physical activity. The ability of viruses to manipulate mitochondrial function is well described, and it is now also thought that for evolutionary reasons, they also manipulate the ageing process.

Pre-admission or pre-procedure testing can identify recovered asymptomatic patients who may no longer be contagious but would require precautions according to current CDC recommendations (10 days). This can result in unintended consequences, including procedure delays or transfer to appropriate care (e.g., psychiatric or post-trauma patients requiring admission to COVID-19 units instead of psychiatric or rehabilitation facilities, respectively). Methods We conducted a structured survey of healthcare epidemiologists and infection prevention experts from the SHEA Research Network between March-April, 2021. The 14-question survey, presented a series of COVID-19 PCR+ asymptomatic patient case scenarios and asked respondents if (1) they would consider the case recovered and not infectious, (2) if they have cleared precautions in such cases, and if so, (3) how many transmission events occurred after discontinuing precautions. The survey used one or a combination of 5 criteria: history of COVID-19 symptoms, history of exposure to a household member with COVID-19, COVID-19 PCR cycle threshold (CT), and IgG serology. Percentages were calculated among respondents for each question. Results Among 60 respondents, 56 (93%) were physicians, 51 (86%) were hospital epidemiologists, and 46 (77%) had >10y infection prevention experience. They represented facilities that cumulatively cared for >29,000 COVID-19 cases;46 (77%) were academic, and 42 (69%) were large ( >400 beds). One-third to one-half would consider an incidentally found PCR+ case as recovered based on solo criteria, particularly those with two consecutive high CTs or COVID IgG positivity recovered (53-55%) (Table 1). When combining two criteria, half to four-fifths of respondents deemed PCR+ cases to be recovered (Table 2). Half of those had used those criteria to clear precautions (45-64%) and few to none experienced a subsequent transmission event resulting from clearance. Conclusion The majority of healthcare epidemiologists consider a combination of clinical and diagnostic criteria as recovered and many have used these to clear precautions without high numbers of transmission.

We observe natural phonatory and swallowing functions in clinical examinations with a trans-nasal laryngeal fiberscope (TNLF). Before each observation, we use epinephrine to enlarge and smooth the common nasal meatus (bottom of nostril) and then insert a wet swab inside the nose, as in taking a swab culture in the nasopharynx. During the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, this careful technique prevents any complications, including nasal bleeding, painfulness, and induced sneezing. Here, we introduce our routine to observe esophageal movement in swallowing in a natural (sitting) position without anesthesia. CASE PRESENTATION: The case was a 70-year-old female who complained that something was stuck in her esophagus; there was a strange sensation below the larynx and pharynx. After enlarging and smoothing the common nasal meatus, we inserted the TNLF (slim type ?2.9 mm fiberscope, VNL8-J10, PENTAX Medical, Tokyo, Japan.) in the normal way. We then observed the phonatory and swallowing movements of the vocal folds. As usual, to not interfere with natural movements, we used no anesthesia. We found no pathological condition in the pyriform sinus. We asked the patient to swallow the fiberscope. During the swallow, we pushed the TNLF and inserted the tip a bit deeper, which made the fiberscope easily enter the esophagus, like in the insertion of a nasogastric tube. We then asked the patient to swallow a sip of water or saliva to clear and enlarge the lumen of the esophagus. This made it possible to observe the esophagus easily without any air supply. With tone enhancement scan, the esophagus was found to be completely normal except for glycogenic acanthosis. CONCLUSIONS: The advantage of this examination is that it is easily able to perform without anesthesia and with the patient in sitting position. It is quick and minimally invasive, enabling observation the physiologically natural swallowing. It is also possible to observe without anesthesia down to the level of the esophagogastric junction using with a thin type flexible bronchoscope. In the future, gastric fiberscopes might be thinner, even with narrow band imaging (NBI) function. Before that time, physicians should remember to just insert along the bottom of the nose.

This prospective population-based cohort study aimed to explore their characteristics and significances. Methods: From January 22, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was identified in Hefei, China, until July 3, a total of 14,839 people in Feidong, Hefei, with a population of ~1,081,000 underwent SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing, where 36 cases (0.2%) with confirmed COVID-19 infection (Group 1) and 27 close contacts (0.2%) testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but having both positive COVID-19 exposure histories and CT findings (Group 2) from eight clusters were prospectively identified. Another 62 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases without any exposure history (Group 3) were enrolled, and characteristics of the three groups were described and compared. We further described a cluster with an unusual transmission pattern. Results: Fever was more common in Group 2 than Groups 1 and 3. Frequency of diarrhea in Group 1 was higher than in Groups 2 and 3. Median leucocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts were all lower in Groups 1 and 2 than in Group 3. Median D-dimer level was lower in Group 1 than in Groups 2 and 3. Total protein and albumin levels were higher in Groups 1 and 2 than in Group 3. C-reactive protein level was lower and erythrocyte sedimentation rate slower in Groups 1 and 2 than in Group 3. Combination antibacterial therapy and levofloxacin were more often used in Group 3 than in Groups 1 and 2. Lopinavir/ritonavir was more often administered in Groups 1 and 2 than in Group 3. Group 1 received more often corticosteroids than Groups 2 and 3. Group 2 received less often oxygen therapy than Groups 1 and 3. Median duration from illness onset to discharge was longer in Group 1 (27 d) than Groups 2 and 3 (both 17 d). Among contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 patient, only one had a positive virus RNA test but remained asymptomatic and had negative CT findings, and three had negative virus RNA tests but had symptoms and positive CT findings, one of whom transmitted COVID-19 to another asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed patient who had no other exposures. Conclusions: Among close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, some present with positive symptoms and CT findings but test negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using common respiratory (throat swab and sputum) specimens; they have features more similar to confirmed COVID-19 cases than non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases and might have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to others. Such cases might add to the complexity and difficulty of COVID-19 control. Our hypothesis-generating study might suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing by rRT-PCR assays of common respiratory (throat swab and sputum) specimens alone, the widely accepted golden standard for diagnosing COVID-19, might be sometimes insufficient, and that further studies with some further procedures (e.g., testing via bronchoalveolar lavage or specific antibodies) would be warranted for Group 2-like patients, namely, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative (tested using common respiratory specimens), radiographically positive, symptomatic contacts of COVID-19 cases, to further reveal their nature.","output":"Swab and Sputum SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Negative, CT-Positive, Symptomatic Contacts of COVID-19 Cases: A Hypothesis-Generating Prospective Population-Based Cohort Study of Eight Clusters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organizations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1565 positive samples (172 per 100a??000 population) from 1376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6a??% of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. In total, 1035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of ~2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a discrete sublineage associated with six care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients, indicating infection control measures were effective; and found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility.

Although hepatic diseases are a common occurrence in reptile medicine, there is no reference to the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) to evaluate the liver in lizards. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of change in echogenicity and attenuation of the liver in green iguanas (Iguana iguana) after administration of specific contrast media. RESULTS An increase in liver echogenicity and density was evident during CEUS and CECT, respectively. In CEUS, the mean  SD (median; range) peak enhancement was 19.9%  7.5 (18.3; 11.7-34.6). Time to peak enhancement was 134.0  125.1 (68.4; 59.6-364.5) seconds. During CECT, first visualization of the contrast medium was at 3.6  0.5 (4; 3-4) seconds in the aorta, 10.7  2.2 (10.5; 7-14) seconds in the hepatic arteries, and 15  4.5 (14.5; 10-24) seconds in the liver parenchyma.

Gender-blind programs are known to augment harms associated with violence and structural stigmatization by reinforcing rather than challenging unequal systems of power. The intersecting marginalization of these populations with systems of class, race, and settler-colonialism is exacerbating the impact that policies such as physical distancing, school closures, and a realignment of healthcare priorities are having on the wellbeing of these populations. The overarching reasons why women and SGM are marginalized are well known and stem from a hegemonic, patriarchal system that fails to fully integrate these groups into planning and decision making regarding public health programming-including the response to COVID-19. In this perspective, we aim to highlight how the exclusion of cisgender women and SGM, and failure to use a gender redistributive/transformative approach, has (i) hampered the recovery from the pandemic and (ii) further entrenched the existing power structures that lead to the marginalization of these groups. We also argue that COVID-19 represents a once-in-a-century opportunity to realign priorities regarding health promotion for cisgender women and SGM by using gender redistributive/transformative approaches to the recovery from the pandemic. We apply this framework, which aims to challenge the existing power structures and distribution of resources, to exemplars from programs in health, housing, employment, and incarceration to envision how a gender redistributive/transformative approach could harness the COVID-19 recovery to advance health equity for cisgender women and SGM.","output":"Finding opportunity in the COVID-19 crisis: prioritizing gender in the design of social protection policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective: The Coronavirus disease 2019 first appeared in the area of Wuhan, China Dental professionals are at greater risk of getting infected by patients and certain dental procedures involving aerosol generation and proximity to the oropharyngeal region Therefore, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is recommended to protect skin and mucosa from infected blood or saliva American Dental Association (ADA) has published recommendations for dental treatment, yet most of the dentists are still hesitant in treating patients The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge and practices of dentists in Pakistan regarding PPE during COVID-19 pandemic Methods: Data collection was done using a well-structured web-based questionnaire (Google forms) The survey form was disseminated by sending the link via email, WhatsApp and other online forums Results: A total of n=1016 responses were collected Approximately 91 6% of the participants were young dentists with years of experience 1-10 years Majority of the participants 76 7% did not have easy access to PPE A total of 60 8% claimed to be aware of the recent World Health Organizations, Centre for Disease Control and other international guidelines to screen COVID-19 patients at their clinic Almost all the participants, 95 6%, had never undergone N95 fit-testing in their career More than half of the participants, 64 4% were not aware of the differences between N95, N99, N100 masks A positive trend was observed in 91 7% of the participants when asked about washing hands or uses an alcohol-based sanitizer before every patient encounter More than three quarter (81%) of the participants was not performing aerosol producing procedures at their practices Conclusion: Majority of dentists were found to have adequate knowledge and practice scores, which is important to combat COVID-19 However there still many gaps in their knowledge and practices which need to be highlighted to ensure safe dental practice for both patients and dentists [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Biomedica is the property of Knowledge Bylanes and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Knowledge and Practices of Dentists Regarding Personal Protective Equipment during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study among Pakistani Dentists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As we look toward recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, we overview challenges to be minimized, including economic setbacks, health and well-being effects, and highlighted ageism, racism, and classism.

Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets. Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19 lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions. Based on a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method. The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models. We further show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung lesions, which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training convergence. In addition, our proposed Hybrid-encoder learning method incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non-COVID19 datasets effectively and achieves significant improvement. These findings promote new insights into transfer learning for COVID-19 CT image segmentation, which can also be further generalized to other medical tasks.","output":"Does Non-COVID19 Lung Lesion Help?

Training methods have been proposed to reach recommended optical diagnosis thresholds. The aim of our study was to present a systematic review and meta-analysis on optical diagnosis training. Methods PubMed/Medline and Cochrane databases were searched between 1980 and October 2019 for studies reporting outcomes on optical diagnosis training of colorectal polyps. The primary outcome was optical diagnosis accuracy compared to histological analysis pre-training and post-training intervention. Subgroup analyses of experienced/trainee endoscopists, training methods, and small/diminutive polyps were included. Results Overall, 16 studies met inclusion criteria, analyzing the impact of training on 179 endoscopists. Pre-training accuracy was 70.3 % (6416/9131 correct diagnoses) whereas post-training accuracy was 81.6 % (7416/9213 correct diagnoses) (risk ratio [RR] 1.17; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.09C1.24, P < 0.001). In experienced endoscopists, accuracy improved from 69.8 % (3771/5403 correct diagnoses) to 82.4 % (4521/5485 correct diagnoses) (RR 1.20; 95 % CI: 1.11C1.29, P < 0.001). Among trainees, accuracy improved from 69.6 % (2645/3803 correct diagnoses) to 78.8 % (2995/3803 correct diagnoses) (RR 1.14; 95 % CI 1.06C1.24, P < 0.001).

For CINV prophylaxis, 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3 receptor antagonists (5HT3-RAs) and neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists (NK1-RAs) are usually administered together with dexamethasone, which may increase the risk of serious infections in patients undergoing myeloablative treatment. The rationale of this multicenter, open-label and phase IIa study was to explore the efficacy of multiple doses of NEPA (netupitant/palonosetron) given as an every-other-day regimen without dexamethasone in preventing CINV in patients with relapsed-refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R/R-NHL), eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and treated with MD-HD-CT. Seventy patients participated to the study. According to the adopted Fleming one-stage design, the primary endpoint of this study was achieved. The CR values were 87.1% (primary endpoint, overall phase: days 1-8), 88.6% (acute phase: days 1-6), and 98.6% (delayed phase: days 7-8), while complete control (CR with no more than mild nausea) was 85.7% (overall phase), 88.6% (acute phase), and 95.7% (delayed phase). Moderate and severe episodes of nausea were reported by less than 10% of patients in the overall phase and less than 5% in both the acute and delayed phases. Regarding safety, NEPA was well tolerated with only one adverse event (constipation) evaluated as possibly related to NEPA administration. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that multiple alternate dosing of NEPA without the addition of dexamethasone is highly effective for preventing nausea and vomiting in this difficult setting, with a good tolerability profile.","output":"Efficacy and safety of multiple doses of NEPA without dexamethasone in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by multiple-day and high-dose chemotherapy in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a phase IIa, multicenter study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Cell lines were constructed which permanently express influenza virus-specific RNA.

Surveys were distributed by email in May 2021. Results were summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Responses were received from 35 program directors and 34 program coordinators from 76 programs contacted. Compared to the 2019-2020 recruitment season, in 2020-2021, 14 of 35 programs received >10% more applications and most programs interviewed 12 applicants per position. Interview days were typically 5-6 hours long and were often coordinated with Pediatrics interviews. Most programs (13/15) utilized virtual social events with residents, but these often did not allow residents to provide quality feedback about applicants. Program directors could adequately assess most applicant qualities but felt that virtual interviews limited their ability to assess applicants interpersonal communication skills and to showcase special features of their programs.

We examined the psychological status of nurses working in the tertiary women's and children's hospitals in Sichuan, China, in order to explore the possible effect of the COVID-19. The cross-sectional survey was conducted at the peak period of COVID-19 among 1971 nurses. Their anxiety, depression and self-efficacy were assessed by the seven-item anxiety scale (GAD-7), the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES), respectively. 1934 valid questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 98.1%.

Consequently, it was among the first countries to experience significant breakthrough infections due to the waning of vaccine-induced immunity, which led to a resurgence of the epidemic. To mitigate the outbreak, Israel launched a pioneering booster campaign. Israel's success in curtailing the Delta resurgence while imposing only mild non-pharmaceutical interventions has been instrumental in influencing the decision of many countries to initiate a booster campaign. By constructing a detailed mathematical model and calibrating it to the Israeli data, we expand our understanding of the impact of the booster campaign from the individual to the population level. We use the calibrated model to explore counterfactual scenarios in which the booster vaccination campaign is altered and to assess the direct and indirect effects in the different scenarios. Our results point to the vast benefits of vaccinating younger age groups that are not at a high risk of developing severe disease but play an important role in transmission. We further show that when the epidemic is exponentially growing the success of the booster campaign is highly sensitive to the timing of its initiation. Hence a rapid response is an important factor in reducing disease burden using booster vaccination.","output":"Booster vaccination to curtail COVID-19 resurgence - population-level implications of the Israeli campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The experiments on the kinetics of molecular desorption from structurally disordered adsorbents clearly demonstrate its non-Debye behavior at \\"long\\" times. In due time, when analyzing the desorption of hydrogen molecules from crystalline adsorbents, attempts were made to associate this behavior with the manifestation of second-order effects, when the rate of desorption is limited by the rate of surface diffusion of hydrogen atoms with their subsequent association into molecules. However, the estimates made in the present work show that the dominance of second-order effects should be expected in the region of times significantly exceeding those where the kinetics of H2 desorption have long acquired a non-Debye character. To explain the observed regularities, an approach has been developed according to which frozen fluctuations in the activation energy of desorption play a crucial role in the non-Debye kinetics of the process. The obtained closed expression for the desorption rate has a transparent physical meaning and allows us to give a quantitative interpretation of a number of experiments on the desorption kinetics of molecules not only from crystalline (containing frozen defects) but also from amorphous adsorbents.

While there is evidence for vaccine hesitancy across the globe, wide variation in factors influencing vaccine acceptance has been reported, mainly from High-Income Countries (HIC). However, the evidence from Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) remains unclear. The objective of this review was to describe the determinants of vaccine acceptance and strategies to address those in an LMIC context. METHODS: The World Health Organizations (WHO) Measuring Behavioral and Social Drivers of Vaccination (BeSD) Increasing Vaccination Model was employed to identify factors that influenced vaccine acceptance. All evidence related to supply-side and demand-side determinants and social and health system processes were examined. A comprehensive search for published literature was conducted in three databases and grey literature in relevant websites of government, multinational agencies, and COVID-19 resource aggregators, followed by a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Overall, the results showed that the vaccine acceptance rates differed across LMICs, with a wide variety of reasons cited for vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine acceptance was reportedly greater among males, those with higher education, elevated socio-economic status, the unmarried, those employed as health care workers. Evidence suggested that exposure to misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and public concerns over the safety of vaccines may contribute to lower acceptance rates. Strategies to increase vaccine acceptance rates included direct engagement with communities through influencers, including community leaders and health experts; clear and transparent communication about COVID-19 vaccines, financial and non-financial incentives; and strong endorsement from health care workers. Trust in government was identified as a significant enabler of vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for measures to address public acceptability, trust and concern over the safety and benefit of approved vaccines.

Daily injections of CsA (50 mg/kg) inhibited the expression of the MHV3-induced ependymitis, meningitis, hydrocephalus and vasculitis. The effect was preserved even if CsA treatment was initiated 15 days after virus infection but was lost if CsA treatment was given later on or for a shorter period of time. Viral titers in brains of chronically infected mice were not affected by CsA treatment. During the first week following MHV3 infection, CsA treatment increased both the percentage of acute death (31 vs. 10%) and the viral titers in brain and liver of infected mice. In this model, the timing of CsA treatment appeared critical for the balance between its beneficial effect on CNS lesions and the risk of increased acute mortality.","output":"Effect of cyclosporin A on an experimental chronic viral infection of the central nervous system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this paper was to review recent literature and provide recommendations regarding the use of telemental health, with a focus on tele-consultation and tele-supervision in post-disaster and low-resource settings, including the impact of COVID-19.

In this paper, we exploit exhaustive municipality-level data in France, one of the most severely hit country in the world, to identify a negative relationship between income and excess mortality within urban areas, that persists over COVID-19 waves. Over the year 2020, the poorest municipalities experienced a 30% higher increase in excess mortality. Our analyses can rule out an independent contribution of lockdown policies to this heterogeneous impact. Finally, we find evidence that both labour-market exposure and housing conditions are major determinants of the epidemic-induced effects of COVID-19 on mortality inequalities, but that their respective role depends on the state of the epidemic.","output":"A poorly understood disease?

Here, we report that interferon- (IFN) sensitizes macrophages to Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced death that requires macrophage-intrinsic death ligands and caspase-8 enzymatic activity, which trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic effectors, BAX and BAK. The pro-apoptotic caspase-8 substrate BID was dispensable for BAX and BAK activation. Instead, caspase-8 reduced pro-survival BCL-2 transcription and increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), thus facilitating BAX and BAK signaling. IFN-primed, TLR-induced macrophage killing required iNOS, which licensed apoptotic caspase-8 activity and reduced the BAX and BAK inhibitors, A1 and MCL-1. The deletion of iNOS or caspase-8 limited SARS-CoV-2-induced disease in mice, while caspase-8 caused lethality independent of iNOS in a model of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. These findings reveal that iNOS selectively licenses programmed cell death, which may explain how nitric oxide impacts disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other iNOS-associated inflammatory conditions.","output":"Interferon- primes macrophages for pathogen ligand-induced killing via a caspase-8 and mitochondrial cell death pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2020, UK authorities warned of the rapid spread of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant, belonging to the B.1.1.7 lineage, known as the Alpha variant.

Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven chronic inflammation of the arterial wall with coronary artery disease (CAD) that may lead to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which remains the main cause of death in developed countries. We believe that due to CAD development factors affecting the vessel wall, the SARS-CoV-2 infection may precipitate further advancement of future thromboembolic events by a plaque erosion or rupture. Therefore, this metanalysis aims to unambiguously establish the role of the history of CAD in mortality and severity of COVID-19 disease. ABSTRACT: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Patients with pre-existing CAD were shown to have a more severe course of COVID-19, but this association has not been clarified. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the association between CAD and COVID-19 outcomes. We searched Scopus, Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to 2 November 2021. There were 62 studies with a total population of 49,286 patients included in the meta-analysis. CAD occurrence in survivor vs. non-survivor groups varied and amounted to 9.2% vs. 22.9%, respectively (OR = 0.33; 95%CI: 0.29 to 0.39; I(2) = 70%; p < 0.001). CAD was also associated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease and was (10.8% vs. 5.6%, respectively, for severe vs. non-severe groups (OR = 2.28; 95%CI: 1.59 to 3.27; I(2) = 72%; p < 0.001). The role of history of CAD in mortality and severe condition in COVID-19 presents itself as prominentalthough a risk of bias in retrospective trials needs to be assessed, in case of our meta-analysis the statistically significant results when it comes to higher mortality among patients with CAD compared to non-CAD patients, a more severe condition observed in patients with CAD, and a visibly more frequent admission to intensive care unit in patients with CAD, it seems that an incidence of cardiovascular events plays a role in COVID-19 prognosis.","output":"Effect of Coronary Artery Disease on COVID-19Prognosis and Risk Assessment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Initial treatment recommendations of COVID-19 were based on the use of antimicrobial drugs and immunomodulators. Although information on drug interactions was available for other pathologies, there was little evidence in the treatment of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to analyse the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) derived from the medication used in COVID-19 patients in the first pandemic wave and to evaluate the real consequences of such interactions in clinical practice. METHODS Cohort, retrospective and single-centre study carried out in a third-level hospital. Adult patients, admitted with suspected COVID-19, that received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon beta 1-b or tocilizumab and with any pDDIs according to \\"Liverpool Drug Interaction Group\\" between March and May 2020 were included. The possible consequences of pDDIs at the QTc interval level or any other adverse event according to the patient's medical record were analysed. A descriptive analysis was carried out to assess possible factors that may affect the QTc interval prolongation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Two hundred and eighteen (62.3%) patients of a total of 350 patients admitted with COVID-19 had at least one pDDI. There were 598 pDDIs. Thirty-eight pDDIs (6.3%) were categorized as not recommended or contraindicated. The mean value difference between baseline and pDDI posterior ECG was 412.3 ms  25.8 ms vs. 426.3 ms  26.7 ms; p < 0.001. Seven patients (5.7%) had a clinically significant alteration of QTc. A total of 44 non-cardiological events (7.3%) with a possible connection to a pDDI were detected. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION The number of pDDIs in patients admitted for COVID-19 in the first pandemic wave was remarkably high. However, clinical consequences occurred in a low percentage of patients. Interactions involving medications that would be contraindicated for concomitant administration are rare. Knowledge of these pDDIs and their consequences could help to establish appropriate therapeutic strategies in patients with COVID-19 or other diseases with these treatments.","output":"Real-world prevalence and consequences of potential drug-drug interactions in the first-wave COVID-19 treatments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim Using a collection of samples from the biobank of City Hospital  40 of St Petersburg, to study the cytokine profile in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and sepsis, in comparison with patients with abdominal inflammation and septicemia Material and methods The study included serum samples from 181 patients with sepsis and COVID-19 (127 patients with a diagnosis confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR);54 patients with a negative PCR test, but with a characteristic computed tomographic lung performance) and 47 patients with abdominal sepsis The content of cytokines was determined using a multiplex immunofluorescence analysis based on the Luminex xMAP technology using the HCYTOMAG- 60K panel - a soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) Other laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, procalcitonin) were taken from patient records Normality of distribution was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test To compare groups, the Mann-Whitney test for independent samples, Wilcoxon test for dependent samples, and the Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons were used Results In patients with sepsis and COVID-19 infection, no differences in the concentrations of cytokines, ferritin and CRP were found between the groups with detected and not detected virus by PCR test Based on this, this group was considered homogeneous when studying the cytokine profile It was shown that in patients with sepsis and COVID-19, significantly higher levels of sCD40L (p&lt;0,0001) and VEGF (p=0,037) and relatively low levels of CRP (p&lt;0,0001), IL-6 (p&lt;0,0001), IL-8 (p&lt;0,0001), TNFalpha (p&lt;0,00058) Conclusion These results indicate that sepsis in patients with COVID-19 courses with less elevation in inflammatory cytokine than in abdominal sepsis At the same time, a critically high level of sCD40L indicates the significant endothelial damage ֧ݧ  ҧѧ٧ ܧݧݧ֧ܧڧ ҧѧ٧ ҧڧҧѧߧܧ   էܧѧ ҧݧߧڧ  40 ڧ٧ڧ ҧ֧ߧߧ ڧܧڧߧӧԧ ڧݧ  ѧڧ֧ߧ  ֧ڧ֧ܧڧ ѧا֧ߧڧ֧ ߧ ߧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ, ӧ٧ӧѧߧߧ SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2),  ѧӧߧ֧ߧڧ  ѧڧ֧ߧѧާ  ֧ڧ֧ާڧ֧ ߧ ߧ ѧҧէާڧߧѧݧߧԧ ӧѧݧ֧ߧڧ ѧ֧ڧѧ  ާ֧է  ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ҧݧ ӧ٧ ҧѧ٧ ӧܧ ܧӧ  181 ѧڧ֧ߧ  ֧ڧ֧ܧڧ ѧا֧ߧڧ֧ ߧ ߧ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ (127 ѧڧ֧ߧ  էڧѧԧߧ٧, էӧ֧اէ֧ߧߧ ֧ڧӧѧߧڧ֧  ާ ݧڧާ֧ѧ٧ߧ ֧ߧ ֧ѧܧڧ (),  54 ѧڧ֧ߧ  ڧѧ֧ݧߧ ֧٧ݧѧ -ѧߧѧݧڧ٧, ߧ  ѧѧܧ֧ߧ ܧѧڧߧ ܧާ֧ߧ ާԧѧڧ ݧ֧ԧܧڧ)  47 ѧڧ֧ߧ  ѧҧէާڧߧѧݧߧ ֧ڧ է֧اѧߧڧ ڧܧڧߧ ֧է֧ݧݧ  ާ ާݧڧݧ֧ܧߧԧ ڧާާߧݧ֧֧ߧߧԧ ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ ߧ ҧѧ٧ ݧѧާ xMap (Luminex) ڧݧ٧ӧѧߧڧ֧ ѧߧ֧ݧ HCYTOMAG-60K - ѧӧڧާѧ ާ ݧڧԧѧߧէ CD40 (sCD40L), ڧߧ֧ݧ֧ۧܧڧ-1alpha (IL-1alpha), ڧߧ֧ݧ֧ۧܧڧ-1beta (IL-1beta), ڧߧ֧ݧ֧ۧܧڧ 6 (IL-6), ڧߧ֧ݧ֧ۧܧڧ 8 (IL-8), ާߧڧѧߧ ֧ާѧܧڧ֧ܧڧ ҧ֧ݧ-1 (MCP-1), ѧܧ ߧ֧ܧ٧ ݧ ѧݧ (TNFalpha), ѧܧ  ߧէ֧ݧڧ է (VEGF) ӧߧ ڧ ݧѧҧѧߧ ܧѧ٧ѧ֧ݧ֧ (-֧ѧܧڧӧߧ ҧ֧ݧ (), ֧ڧڧ, ܧѧݧڧߧڧ) ҧݧ ӧ٧ ڧ ڧڧ ҧݧ֧٧ߧ ѧڧ֧ߧ ӧ֧ܧ ӧҧ ߧ ߧާѧݧߧ ѧ֧է֧ݧ֧ߧڧ ֧ӧݧݧ ާ֧է ѧڧ-ڧݧܧ ݧ ѧӧߧ֧ߧڧ ԧ ڧݧ٧ӧѧݧ ܧڧ֧ڧ ѧߧߧ-ڧߧ էݧ ߧ֧ӧ٧ѧߧߧ ӧҧ, ܧڧ֧ڧ ڧݧܧܧߧ էݧ ӧ٧ѧߧߧ ӧҧ  ާ֧ էڧ֧ڧߧߧԧ ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ ѧܧ֧ݧ-ݧݧڧ  ѧӧܧ ߧ֧ߧ էݧ ާߧا֧ӧ֧ߧߧ ѧӧߧ֧ߧڧ ֧٧ݧѧ  ѧڧ֧ߧ  ֧ڧ֧ܧڧ ѧا֧ߧڧ֧ ߧ ߧ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ѧ٧ݧڧڧ  ܧߧ֧ߧѧڧ ڧܧڧߧ, ֧ڧڧߧ   ާ֧اէ ԧѧާ  ӧӧݧ֧ߧߧ  ߧ ӧӧݧ֧ߧߧ ާ֧է  SARS-CoV-2 ҧߧѧا֧ߧ ߧ ҧݧ  ߧӧѧߧڧ ԧ էѧߧߧѧ ԧ  ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ҧ֧ߧߧ֧ ڧܧڧߧӧԧ ѧ ѧާѧڧӧѧݧѧ ܧѧ ԧާԧ֧ߧߧѧ  ѧӧߧ֧ߧڧ ڧܧڧߧӧԧ ڧݧ  ѧڧ֧ߧ  ѧ٧ߧާ ڧѧާ ֧ڧ֧ܧԧ ѧا֧ߧڧ ҧݧ ܧѧ٧ѧߧ,   ԧ ѧڧ֧ߧ  ֧ڧ ߧ ߧ SARS-CoV-2 ߧѧҧݧէѧ ٧ߧѧڧ֧ݧߧ ҧݧ֧ ӧܧڧ ӧߧ sCD40L (p&lt;0,0001)  VEGF (p=0,037)  ߧڧ֧ݧߧ ߧڧ٧ܧڧ  (p&lt;0,0001), IL-6 (p&lt;0,0001), IL-8 (p&lt;0,0001), TNFalpha (p&lt;0,00058) ѧܧݧ֧ߧڧ ݧ֧ߧߧ ֧٧ݧѧ ܧѧ٧ӧѧ ߧ ,  ֧ڧ֧ܧ ѧا֧ߧڧ  COVID-19 ֧ܧѧ֧  ާ֧ߧڧ է֧ާ ӧߧ֧ ӧѧݧڧ֧ݧߧ ڧܧڧߧ, ֧  ѧҧէާڧߧѧݧߧ ֧ڧ   ܧڧڧ֧ܧ ӧܧڧ ӧ֧ߧ sCD40L ܧѧ٧ӧѧ֧ ߧ ߧѧݧڧڧ ٧ߧѧڧ֧ݧߧԧ ߧէ֧ݧڧѧݧߧԧ ѧا֧ߧڧ,  ݧߧ ӧڧӧѧ֧  ֧էѧӧݧ֧ߧڧ  ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧ ܧѧڧߧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧߧڧ","output":"Covid-19 Biobank: Features of the Cytokine Profile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growing literature on gender inequality in academia attests to the challenge that awaits female researchers during their academic careers.

There were 8 females and 15 males.18 children (78%) did not have a CPME following the initial strategy discussion.Social care records showed in 11 cases (48%) after the child/family were spoken to by social care with or without the police, the decision was made that a CP medical was not indicated, mainly because the history was not substantiated or injuries were not seen. This included one 3-year old and four 4-year olds.Two children (aged 8 and 12) retracted their allegations;no information regarding injuries is recorded.In 1 case the mother admitted to smacking the 8 year old child, she stated that she was unaware of the law as the family were new to the UK;there is no documentation with regards to injuries. One 15 year old refused to consent for CPME.ConclusionsCPMEs only occurred for 5/23 (22%) of children following their initial allegation of physical abuse. It is of concern that young children may make a disclosure to a safe adult such as a teacher but then when they are unable to repeat the allegation to an unfamiliar social worker or police officer that further medical assessment is not sought.A CPME will not always be offered by paediatricians in cases where there is no visible injury in a verbal child. GMC guidance states that before carrying out a CPME you must be satisfied that it is necessary and appropriate. You must be clear about what will be achieved and whether or not the outcome is likely to affect the proposed course of action.We therefore call for clarity between all agencies with regard to the threshold required for a CPME to occur following referrals received for physical abuse allegations.We recommend that in preschool and younger children with limited verbal skills social workers should refer for a CPME to be undertaken where there is an allegation of physical abuse regardless of whether an injury is seen. In verbal children a CPME should be done when there is a significant allegation even if no injury is seen to ensure there are no hidden injuries.","output":"Missing child protection medicals: a service evaluation of referrals following strategy meetings for physical abuse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly described parvovirus. HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory infections, including acute otitis media (AOM), but the knowledge on the significance of HBoV1 in upper respiratory tract infections (URI) and AOM in relation to other respiratory viruses is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of detection of HBoV1 to that of other respiratory viruses in specimens from children with URI, with and without AOM complication. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected during URI from healthy children (6C35 months) followed prospectively for 1 year; specimens have been previously analyzed for broad spectrum of respiratory viruses. Archived NPS were analyzed for HBoV1 using a high-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: Seven hundred and seven NPS samples collected during URI episodes from 201 children were studied for HBoV1. A total of 94 (47%) children tested positive for HBoV1 DNA during 172 (24%) URI episodes; HBoV1 was present as the only virus in 44 (6%) URI episodes. Overall, 37% of URI episodes were complicated by AOM. Of URI associated with single virus (n = 303), the rate of AOM complicating URI associated with HBoV1 only was 52% (23 of 44); this was a higher AOM rate, compared to that of other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Among URI associated with single respiratory virus, HBoV1-URI was commonly associated with AOM complication. The important role of HBoV1 on AOM pathogenesis needs to be studied further.","output":"Role of Human Bocavirus in Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Acute Otitis Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) meet clinical criteria for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), yet early reports suggested they differ physiologically and clinically from patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS, prompting treatment recommendations that deviate from standard evidence-based practices for ARDS. OBJECTIVES: To compare respiratory physiology, clinical outcomes, and extrapulmonary clinical features of severe COVID-19 with non-COVID ARDS. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study, comparing 130 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 with 382 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS. Initial respiratory physiology and 28-day outcomes were compared. Extrapulmonary manifestations (inflammation, extrapulmonary organ injury, and coagulation) were compared in an exploratory analysis. RESULTS: Comparison of patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS suggested small differences in respiratory compliance, ventilatory efficiency, and oxygenation. 28-day mortality was 30% in COVID-19 patients and 38% in non-COVID ARDS. In adjusted analysis, point estimates of differences in time-to-breathing-unassisted at 28 days (adjusted SHR 0.98 [95% CI 0.77-1.26]) and 28-day mortality (risk ratio = 1.01 [95% CI 0.72-1.42]) were small for COVID-19 vs. non-COVID ARDS, although the confidence intervals for these estimates include moderate differences. Patients with COVID-19 had lower neutrophil counts but did not differ in lymphocyte count or other measures of systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: In this single center cohort, we found no evidence for large differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS. Many key clinical features of severe COVID-19 were similar to those of non-COVID-19 ARDS, including respiratory physiology and clinical outcomes, although our sample size precludes definitive conclusions. Further studies are needed to define COVID-19-specific pathophysiology before deviation from evidence-based treatment practices can be recommended.","output":"Comparing Clinical Features and Outcomes in Mechanically Ventilated Patients with COVID-19 and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A three-dimensional coordination polymer, poly[hexa-aqua-((4)-glutarato)bis((3)-sulfato)-dineodymium(III)], [Nd(2)(glutarato)(SO(4))(2)(H(2)O)(6)]( n ) (glutarato(2C) = C(5)H(6)O(4) (2C)), 1, consisting of cationic {Nd(2)(H(2)O)(6)(SO(4))(2)}( n ) (2n+) layers linked by bridging glutarate ligands, was synthesized by the microwave-heating technique within few minutes.

METHODS: This case-control study nested within a cohort of cDMARD users was conducted in the Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany and Lazio regions and Reggio Emilia province. Claims databases were linked to COVID-19 surveillance registries. Risk of COVID-19-related outcomes was estimated using a multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis, comparing HCQ/CLQ vs methotrexate, vs other cDMARDs and vs non-use of these drugs. Presence of rheumatic diseases vs their absence in a non-nested population was investigated. RESULTS: 1275 cases hospitalized due to COVID-19 were matched to 12 734 controls. Compared with recent use of methotrexate, no association between HCQ/CLQ monotherapy and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR 0.83 [95%CI, 0.69-1.00]) or mortality (OR 1.19 [95%CI, 0.85-1.67]) was observed. A lower risk was found when comparing HCQ/CLQ use to the concomitant use of other cDMARDs and glucocorticoids. HCQ/CLQ was not associated with COVID-19 hospitalization as compared with non-use. An increased risk for recent use of either methotrexate monotherapy (OR 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05-1.34]) or other cDMARDs (OR 1.21 [95% CI, 1.08-1.36]) vs non-use was found.

Any batch of crablets caught from the wild is a mix of the three native species under the genus Scylla. Scylla species have different growth rates. Since grow-out culture depends heavily on species' growth, growers should be able to distinguish the species as early as the juvenile stage, which is taxonomically difficult. This study was done to consolidate low-cost traditional identification techniques for juvenile Scylla from fishers of the Philippines for future validation. Focused group discussions were done in fishing communities from Bataan, Pangasinan, and Cagayan on the island of Luzon. The study was continued through online surveys, as travel was restricted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Results indicate that 70.58% of respondents identify the species of crabs by looking at their claws and 55.88% observe the color of the crabs. Almost half, or 41.17% of respondents, consider the width and size of the carapace. Unique methods in certain Philippine regions include observation of the behavior patterns, carapace texture, rate of weight gain, and seasonality.

The pressure drop is dominated by capillarity but contains electro-osmotic and viscous corrections. The viscous correction is shown to be remarkably insensitive to the presence of electro-osmotic effects. The electro-osmotic pressure correction is negative, reflecting work done by the electro-osmotic conjoining pressure as film is laid down. The negative electro-osmotic correction to pressure drop can far exceed the positive viscous correction.

The disruption to chronic illnesses, such as epilepsy, may relate to several factors ranging from direct infection to secondary effects from healthcare reorganization and social distancing measures. OBJECTIVES: As part of the COVID-19 and Epilepsy (COV-E) global study, we ascertained the effects of COVID-19 on people with epilepsy in Brazil, based on their perspectives and those of their caregivers. We also evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the care delivered to people with epilepsy by healthcare workers. METHODS: We designed separate online surveys for people with epilepsy and their caregivers. A further survey for healthcare workers contained additional assessments of changes to working patterns, productivity, and concerns for those with epilepsy under their care. The Brazilian arm of COV-E initially collected data from May to November 2020 during the country's first wave. We also examined national data to identify the Brazilian states with the highest COVID-19 incidence and related mortality. Lastly, we applied this geographic grouping to our data to explore whether local disease burden played a direct role in difficulties faced by people with epilepsy. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-one people returned the survey, 20% were individuals with epilepsy (n = 48); 22% were caregivers (n = 53), and 58% were healthcare workers (n = 140). Just under half (43%) of people with epilepsy reported health changes during the pandemic, including worsening seizure control, with specific issues related to stress and impaired mental health. Of respondents prescribed antiseizure medication, 11% reported difficulty taking medication on time due to problems acquiring prescriptions and delayed or canceled medical appointments. Only a small proportion of respondents reported discussing significant epilepsy-related risks in the previous 12 months. Analysis of national COVID-19 data showed a higher disease burden in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro compared to Brazil as a whole. There were, however, no geographic differences observed in survey responses despite variability in the incidence of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Brazilians with epilepsy have been adversely affected by COVID-19 by factors beyond infection or mortality. Mental health issues and the importance of optimal communication are critical during these difficult times. Healthcare services need to find nuanced approaches and learn from shared international experiences to provide optimal care for people with epilepsy as the direct burden of COVID-19 improves in some countries.

We examined the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of mobile chat messaging in preventing smoking relapse in smokers who have recently quit smoking. METHODS: In this assessor-blinded, pilot randomized controlled trial in 5 cessation clinics, we recruited adult daily smokers who had been receiving cessation treatments and abstained for 3 to 30 days. The intervention group received real-time, personalized chat messaging on relapse prevention via WhatsApp for 3 months. The control group received generic text messaging on the harms of smoking and benefits of quitting for 3 months. The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-validated abstinence at 6 months post-treatment initiation. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04409496). RESULTS: From June to July 2020, 108 of 130 (83%) eligible subjects were randomized to the intervention (N=54) or control (N=54) groups. The retention rate was 93% at 3 months (end of treatment) and 85% at 6 months. In the intervention group, 80% of participants responded to the chat messages at least once;43% continuously engaged with the intervention over the 3-month intervention period. By intention-to-treat, validated abstinence at 6 months was higher in the intervention than control group (31% vs 22%), with an RR of 1.72 (95% CI 0.91-3.23;P=0.09) after adjusting for pre-quit nicotine dependence, duration of abstinence and cessation treatment at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial showed the feasibility and acceptability of mobile chat messaging for relapse prevention with preliminary evidence on its effectiveness in increasing validated abstinence. IMPLICATIONS: Smoking relapse is the most likely outcome of smoking cessation attempts and an undertreated problem. This pilot trial showed the feasibility and acceptability of personalized chat messaging via WhatsApp for relapse prevention in recent abstainers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The higher carbon monoxide-validated abstinence rate in participants who received chat messaging than controls showed preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of the intervention.

Regarding, lipid rafts are functional membrane microdomains with highly and tightly packed lipid molecules. These regions enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol recruit and concentrate several receptors and molecules involved in pathogen recognition and cellular signaling. Cholesterol-rich lipid rafts have multiple functions for viral replication; however, their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. In this review, we discussed the novel evidence on the cholesterol-rich lipid rafts as a platform for SARS-CoV-2 entry, where receptors such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), human Toll-like receptors (TLRs), transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS), CD-147 and HDL-scavenger receptor B type 1 (SR-B1) are recruited for their interaction with the viral spike protein. FDA-approved drugs such as statins, metformin, hydroxychloroquine, and cyclodextrins (methyl--cyclodextrin) can disrupt cholesterol-rich lipid rafts to regulate key molecules in the immune signaling pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines, and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here, we report the pK(a) calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using the recently developed graphical processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with a new asynchronous replica-exchange scheme, which allows computation on a single GPU card. The calculated pK(a)s support the catalytic roles of the CysCHisCAsp triad.

Simulations revealed that the BL2 can open and close depending on the protonation state of C271/270, consistent with the most recent crystal structure evidence.

Therefore, it was deemed necessary to quickly find a solution to the backlog.ObjectivesTo implement a temporary doctor delivered blood clinic to increase training opportunities and confidence in paediatric venepuncture, whilst meeting demand for a clinic appointment and reducing waiting times during COVID-19 by creating 56 extra slots within a 7 week period.MethodsFirstly, we collected data for the number of GP referrals between November 2019 to January 2020, and compared it to the number of GP referrals between November 2020 to January 2021 to see whether there had been a substantial increase likely attributable to COVID-19. When starting the quality improvement project we also answered the question: What are we trying to accomplish?, and looked at the five key areas we wanted to achieve. This formed the basis of a questionnaire that was circulated to the trainees after each clinic they had attended. The questionnaire included the key areas identified such as confidence in venepuncture both before and after the clinic, how often the trainees required additional help, and whether they felt supported throughout the clinic.ResultsAlthough there was felt to be a perceived increase in GP referrals to blood clinics within the department, our results did not support this conclusion. The number of referrals before and during COVID remained almost the same. The trainees who undertook this clinic ranged from F1s to ST1s and GP trainees. Two-thirds of the trainees felt their venepuncture had improved after the clinic, and all felt this clinic was a good training opportunity and should be continued in future. On average, the trainees asked for assistance with one to two patients and we received very useful feedback in the comments section on the questionnaire. Furthermore, we discovered a few issues which arose throughout the clinic. This primarily involved the IT system and difficult patients being inappropriately booked into this junior-led clinic. This was addressed in a half-way meeting and measures put in place to resolve those issues. This included the creation of a booking guide for the outpatient department and a handbook for the doctors undertaking the clinic.ConclusionsOverall our results showed an overwhelming positive response to implementing this clinic. It allowed the doctors to improve on their venepuncture skills, but also ensured there were appropriate staff available should they require help. As it was set out to do, it reduced our waiting times from 6 weeks to 3 weeks, and therefore helped to clear a backlog that had been developing before its introduction.","output":"Implementing a temporary doctor delivered blood clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Background: The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic presented many sudden challenges regarding food including grocery shopping changes (e.g., reduced store hours, capacity restrictions, empty store shelves due to food hoarding), restaurant closures, the need to cook more at home, and closures of food access programs. Eat Well Saskatchewan (EWS) implemented a 16-week social media campaign (#eatwellcovid19) led by a dietitian and nutrition student that focused on sharing stories submitted by the Saskatchewan public about how they are eating healthy during COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Objective: To describe implementation of the #eatwellcovid19 social media campaign, and results from the evaluation of the campaign which included campaign performance using social media metrics and experiences and perspectives of campaign followers. METHODS: Methods: Saskatchewan, Canada residents were invited to submit personal stories and experiences to EWS about how they are eating healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic from April-August 2020. Each week, one to three stories were featured on EWS social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), along with evidence-based nutrition information to help residents become more resilient to challenges related to food and nutrition experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals who submitted stories were entered into a weekly draw for a $100 grocery gift card. Social media metrics and semi-structured qualitative interviews of campaign followers were used to evaluate #eatwellcovid19. RESULTS: Results: In total, n=75 stories were submitted by n=74 individuals on a variety of topics (e.g., grocery shopping, traditional skills, gardening) and n=42 were featured on social media. EWS shared 194 #eatwellcovid19 posts across social media platforms (Facebook: n=100;Instagram: n=55;Twitter: n=39). On Facebook, #eatawellcovid19 reached 100,571, left 128,818 impressions and there were 9,575 engagements. On Instagram, the campaign reached 11,310, made 14,145 impressions, received 823 likes and 15 comments. On Twitter, #eatwellcovid19 made 15,199 impressions and received 424 engagements. Featured story submission posts had the best engagement on Facebook and the most likes and comments on Instagram. The EWS social media pages reported increases in following during the campaign (Instagram: +30%;Twitter: +14%;Facebook: +12%). Results from the interviews reveal that there were two types of campaign followers - those who appreciated hearing the stories submitted by followers as it helped them to feel connected to the community during social isolation, and those that appreciated the evidence-based information. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Numerous stories were submitted to the #eatwellcovid19 social media campaign on various topics. On Instagram and Facebook, posts that featured these stories had the highest engagement. During this campaign, EWS social media following increased by &gt;10% on each platform. The approach used for #eatwellcovid19 could be considered by others looking to develop health promotion campaigns.","output":"Evaluation of a social media campaign in Saskatchewan to promote healthy eating during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since it was announced as a public health emergency of international con-cern in 2019, Covid-19 has caused enormous loss of property and life.

Our research group has conducted a series of studies testing the validity and reliability of the facial identification practice of morphological analysis. In this paper, we summarize the results of our studies and other latest advances in facial identification practice. In addition, we present a review of relevant technical literature on the limiting factors imposed on facial identification by closed circuit television, while making recommendations for practice and the future of this research niche based on a combination of our results and the technical know-how available. Facial identification research is a multidisciplinary task, with involvement from the field of anatomy, forensic anthropology, photography, image science, and psychology, among others. The value of this brief review is the bridging of these multiple disciplines to discuss the relevant needs and requirements of facial identification in forensic practice and future research. ABSTRACT: Global escalation of crime has necessitated the use of digital imagery to aid the identification of perpetrators. Forensic facial comparison (FFC) is increasingly employed, often relying on poor-quality images. In the absence of standardized criteria, especially in terms of video recordings, verification of the methodology is needed. This paper addresses aspects of FFC, discussing relevant terminology, investigating the validity and reliability of the FISWG morphological feature list using a new South African database, and advising on standards for CCTV equipment. Suboptimal conditions, including poor resolution, unfavorable angle of incidence, color, and lighting, affected the accuracy of FFC. Morphological analysis of photographs, standard CCTV, and eye-level CCTV showed improved performance in a strict iteration analysis, but not when using analogue CCTV images. Therefore, both strict and lenient iterations should be conducted, but FFC must be abandoned when a strict iteration performs worse than a lenient one. This threshold ought to be applied to the specific CCTV equipment to determine its utility. Chance-corrected accuracy was the most representative measure of accuracy, as opposed to the commonly used hit rate. While the use of automated systems is increasing, trained human observer-based morphological analysis, using the FISWG feature list and an Analysis, Comparison, Evaluation, and Verification (ACE-V) approach, should be the primary method of facial comparison.","output":"Forensic Facial Comparison: Current Status, Limitations, and Future Directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The replication and pathogenicity of influenza A viruses (IAVs) critically depend on their ability to tolerate the antiviral interferon (IFN) response. To determine a potential role for the IAV hemagglutinin (HA) in viral sensitivity to IFN, we studied the restriction of IAV infection in IFN--treated human epithelial cells by using 2:6 recombinant IAVs that shared six gene segments of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus (PR8) and contained HAs and neuraminidases of representative avian, human, and zoonotic H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. In A549 and Calu-3 cells, viruses displaying a higher pH optimum of HA-mediated membrane fusion, H5N1-PR8 and H7N9-PR8, were less sensitive to the IFN-induced antiviral state than their counterparts with HAs from duck and human viruses, which fused at a lower pH. The association between a high pH optimum of fusion and reduced IFN sensitivity was confirmed by using HA point mutants of A/Hong Kong/1/1968-PR8 that differed solely by their fusion properties. Furthermore, similar effects of the viral fusion pH on IFN sensitivity were observed in experiments with (i) primary human type II alveolar epithelial cells and differentiated cultures of human airway epithelial cells, (ii) nonrecombinant zoonotic and pandemic IAVs, and (iii) preparations of IFN- and IFN-1. A higher pH of membrane fusion and reduced sensitivity to IFN correlated with lower restriction of the viruses in MDCK cells stably expressing the IFN-inducible transmembrane proteins IFITM2 and IFITM3, which are known to inhibit viral fusion. Our results reveal that the pH optimum of HA-driven membrane fusion of IAVs is a determinant of their sensitivity to IFN and IFITM proteins.IMPORTANCE The IFN system constitutes an important innate defense against viral infection. Substantial information is available on how IAVs avoid detection by sensors of the IFN system and disable IFN signaling pathways. Much less is known about the ability of IAVs to tolerate the antiviral activity of IFN-induced cellular proteins. The IFN-induced proteins of the IFITM family block IAV entry into target cells and can restrict viral spread and pathogenicity. Here we show for the first time that the sensitivity of IAVs to the IFN-induced antiviral state and IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins depends on the pH value at which the viral HA undergoes a conformational transition and mediates membrane fusion. Our data imply that the high pH optimum of membrane fusion typical of zoonotic IAVs of gallinaceous poultry, such as H5N1 and H7N9, may contribute to their enhanced virulence in humans.","output":"pH Optimum of Hemagglutinin-Mediated Membrane Fusion Determines Sensitivity of Influenza A Viruses to the Interferon-Induced Antiviral State and IFITMs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current models of mental effort in psychology, behavioral economics, and cognitive neuroscience typically suggest that exerting cognitive effort is aversive, and people avoid it whenever possible. The aim of this research was to challenge this view and show that people can learn to value and seek effort intrinsically. Our experiments tested the hypothesis that effort-contingent reward in a working-memory task will induce a preference for more demanding math tasks in a transfer phase, even though participants were aware that they would no longer receive any reward for task performance. In laboratory Experiment 1 (n = 121), we made reward directly contingent on mobilized cognitive effort as assessed via cardiovascular measures (-adrenergic sympathetic activity) during the training task. Experiments 2a to 2e (n = 1,457) were conducted online to examine whether the effects of effort-contingent reward on subsequent demand seeking replicate and generalize to community samples. Taken together, the studies yielded reliable evidence that effort-contingent reward increased participants demand seeking and preference for the exertion of cognitive effort on the transfer task. Our findings provide evidence that people can learn to assign positive value to mental effort. The results challenge currently dominant theories of mental effort and provide evidence and an explanation for the positive effects of environments appreciating effort and individual growth on peoples evaluation of effort and their willingness to mobilize effort and approach challenging tasks.","output":"Rewarding cognitive effort increases the intrinsic value of mental labor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the pandemic reaches the one-year mark in the United States, college presidents reflected on the impact the prolonged crisis has had on their institutions, their communities-- and themselves.

Post-approval, a key goal has been to upscale and continuously improve manufacturing success and turnaround time in the commercial settings to meet the needs of a global patient population. Here we report accrued experience from our 4-year journey of optimizing the commercial tisagenlecleucel manufacturing process at the US site (Morris Plains, NJ), for faster and successful delivery to patients in the US. Methods: As reported previously, the tisagenlecleucel manufacturing process includes leukapheresis of the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells, enrichment and activation of T cells, transduction of the lentiviral vector containing the anti-CD19 CAR transgene, activation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-coated beads, expansion in cell culture, washing, and formulation of the viable cells into a cryoformulation medium. The final product is then cryopreserved, shipped back to the treatment center and infused to patients (Tyagarajan, 2020). Use of cryopreserved leukapheresis material as the starting point in commercial manufacturing is unique to tisagenlecleucel;this allows flexibility in terms of scheduling leukapheresis when a patient's health is optimal to provide T cells, and also helps offset logistical challenges (Tyagarajan, 2019). Results: As of Jun-2021, tisagenlecleucel has been manufactured for >5000 patients worldwide, enabled by Novartis's significantly increased global manufacturing footprint at six sites strategically located across six countries (US, France, Switzerland, Germany, Japan and Australia) and a global treatment network of >340 certified centers, including 127 centers in the US. Specifically for the US manufacturing site, between Dec-2020 and Jun-2021, 376 patients in the US had starting material available for manufacturing. Overall, the manufactured product was available for shipment for 98% of patients (shipping success rate [SSR]). The commercial manufacturing success rate (MSR) was 96%, with an out-of-specification (OOS) rate of <3% and no OOS for viability. All ten OOS batches were released for infusion as benefit:risk assessment was positive. Manufacturing was cancelled for two patients upon physician's request. Immediate manufacturing capability without waiting time was available on receipt of all apheresis starting materials. The median time from start of manufacturing to shipping was 20 days. As is evident, the COVID-19 pandemic did not appear to have significantly affected the success rate or manufacturing turnaround time. These latest success metrics, reflecting significant improvements from 2018 to 2021 in MSR (69% to 96%), SSR (93% to 98%), and overall OOS rate (26% to 2%) including viability OOS rate (from 25% to 0%), are a result of upscaling the manufacturing capabilities, enhancements with hospitals focusing on optimizing apheresis collection and cryopreservation procedures, and continuous evaluation and improvement of the manufacturing process since tisagenlecleucel was first launched (Figure). Two key process and analytical improvements that were considered to have improved robustness of manufacturing and testing processes, reduced OOS rates, and minimized variability in turnaround time were introduced towards the end of 2020. Firstly, a simplified sample preparation procedure for final product cell count and viability measurement, which is more reflective of final product at infusion. Secondly, an alternate serum source (5% plasma-derived human AB serum [PD hABs]) which further improves process robustness with a trend towards improved growth and higher peak cell counts. Conclusions: Tisagenlecleucel's current global commercial manufacturing footprint and treatment network are well-positioned to meet anticipated future increase in demand for CAR-T therapies. Recent process improvements h ve significantly increased the MSR (to 96%) and SSR (to 98%), and immediate product availability for patients in need of CAR-T cells. Ongoing and upcoming process improvements are anticipated to further reduce the throughput time, thus allowing more patients faster access to CAR-T therapy.

In this paper, we investigate how effectively and efficiently can such a list of susceptible people be found given a list of infected persons and their locations. To address this problem from an information retrieval (search) perspective, we represent the location of each person at each time instant as a point in a vector space. By using the locations of the given list of infected persons as queries, we investigate the feasibility of applying approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) based indexing and retrieval approaches to obtain a list of top-k suspected users in real-time. Since leveraging information from true user location data can lead to security and privacy concerns, we also investigate what effects does distance-preserving encoding methods have on the effectiveness of the ANN methods. Experiments conducted on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the top-k retrieved lists of susceptible users retrieved with existing ANN approaches (KD-tree and HNSW) yield satisfactory precision and recall values, thus indicating that ANN approaches can potentially be applied in practice to facilitate real-time contact tracing even under the presence of imposed privacy constraints.","output":"Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search on Privacy-aware Encoding of User Locations to Identify Susceptible Infections in Simulated Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions to cervical cancer screening in the United States, stratified by step in the screening process and primary test modality, on cervical cancer burden.

Scenarios varied by the duration of the disruption (6 or 24 months), steps in the screening process being disrupted (primary screening, surveillance, colposcopy, excisional treatment), and primary screening modality (cytology alone or cytology plus human papillomavirus \\"cotesting\\"). RESULTS: The models consistently showed that COVID-19-related disruptions yield small net increases in cervical cancer cases by 2027, which are greater for women previously screened with cytology compared with cotesting. When disruptions affected all four steps in the screening process under cytology-based screening, there were an additional 5-7 and 38-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. In contrast, under cotesting, there were additional 4-5 and 35-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. The majority (58-79%) of the projected increases in cases under cotesting were due to disruptions to surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, rather than to primary screening.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level of awareness, perception, and attitude regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and infection control among Jordanian dentists. METHODS: The study population consisted of dentists who worked in private clinics, hospitals, and health centers in Jordan. An online questionnaire was sent to a sample of Jordanian dentists in March 2020. The questionnaire was comprised of a series of questions about dentists' demographic characteristics; their awareness of the incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of COVID-19 and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19; and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: This study included a total of 368 dentists aged 22-73 years (mean 32.9 years, SD 10.6 years). A total of 112 (30.4%) dentists had completed a master or residency program in dentistry, 195 (53.0%) had received training in infection control in dentistry, and 28 (7.6%) had attended training or lectures regarding COVID-19. A total of 133 (36.1%) dentists reported that the incubation period is 1-14 days. The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of identifying patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission, and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. A total of 275 (74.7%) believed that it was necessary to ask patients to sit far from each other, wear masks while in the waiting room, and wash hands before getting in the dental chair to decrease disease transmission.

In this study, we report that US3 blocks IFN- production by hyperphosphorylating IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Ectopic expression of US3 protein significantly inhibited Sendai virus (SeV)-mediated activation of IFN- and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoters and the transcription of IFN-, ISG54, and ISG56. US3 was also shown to block SeV-induced dimerization and nuclear translocation of IRF3. The kinase activity was indispensable for its inhibitory function, as kinase-dead (KD) US3 mutants K220M and D305A could not inhibit IFN- production. Furthermore, US3 interacted with and hyperphosphorylated IRF3 at Ser175 to prevent IRF3 activation. Finally, the US3 KD mutant viruses were constructed and denoted K220M or D305A HSV-1, respectively. Cells and mice infected with both mutant viruses produced remarkably larger amounts of IFN- than those infected with wild-type HSV-1.

Among an open-label, randomized clinical trial, adult patients ( 18 years old) with severe COVID-19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to the IFN group or the control group. Patients in the IFN group received IFN -1b (250 mcg subcutaneously every other day for two consecutive weeks) along with the national protocol medications while in the control group, patients received only the national protocol medications (lopinavir/ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine for 7-10 days). The primary outcome of the study was time to clinical improvement. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital complications and 28-daymortality. Between April 20 and May 20, 2020, 80 patients were enrolled and finally 33 patients in each group completed the study. Time to clinical improvment in the IFN group was significantly shorter than the control group ([9(6-10) vs. 11(9-15) days respectively, p=0.002, HR= 2.30; 95% CI: 1.33-3.39]). At day 14, the percentage of discharged patients was 78.79% and 54.55% in the IFN and control groups respectively (OR= 3.09; 95% CI: 1.05-9.11, p=0.03). ICU admission rate in the control group was significantly higher than the IFN group (66.66% vs. 42.42%, p = 0.04). The duration of hospitalization and ICU stay were not significantly different between the groups All-cause 28-day mortality was 6.06% and 18.18% in the IFN and control groups respectively (p = 0.12). IFN -1b was effective in shortening the time to clinical improvement without serious adverse events in patients with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, admission in ICU and need for invasive mechanical ventilation decreased following administration of IFN -1b.

Permitted by recent advancements in anesthesia and multimodal pain management, there has been a trend toward outpatient cleft lip repair to alleviate hospital burden and minimize healthcare costs. The purpose of this study was to compare complication rates between outpatient and inpatient cleft lip repair from large national samples as well as identify preoperative factors that predicted discharge status. METHODS The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for pediatrics was used to analyze 30-day outcomes for all patients undergoing cleft lip repair (CPT (current procedural terminology) code 40700) from 2012 to 2019. Complication rates were compared across 3 groups: same day discharge, next day discharge, and later discharge. Preoperative factors, including comorbidities and demographics, were analyzed to determine the impact of discharge date on complications as well as identify independent predictors of discharge timing and perioperative complications. RESULTS A total of 6689 patients underwent primary cleft lip repair, with 16.8% discharging on day of surgery, and 72.4% discharging 1 day after surgery. Complication rates were statistically equivalent between same day and next day discharge. Preoperative factors predicting complication and postoperative admission included age <6 months and weight less than ten pounds at the time of surgery. Patients discharged after more than 1 day in the hospital had higher rates of complications as well as more preoperative comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Complication rates between same day and next day discharge are equivalent, suggesting that same day discharge is a safe option in select patients.

Although most COVID-19 cases are mild, some are severe or critical, predominantly due to acute lung injury. It has been widely accepted that a counter regulatory renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis including the ACE2/ANG [1-7]/Mas protects the lungs from acute lung injury. However, recent evidence suggests that the generation of protective ANG [1-7] in the lungs is predominantly mediated by proinflammatory prolyloligopeptidase (POP), which has been repeatedly demonstrated to be involved in lung pathology. This review contends that acute lung injury in severe COVID-19 is characterised by a) ACE2 downregulation and malfunction (inflammatory signalling) due to viral occupation, and b) dysregulation of the protective RAS axis, predominantly due to increased activity of proinflammatory POP. It follows that a reasonable treatment strategy in COVID-19-related acute lung injury would be delivering functional recombinant (r) ACE2 forms to trap the virus. Additionally, or alternatively to rACE2 delivery, the potential benefits resulting from lowering POP activity should also be explored. These treatment strategies deserve further investigation.","output":"The Counter Regulatory Axis of the Lung Renin-Angiotensin System in Severe COVID-19: Physiopathology and Clinical Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: As the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues, people with cystic fibrosis (CF) have been identified as being a vulnerable group.

Psychoeducational programs can reduce these negative outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether this virtual caregiver education program changes caregiver confidence, self-efficacy, and burden relative to controls. METHODS: This was a pre-post comparison of a five-week, synchronous, virtual caregiver education program delivered by a clinician and caregiver support specialist covering aspects of dementia, including changes in cognition, behavior, functional abilities, caregiver-care recipient roles, communication, and caregiver self-care. Caregivers (n = 90) were surveyed at baseline, at completion of intervention, and three months thereafter; controls (n = 44) were surveyed at two points six weeks apart. We compared validated measures of caregiver confidence, self-efficacy, and burden using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Participants confidence and self-efficacy increased over follow-up compared with controls (p < 0.01 for intervention(*)time in regression models). There was no difference in burden. All participants (100%) reported perceived increased knowledge, 97% perceived increased confidence, and 95% perceived increased ability to manage dementia-related behaviors after the course. CONCLUSION: This virtual caregiver education program was effective in improving caregiver confidence and self-efficacy and participants self-reported impact was equivalent to those who had taken previous courses in person. Caregivers with greater confidence and self-efficacy have been shown to have better health outcomes and decreased stress and depressive symptoms.

The mental health and individual adjustment to the COVID-19 situation are explained by socio-demographic factors, health-related factors, lifestyles, attitudes and behaviors, lockdown experience, and place of residence. A better adaptation and mental health are observed among men, people with a higher educational level, people with lower sadness, nervousness, and burnout, and people whose health situation did not worsen with the pandemic. In terms of lifestyle, a better adaptation is related to a better quality of sleep, fewer nightmares, a higher practice of physical activity, and less consumption of processed foods and sweets. A better adaptation is also associated with lower levels of dependence on alcohol, TV, and SN (social networks) and a more positive experience of the lockdown imposed by the pandemic. Gender and age group differences in the described context were studied.

The engagement with these virtual coaches could be improved by presenting users with tailored coaching dialogues. In this article, we investigate if the suggestion of an automatically tailored topic by an ECA leads to higher engagement by the user and thus longer sessions of interaction. METHODS: A Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) was conducted in which two types of interaction with an ECA were compared: (a) the coach suggests a relevant topic to discuss, and (b) the coach asks the user to select a topic from a set of options. Every time the user would interact with the ECA, one of those conditions would be randomly selected. Participants interacted in their daily life with the ECA that was part of a multi-agent health coaching application for 4C8 weeks. RESULTS: In two rounds, 82 participants interacted with the micro-randomized coach a total of 1011 times. Interactions in which the coach took the initiative were found to be of equal length as interactions in which the user was allowed to choose the topic, and the acceptance of topic suggestions was high (71.1% overall, 75.8% for coaching topics). CONCLUSION: Tailoring coaching conversations with ECAs by letting the coach automatically suggest a topic that is tailored to the user is perceived as a natural variation in the flow of interaction. Future research could focus on improving the novel coaching engine component that supports the topic selection process for these suggestions or on investigating how the amount of initiative and coaching approach by the ECA could be tailored.","output":"Automatic topic selection for long-term interaction with embodied conversational agents in health coaching: A micro-randomized trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"De.mem Ltd has added antimicrobial products to its portfolio to address the strong demand for items such as hand-sanitisers and surface disinfectants C in particular in Singapore C because of the coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Pandemic prompts De.mem to add anti-microbial products to its portfolio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suicide in people between the ages of 15 and 24 is one of the top three causes of death.

Describe the most common health-illness transitions experienced by patients with pancreatic cancer 2. Describe the relationship between management of health-illness transitions and psychological distress Original Research Background Health-illness transitions (HITs) include care transitions (changes in cancer status, treatment, or goals of care) and personal transitions (physical, emotional, social, or spiritual changes). Management of HITs is an important self-management skill because unmanaged HITs can increase distress. HITs experienced during pancreatic cancer have not been previously described, and patients with pancreatic cancer may have an abbreviated opportunity to learn self-management of HITs. Research Objectives To elucidate how patients with pancreatic cancer experience and manage HITs and whether HITs are associated with distress. Methods We enrolled patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. We assessed extent and management of HITs via the Measurement of Transitions in Cancer Scale and evaluated psychological distress via the Distress Thermometer (DT). Open-ended questions explored transitions not captured by the existing scale and the influence of COVID-19 on experience and management of HITs. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and clinical characteristics, HIT variables, and distress scores. We calculated Spearman's correlations between distress and unmanaged transitions and used thematic analysis for examination of qualitative data. Results Among 55 participants (median age = 70;98% pancreatic adenocarcinoma;median time since diagnosis = 4 months), all experienced at least 1 HIT and managed transitions moderately well. Physical (95%) and emotional (93%) transitions were most common. Unmanaged transitions and distress were correlated;severely distressed participants (7-10 on the DT) reported more HITs and worse management. Participants suggested new transition types: financial and caregiver. COVID-19 increased distress and complicated transition management. Participants reported that HITs made self-management more difficult and identified facilitators and barriers. Conclusion Patients with pancreatic cancer experience multiple HITs, which, when unmanaged, are associated with distress. Implications for Research, Policy, or Practice Findings about HITs can inform interventions targeting self-management skill building to alleviate distress and improve quality of life among patients with pancreatic cancer. Because HITs may vary for patients with different cancers, cancer-specific examination and intervention development will be needed.","output":"Health-Illness Transition Experiences Among Patients with Pancreatic Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study we propose a fractional frequency flexible Fourier form fractionally integrated ADF unit-root test, which combines the fractional integration and nonlinear trend as a form of the Fourier function.

The feasibility and efficacy of the VR-BRES prototype were investigated through a randomized crossover trial. Fifty healthy adults participated in the trial, and their respiratory parameters and user evaluation of the VR-BRES were compared with conventional deep breathing (CDB) exercises. RESULTS: The respiratory parameters, forced vital capacity (Z = 4.82, 4.95, p < .001), forced expiratory volume in one second (t = 6.02, 6.26, p < .001), and peak expiratory flow (t = 5.35, 5.68, p < .001) were significantly higher during breathing exercises using the VR-BRES.

We developed two COVID-19 vaccines based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-CoV2-S); their immunogenicity was evaluated in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunizations. Both vaccines induced robust, broad, and polyfunctional S-specific CD4(+) (mainly Th1) and CD8(+) T-cell responses, with a T effector memory phenotype. DNA/MVA immunizations elicited higher T-cell responses. All vaccine regimens triggered high titers of IgG antibodies specific for the S, as well as for the receptor-binding domain; the predominance of the IgG2c isotype was indicative of Th1 immunity. Notably, serum samples from vaccinated mice neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures, and those from MVA/MVA immunizations showed a higher neutralizing capacity. Remarkably, one or two doses of MVA-CoV2-S protect humanized K18-hACE2 mice from a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, two doses of MVA-CoV2-S confer full inhibition of virus replication in the lungs. These results demonstrate the robust immunogenicity and full efficacy of MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in animal models and support its translation to the clinic. IMPORTANCE The continuous dissemination of the novel emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus, with more than 78 million infected cases worldwide and higher than 1,700,000 deaths as of 23 December 2020, highlights the urgent need for the development of novel vaccines against COVID-19. With this aim, we have developed novel vaccine candidates based on the poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and we have evaluated their immunogenicity in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunization protocols. The results showed the induction of a potent S-specific T-cell response and high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Remarkably, humanized K18-hACE2 mice immunized with one or two doses of the MVA-based vaccine were 100% protected from SARS-CoV-2 lethality. Moreover, two doses of the vaccine prevented virus replication in lungs.

METHODS A total of 244 term neonates delivered by primary cesarean section were studied. In addition to routine monitoring with pulse oximetry, aEEG and NIRS measurements were performed during the first 15min after birth. The mean minimum (Vmin) and maximum (Vmax) amplitude of the cerebral activity as well as crSO2 and cFTOE for each minute was determined. Neonates with initial Vmin<5V or Vmax<10V, which normalized during transition (study group) were compared to neonates with normal aEEG values throughout the whole monitoring period (control group). RESULTS 9 neonates fulfilled inclusion criteria to the study group and were compared to 50 neonates in the control group. Vmin, Vmax, crSO2, SpO2 and cFTOE were compared from the 4th to 15thmin after birth. During our study period, Vmin and Vmax were significantly lower in the study group than in the control group. crSO2 was significantly lower in the study group until minute 11, dropping below the 10th centile in minute 8. cFTOE was significantly higher in the study group until minute 10, rising above the 90th centile in minutes 8 and 9.

RESULTS A novel polyomavirus, the giant panda polyomavirus 1 (GPPyV1) from the nasal cavity of a dead giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) was characterized. The GPPyV1 genome is 5144 bp in size and reveals five putative open-reading frames coding for the classic small and large T antigens in the early region, and the VP1, VP2 and VP3 capsid proteins in the late region. Phylogenetic analyses of the large T antigen of the GPPyV1 indicated GPPyV1 belonged to a putative new species within genus Deltapolyomavirus, clustering with four human polyomavirus species. The GPPyV1 VP1 and VP2 clustered with genus Alphapolyomavirus. Our epidemiologic study indicated that this novel polyomavirus was also detected in nasal swabs and fecal samples collected from captive healthy giant pandas.

The main research tool was a questionnaire on students' perceptions of their participation in the SVP. As a complementary qualitative method, we used semi-structured interviews with the volunteers. Our respondents (n = 158) perceived conditions and safety generally positively: most reported having personal protective equipment (89.24%), technical support (88.61%), and induction training (79.11%). Only 38.61% said they had access to psychological support. In our view, benefits (e.g., an opportunity to make new contacts or receiving positive reactions from patients and staff) seemed to outweigh costs. 65.82% of the respondents agreed that they learnt new interesting things. A majority noticed the development of their soft skills (social 86.08%; organisational 78.48%; stress management 68.99%), while 40.51% C the development of their medical skills. The interviews pointed to additional benefits for students such as gaining insight of the healthcare system, and costs such as distress caused by some patient interactions. We conclude that student volunteering could become a viable solution for health professions education. To maximise its educational potential, volunteers' needs must be explored, psychological support ensured, and opportunities for mentoring and reflection provided.

In the void created by a lack of clinical experience with COVID-19, artificial intelligence (AI) may be an important tool to bolster clinical judgment and decision making. However, a lack of clinical data restricts the design and development of such AI tools, particularly in preparation for an impending crisis or pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of a \\"patients-like-me\\" framework to predict the deterioration of patients with COVID-19 using a retrospective cohort of patients with similar respiratory diseases. METHODS: Our framework used COVID-19-like cohorts to design and train AI models that were then validated on the COVID-19 population. The COVID-19-like cohorts included patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, unspecified pneumonia, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at an academic medical center from 2008 to 2019. In total, 15 training cohorts were created using different combinations of the COVID-19-like cohorts with the ARDS cohort for exploratory purposes. In this study, two machine learning models were developed: one to predict invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 hours for each hospitalized day, and one to predict all-cause mortality at the time of admission. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. We established model interpretability by calculating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scores to identify important features. RESULTS: Compared to the COVID-19-like cohorts (n=16,509), the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n=159) were significantly younger, with a higher proportion of patients of Hispanic ethnicity, a lower proportion of patients with smoking history, and fewer patients with comorbidities (P<.001). Patients with COVID-19 had a lower IMV rate (15.1 versus 23.2, P=.02) and shorter time to IMV (2.9 versus 4.1 days, P<.001) compared to the COVID-19-like patients. In the COVID-19-like training data, the top models achieved excellent performance (AUROC>0.90). Validating in the COVID-19 cohort, the top-performing model for predicting IMV was the XGBoost model (AUROC=0.826) trained on the viral pneumonia cohort. Similarly, the XGBoost model trained on all 4 COVID-19-like cohorts without ARDS achieved the best performance (AUROC=0.928) in predicting mortality. Important predictors included demographic information (age), vital signs (oxygen saturation), and laboratory values (white blood cell count, cardiac troponin, albumin, etc). Our models had class imbalance, which resulted in high negative predictive values and low positive predictive values.

Methods SARS-CoV-2 was detected by reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction on viral RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs. WGS was performed using an Oxford MinION Mk1C instrument following the ARTIC v3 sequencing protocol. High quality consensus genomes were assembled with the artic-ncov2019 bioinformatics pipeline and viral phylogenetic trees were built, inferred by maximum-likelihood. Clusters were defined using a threshold of 0-1 SNPs between epidemiologically linked sequences. Results In April 2021, outbreaks of COVID-19 were declared on two wards at University Hospital Limerick after four healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected by post-admission surveillance testing. Contact tracing identified 12 further connected cases;all with direct or indirect links to the ED COVID Zone. All sequences were assigned to the Pangolin B.1.1.7 lineage by WGS, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-level analysis revealed two distinct but simultaneous clusters of infections. Repeated transmission in the ED was demonstrated, involving patients accommodated on trolleys in crowded areas, resulting in multiple generations of infections across three inpatient hospital wards and subsequently to the local community.

BACKGROUND The efficacy and safety of transradial access in CTO PCI has received limited study. METHODS We compared the technique and outcomes of transradial vs. transfemoral access among 650 CTO PCI cases performed between January 2012 and March 2014 at 6 US centers. RESULTS Most patients were men (87%) with high frequency of diabetes mellitus (42%) and prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (36%). The CTO target vessel was the right coronary (59%), left anterior descending (20%), or circumflex (17%) artery. TR access was used in 110 (17%) of the 650 cases, as follows: bilateral radial access (63%); bilateral radial access plus unilateral or bilateral femoral access (7%); unilateral radial access plus unilateral or bilateral femoral access (26%); and unilateral radial access (4%). Six and eight French guide catheters were used through the radial and femoral artery, respectively. Compared to transfemoral, transradial cases had similar technical (92.6% vs. 93.0%, P = 0.87) and procedural (91.1% vs. 90.0%, P = 0.95) success and major complication rates (1.7% vs 1.8%, P = 0.99).

OBJECTIVES: To describe the revision of two National Institutes of Health funded community-based palliative-focused clinical trials serving underserved populations to accommodate remote subject enrollment and examine its impact. METHODS: Transitioning to remote processes required multiple protocol and procedural changes including: altering informed consent processes; reducing the number of surveys administered; adding internet access as an inclusion criterion. To understand technological challenges, a screening tool was developed for one study to identify potentially eligible subjects technology abilities and accessibility. RESULTS: Subjects limited access to the internet and internet-enabled devices and discomfort with technology led to changes in recruitment patterns. Lack of familiarity with technology increased the amount of time it took research team members and subjects to connect remotely. Patients with significant cognitive and/or sensory deficits were at higher risk of experiencing fatigue during remote study visits leading to streamlining of data collection. A researcher-developed technology screening tool found that potential subjects were not comfortable with videoconferencing through Zoom expressing a preference for phone visits. Reduced travel time made scheduling remote study visits more efficient. CONCLUSION: Future community- and home-based palliative care trials must consider the best way to utilize remote recruitment, enrollment, and data collection processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

RESULTS: Sixty-three patients with HIV infection were analysed. The median age was 46 years (IQR: 37-56 years), 88.9% were men. The median time of HIV infection was 10.8 years (IQR: 6.5 - 16.8 years), 96.8% were on antiretroviral therapy. 84.1% had previous comorbidities. The most common symptoms were fever(66.1%), cough(66.1%) and dyspnea(46.8%). Pneumonia was found in 47.5%, 28.6% of patients had severe disease and 32.3% was admitted to hospital. The ICU admission rate and the mortality rate were both 3.17%. Significant association was observed between age, arterial hypertension, overweight, diabetes mellitus and the severity of COVID-19 disease. No association was observed between HIV-related factors.

Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and encoded proteins.

Due to its amphiphilic properties, glycyrrhizin can form self-associates (dimers, micelles) and supramolecular complexes with a wide range of hydrophobic drugs, which leads to an increase in their solubility, stability and bioavailability. That is why the mechanism of the biological activity of glycyrrhizin is of considerable interest and has been the subject of intensive physical and chemical research in the last decade. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effect of glycyrrhizin on drug bioavailability, namely, the increase in drug solubility in water and enhancement of the membrane permeability. Interest in the membrane-modifying ability of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is also growing at present due to its recently discovered antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 Bailly and Vergoten (2020) [1]. In the present study, the passive permeability of the DOPC lipid membrane for the calcium channel blocker nifedipine was elucidated by parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) and full atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with free energy calculations. PAMPA experiments show a remarkable increase in the amount of nifedipine (NF) permeated with glycyrrhizin compared to free NF. In previous studies, we have shown using MD techniques that glycyrrhizin molecules can integrate into the lipid bilayer. In this study, MD simulation demonstrates a significant decrease in the energy barrier of NF penetration through the lipid bilayer in the presence of glycyrrhizin both in the pure DOPC membrane and in the membrane with cholesterol. This effect can be explained by the formation of hydrogen bonds between NF and GA in the middle of the bilayer.","output":"Mechanism of the enhancing effect of glycyrrhizin on nifedipine penetration through a lipid membrane"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to significant changes in healthcare systems and its impact on the treatment of cardiovascular conditions, such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), is unknown in countries where the healthcare systems were not saturated, as was the case in Portugal. As such, we aimed to assess the effect on STEMI admissions and outcomes in Portuguese centers. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, observational, retrospective study including all patients admitted to our hospital due to STEMI between the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 case diagnosed in Portugal and the end of the state of emergency (March and April 2020). Patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed and compared with the same period of 2019. RESULTS: A total of 104 STEMI patients were assessed, 55 in 2019 and 49 in 2020 (-11%). There were no significant differences between groups regarding age (6212 vs. 6514 years, p=0.308), gender (84.8% vs. 77.6% males, p=0.295) or comorbidities. In the 2020 group, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of patients transported to the hospital in pre-hospital emergency medical transportation (38.2% vs. 20.4%, p=0.038), an increase in system delay (49 [30-110.25] vs. 140 [90-180] minutes, p=0.019), a higher Killip-Kimball class, with a decrease in class I (74.5% vs. 51%) and an increase in class III (1.8% vs. 8.2%) and IV (5.5% vs. 18.4%) (p=0.038), a greater incidence of vasoactive support (3.7% vs. 26.5%, p=0.001), invasive mechanic ventilation usage (3.6% vs. 14.3%, p=0.056), and an increase in severe left ventricular dysfunction at hospital discharge (3.6% vs. 16.3%, p=0.03). In-hospital mortality was 14.3% in the 2020 group and 7.3% in the 2019 group p=0.200). CONCLUSION: Despite a lack of significant variation in the absolute number of STEMI admissions, there was an increase in STEMI clinical severity and significantly worse outcomes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An increase in system delay, impaired pre-hospital care and patient fear of in-hospital infection can partially justify these results and should be the target of future actions in further waves of the pandemic.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on ST-elevation myocardial infarction admissions and outcomes in a Portuguese primary percutaneous coronary intervention center: Preliminary Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nature has long demonstrated the capacity to facilitate wellbeing.

A bilevel programming model is formulated where the lower-level is the transport system equilibrium with queueing to predict traffic inflow, and the upper-level is queueing network optimization, which is an integer nonlinear programming. The objective of this optimization is to minimize the total operation cost of checkpoints with a predetermined maximum waiting time. Note that stochastic queueing theory is used to represent the waiting phenomenon at each entry link. A heuristic algorithm is designed to solve the proposed bilevel model where the method of successive averages (MSA) is adopted for the lower-level model, and the genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted for the upper-level model. An experimental study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and algorithm. The results show that the methods can find a good heuristic optimal solution.

Objective: To assess outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged via the expected practice approach to home or quarantine housing with supplemental home oxygen. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 621 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were discharged from 2 large urban public hospitals caring primarily for patients receiving Medicaid from March 20 to August 19, 2020. Patients were included in the analysis cohort if they received emergency or inpatient care for COVID-19 and were discharged with home oxygen. Interventions: Patients receiving at least 3 L per minute of oxygen, stable without other indication for inpatient care, were discharged from either emergency or inpatient encounters with home oxygen equipment, educational resources, and nursing telephone follow-up within 12 to 18 hours of discharge. Nurses provided continued telephone follow up as indicated, always with physician back-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality and all-cause 30-day return admission. Results: A total of 621 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (404 male [65.1%] and 217 female [34.9%]) were discharged with home oxygen. Median age of these patients was 51 years (interquartile range, 45-61 years), with 149 (24.0%) discharged from the emergency department and 472 (76%) discharged from inpatient encounters. The all-cause mortality rate was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.5%) and the 30-day return hospital admission rate was 8.5% (95% CI, 6.2%-10.7%) with a median follow-up time of 26 days (interquartile range, 15-55 days). No deaths occurred in the ambulatory setting. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged on home oxygen had low rates of mortality and return admission within 30 days of discharge. Ambulatory management of COVID-19 with home oxygen has an acceptable safety profile, and the expected practice approach may help optimize outcomes, by ensuring right care in the right place at the right time and preserving access to acute care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Mortality and Readmission Rates Among Patients With COVID-19 After Discharge From Acute Care Setting With Supplemental Oxygen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Women with abdominal pain and bloating frequently have their Ca-125 levels investigated for suspected ovarian cancer and this has led to a significant increase in referrals to the ovarian cancer service. We have conducted this study to help improve the efficiency in which these patients are investigated and to improve future pathways within the referral service. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational outcome study. Data were collected from electronic documents of patients referrals, assessments, and clinical correspondences over 48 months. The study was conducted in a secondary gynaecology cancer centre with direct referrals from primary care. The pelvic mass clinic was set up to include a consultation and an ultrasound scan with support available for patients if required. All patients included were referred directly from primary care for suspected ovarian cancer with Ca-125 result over a period of 2 years. RESULTS: 286 were referred from primary care according to the NICE guidelines of 2-week wait for ovarian cancer. Only 223 patients who had a Ca-125 result reported at the time of their referral were included in the analysis. Out of the 223 patients, 126 patients were discharged with or without a repeat Ca-125 after the initial assessment. 18 patients were diagnosed with cancer following the referral, but only 12 of them had a primary ovarian malignancy. The malignancy rate in women under 50 years of age was 22% (4/18) and 78% (14/18) in women aged 50 or above. CONCLUSION: One-stop focused gynaecology ultrasound clinics where clinicians may assess patients and perform ultrasound scans for suspected cancer, may be better for managing this patient population due to improved efficiencies in waiting times, same day diagnosis and a reduction in waiting times to first appointment. Secondly, the majority of the patients with Ca-125 of more than 35 U/mL, who were referred through this pathway, did not have cancer. This review queries the future value of using Ca-125 as the basis for referrals from primary care for suspected ovarian malignancy. Further studies are required to assess whether a higher Ca-125 cut off may be used as the basis of referrals for premenopausal women.","output":"One-stop clinic for patients with suspected ovarian cancer: results from a retrospective outcome study of the referral pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the insertion of the Impella 5.0, a peripherally placed mechanical cardiovascular microaxial pump, in a patient with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.

This amino acid substitution occurs near the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding interface and gives rise to a canonical RGD adhesion motif that is often found in native extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin. In the present study, the ability of recombinant S1-RBD to bind to cell surface integrins and trigger downstream signaling pathways was assessed and compared to RGD-containing, integrin-binding fragments of fibronectin. S1-RBD supported adhesion of both fibronectin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as primary human small airway epithelial cells. Cell adhesion to S1-RBD was cation- and RGD-dependent, and was inhibited by blocking antibodies against (v) and (3), but not (5) or (1), integrins. Similarly, direct binding of S1-RBD to recombinant human (v)(3) and (v)(6) integrins, but not (5)(1) integrins, was observed by surface plasmon resonance. Adhesion to S1-RBD initiated cell spreading, focal adhesion formation, and actin stress fiber organization to a similar extent as fibronectin. Moreover, S1-RBD stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the adhesion mediators FAK, Src, and paxillin, Akt activation, and supported cell proliferation. Together, these data demonstrate that the RGD sequence within S1-RBD can function as an (v)-selective integrin agonist. This study provides evidence that cell surface (v-)containing integrins can respond functionally to spike protein and raise the possibility that S1-mediated dysregulation of ECM dynamics may contribute to the pathogenesis and/or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 is a functional v-integrin agonist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Towards the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the culprit for a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China Since then, it has rapidly spread worldwide, affecting more than 43 million people, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic The purpose of the study is to present the findings of 15 forensic autopsies performed in Romania, on SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) positive subjects, and to present the case of one SARS-CoV-2 infected patient who experienced a violent death, as established during their autopsy A total of 11 male and 4 female patients were autopsied, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed post-mortem in two cases The most frequent symptoms before death were dry cough, dyspnoea, and fever Hypertension, ischemic cardiac disease, and a history of stroke were the most frequent associated diseases The mean duration from the symptoms&rsquo;debut to a RT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 test was 3 7 days, while the mean survival time from the RT-PCR positive test was 4 2 days A histological examination was performed in seven cases and revealed, in most of them, hyaline membranes, and mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the interstitium, alveoli, and perivascular areas In addition, all of the examined cases developed small vessel thrombosis A case of violent death was also reported, regarding a 87-year-old male subject who suffered a femur fracture (domestic fall) and was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection the following day after surgery After transfer to a COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19) support hospital, during an episode of behavioral disorder, the patient jumped from the first floor window Death occurred a few days later, and the cause was established as bronchopneumonia superimposed on SARS-CoV-2 infection In conclusion, autopsies should be conducted while providing a safe environment for professionals to perform them, because they are crucial procedures that can help gain a better understanding of the role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in thanatogenesis","output":"Post-Mortem Diagnosis and Autopsy Findings in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Forensic Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Definition und H?ufigkeit.

However, the protective mechanisms of intestinal damage caused by RV are poorly defined, especially the molecular pathways related to enterocytes apoptosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of sodium butyrate (SB) on RV-induced apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells. RESULTS: The RV infection led to significant cell apoptosis, increased the expression levels of ER stress (ERS) markers, phosphorylated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2), caspase9, and caspase3. Blocking PERK pathway using specific inhibitor GSK subsequently reversed RV-induced cell apoptosis. The SB treatment significantly inhibited RV-induced ERS by decreasing the expression of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), PERK, and eIF2. In addition, SB treatment restrained the ERS-mediated apoptotic pathway, as indicated by downregulation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA level, as well as decreased cleaved caspase9 and caspase3 protein levels. Furthermore, siRNA-induced GPR109a knockdown significantly suppressed the protective effect of SB on RV-induced cell apoptosis.

While antisense oligonucleotides are used to block oncomiRs, delivery of tumour-suppressive miRNAs holds great potential as a potent anti-cancer strategy. Here, we aim to determine, and functionally analyse, miRNAs that are lowly expressed in various types of tumour but abundantly expressed in multiple normal tissues. METHODS: The miRNA sequencing data of 14 cancer types were downloaded from the TCGA dataset. Significant differences in miRNA expression between tumor and normal samples were calculated using limma package (R programming). An adjusted p value < 0.05 was used to compare normal versus tumor miRNA expression profiles. The predicted gene targets were obtained using TargetScan, miRanda, and miRDB and then subjected to gene ontology analysis using Enrichr. Only GO terms with an adjusted p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data from wet-lab experiments (cell viability assays and flow cytometry) were expressed as means  SEM, and their differences were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (Students t test, p < 0.05). RESULTS: By compiling all publicly available miRNA profiling data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer Project, we reveal a small set of tumour-suppressing miRNAs (which we designate as normomiRs) that are highly expressed in 14 types of normal tissues but poorly expressed in corresponding tumour tissues. Interestingly, muscle-enriched miRNAs (e.g. miR-133a/b and miR-206) and miRNAs from DLK1-DIO3 locus (e.g. miR-381 and miR-411) constitute a large fraction of the normomiRs. Moreover, we define that the CCCGU motif is absent in the oncomiRs seed sequences but present in a fraction of tumour-suppressive miRNAs. Finally, the gain of function of candidate normomiRs across several cancer cell types indicates that miR-206 and miR-381 exert the most potent inhibition on multiple cancer types in vitro.

METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The ability of DNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from different HPAI H5N1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5N1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after DNA immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device. These vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of HPAI H5N1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 HAs. The response was dose-dependent, and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus HA in the vaccine. Monovalent and trivalent HA vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination. In chickens, protection was observed against heterologous strains of HPAI H5N1 after vaccination with a trivalent H5 serotype DNA vaccine with doses as low as 5 g DNA given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: DNA vaccines offer a generic approach to influenza virus immunization applicable to multiple animal species. In addition, the ability to substitute plasmids encoding different strains enables rapid adaptation of the vaccine to newly evolving field isolates.","output":"Multivalent HA DNA Vaccination Protects against Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Infection in Chickens and Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine can be a component of integrated healthcare practices and its use is not a recent phenomenon around the world. In Brazil, its more widespread use began during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, through extraordinary authorization from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. OBJECTIVES: To describe some aspects of use of teleconsultation among a sample of physicians in the state of S?o Paulo during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study based on a survey conducted by the S?o Paulo Medical Association (Associa??o Paulista de Medicina, APM) on medical practice during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic between December 18, 2020, and January 18, 2021. RESULTS: This survey generated responses from 2,052 physicians. Of these, 981 (47.8%) reported not practicing any form of telemedicine. Among those who reported practicing telemedicine, 274 (28.4%) reported not receiving remuneration directly for the attendance provided and 225 (23.3%) reported receiving remuneration equal to what they would have received from face-to-face consultations. Regarding the professional linkage of the physicians who undertook telemedicine attendance, the majority (499; 51.8%) only attended private patients. Regarding the resources used to provide telemedicine attendance, most of the respondents used specialized digital platforms (594; 61.6%), electronic health records (592; 61.4%) and electronic prescriptions (700; 72.6%).

Introduction: The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection. The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methodology: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Results: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained blanket testing rate of [] 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of [] 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of [] 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. Discussion and conclusion: Our model predicts that the current testing rates of {approx} 150/100,000 population are inadequate to control transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in Lusaka. Active isolation of COVID-19 cases including asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia.

METHODS: an online survey was shared with orthopaedic surgeons practicing in different countries. RESULTS: this study showed that orthopaedic surgery plan management was adapted to respond more effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining the continuity of health care and ensuring protection of medical staff and patients. Among the introduced measures, elective surgery was postponed to free-up beds for suspected or COVID-19 positive patients requiring hospitalization. Additionally, the number of outpatient visits was considerably decreased and non-urgent visits were postponed to reduce the flow of patients in and out of hospitals and therefore minimize the risk of contamination. Interestingly, data revealed the willingness of orthopaedic surgeons to take care of COVID-19 positive patients and support their colleagues in intensive care units, if needed. CONCLUSION: orthopaedic surgery departments have adapted their programs to face the unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quick measures were taken to reduce the risk of contamination in patients, medical staff and to allow hospitals to free up beds for treatment of patients with positive or suspected COVID-19.","output":"Orthopaedic surgeons' perceptions and attitudes on COVID-19 related changes in practice: an international cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In order to manage the COVID-19 systemic inflammatory response, it is important to identify clinicopathological characteristics across multiple cohorts. Methods: Electronic patient records for 2 consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to two urban teaching hospitals with COVID-19 during two 7-week periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow, U.K. (cohort 1: 17th March 2020 - 1st May 2020) and (cohort 2: 18th May 2020 - 6th July 2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data. Results: Compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p<0.001), more likely to be female (p<0.05) and have less independent living circumstances (p<0.001). More patients in cohort 2 were PCR positive, CXR negative (both p<0.001) and had low serum albumin concentrations (p<0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between both cohorts (23% and 22%).

The success of an approved vaccine in stopping or slowing the pandemic will ultimately depend on the publics acceptance of it. As studies indicate that people perceive COVID-19 as a threatening disease, the demand for a vaccine could be expected to be high. However, vaccine safety concerns might still outweigh the perceived disease risks in a decision to vaccinate against COVID-19. In the present paper, the role of perceived risk of COVID-19 (i.e., perceived likelihood of infection, perceived disease severity, and disease-related worry) and trust in the safety of a prospective vaccine against COVID-19 in predicting intentions to accept a COVID-19 vaccine was investigated. Methods: Three Finnish samples were surveyed: 856 parents of small children, 205 individuals living in an area with suboptimal vaccination coverage, and 1,325 Facebook users nationwide. As points of reference, we compared the perceptions of COVID-19 to those of influenza and measles. Results: COVID-19 was perceived as a threatening diseasemore so than influenza and measles. The strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intentions was trusting the safety of the potential vaccine. Those perceiving COVID-19 as a severe disease were also slightly more intent on taking a COVID-19 vaccine.

Macrophages are one of the critical cells linking the innate and adaptive immune system, and it has been shown that MSCs can differentiate between pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype of macrophages. However, it has not yet been fully clarified whether these differentiated macrophages are functional. In this study, we compared the immunomodulatory effects on the CD4 T cells of M1, M2a and M2c macrophages with the macrophages that directly and indirectly cultured with MSCs. We analyzed the changes in CD14, CD64, CD80, CD163 and CD200R expression to evaluate macrophage phenotypes, and the changes in CD4, IFN-g, IL-4, IL-17a and FoxP3 expression to evaluate T helper subsets using the FACS method. The changes in IL-1b, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17a and IFN-g in the media supernatants were analyzed using the Luminex method. We also performed WST-1 and Caspase-3 ELISA analyses to observe the proliferation and apoptosis status of the T cells. MSCs were found to differentiate macrophages into a distinctive phenotype, which was close to the M2c phenotype, but was not considered as an M2c cell due to the low expression of CD163, a characteristic marker for M2c. While MEM-D, MEM-ID and MSCs showed similar inhibitory effects on the Th2 and Th17 cells, the most significant increase in Treg cell frequencies was seen in MEM-D cells. Macrophages can alter their phenotypes and functions according to the stimuli from the environment. The fact that macrophages educated with MSCs suppressed the production of all the cytokines we evaluated even after the removal of MSCs suggests that these cells may be differentiated by MSCs into a suppressive macrophage subgroup. However, the Treg cell activation caused by direct interactions between MSCs and macrophage cells may be the most prominent observation of this study compared to previous work. As a result, according to our data, the interactions between MSCs and macrophages may lead to differentiation of macrophage cells into an immunosuppressive phenotype, and these macrophages may suppress the T lymphocyte subgroups at least as effectively as MSCs.

In Canada and internationally, follow-up care continues to be delivered most often by oncologists in institution-based settings. There is extensive evidence to demonstrate that this model of care does not work well for many survivors or our cancer systems. Randomized controlled trials have clearly demonstrated that alternate approaches to follow-up care are equivalent to oncologist-led follow-up in terms of patient outcomes, such as recurrence, survival, and quality of life in a number of common cancers. In this paper, we discuss the state of follow-up care for survivors of prevalent cancers and the need for more personalized models of follow-up. Indeed, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to post-treatment follow-up care, and more personalized approaches to follow-up that are based on individual risks and needs after cancer treatment are warranted. Canada lags behind when it comes to personalizing follow-up care for cancer survivors. There are many reasons for this, including difficulty in determining who is best served by different follow-up pathways, a paucity of evidence-informed self-management education and supports for most survivors, poorly developed IT solutions and systems, and uneven coordination of care.

COVID-19 cases and case fatality rate (CFR) of the world have been summarized and compared with India from January 22, 2020 to April 15, 2020. Indian cases were analyzed among states of India and also compared with age and gender by performing statistical approaches such as central tendency, standard deviation and interquartile range. By April 15, 2020, Indian has reported 12,322 confirmed cases, 1,498 recovered cases and 405 death cases of COVID-19. In spite of India being a diverse country with the secondhighest population, the deadly side of COVID-19 was comparatively far less as compared to the other countries. India has taken preemptive measures at an early stage to prevent transmission of COVID-19 outbreak and it is reviewed from our study by comparing India with other countries. Our study also summarizes that age also plays a vital role in the intervention of COVID-19 cases.","output":"Analytical review of COVID-19 outbreak in India during the global pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite critical progress registered in the reduction of mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV worldwide, transmission through breastfeeding still contributes to almost 50% of pediatric HIV infections recorded every year. In this short narrative review, after development of an extensive background on HIV and breastfeeding, some directions are suggested to address the key bottlenecks. Specifically, reinforcing the prevention of MTCT through breastfeeding (BF) in order to move towards elimination of MTCT prior to 2030 may require, among others strategies: tracking all women of child bearing age through HIV testing, improving testing and retesting of women during pregnancy and breastfeeding, strengthening adherence on antiretroviral therapy (ART) among pregnant and lactating women, ensuring continuum and retention in care of mother and baby-pairs up to 24 months, switching ART in non-viral suppressed mothers after improvement of adherence counseling. In addition, due to the burden of seroconversion during pregnancy or thereafter through BF, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) for most at risk women should be implemented urgently. The opportunity to extend the infant prophylaxis to the whole lactating period should be assessed to address residual transmission amongst viral suppressed mothers.","output":"Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV Through Breastfeeding Improving Awareness and Education: A Short Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this report, we show that apoptosis (or programmed cell death) is induced in different cell lines infected with a coronavirus, the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Kinetic analysis of internucleosomal DNA cleavage by agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry or cytometric monitoring of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential showed that, for ST cells infected with TGEV, the first overt signs of apoptosis appeared from 10 to 12 h postinfection on. They preceded morphological changes characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis, as observed by light and electron microscopy. The tripeptide pan-ICE (caspase) inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone blocked TGEV-induced apoptosis with no effect on virus production. The thiol agent pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate inhibited apoptosis, suggesting that TGEV infection may lead to apoptosis via cellular oxidative stress. The effect of TGEV infection on activation of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor known to be activated by oxidative stress, was examined. NF-kappaB DNA binding was shown to be strongly and quickly induced by TGEV infection. However, transcription factor decoy experiments showed that NF-kappaB activation is not critical for TGEV-induced apoptosis.","output":"Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus induces programmed cell death in infected cells through a caspase-dependent pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To design and test the psychometric properties of four context-specific norm-related scales around handwashing with soap after toilet use: (1) perceived handwashing descriptive norms (HWDN); (2) perceived handwashing injunctive norms (HWIN); (3) perceived handwashing behaviour publicness (HWP); and (4) perceived handwashing outcome expectations (HWOE). DESIGN: Scale items were developed based on previous work and pilot tested in an iterative process. Content experts and members of the study team assessed the face validity of the items. The psychometric properties of the scales were assessed in a cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study was conducted in communal housing compounds in Abidjan, C?te dIvoire. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 201 adult residents (16 years old) from 60 housing compounds completed the final questionnaire. OUTCOME MEASURE: Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the goodness of fit of the global model. We assessed the internal consistency of each scale using Cronbachs alpha () and the Spearman-Brown coefficient (). RESULTS: The results of the psychometric tests supported the construct validity of three of the four scales, with no factor identified for the HWOE (=0.15). The HWDN and HWP scales were internally consistent with correlations of =0.74 and =0.63, respectively. The HWIN scale appeared reliable (=0.83). CONCLUSION: We were able to design three reliable context-specific handwashing norm-related scales, specific to economically disadvantaged community settings in Abidjan, C?te dIvoire, but failed to construct a reliable scale to measure outcome expectations around handwashing. The social desirability of handwashing and the narrow content area of social norms constructs relating to handwashing present significant challenges when designing items to measure such constructs. Future studies attempting to measure handwashing norm-related constructs will need to take this into account when developing such scales, and take care to adapt their scales to their study context.","output":"Measuring social norms related to handwashing: development and psychometric testing of measurement scales in a low-income urban setting in Abidjan, C?te dIvoire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Previous pandemics have resulted in significant consequences for mental health. Here, we report the mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic in a UK cohort and examine modifiable and non-modifiable explanatory factors associated with mental health outcomes. We focus on the first wave of data collection, which examined short-term consequences for mental health, as reported during the first 4C6 weeks of social distancing measures being introduced. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. SETTING: Community cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: N=3097 adults aged 18 years were recruited through a mainstream and social media campaign between 3 April 2020 and 30 April 2020. The cohort was predominantly female (n=2618); mean age 44 years; 10% (n=296) from minority ethnic groups; 50% (n=1559) described themselves as key workers and 20% (n=649) identified as having clinical risk factors putting them at increased risk of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety and stress scores. RESULTS: Mean scores for depression ([Formula: see text] =7.69, SD=6.0), stress ([Formula: see text] =6.48, SD=3.3) and anxiety ([Formula: see text] = 6.48, SD=3.3) significantly exceeded population norms (all p<0.0001). Analysis of non-modifiable factors hypothesised to be associated with mental health outcomes indicated that being younger, female and in a recognised COVID-19 risk group were associated with increased stress, anxiety and depression, with the final multivariable models accounting for 7%C14% of variance. When adding modifiable factors, significant independent effects emerged for positive mood, perceived loneliness and worry about getting COVID-19 for all outcomes, with the final multivariable models accounting for 54%C57% of total variance. CONCLUSIONS: Increased psychological morbidity was evident in this UK sample and found to be more common in younger people, women and in individuals who identified as being in recognised COVID-19 risk groups. Public health and mental health interventions able to ameliorate perceptions of risk of COVID-19, worry about COVID-19 loneliness and boost positive mood may be effective.","output":"Mental health in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional analyses from a community cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Evidence relating to long-term outcomes of online education programs is largely lacking and head-to-head comparisons of different delivery formats are very rare. The aims of the study were to test whether eLearning Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) or blended training (eLearning plus face-to-face course delivery), implemented in an Australian public sector workplace, were more effective than a control intervention at 1-year and 2-year follow-up, and whether blended MHFA training was more effective than eLearning alone. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Australian public servants (n = 608 at baseline) were randomly assigned to complete an eLearning MHFA course, a blended MHFA course or Red Cross eLearning Provide First Aid (PFA) (the control) and completed online questionnaires pre- and post-training and one and two years later (n = 289, n = 272, n = 243 at post, 1- and 2-year follow-up respectively). The questionnaires were based on vignettes describing a person with depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Primary outcomes were mental health first aid knowledge, desire for social distance and quality of support provided to a person in the workplace. Secondary outcomes were recognition of mental health problems, beliefs about treatment, helping intentions and confidence, personal stigma, quality of support provided to a person outside the workplace, self-reported professional help seeking and psychological distress. RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, both eLearning and blended courses produced greater improvements than PFA training in knowledge, confidence and intentions to help a person with depression or PTSD, beliefs about dangerousness and desire for social distance. At 2-year follow-up, some of these improvements were maintained, particularly those relating to knowledge and intentions to help someone with PTSD. When eLearning and blended courses were compared at 1-year follow-up, the blended course led to greater improvements in knowledge and in confidence and intentions to help a person with depression. At 2-year follow-up, improvements in the quality of help provided to a person with a mental health problem outside the workplace were greater in participants in the blended course. CONCLUSIONS: Both blended and eLearning MHFA courses led to significant longer-term improvements in knowledge, attitudes and intentions to help a person with a mental health problem. Blended MHFA training led to an improvement in the quality of helping behaviours and appears to be more effective than online training alone.

We contrast these affinities with HLA allele frequencies across hundreds of human populations worldwide. Statistical modelling shows that peptide\\\\binding affinities classified into four distinct categories depend on the HLA locus but that the type of virus is only a weak predictor, except in the case of HIV\\\\1. Among the strong HLA binders (IC(50)  50), we uncovered 16 alleles (the top ones being A*02:02, B*15:03 and DRB1*01:02) binding more than 1% of peptides derived from all viruses, 9 (top ones including HLA\\\\A*68:01, B*15:25, C*03:02 and DRB1*07:01) binding all viruses except HIV\\\\1, and 15 (top ones A*02:01 and C*14:02) only binding coronaviruses. The frequencies of strongest and weakest HLA peptide binders differ significantly among populations from different geographic regions. In particular, Indigenous peoples of America show both higher frequencies of strongest and lower frequencies of weakest HLA binders. As many HLA proteins are found to be strong binders of peptides derived from distinct viral families, and are hence promiscuous (or generalist), we discuss this result in relation to possible signatures of natural selection on HLA promiscuous alleles due to past pathogenic infections. Our findings are highly relevant for both evolutionary genetics and the development of vaccine therapies. However they should not lead to forget that individual resistance and vulnerability to diseases go beyond the sole HLA allelic affinity and depend on multiple, complex and often unknown biological, environmental and other variables.","output":"Binding affinities of 438 HLA proteins to complete proteomes of seven pandemic viruses and distributions of strongest and weakest HLA peptide binders in populations worldwide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS We investigated the incidence of suture complications and recurrent prolapse following uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS) using delayed absorbable polyglyconate monofilament suture (Maxon).

She initially presented with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix and was treated with concurrent chemoradiation followed by high-dose rate brachytherapy. Six months later, she developed an insidious onset of pain and swelling in the right thumb, erythema, and edema, mimicking cellulitis. DIAGNOSIS A biopsy of the soft tissues of the thumb was performed, and the histopathology indicated metastasis of adenocarcinoma to the bone and soft tissues. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES The patient rejected further treatment and died of progressive disease 4 months after the diagnosis of the recurrence.

After natural disasters and during wartime, people must repurpose the materials and processes available to make shelter, distribute food, etc. Repurposing is equally important in professional life (e.g. clinicians often repurpose medicines off-license) and in addressing societal challenges (e.g. finding new roles for waste products,).

Telehealth has been used relatively well in patients from remote regions with limited access to subspecialty healthcare providers. This article discusses novel ways of using telehealth during the current pandemic and measures that would need to be taken to sustain telehealth and teleconsultations. RECENT FINDINGS Telehealth has expanded to outpatient pediatric cardiology clinics across the globe during the pandemic. Technological advancements in video conferencing and the abundance of readily available wearable devices have allowed cardiologists to establish a preliminary diagnosis and set forth a treatment plan. Additional support by insurance providers and relaxation of mandatory regulations by the government have allowed telehealth to succeed during the pandemic. Although many subdisciplines within pediatric cardiology can be easily adapted into a sustainable telehealth model, some unique patient interactions, such as fetal cardiology, exercise physiology, and echocardiograms cannot be done remotely. The field of telehealth medicine with HIPAA-compliant programs and both insurance and government support should remain in our armamentarium of available resources for all patients and families. SUMMARY Although not unique to pediatric cardiology, telehealth has emerged as an avenue to perform an initial evaluation and even establish a care pathway for patients. It is well recognized that telehealth visits will not supplant all patient--physician interactions but is a very acceptable first step in the majority of cases and can often steer the patient to subsequently undergo more selective and streamlined care.","output":"COVID-19 will forever change the landscape of telemedicine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid emergence of covid-19 variants by continuous mutation made the world experience continuous waves of infections and as a result, a huge number of death-toll recorded so far. It is, therefore, very important to investigate the diversity and nature of the mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. In this study, the common mutations occurred in the whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants of Bangladesh in a certain timeline were analyzed to better understand its status. Hence, a total of 78 complete genome sequences available in the NCBI database were obtained, aligned and further analyzed. Scattered Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified throughout the genome of variants and common SNPs such as: 241:C>T in the 5UTR of Open Reading Frame 1A (ORF1A), 3037: C>T in Non-structural Protein 3 (NSP3), 14,408: C>T in ORF6 and 23,402: A>G, 23,403: A>G in Spike Protein (S) were observed, but all of them were synonymous mutations. About 97% of the studied genomes showed a block of tri-nucleotide alteration (GGG>AAC), the most common non-synonymous mutation in the 28,881C28,883 location of the genome. This block results in two amino acid changes (203C204: RG>KR) in the SR rich motif of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, introducing a lysine in between serine and arginine. The N protein structure of the mutant was predicted through protein modeling. However, no observable difference was found between the mutant and the reference (Wuhan) protein. Further, the protein stability changes upon mutations were analyzed using the I-Mutant2.0 tool. The alteration of the arginine to lysine at the amino acid position 203, showed reduction of entropy, suggesting a possible impact on the overall stability of the N protein.

To better understand how airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs, we sought to determine viral loads within coarse (>5m) and fine (5m) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing. METHODS: Using a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing. RESULTS: Thirteen participants (59%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged from 63C5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per participant, with high person-to-person variation. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA. Two participants, sampled on day 3 of illness, accounted for 52% of the total viral load. Overall, 94% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were emitted by talking and singing. Interestingly, 7 participants emitted more virus from talking than singing. Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Fine aerosols produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Exposure to fine aerosols, especially indoors, should be mitigated. Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an urgent enquiry necessitating larger-scale studies.","output":"Viral Load of SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory Aerosols Emitted by COVID-19 Patients while Breathing, Talking, and Singing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsTo estimate the associations between high-risk alcohol consumption and (1) SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, (2) self-reported new SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (3) symptomatic COVID-19. DesignProspective cohort SettingIndiana University Bloomington (IUB), a public university of 34,660 students in southern Indiana. ParticipantsAt the beginning of the fall 2020 semester, we randomly sampled N=1,267 IU undergraduate students, aged 18 years or older and residing in Monroe County, IN. MeasurementsPrimary exposure was high-risk alcohol consumption measured with the AUDIT questionnaire. We used an AUDIT score of 8 or more as the cut-off score when detecting high-risk alcohol consumption. Primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, assessed with two SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, at baseline and endline. Secondary outcomes were a) self-reported new SARS-CoV-2 infection at the study endline, and b) self-reported symptomatic COVID-19 at baseline. FindingsPrevalence of high-risk alcohol consumption was 34%. We found that students with high-risk alcohol consumption status had 2.34 [95% CI: (1.29, 4.24)] times the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and 1.89 [95% CI: (1.08, 3.32)] times the risk of self-reporting a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to students with no such risk. Moreover, students with high-risk alcohol consumption were 18% more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19, though this association was not statistically significant. Similar results were found after adjusting for sex at birth, race, and year in school. Findings from sensitivity analyses corroborated these results and suggested potential for a dose-response relationship.

We have investigated the incidence and impact of key bacterial/fungal infections in COVID-19 persons in England. METHODS: We extracted laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases (01/01/2020-02/06/2020) and blood and lower-respiratory specimens positive for 24 genera/species of clinical relevance (01/01/2020-30/06/2020) from Public Health Englands national laboratory surveillance system. We defined coinfection and secondary infection as a culture-positive key organism, isolated within 1-day, or 2-27 days, respectively of the SARS-CoV-2 positive date. We described the incidence and timing of bacterial/fungal infections and compared characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without bacterial/fungal infection. RESULTS: One-percent (n=2,279/223,413) of COVID-19 persons in England had co/secondary infection, >65% were bloodstream infections. The most common causative organisms were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cases with co/secondary infections were older than without (median 70-years [IQR:58-81] vs 55-years [IQR:38-77]), and a higher percentage of cases with secondary infection were of Black or Asianst ethnicity than cases without (67% vs 41%, and 99% vs 82%, respectively, p<0001).

To our knowledge, this is the first case-series to explore long-term buprenorphine treatment for loperamide use disorder.

SP-D binds to specific pathogen surfaces through its carbohydrate recognition (lectin) domain, that helps in their neutralization and clearance by phagocytes. SP-D also acts as an anti-inflammatory molecule. We hypothesized that SP-D plays a protective role in COVID-19. Methods: Polar+, a novel quantum computing algorithm for molecular pruning, and classical in silico modeling were used to investigate potential binding sites between SP-D and SARS CoV2. Electronegativity and topologically oriented molecular pruning, calculation of electronic force-fields and electrostatic binding combined with protein-protein docking, geometric fitting and assessment of protein glycosylation sites were employed. SP-D-/- mouse lung was used to study expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry molecules TMPRSS2 and ACE2. Plasma from COVID-19 patients was studied for SP-D leakage, cytokine levels and lipid mediators. Results: We found that SP-D potentially binds to the same SARS CoV-2 glycoprotein (S protein) that it utilizes to bind the cellular receptor, ACE2, with high affinity. However, SP-D binds to subunit 2, instead of subunit 1 (that ACE2 utilizes). Additional studies will need to determine if SP-D binding affects S protein and ACE2 interactions. We also found that SP-D-/- mice had increased expression of the TMRSS2 gene in the lung and that both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 mRNA levels were increased during lung injury, amplified by the lack of SP-D. SP-D leakage from the lung to the circulation was significantly increased in COVID- 19 patients and correlated with expression of pro-neutrophilic inflammatory markers. Conclusions: We speculate that SP-D aids in the protection from SARS CoV2 infection by both acting as a potential natural decoy to prevent coronavirus entry into airway epithelial cells and by attenuating the expression of the viral entry receptor TMPRSS2. Oxidative lung injury results in SP-D leak into the circulation denoting disease severity in COVID-19 patients.

Eligible studies had to: include Italian children and adolescents; report data for one or more sleep-related variables; be published in English or Italian. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were selected including 18551 Italian children or adolescents. Studies were categorized by age group: infancy and toddlerhood (0-3 years); preschool and school age (3-12 years); adolescence (12-18 years) and mixed age groups. Overall, studies showed that the Italian pediatric population present shorter sleep duration and longer sleep onset latency compared to international recommendations. Furthermore, data indicate high prevalence of dysfunctional sleep habits, such as late bed-time (all age groups), involvement of parents during bed-time (infancy and toddlerhood), and high variability between sleep times on week-days vs. weekends (adolescence).

There are limited data on the risk of severe disease or outcomes in patients with concurrence of TB and COVID-19. Nevertheless, co-infection of some virus would aggravate TB, such as measles. And tuberculosis and influenza co-infection compared with tuberculosis single infection was associated with increased risk of death in individuals. This review will also introduce the characteristics about the concurrence of TB and emerging infectious diseases to provide a hint to manage current epidemic.","output":"COVID-19 and Tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease- 2019 is yet to be defeated It is primarily a viral respiratory illness, with a myriad of clinical presentations being reported, since it was first identified towards the end of 2019 in China Apart from the classical symptoms of fever, cough, and dyspnea, atypical presentations in COVID-19 patients, have puzzled healthcare workers worldwide Patients with isolated non- respiratory complaints like diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, skin rash, and confusion, have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 The symptoms of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction have recently been added to the list for screening suspected cases after their prevalence was found to be high among COVID-19 patients This article elaborates on the system-wise manifestations of COVID-19 and discusses the clinical implications of these aberrant presentations to healthcare workers","output":"The Myriad of Clinical Presentations of COVID-19: a Short Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus or Covid-19 epidemic has stricken the imagination The fear of a total collapse of advanced countries health system gave birth to what has been called the lock-down of major economies These measures also have a cost Obviously, the longer would the lock-down situation go, the higher its economic cost But, at some point, we could have some irreversible consequences as the number of Small or Very Small enterprises going bankrupt could reach a critical mass One could then ask the question to know if the health emergency linked to epidemic is not paving the way to major an economic crisis, one that could dwarf all other post-1945 crises The end of the containment is not to simply jump-start the economy The level of depression experienced during the lock-down situation would be a serious indicator to estimate the duration of the return to a pre-Covid situation The difficulty in initially estimating the extent of this crisis can be understood However, various governments clearly underestimated the gravity of the situation, like the French and the Italian ones, until the beginning of April 2020 They also continue for some, like the French government, to underestimate the extent of the recession We have attempted in this text to produce realistic estimates and in the subsequent paper we are comparing our estimates with others, be they produced by public bodies or by private ones If the drop in production figures is actually closer to the level of the 1929 crisis, what is new is the speed with which production is almost at a standstill As with the 1929 depression the number of changes, for the better or for the worse, is to be extremely important","output":"Would the lock-down induced economic contraction be a prelude to a major depression?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initial hopes for a quick disappearance of COVID-19 seem to fade away gradually, partially due to the emergence of new virus variants, which come with an inherent possibility for breakthrough infections.

It is commonly believed that this bacterium avoids major immune recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) because of low intrinsic activity of its flagellin and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In particular, TLR5 specifically detects flagellins in various bacterial pathogens, while Hp evolved mutations in flagellin to evade detection through TLR5. Cancerogenic Hp strains encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS core component and pilus-associated protein CagY, a large VirB10 ortholog, drives effector molecule translocation. Here, we identify CagY as a flagellin-independent TLR5 agonist. We detect five TLR5 interaction sites, promoting binding of CagY-positive Hp to TLR5-expressing cells, TLR5 stimulation, and intracellular signal transduction. Consequently, CagY constitutes a remarkable VirB10 member detected by TLR5, driving crucial innate immune responses by this human pathogen.","output":"Toll-like Receptor 5 Activation by the CagY Repeat Domains of Helicobacter pylori."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged in 2012, and over 2000 infections and 800 deaths have been confirmed in 27 countries. However, to date, no commercial vaccine is available. In this study, structural proteins of MERS-CoV were expressed in silkworm larvae and Bm5 cells for the development of vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV and diagnostic methods. The spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV lacking its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (STM) was secreted into the hemolymph of silkworm larvae using a bombyxin signal peptide and purified using affinity chromatography. The purified STM forms small nanoparticles as well as the full-length S protein and has the ability to bind human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is a receptor of MERS-CoV. These results indicate that bioactive STM was expressed in silkworm larvae. To produce MERS-CoV-like particles (MERS-CoV-LPs), the coexpression of spike proteins was performed in Bm5 cells and envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins secreted E and M proteins extracellularly, suggesting that MERS-CoV-LPs may be formed. However, this S protein was not displayed on virus-like particles (VLPs) even though E and M proteins were secreted into the culture supernatant. By surfactant treatment and mechanical extrusion using S protein- or three structural protein-expressing Bm5 cells, S protein-displaying nanovesicles with diameters of approximately 100-200 nm were prepared and confirmed by immuno-TEM. The mechanical extrusion method is favorable for obtaining uniform recombinant protein-displaying nanovesicles from cultured cells.

Six patients received no antigen (relatives), 15 patients one antigen, five patients two antigen and three patients three antigen disparate grafts. Twenty-three patients were in class 2 or class 3, whereas six patients were in class 1. Thirteen patients were given BUCY, nine patients BUCY plus ALG, six patients BUCY plus TBI or TLI and one patient BUCY with prior cytoreductive-immunosuppressive treatment as conditioning.

The incidence of grade IICIV acute GVHD was 47.3% and chronic GVHD was 37.5%. The incidence of acute GVHD was higher in patients receiving one or two antigen disparate in the GVHD direction grafts (vs no antigen) (P EQ 0.04; odds ratio 10.8; 95% CI 1.5C115).

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical charts of patients with severe BPD who were PPV dependent at home and who were enrolled in a university-affiliated home ventilator program between 1984 and 2010. We excluded patients with other comorbidities that could contribute to the development of chronic respiratory failure. We reported the incidence of these children in Indiana and cumulative incidences of survival, liberation from PPV, and decannulation. RESULTS Over 27 years, 628 children were cared for in our home ventilator program. Of these, 102 patients met inclusion criteria: 83 (81.4%) were alive and 19 (18.6%) were deceased. Sixty-nine patients (67.6%) were liberated from PPV, and 97.1% of them were weaned before their fifth birthday, with a median age at liberation of 24 months (interquartile range, 19-33). Similarly, 60 patients (58.8%) were decannulated, of which 96.7% completed this process before their sixth birthday, with a median age at decannulation of 37.5 months (interquartile range, 31.5-45). The incidence of children with chronic respiratory failure secondary to BPD who were PPV-dependent at home in Indiana was 1.23 per 100 000 live births in 1984 and increased to 4.77 per 100 000 live births in 2010.

Therefore, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of homologous boosting with an inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac), as well as the cross-neutralising activity against the Omicron variant in children and adolescents aged 3-17 years. Methods: In the phase 2 clinical trial, in Hebei province, China, participants aged 3-17 years were initially assigned (2:2:1) to a 1.5 g dose or 3.0 g dose of CoronaVac or a placebo group. Following a protocol amendment on September 13, 2021, half of the participants (cohort 1) in vaccine group received a booster dose 10 months (window period 30 days) after dose 2, and the other half of the participants (cohort 2) received a booster dose 12 months (window period 30 days) after dose 2. Participants in placebo groups withdrew from the study since the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccine in children and adolescents. The main outcomes of the study were geometric mean titres (GMTs), geometric mean increases (GMIs), and seropositivity rate of neutralising antibody to the live prototype SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, 28 days, 3 months, 6 months, 10 months, 12 months after dose 2 and at 28 days after dose 3. The cross-neutralising immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was detected, and the primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after the third dose. The trial is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04551547. Findings: 171 participants in cohort 1 (89% of the 192 participants) received a third dose 10 months after dose 2. By 10 months after dose 2, the GMTs of neutralising antibody against the prototype SARS-CoV-2 strain was down to 12.7 (95% CI 10.4-15.5) and 20.8 (95% CI 16.5-26.1) in the 1.5 g group and 3.0 g group, respectively. A third dose of CoronaVac increased GMTs to 597.7 (452.4-789.6) in the 1.5 g group and 681.0 (545.2-850.7) in the 3.0 g group. Seropositivity rates against the prototype in both groups were 100% at 28 days after dose 3. The GMTs of cross-neutralising antibody against the Omicron variant was 23.6 (17.7-31.4) in the 1.5 g group and 34.5 (27.2-43.7) in the 3.0 g group on 28 days after dose 3. Seropositivity rates against the Omicron variant were 77.6% (1.5 g group) and 90.6% (3.0 g group). 175 participants in cohort 2 (91% of the 192 participants) received a third dose 12 months after the dose 2. By 12 months after dose 2, the GMTs of neutralising antibody against the prototype was down to 16.8 (13.3-21.3) and 21.7 (18.1-26.0) in the 1.5 g group and 3.0 g group, respectively. A third dose of CoronaVac increased GMTs to 462.4 (364.4-586.6) in the 1.5 g group and 745.2 (577.0-962.3) in the 3.0 g group. Seropositivity rates against the prototype in both groups were 100% at 28 days after dose 3. The GMTs of cross-neutralising antibody against the Omicron variant was 24.0 (18.0-32.2) in the 1.5 g group, and 40.0 (30.7-52.3) in the 3.0 g group at 28 days after dose 3. Seropositivity rates against the Omicron variant were 78.8% (1.5 g group) and 91.5% (3.0 g group). Severities of local and systemic adverse reactions reported within 28 days after dose 3 were mild and moderate in both cohorts. The most commonly reported reactions were injection-site pain (14 [4.1%] participants) and fever (5 [1.5%] participants). Only one (0.3%) of 346 participants reported serious adverse events within 28 days after dose 3 were mild and moderate in both cohorts. The most commonly reported reactions were injection-site pain (14 [4.1%] participants) and fever (5 [1.5%] participants). Only one (0.3%) of 346 participants reported serious adverse events within 28 days after dose 3. Interpretation: A third dose CoronaVac in children and adolescents inoculated 10 months or 12 months after dose 2 induced a robust immune anamnestic response to the prototype SARS-CoV-2, which remarkably increased the neutralising antibody titres and had a cross-neutralising immunity against the Omicron variant.

In TREX1 knockdown cells, the activation of ER stress signaling disrupted ER Ca2+ homeostasis via the ERO1-IP3R1-CaMKII pathway, leading to neuronal cell death. Moreover, TREX1 knockdown dysregulated the Golgi-microtubule network through Golgi fragmentation and decreased Ac--tubulin levels, contributing to neuronal injury. These alterations were also observed in neuronal cells harboring a TREX1 mutation (V91M) that has been identified in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) patients in Korea.

This situation led to a prolonged and ferocious debate between those who questioned such a widespread and unevidenced practice, and those who defended the place of an common sense empirical medicine.

health systems for efficient case tracking and reporting. In the post-pandemic era, it is essential to be ready and provide not only preventive measures, but also effective digital strategies and solutions to protect our population from future outbreaks. This work presents a contact tracing solution based on wearable devices to track epidemic exposure. Our proximity-based privacy-preserving contact tracing (P3CT) integrates: 1) the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for reliable proximity sensing, 2) a machine-learning approach to classify the exposure risk of a user, and 3) an ambient signature protocol for preserving the user's identity. Proximity sensing exploits the signals emitted from a smartwatch to estimate users' interaction, in terms of distance and duration. Supervised learning is then used to train four classification models to identify the exposure risk of a user with respect to a patient diagnosed with an infectious disease. Finally, our proposed P3CT protocol uses ambient signatures to anonymize the infected patient's identity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed solution for real-world contact tracing problems. The large-scale dataset consisting of the signal information collected from the smartwatch is available online. According to experimental results, wearable devices along with machine learning models are a promising approach for epidemic exposure notification and tracking. ? 2013 IEEE.","output":"Epidemic Exposure Tracking With Wearables: A Machine Learning Approach to Contact Tracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lymphatic vessels and lymph are a missing link in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies Based on well-established principles of lymphatic function and dysfunction and a neglected literature, this article highlights promising directions for future research and clinical exploration","output":"SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, LYMPHATIC VESSELS, LYMPH, AND LYMPHOLOGY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging plays a diagnostic and prognostic role in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) patients.

METHODS: We applied two computational approaches to identify potential therapeutics. First, we sought to identify existing FDA approved drugs that could block coronaviruses from entering cells by binding to ACE2 or TMPRSS2 using a high-throughput AI-based binding affinity prediction platform. Second, we sought to identify FDA approved drugs that could attenuate the gene expression patterns induced by coronaviruses, using our Disease Cancelling Technology (DCT) platform. RESULTS: Top results for ACE2 binding iincluded several ACE inhibitors, a beta-lactam antibiotic, two antiviral agents (Fosamprenavir and Emricasan) and glutathione. The platform also assessed specificity for ACE2 over ACE1, important for avoiding counterregulatory effects. Further studies are needed to weigh the benefit of blocking virus entry against potential counterregulatory effects and possible protective effects of ACE2. However, the data herein suggest readily available drugs that warrant experimental evaluation to assess potential benefit. DCT was run on an animal model of SARS-CoV, and ranked compounds by their ability to induce gene expression signals that counteract disease-associated signals. Top hits included Vitamin E, ruxolitinib, and glutamine. Glutathione and its precursor glutamine were highly ranked by two independent methods, suggesting both warrant further investigation for potential benefit against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: While these findings are not yet ready for clinical translation, this report highlights the potential use of two bioinformatics technologies to rapidly discover existing therapeutic agents that warrant further investigation for established and emerging disease processes.","output":"Advanced bioinformatics rapidly identifies existing therapeutics for patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess the relationship between stress throughout the day and aggressive discipline practices by parents during COVID-19 stay at home orders. For this study, participants took baseline survey online, then provided data three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) for 14 consecutive days using Ecological Momentary Assessment procedures. Data were collected from 323 participants, covering 9,357 observations from April 13 to May 27, 2020 in Central Ohio during stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19. Use of aggressive discipline, including corporal punishment and psychological aggression, was measured using the Dimensions of Discipline Inventory. For each higher level of stress, parents had 1.3 greater odds of using aggressive discipline. Having used aggressive discipline at baseline was related to three times greater odds of using it during the study period. Higher situational stress was associated with use of aggressive parenting. When combined with less contact with mandatory reporters, this places children at risk for abuse and neglect that may go without detection and intervention for longer time-periods. First responders and medical professionals become more important in identifying and reporting suspected child maltreatment, as this may be a childs only contact with a mandated professional for six months to a year.

Nurses often are being seen as compassionate helpers. The public image of nursing, however, also consists of stereotypes such as nursing being a 'doing' profession and care being a 'female' characteristic. Next to that, nursing is associated with images from the past, such as 'the lady with the lamp'. Therefore, in the public eye at least, the nursing identity seems a simple and straightforward enough construct, but nothing less is true. Looking at what a professional identity consists of, historic and social developments influence a group identity as a construct. In addition, individual, professional and contemporary societal moralities, including stereotypes, play its role. Nurses themselves reinforce stereotypes in order to fit into what is expected, even when they believe professional behaviour encompasses other features. They may do so individually as well as in a group context. But nursing actually seems to be better off when viewed upon as a diverse, autonomous profession. Moral values such as compassion motivate nurses to enter the profession. Research shows that if such values are addressed in daily practice, nursing could perhaps be saved from nurses leaving the profession because of feeling unfulfilled. Another aspect concerns the huge nursing body of knowledge. If seen as the ground on which nursing behaviour is standing, it would contribute to a different image of nursing than simplified stereotypes, which do not acknowledge the complex nature of the profession. This paper challenges the idea that the nursing identity is unchangeable and the notion that 'a nurse will always be a nurse'. By doing so, the paper contributes to a debate on the supposed 'true' nature of the nursing identity and opens a discussion on the need for it to change.","output":"What makes a nurse today?

PURPOSE: Showing whether non-contrast CT performed after pPCI might be usefull as a diagnosis of no-reflow phenomenon. METHODS: Six STEMI patients (mean age = 68.3 y/o) underwent revascularization by pPCI and stent placement within 6 hours after onset of angina and within less than 90 minutes of door-to-balloon time. Due to the outbreak of SARS-Cov-2, chest CT scanning was indicated in all patients before coronary unit admission (192  102 mins after pPCI). RESULTS: Three patients with a higher time than the mean angina time and than the mean door-to-ballon time (190  149.3 versus 170  107.5 and 63  6.08 vs 56  11.5, respectively) developed an interventional type of no-reflow phenomenon (Table 1) and CT scanning showed regional myocardial contrast retention related to the culprit coronary artery (Figure 1).

It is agreed that a stockpile of appropriate polio vaccines will need to be established, and a surveillance and response capacity will need to be maintained, in order to protect the world against any possible future outbreaks attributable either to the persistence of wild poliovirus or vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) or to the unintentional or intentional release of poliovirus from a laboratory or vaccine store. Although it has been suggested that the stockpile should consist of monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (mOPV), many questions remain concerning its nature, financing, management, and use--in particular, because of uncertainties over future national vaccination policies, and over the availability of different vaccines, after the certification of wild poliovirus eradication. There are further uncertainties concerning the possible role and efficacy of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) used either routinely or in outbreak control in low-hygiene settings, the potential for rapid geographical spread of polioviruses should an outbreak occur after certification, and the risks inherent in introducing additional oral polio vaccine (OPV) viruses into populations in which the vaccine coverage and prevalence of immunity have declined, and which may thus favour the spread of VDPVs.

Changes in the melatonin and melatonin isomer 2 contents during growth and ripening were studied in Golden apples, as was the effect of the melatonin treatment (500 M, day 124 post-anthesis) on the apple tree. Melatonin content varied greatly, with higher value in the skin than in the flesh. In the skin, melatonin increased at day 132 post-anthesis, when ethylene synthesis started. In the flesh, melatonin levels were high at the beginning of the growth phase and at the end of ripening. Melatonin isomer 2 was also higher once the ripening started and when ethylene began to increase. The melatonin treatment significantly advanced the ethylene production and increased the fruit size, weight, sugar content, and firmness. The data suggest that melatonin stimulates fruit ripening through the induction of ethylene synthesis, while melatonin treatments before ripening improve the final fruit quality.","output":"Role of Melatonin in Apple Fruit during Growth and Ripening: Possible Interaction with Ethylene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To accommodate its RNA synthesis in the infected cell, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induces a cytoplasmic reticulovesicular network (RVN) that is derived from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. We set out to investigate how the early secretory pathway interacts with the RVN and the viral replication/transcription complex (RTC) that is anchored to it. When the secretory pathway was disrupted by brefeldin A (BFA) treatment at the start of infection, RVN formation and viral RTC activity were not blocked and continued up to 11 h postinfection, although RNA synthesis was reduced by ca. 80%. In vitro RTC assays, using membrane fractions from infected cells, demonstrated that BFA does not directly interfere with the activity of the viral RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Confocal microscopy studies showed that early secretory pathway components are not associated with SARS-CoV-induced replication sites, although our studies revealed that infection induces a remarkable redistribution of the translocon subunit Sec61alpha. Ultrastructural studies, including electron tomography, revealed that the formation of the RVN and all its previously documented features can occur in the presence of BFA, despite differences in the volume and morphology of the network. We therefore conclude that early secretory pathway proteins do not play a direct role in RVN morphogenesis or the functionality of the SARS-CoV RTC. The BFA-induced disruption of ER integrity and functionality probably affects the overall quality of the membrane scaffold that is needed to support the viral RTC and/or the availability of specific host factors, which in turn compromises viral RNA synthesis.","output":"Integrity of the early secretory pathway promotes, but is not required for, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus RNA synthesis and virus-induced remodeling of endoplasmic reticulum membranes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Reports have suggested that the efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19 might have fallen since the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant replaced the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant as the predominant variant. We aimed to investigate, for the two main classes of vaccine, whether efficacy against severe COVID-19 has decreased since delta became the predominant variant and whether the efficacy of two doses of vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes with time since second dose. METHODS: In the REACT-SCOT case-control study, vaccine efficacy was estimated using a matched case-control design that includes all diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Scotland up to Sept 8, 2021. For every incident case of COVID-19 in the Scottish population, ten controls matched for age rounded to the nearest year, sex, and primary care practice, and alive on the day of presentation of the case that they were matched to were selected using the Community Health Index database. To minimise ascertainment bias we prespecified the primary outcome measure to assess vaccine efficacy as severe COVID-19, defined as diagnosed patients with entry to critical care within 21 days of first positive test, death within 28 days of first positive test, or any death for which COVID-19 was coded as underlying cause.

Of the severe cases, 4495 (80%) were not vaccinated, and of the controls, 36 879 (74%) were not vaccinated. Of the severe cases of COVID-19 who had been vaccinated, 389 had received an mRNA vaccine and 759 had received the ChAdOx1 vaccine. The efficacy of vaccination against severe COVID-19 decreased in May, 2021, coinciding with the replacement of the alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant by the delta variant in Scotland, but this decrease was reversed over the following month. In the most recent time window centred on July 29, 2021, the efficacy of two doses was 91% (95% CI 87C94) for the ChAdOx1 vaccine and 92% (88C95) for mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) vaccines. The efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 declined with time since second dose to 69% (95% CI 52C80) at 20 weeks from second dose. The efficacy of mRNA vaccines declined in the first ten weeks from second dose but more slowly thereafter to 93% (88C96) at 20 weeks from second dose. INTERPRETATION: Our results are reassuring with respect to concerns that vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 might have fallen since the delta variant became predominant, or that efficacy of mRNA vaccines wanes within the first 5C6 months after second dose. However, the efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes substantially by 20 weeks from second dose. Efficacy of mRNA vaccines after 20 weeks and against newer variants remains to be established. Our findings support the case for additional protective measures for those at risk of severe disease, including, but not limited to, booster doses, at times when transmission rates are high or expected to rise.

Economic evaluations of mitigation technologies and strategies have been recommended for inclusion in emergency preparedness plans. We aimed to perform an economic evaluation using dynamic transition modeling of ebola virus disease (EVD) vaccination in a hypothetical community of 1,000 persons in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHOD Using a modified SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, with Death added [SEIR-D]) model that accounted for death and epidemiological data from an EVD outbreak in the DRC, we modeled the transmission of EVD in a hypothetical population of 1,000. With our model, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of an EVD vaccine and an EVD vaccination intervention. RESULTS The results showed vaccinating 50% of the population at risk prevented 670 cases, 538 deaths, and 22,022 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The vaccine was found to be cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $95.63 per DALY averted. We also determined the minimum required vaccination coverage for cost-effectiveness to be 40%. Sensitivity analysis showed our model to be fairly robust, assuring relatively consistent results even with variations in such input parameters as cost of screening, as well as transmission, infection, incubation, and case fatality rates. CONCLUSION EVD vaccination in our hypothetical population was found to be cost-effective from the payer perspective.

In the present paper, our purpose was to characterize the proteome of the culture medium in which the oocytes within the primordial/primary follicles underwent apoptosis induced by cisplatin (CIS) or were, for the most part, protected by LH against the drug. To this aim, prepubertal ovarian tissues were cultured under control and in the presence of CIS, LH, and CIS + LH. The culture media were harvested after 2, 12, and 24 h from chemotherapeutic drug treatment and analyzed by liquid chromatographyCmass spectrometry (LC-MS). We found that apoptotic conditions generated by CIS in the cultured ovarian tissues and/or oocytes are reflected in distinct changes in the extracellular microenvironment in which they were cultured. These changes became evident mainly from 12 h onwards and were characterized by the inhibition or decreased release of a variety of compounds, such as the proteases Htra1 and Prss23, the antioxidants Prdx2 and Hbat1, the metabolic regulators Ldha and Pkm, and regulators of apoptotic pathways such as Tmsb4x. Altogether, these results confirm the biological relevance of the LH action on prepuberal ovaries and provide novel information about the proteins released by the ovarian tissues exposed to CIS and LH in the surrounding microenvironment.

We tested 2 lymphedema prevention interventions and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a group-randomized trial at 38 cooperative group sites within the United States. METHODS: Patients were recruited before breast surgery. Sites were randomly assigned to education-only (EO) lymphedema prevention or education plus exercise and physical therapy (LEAP). Lymphedema was defined as a &#8805;10% difference in arm volume at any time from baseline to 18 months postsurgery. HRQOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast plus 4 lymphedema items (FACT-B+4). Longitudinal mixed model regression analysis, adjusting for key demographic and clinical variables, examined participants' HRQOL by intervention group and lymphedema status. RESULTS: A total of 547 patients (56% LEAP) were enrolled and completed HRQOL assessments. The results revealed no differences between the interventions in preventing lymphedema (P = .37) or HRQOL (FACT-B+4 total score; P = .8777). At 18 months, the presence of lymphedema was associated with HRQOL at borderline significance (P = .0825). However, African American patients reported greater lymphedema symptoms (P = .0002) and better emotional functioning (P = .0335) than patients of other races or ethnicities. Lower HRQOL during the intervention was associated with younger age (P &#8804; .0001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >0 (P = .0002), &#8805;1 positive lymph nodes (P = .0009), having no education beyond high school (P < .0001), having undergone chemotherapy (P = .0242), and having had only axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy versus both (P = .0007).

METHODS: Adults with a positive test for SARS-COV2 and were hospitalized due to pneumonia requiring either high flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation were included. Patients with a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were preferentially given theophylline. All other patients received pentoxifylline 400 mg orally TID. A group of hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving standard of care acted as a comparison group. The coprimary outcomes were a change in C-reactive protein (CRP) and ROX score between groups from day 1 to day 4 of therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred and nine inpatients were reviewed. Fifty-eight patients received pentoxifylline/theophylline, with 151 patients serving as the comparison group. Active therapy was associated with an increase in the ROX score (mean: 2.9 (95% CI: 0.6, 5.1)) and decrease in CRP (mean: -0.7 (95% CI: -4.7, 3.2).

The aim of this study was to compare the rates of humoral immune response and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in pwMS and healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: In this multicenter prospective study on 456 pwMS and 116 HCs, SARS-CoV-2-IgG response was measured 3 months after the first vaccine dose. The primary endpoint was defined as proportion of patients developing antibodies (seroconversion). Secondary endpoints included antibody level, safety and efficacy. RESULTS: Compared to 97.4% in HCs, seroconversion occurred in 96.7% (88/91) untreated pwMS, 97.1% of patients (135/139) on immunomodulatory DMTs and 61.1% (138/226; p < 0.001) on immunosuppressive DMTs. Seroconversion was lowest in patients on antiCD20 monoclonal antibodies (CD20 mAbs; 52.6%) followed by sphingosine-1-phosphate-receptor-modulators (S1PMs; 63.6%). In the S1PM subgroup, seroconversion increased with lymphocyte count (odds ratio [OR] 1.31 per 0.1 G/L; p = 0.035). In pwMS on CD20 mAbs, B-cell depletion decreased seroconversion (OR 0.52; p = 0.038), whereas time since last DMT did not. Safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in pwMS was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Humoral response to SARS-CoV2 vaccines in pwMS is generally excellent. While reduced by immunosuppressive DMTs, most importantly by B-cell-depleting CD20 mAbs and S1PMs, seroconversion is still expected in the majority of patients. SARS-CoV2 vaccination should be offered to every MS patient.","output":"Comparing humoral immune response to SARS-CoV2 vaccines in people with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls: An Austrian prospective multicenter cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After two months of implementing a partial lockdown, the Indonesian government had announced the \\"New Normal\\" policy to prevent a further economic crash in the country.

We further analyzed the public perception using sentiment analysis and identified the predominant tweets using emotion analysis. RESULT: We collected 284,216 tweets from 137,057 active users. From the trend analysis, we observed three stages of the changing trend of the public's attention on the \\"New Normal\\". Results from the sentiment analysis indicate that more than half of the population (52%) had a \\"positive\\" sentiment towards the \\"New Normal\\" issues while only 41% of them had a \\"negative\\" perception. Our study also demonstrated the public's sentiment trend has gradually shifted from \\"negative\\" to \\"positive\\" due to the influence of both the government actions and the spread of the disease.

Qualitative and quantitative contributions of these sources to ambient PM(2.5) (particulate matter with an aerodynamic equivalent diameter below 2.5 m) concentrations remains uncertain. Stable nitrogen isotopic composition ((15)N) of NH(3) and NH(4)(+) ((15)N(NH(3)) and (15)N(NH(4)(+)), respectively) can yield valuable information about its sources and associated processes. This review provides an overview of the recent progress in analytical techniques for (15)N(NH(3)) and (15)N(NH(4)(+)) measurement, sampling of atmospheric NH(3) and NH(4)(+) in the ambient air and their sources signature (e.g., agricultural vs. fossil fuel), and isotope-based source apportionment of NH(3) in urban atmosphere. This study highlights that collecting sample that are fully representative of emission sources remains a challenge in fingerprinting (15)N(NH(3)) values of NH(3) emission sources. Furthermore, isotopic fractionation during NH(3) gas-to-particle conversion under varying ambient field conditions (e.g., relative humidity, particle pH, temperature) remains unclear, which indicates more field and laboratory studies to validate theoretically predicted isotopic fractionation are required. Thus, this study concludes that lack of refined (15)N(NH(3)) fingerprints and full understanding of isotopic fractionation during aerosol formation in a laboratory and field conditions is a limitation for isotope-based source apportionment of NH(3). More experimental work (in chamber studies) and theoretical estimations in combinations of field verification are necessary in characterizing isotopic fractionation under various environmental and atmospheric neutralization conditions, which would help to better interpret isotopic data and our understanding on NH(x) (NH(3) + NH(4)(+)) dynamics in the atmosphere.

The log-linear Poisson and geographically weighted Poisson regression are applied to model the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (total population as the offset) in a ZIP code. RESULTS: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in a ZIP code is positively associated with socioeconomic disadvantages-specifically, the high levels of concentrated disadvantage and income inequality. It is also positively associated with the percentage of American Indian and Alaskan Native populations, net of other potential confounders at the ZIP code level. Importantly, these associations are spatially varying in that some ZIP codes suffer more from concentrated disadvantage than others. CONCLUSIONS: Additional attention for COVID-19 mitigation effort should focus on areas with higher levels of concentrated disadvantage, income inequality, and higher percentage of American Indian and Alaska Native populations as these areas have higher incidence of COVID-19.

Furthermore, dividing the users into three categories, Leaders, Chatters, and General Public, and study the influence of human characteristics on the relationship between the strength of rumour/anti-rumour and rumour control by considering the different human characteristics as moderator variables. The results showed that anti-rumours have a significant positive impact on the control of rumours; the ambiguity of rumours has a significant negative impact on the Positive Comment Index (PCI) in rumour control. Further, the Leaders increased the overall level of PCI, but negatively adjusted the relationship between evidence and PCI; the Chatters and the General Public reduced the overall level of PCI, and Chatters weakened the relationship between the specific type of anti-rumour form and PCI while the General Public enhanced the relationship between the specific type of anti-rumour form and PCI. In the long run, the role of Leaders needs to be further improved, and the importance of the General Public is growing in the food rumour control process.","output":"The Moderation of Human Characteristics in the Control Mechanisms of Rumours in Social Media: The Case of Food Rumours in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a widely accepted to treat the varicose vein. However, outcome studies for occlusion rate and patterns of the saphenous vein after RFA are scarce. The purpose of our study is to report the results of RFA in patients with varicose vein. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes after RFA using ClosureFAST (Covidien) catheter. We evaluated the occlusion rate and patterns with duplex scanning after RFA. RESULTS A total of 200 limbs (148 patients) underwent RFA. The truncal veins were ablated in 163 great saphenous veins (GSV) and 41 small saphenous veins (SSVs). The mean age was 52.1  11.9 years and female to male ratio was 125 : 87.

Some of the well-known characteristics of DCM include increased myocardial left ventricular wall thickness and remodelling that result in reduced cardiac efficiency. To prevent this, an increasing number of pharmacological compounds such as N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) are explored for their antioxidant properties. A few studies have shown that NAC can ameliorate hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative damage within the heart. Hence, the objective of this review is to synthesise the available evidence pertaining to the cardioprotective role of NAC against hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative damage and thus prevent DCM. METHODS This systematic review protocol will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statement. We will perform a comprehensive search on major databases such as EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed and Google scholar for original research articles published from January 1960 to March 2017. We will only report on literature that is available in English. Two authors will independently screen for eligible studies using pre-defined criteria, and data extraction will be done in duplicate. All discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or consultation of a third reviewer. The quality of studies will be checked using Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool and The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal tools for non-randomised experimental studies. Heterogeneity across studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Q statistic and the inconsistency index (I 2). We will use the random effects model to calculate a pooled estimate. DISCUSSION Although several studies have shown that NAC can ameliorate hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative damage within the heart, this systematic review will be the first pre-registered synthesis of data to identify the cardioprotective potential of NAC against hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative damage. This result will help guide future research evaluating the cardioprotective role of NAC against DCM and better identify possible mechanisms of action for NAC to prevent oxidative damage with a diabetic heart.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD)/stroke risk has been widely understood with the help of carotid artery disease (CTAD), a surrogate biomarker for CHD. The proposed study emphasizes artificial intelligence-based frameworks such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) that can accurately predict the severity of CVD/stroke risk using carotid wall arterial imaging in ED patients. Methods: Using the PRISMA model, 231 of the best studies were selected. The proposed study mainly consists of two components: (i) the pathophysiology of ED and its link with coronary artery disease (COAD) and CHD in the ED framework and (ii) the ultrasonic-image morphological changes in the carotid arterial walls by quantifying the wall parameters and the characterization of the wall tissue by adapting the ML/DL-based methods, both for the prediction of the severity of CVD risk. The proposed study analyzes the hypothesis that ML/DL can lead to an accurate and early diagnosis of the CVD/stroke risk in ED patients. Our finding suggests that the routine ED patient practice can be amended for ML/DL-based CVD/stroke risk assessment using carotid wall arterial imaging leading to fast, reliable, and accurate CVD/stroke risk stratification. Summary: We conclude that ML and DL methods are very powerful tools for the characterization of CVD/stroke in patients with varying ED conditions. We anticipate a rapid growth of these tools for early and better CVD/stroke risk management in ED patients.","output":"Cardiovascular/Stroke Risk Assessment in Patients with Erectile DysfunctionA Role of Carotid Wall Arterial Imaging and Plaque Tissue Characterization Using Artificial Intelligence Paradigm: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Circulating nucleic acids, encapsulated within small extracellular vesicles (EVs), provide a remote cellular snapshot of biomarkers derived from diseased tissues, however selective isolation is critical.

Here we analysed the impact of these mutations on vaccination- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells. We confirmed that, in the majority of infected or vaccinated individuals, different mutations present in a single VOC (Delta) or a combined mosaic of more than 30 AA substitutions and deletions found in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron VOCs cause modest alteration in the global Spike-specific T cell response. However, distinct numerically dominant Spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells preferentially targeted regions affected by AA mutations and do not recognise the mutated peptides. Importantly, some of these mutations, such as N501Y (present in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron) and L452R (present in Delta), known to provide biological advantage to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of infectivity also abolished CD8 T cell recognition. Taken together, our data show that while global mRNA vaccine- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells largely tolerate the diverse mutations present in VOCs, single Spike-specific T cells might contribute to the natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern escaping Spike-specific T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented veterinary emergency hospitals with unique challenges.

METHODS: We prospectively assessed the medical records, laboratory results, chest CT images and use of medication in a cohort of patients presenting to two designated covid-19 treatment centres in Sichuan, China. Outcomes of interest included death, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, treatment with vasoactive agents and classification of disease severity. Acute myocardial injury was defined by a value of high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) greater than the normal upper limit. RESULTS: A total of 101 cases were enrolled from January to 10 March 2020 (average age 49 years, IQR 34C62 years). Acute myocardial injury was present in 15.8% of patients, nearly half of whom had a hs-TnT value fivefold greater than the normal upper limit. Patients with acute myocardial injury were older, with a higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and more likely to require ICU admission (62.5% vs 24.7%, p=0.003), mechanical ventilation (43.5% vs 4.7%, p<0.001) and treatment with vasoactive agents (31.2% vs 0%, p<0.001).

Newborn preterm pigs were intubated and randomized to receive intratracheal rhKGF (20 g/kg; n = 6) or saline (0.5 ml 0.9% saline; control; n = 6) before initiating 24 h of ventilation followed by extubation to nasal oxygen for 12 h before euthanasia and collection of lungs for histopathology and immunohistochemistry to assess expression of surfactant protein B and markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. rhKGF pigs required less oxygen during mechanical ventilation, had higher tidal volumes at similar peak pressures indicative of improved lung compliance, and survival was higher after extubation (83% vs. 16%). rhKGF increased surfactant protein B expression (p < 0.05) and reduced TGF-1 (p < 0.05), that inhibits surfactant production and is a prominent marker for epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Our findings suggest intratracheal administration of rhKGF at initiation of mechanical ventilation enhances surfactant production, reduces ventilator induced lung injury, and attenuates epithelial-mesenchymal transition while improving pulmonary functions. rhKGF is a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate pulmonary responses of preterm infants that require mechanical ventilation and thereby reduce the incidence and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","output":"Intratracheal Keratinocyte Growth Factor Enhances Surfactant Protein B Expression in Mechanically Ventilated Preterm Pigs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The influenza B viruses belong to two lineages distinguished by their genetic and antigenic characteristics, which are referred to as the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, designated after their original isolates, B/Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/2/87.

METHODS: Influenza B virus was detected using a respiratory virus panel of assays and an influenza B-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. The complete influenza B hemagglutinin (HA) gene was amplified and sequenced directly from clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using nucleotide sequences. RESULTS: A total of 71 hospitalized pediatric patients were influenza B positive. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the great majority of influenza B strains (66/71, 93.0%) belonged to the Victoria-lineage and were antigenically like vaccine strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008) included only in the quadrivalent vaccine. In the detected influenza B strains, a series of amino acid changes were observed in the antigenic regions: I117V, V124A, N129D, V146I, N197D, T199A, and A202T. However, only 2 amino acid changes were observed in the HA regions involved in receptor binding or in antibody recognition. CONCLUSIONS: All the influenza B strains identified in this study belonged to the influenza B Victoria lineage not included in the trivalent vaccine commonly used by the general population during the 2015C2016 influenza season in Italy.

The aim of our analysis was to evaluate the impact of dysphagia on Length of Hospital Stay (LOS) and costs. The hospital perspective was used to assess costs. METHODS Hospital discharge databases comparing hospital stays for ischemic stroke associated with dysphagia vs stroke without dysphagia in France and Switzerland were analyzed. The French Medical Information System Program (PMSI) database analysis focused on 62'297 stays for stroke in the public sector. 6'037 hospital stays for stroke were analyzed from the Swiss OFS (Office fdral de la statistique: Statistique des co?ts par cas 2012) database. Diagnosis codes and listing of procedures were used to identify dysphagia in stroke patients. RESULTS Patients with post-stroke dysphagia accounted for 8.4% of stroke hospital stays in Switzerland, which is consistent with recently reported prevalence of dysphagia at hospital discharge (Arnold et al, 2016). The French database analysis identified 4.2% stays with post-stroke dysphagia. We hypothesize that the difference between the Swiss and French datasets may be explained by the limitations of an analysis based on diagnosis and procedure coding. Patients with post-stroke dysphagia stayed longer at hospitals (LOS of 23.7 vs. 11.8 days in France and LOS of 14.9 vs. 8.9 days in Switzerland) compared with patients without post-stroke dysphagia. Post-stroke dysphagia was associated with about 3'000 and CHF14'000 cost increase in France and Switzerland respectively. DISCUSSION In this study post-stroke dysphagia was associated with increased LOS and higher hospital costs. It is difficult to isolate the impact of dysphagia in patients with multiple symptoms and disabilities impacting rehabilitation and recovery. After adjusting for confounding factors by matching stays according to age, sex and stroke complications, post-stroke dysphagia association with increased LOS and higher hospital costs was found to be independent of sensory or motor complications. CONCLUSION Post-stroke dysphagia is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher hospital costs.","output":"Hospital costs impact of post ischemic stroke dysphagia: Database analyses of hospital discharges in France and Switzerland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, presents a high risk of exposure and cross contamination to the operative room personnel.

However, social media use may be maladaptive due to its associations with social media addiction and psychosocial problems. Our study was set at this special context to examine the associations among social media addiction, two aspects of relatedness needs (i.e., satisfaction and frustration), and two prominent psychosocial problems (i.e., depressive symptoms and loneliness). The participants were 1048 residents of the U.K. or U.S. (46% men, mean age = 44.10 years, SD = 12.59, age range: 18C65). The results indicated significant positive associations between relatedness need frustration and social media addiction as well as significant positive associations between social media addiction and the two types of psychosocial problems. More importantly, both of these significant associations were strong enough to partially explain the significant positive associations between relatedness need frustration and the two types of psychosocial problems.

Drawing on official papers, Hansard records and unpublished archival material, this account complements existing studies of the relationships between government ministers and experts. It highlights how individual members of the all-party Parliamentary and Scientific Committee have influenced institutional change. In so doing it exposes some of the challenges confronting Parliament in the scrutiny of science policy from the mid-twentieth century to today. In particular, it reveals MPs' concerns about their ability to scrutinize science policy in the absence of a select committee on science and technology in the Commons during the 1980s. This shows that parliamentary scrutiny of science was compromised during the very period when the Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher set about making major changes to the organization and funding of government-sponsored research in the UK.","output":"'Armed with the necessary background of knowledge': embedding science scrutiny mechanisms in the UK Parliament"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents a short reflection on the confluence between politics and pandemics as they are reflected in Israel in March and April 2020.","output":"Venenum, Virus, Fear, and Politics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vitamin D and calcium are important dietary compounds that affect bone mass, even if other minerals (potassium, zinc, etc.) and vitamins (A, C and K) are also involved. Vitamin D and certain minerals, in fact, play an important role in calcium homeostasis and calcium absorption. Hip fracture incidence is higher in Europe and the United States, where calcium is frequently included in the human diet; while the occurrence of these fractures is lower in developing countries, where diets are often poor in calcium. This condition is named the calcium paradox, and may be partially explained by phosphate toxicity, which can negatively affect mineral metabolism. It is important to maintain correct dietary calcium-phosphate balance in order to have a healthy life, reducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures in older people. Vitamin D can also act as a hormone; vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is derived from the UV-B radiation of ergosterol, the natural vitamin D precursor detected in plants, fungi, and invertebrates. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized by sunlight exposure from 7-dehydrocholesterol, a precursor of cholesterol that can also act as provitamin D3. Dietary intake of vitamin D3 is essential when the skin is exposed for short periods to ultraviolet B light (UV-B), a category of invisible light rays such as UV-A and UV-C. This can be considered the usual situation in northern latitudes during the winter season, or the typical lifestyle for older people and/or for people with very white delicate skin.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the quality of life and the cost-effectiveness of a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with respect to an open distal pancreatectomy. METHODS Forty-one patients who underwent a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and 40 patients who underwent an open distal pancreatectomy were retrospectively studied as regards postoperative results, quality of life and cost-effectiveness analysis. The Italian neutral version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C-30, version 3.0, was used to rate the quality of life. RESULTS Postoperative results were similar in the two groups; the only difference was that the first oral intake took place significantly earlier in the laparoscopic group than in the open group (P < 0.001). Regarding quality of life, the laparoscopic approach was able to ameliorate physical functioning (P = 0.049), role functioning (P = 0.044) and cognitive functioning (P = 0.030) and reduce the sleep disturbance scale (P = 0.050). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the acceptability curve for a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy had a higher probability of being more cost-effective than an open distal pancreatectomy when a willingness to pay above 5400 Euros/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was accepted. CONCLUSION Despite the limitations of the study, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy can be considered not only safe and feasible but also permits a better quality of life and is acceptable in terms of cost-effectiveness to Italian and European health care services.","output":"Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy in Benign or Premalignant Pancreatic Lesions: Is It Really More Cost-Effective than Open Approach?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the importance of triaging surgeries was suggested to reduce burdens on the existing health system and maintaining service. The governor declared a state of emergency and requested that residents avoid going out unnecessarily (semi-lockdown) for the entire prefecture including our medical region from February 28 until May 25, 2020. However, for several spine patients, a significant delay in care may result in the progression of extremity weakness and pain. This study aimed to investigate trends of spine surgeries during the first COVID-19 semi-lockdown in the nonepidemic region in Japan. METHODS: Spine surgeries performed in our institution from February 28 until May 25 between 2017 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. We compared the number of spine surgeries and types of surgical spine pathologies between 2017 and 2019: previous years and 2020: a COVID-19 year. RESULTS: The mean number of spine surgeries performed in previous years was 121 cases, and the number of spine surgeries performed in a COVID-19 year was 109 cases. The percentage of urgent surgeries was 19.6% in previous years versus 37.6% in a COVID-19 year; the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Among the urgent surgical spine pathologies, the prevalence of cauda equina or severe nerve root compression leading to progressive neurological deterioration or intractable pain was 20.2% in a COVID-19 year, which was significantly higher than 12.4% in previous years (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The first COVID-19 semi-lockdown in Japan led to a decrease in elective cases and an increase in urgent cases and might affect progressive neurological deterioration for some spine patients even in a nonepidemic region.","output":"Trends of Spine Surgeries during the First COVID-19 Semi-Lockdown: Survey in a Non-Epidemic Region in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Several specialized collections of COVID-19 literature have been developed during the global health emergency.

In addition, the dynamic total return and volatility connectedness changes over time, rising during periods of economic crisis. In general, the net return connectedness considerably increases during the three most important crises. Thus, the differences between transmitters' (Canola and Corn) and receivers (Orange Juice, Lean Hog, Sugar and Rubber) agricultural commodity markets are emphasized during the GFC and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

Recent studies indicate that coronaviruses (CoVs) have evolved various strategies to evade the autophagyClysosome pathway. In this minireview, we describe the source of double-membrane vesicles during CoV infection, which creates a microenvironment that promotes viral RNA replication and virion synthesis and protects the viral genome from detection by the host. Firstly, CoVs hijack autophagy initiation through non-structural proteins and open-reading frames, leading to the use of non-nucleated phagophores and omegasomes for autophagy-derived double-membrane vesicles. Contrastingly, membrane rearrangement by hijacking ER-associated degradation machinery to form ER-derived double-membrane vesicles independent from the typical autophagy process is another important routine for the production of double-membrane vesicles. Furthermore, we summarize the molecular mechanisms by which CoV non-structural proteins and open-reading frames are used to intercept autophagic flux and thereby evade host clearance and innate immunity. A comprehensive understanding of the above mechanisms may contribute to developing novel therapies and clinical drugs against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the future.","output":"Coronavirus Usurps the Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway and Induces Membranes Rearrangement for Infection and Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Monoclonal Antibody Therapy (MAbs) has been shown to reduce rates of ED visits and hospitalizations in patients at risk for severe Covid-19 infection in clinical trials. Since November, three Mabs received emergency use authorization: Bamlanivimab (Bam), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (Bam/Ete) and Casirivimab/Imdevimab (Casi/imdevi). We describe here the real-world effectiveness of implementing early MAb therapy in the outpatient setting for individuals with Covid-19 at high risk of progression. Methods We examined the records of 808 UCLA Health patients with a confirmed positive SARS-CoV2 PCR test who were either referred for outpatient Mab therapy or received Mab treatment in the emergency department (ED) between December 10, 2020, and May 3, 2021. The primary outcome of our analysis was the combined 30-day incidence of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or death following the date of referral. SARS-CoV2 isolates of hospitalized patients who had received Mabs were sequenced to determine the presence of variants. Results Of 808 patients, 383 were referred for treatment but did not receive treatment, 109 received Mabs in the ED and 316 patients were treated in an outpatient setting. Composite 30-day mortality, ED visits and hospital admissions were significantly reduced in the combination therapy group (Bam/Ete or Cas/Imd) compared with monotherapy (Bam alone) or no treatment groups (aHR 0.16, 95% CI .038, .67). Significant factors associated with the composite outcome included: history of lung disease (HR 4.46, 95% CI 2.89-6.90), cardiovascular disease (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.12-3.12), kidney disease (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.27-3.25), and immunocompromised state (HR 3.24, 95% CI 1.02-10.26) as well as high social vulnerability index (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.13-3.10).

The new American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic suggested modifications to the standards of care to reduce harm from treatment. However, it is unclear whether these changes suit the wishes of patients. Methods: We conducted a survey of patients with gastrointestinal cancer who were undergoing active chemotherapy in our ambulatory therapy center between 17 August and 11 September 2020.

Results: Among the 63 patients who received the questionnaire, 61 participated in the study. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in their lifestyles and substantially impacted their psychological wellbeing. The incidence of anxiety and insomnia has considerably increased during the pandemic. However, female patients and patients aged 70 years or older reported no notable differences.

So, the search for an effective and active option for the treatment of COVID-19 is still a big challenge. The Spike protein (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and Main protease (Mpro) are considered to be the primary therapeutic drug target for COVID-19. In this study we have screened the drugbank compound library against the Main Protease. But our search was not limited to just Mpro. Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2, have also acquired unique mutations. These mutations within the active site of these target proteins may be an important factor hindering effective drug candidate development. In the present study we identified important active site mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Y54C, N142S, T190I and A191V). Further the drugbank database was computationally screened against Mpro and the selected mutants. Finally, we came up with the common molecules effective against the wild type (WT) and all the selected Mpro.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the safety and long-term efficacy of laparoscopic resection of gastric GISTs larger than 2 cm. METHODS Between 2007 and 2011, we prospectively enrolled all patients affected by gastric GIST larger than 2 cm. Exclusion criteria for the laparoscopic approach were the presence of metastases and the absence of any involvement of the esophago-gastric junction, the pyloric canal, or any adjacent organ. Final diagnosis of GIST was confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Follow-up assessment included abdominal CT scans every 6 months for the first 2 years and yearly thereafter. RESULTS Twenty-four consecutive patients were enrolled. Twenty-one patients (87.5%) were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain. The mean tumor size was 5.51 cm (range 2.5-12.0 cm). GISTs were located in the lesser curvature in five cases (20.8%), in the greater curvature in seven cases (29.1%), in the posterior wall in one case (4.1%), in the anterior wall in eight cases (33.3%), and in the fundus in 3 cases (12.5%). Laparoscopic resection was possible in all cases and took on average of 55 min (range 30-105 min). Median blood loss was 24 ml. No major intraoperative complications were observed. Mortality rate was 0%. Median postoperative stay was 3 days. No patients were lost to follow-up. No recurrences occurred after a median follow-up period of 75 months. CONCLUSION Although larger randomized controlled trials comparing different surgical strategies for large gastric GISTs are warranted, our study supports the evidence that laparoscopic resection of gastric GISTs is feasible, safe, and effective on long-term clinical outcome even for lesions up to 12 cm.","output":"Laparoscopic resection of large gastric GISTs: feasibility and long-term results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that vaccination not be interrupted as long as countries could safely maintain this service in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Optimal iodine intake could become a kind of vaccination, which sharply reduces the risk of developing thyroid cancer, as has happened after the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan. Endemic goiter was eliminated 50 years ago, but returned to the country in the early 1990s after the collapse of iodized salt production and has not been eliminated to this day due to the lack of a legislative framework for mandatory salt iodization.

Our living systematic review (LSR) focuses on suicide prevention in relation to COVID-19, with this iteration synthesising relevant evidence up to June 7 (th) 2020. Method: Automated daily searches feed into a web-based database with screening and data extraction functionalities. Eligibility criteria include incidence/prevalence of suicidal behaviour, exposure-outcome relationships and effects of interventions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes of interest are suicide, self-harm or attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts. No restrictions are placed on language or study type, except for single-person case reports. Results: Searches identified 2070 articles, 29 (28 studies) met our inclusion criteria, of which 14 articles were research letters or pre-prints awaiting peer review. All articles reported observational data: 12 cross-sectional; eight case series; five modelling; and three service utilisation studies. No studies reported on changes in rates of suicidal behaviour. Case series were largely drawn from news reporting in low/middle income countries and factors associated with suicide included fear of infection, social isolation and economic concerns. Conclusions: A marked improvement in the quality of design, methods, and reporting in future studies is needed. There is thus far no clear evidence of an increase in suicide, self-harm, suicidal behaviour, or suicidal thoughts associated with the pandemic. However, suicide data are challenging to collect in real time and economic effects are evolving.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: IL-6/Lym ratio, IL-6, D-Dimer, D-Dimer/fibrinogen ratio, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocytes count and neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio collected at hospital admission were tested as prognosticators of negative outcome, defined as combined endpoint in-hospital mortality and/or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission requiring oro-tracheal intubation (OTI). RESULTS: Study population encompassed two hundreds and twenty-three patients (46% females) with mean age  DS 69.4  13.3 years. Eighty-nine patients (39.9%) suffered for severe respiratory failure and required non invasive ventilation, helmets and/or high flow nasal cannula. Fourty-one patients (18.3%) died during hospital stay and/or required OTI. In these patients mean values of IL-6/Lym ratio, IL-6, CRP and N/L were significantly higher and lymphocytes count was significantly lower compared with patients discharged alive and/or not requiring OTI, while no difference was found in mean values of D-Dimer, D-Dimer/Fibrinogen ratio and fibrinogen.

Our first theorem is that this process converges deterministically. To model gridlets, we propose the grid calculus, a higher-order extension of our calculus of spilled arrays with primitives to treat spreadsheets as values. We define a semantics of gridlets as formulas in the grid calculus. Our second theorem shows the correctness of a remarkably direct encoding of the Abadi and Cardelli object calculus into the grid calculus.

Where we look is influenced by bottom-up salience and top-down factors, like value. For reactive saccades in response to suddenly appearing stimuli, it has been shown that short-latency saccades are biased towards salience, and that top-down control increases with increasing latency. Here, we show, in a series of six experiments, that this transition towards top-down control is not determined by the time it takes to integrate value information into the saccade plan, but by the time it takes to inhibit suddenly appearing salient stimuli. Participants made consecutive saccades to three fixation crosses and a vertical bar consisting of a high-salient and a rewarded low-salient region. Endpoints on the bar were biased towards salience whenever it appeared or reappeared shortly before the last saccade was initiated. This was also true when the eye movement was already planned. When the location of the suddenly appearing salient region was predictable, saccades were aimed in the opposite direction to nullify this sudden onset effect. Successfully inhibiting salience, however, could only be achieved by previewing the target.

At earlier stages, methanol conversion was complete, and the reaction product was mainly dimethyl ether (DME), although coke, methane, hydrogen and CO were also observed to a lesser extent. The catalyst was slowly deactivated with time-on-stream (TOS), but maintained a high selectivity to DME (>80%), with a higher yield to this product than 20% for more than 24 h at 500 C. A kinetic model was developed for methanol dehydration reaction, which included the effect of the inhibition of water and the deactivation of the catalyst by coke. The study of stoichiometric rates pointed out that coke could be produced through a formaldehyde intermediate, which might, alternatively, decompose into CO and H(2). On the other hand, the presence of 10% water in the feed did not affect the rate of coke formation, but produced a reduction of 50% in the DME yield, suggesting a reversible competitive adsorption of water. A LangmuirCHinshelwood reaction mechanism was used to develop a kinetic model that considered the deactivation of the catalyst. Activation energy values of 65 and 51 kJ/mol were obtained for DME and methane production in the temperature range from 450 C to 550 C.

This study assessed whether gene signatures translate into a pathologic feature for better disease stratification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mutual interdependence and risk stratification power of three gene signatures, cell cycle, hypoxia, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), were investigated in nine cohorts of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and five cohorts of patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma. The translation from gene signatures to a pathologic feature, tumor necrosis, was validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas lung adenocarcinoma cohort. The translation of signature score to pathway activity was further investigated by integrative analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas and The Cancer Protein Atlas lung adenocarcinoma data sets. RESULTS: The results showed that the three gene signatures were mutually interdependent in lung adenocarcinoma but not in lung squamous cell carcinoma. The signature activities were higher in necrosis-positive tumors than in necrosis-negative tumors. The signature score correlated with the expression level of the representative protein that implicated the activity of each pathway. These signatures stratified patients with operable and stage I lung adenocarcinomas into different risk groups independent of age and stage. Furthermore, the signatures translated to a pathologic feature, tumor necrosis, which predicted shorter overall and relapse-free survival in patients with operable and stage I lung adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSION: This study showed that gene signatures could translate into a pathologic feature, tumor necrosis, with risk stratification ability in patients with operable and stage I lung adenocarcinomas.","output":"Translating Gene Signatures Into a Pathologic Feature: Tumor Necrosis Predicts Disease Relapse in Operable and Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) have been an important hand hygiene tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, ABHS from non-traditional drug manufacturers have entered the market, triggered by a lack of ABHS availability. Some of these ABHS contain high levels of chemical impurities that may be harmful with frequent exposure. Additionally, the use of refillable dispensers designed to accept ABHS from bulk containers allows for mixing and evaporation that may compromise ABHS integrity. To understand the risks associated with low quality ABHS and bulk refilling practices, we collected 77 ABHS samples sourced from community settings (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) and 40 samples from a single school district. All samples were obtained from bulk refillable dispensers that were in use. Samples were analyzed for alcohol content, chemical impurities, aesthetic qualities, and presence of drug labeling information. Additionally, we performed laboratory-based experiments to determine the impact of dispenser design on alcohol evaporation rates. Over 70% of samples for which photos were available showed lack of essential labeling information, including missing Drug Facts Labels. For ABHS samples acquired from community settings, nearly 14% of samples had visible impurities, and over 30% of samples had concentrations of acetal and acetaldehyde in excess of FDA interim limits. Subpotent ethanol concentrations were observed in 9.09% and 82.05% of samples from community settings and the school district, respectively, with the school district sample results being associated with dispenser misuse. Laboratory-based experiments show dispenser design significantly impacts the rate of ethanol evaporation of ABHS products, especially if stored in open refillable dispensers without an internal reservoir. This study demonstrates risks associated with use of inferior ABHS and bulk refilling practices. Regulatory agencies should issue guidance on best practices in community settings to ensure the integrity of ABHS as an essential public health tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other transmissible diseases.","output":"Presence of unsafe chemical impurities, accelerated evaporation of alcohol, and lack of key labeling requirements are risks and concerns for some alcohol-based hand sanitizers and dispenser practices during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammatory responses, characterized by the overproduction of numerous proinflammatory mediators by immune cells, is essential to protect the host against invading pathogens. Excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines is a key pathogenic factor accounting for severe tissue injury and disease progression during the infection of multiple viruses, which are therefore termed as cytokine storm. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a ubiquitous DNA-binding protein released either over virus-infected cells or activated immune cells, may act as a proinflammatory cytokine with a robust capacity to potentiate inflammatory response and disease severity. Moreover, HMGB1 is a host factor that potentially participates in the regulation of viral replication cycles with complicated mechanisms. Currently, HMGB1 is regarded as a promising therapeutic target against virus infection. Here, we provide an overview of the updated studies on how HMGB1 is differentially manipulated by distinct viruses to regulate viral diseases.","output":"Potential effects of HMGB1 on viral replication and virus infection-induced inflammatory responses: a promising therapeutic target for virus infection-induced inflammatory diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV is a danger to the world and is spreading rapidly. Very little structural information about 2019-nCoV make this situation more difficult for drug designing.

Incorporation of any functional groups to the basic benzylidenechromanones enhances their binding ability. Chloro and bromo substitutions amplify the binding affinity. ADME studies of all these compounds indicate they are lipophilic, high gastro intestine absorbable and blood-brain barrier permeable.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is still one of the most frequent and deadly tumor in men and analysis of EVs from biological fluids of PCa patients has proven the feasibility and the unprecedented potential of such an approach. Here, we exploited an antibody-based proteomic technology, i.e. the Reverse-Phase Protein microArrays (RPPA), to measure key antigens and activated signaling in EVs isolated from sera of PCa patients. Notably, we found tumor-specific protein profiles associated with clinical settings as well as candidate markers for EV-based tumor diagnosis. Among others, PD-L1, ERG, Integrin-5, Survivin, TGF-, phosphorylated-TSC2 as well as partners of the MAP-kinase and mTOR pathways emerged as differentially expressed endpoints in tumor-derived EVs. In addition, the retrospective analysis of EVs from a 15-year follow-up cohort generated a protein signature with prognostic significance. Our results confirm that serum-derived EV cargo may be exploited to improve the current diagnostic procedures while providing potential prognostic and predictive information.

The team had to adapt to this instantly. Firstly we sought advice and had training through our respective membership organisations in order to ensure we worked safely and ethically. We then had to contact every client known to us to brief them on immediate changes. Our bereavement support volunteers continued to carry out phone calls. The counsellors were then trained in AccuRx and Zoom to provide video calls. The team also attended various on-line forums for support and to keep abreast of new initiatives. The team developed two 8 week courses on Anxiety Management and Mindfulness for Emotional Well-Being, a newly bereaved counselling group and bereavement therapy group;all facilitated via Zoom.Good planning and IT support are essential to help with technical issues and training on various platforms.

To date, it is highly controversial whether such capability can be adapted in mammalian species as another site for gas exchange. Here, we report the advent of the intestinal breathing phenomenon in mammalians by exploiting EVA (enteral ventilation via anus). METHODS Two different modes of EVA were investigated in an experimental model of respiratory failure: intra-rectal oxygen O2 gas ventilation (g-EVA) or liquid ventilation (l-EVA) with oxygenated perfluorocarbon. After induction of type 1 respiratory failure, we analyzed the effectiveness of g-EVA and I-EVA in mouse and pig, followed by preclinical safety analysis in rat. FINDINGS Both intra-rectal O2 gas and oxygenated liquid delivery were shown to provide vital rescue of experimental models of respiratory failure, improving survival, behavior, and systemic O2 level. A rodent and porcine model study confirmed the tolerable and repeatable features of an enema-like l-EVA procedure with no major signs of complications. CONCLUSIONS EVA has proven effective in mammalians such that it oxygenated systemic circulation and ameliorated respiratory failure. Due to the proven safety of perfluorochemicals in clinics, EVA potentially provides an adjunctive means of oxygenation for patients under respiratory distress conditions.

Veterans are disproportionately affected by disorders of addiction; cocaine use disorder (CUD) being particularly problematic due to high relapse rates and the absence of approved pharmacotherapies. Prize-based Contingency Management (PBCM) is an evidence-based behavioral intervention for CUD, involving incentives for cocaine abstinence but treatment response is variable. Measurement-based adaptation of PBCM has promise to improve effectiveness but remains to be usefully developed. METHODS: This trial aims to determine if individuals with distinct neurocognitive profiles differentially benefit from one of two existing versions of PBCM. CUD patients will be randomized into treatment-as-usual or 12-weeks of PBCM using either monetary or tangible prize incentives. Prior to randomization, EEG will be used to assess response to monetary versus tangible reward; EEG and cognitive-behavioral measures of working memory, cognitive control, and episodic future thinking will also be acquired. Substance use and treatment engagement will be monitored throughout the treatment interval and assessments will be repeated at post-treatment. DISCUSSION: Results of this trial may elucidate individual differences contributing to PBCM treatment response and reveal predictors of differential benefits from existing treatment variants. The design also affords the opportunity to evaluate treatment-related changes in neurocognitive functioning over the course of PBCM. Our model posits that PBCM scaffolds future-oriented goal representation and self-control to support abstinence. Individuals with poorer functioning may be less responsive to abstract monetary reward and will therefore achieve better outcomes with respect to abstinence and treatment engagement when tangible incentives are utilized.","output":"Electrophysiological predictors and indicators of contingency management treatment response: Rationale and design for the ways of rewarding abstinence project (WRAP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the midst of COVID-19 pandemic, cancer patients (pts) are regarded as a highly vulnerable population Pts requiring hospital admission for treatment (Tx) administration are potentially exposed to a higher risk of infection and worse outcome given the multiple in-hospital exposures and the Tx immunosuppressive effects Methods: COVINT is an observational study assessing COVID-19 incidence among pts receiving anticancer Tx in the outpatient clinic of the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano All consecutive pts with non-hematologic malignancies treated with intravenous or subcutaneous/intramuscular Tx in the outpatient clinic were enrolled Pts were admitted to the clinic wearing surgical masks and only if asymptomatic and afebrile The primary endpoint is the rate of occurrence of COVID-19 Secondary endpoints include the rate of COVID-19 related deaths and Tx interruptions The association between clinical and biological characteristics and COVID-19 occurrence is also evaluated using nonparametric tests COVID-19 diagnosis is defined as: a) certain if confirmed by RT-PCR assay of nasopharyngeal swabs (NFS);b) suspected in case of new symptoms and/or CT scan evidence of interstitial pneumonia with negative/not performed NFS;c) negative in case of neither symptoms nor radiological evidence Results: In the first two months (16th February-10th April 2020) of observation, 1083 pts were included Of these, 11 (1%) were confirmed and 73 (6 7%) suspected for COVID-19 No significant differences in terms of cancer and Tx type emerged between the three subgroups Prophylactic use of myeloid growth factors was adopted in 5 3%, 2 7% and 0% of COVID-19-free, -suspected and -confirmed pts (p=0 003) Overall, 96 (8 9%) pts delayed Tx as a precaution for the pandemic Among the 11 confirmed cases, 6 (55%) died of COVID-19 complications, and anticancer Tx was restarted in only one Conclusions: During the pandemic peak, accurate protective measures successfully resulted in low rates of COVID-19 diagnosis, though with high lethality Within the COVINT study, prospective pts surveillance will continue with NFS swabs and IgG/IgM serology performed before each Tx cycle until pandemic resolution Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors Funding: Has not received any funding Disclosure: F G M De Braud: Advisory/Consultancy: Tiziana Life Sciences;Advisory/Consultancy, Speaker Bureau/Expert testimony, Research grant/Funding (institution), Travel/Accommodation/Expenses: BMS;Advisory/Consultancy, Research grant/Funding (institution), Travel/Accommodation/Expenses: Celgene;Advisory/Consultancy, Research grant/Funding (institution): Novartis;Advisory/Consultancy: Servier;Advisory/Consultancy: Pharm Research Associated;Advisory/Consultancy: Daiichi Sankyo;Advisory/Consultancy, Speaker Bureau/Expert testimony: Ignyta;Advisory/Consultancy, Travel/Accommodation/Expenses: Amgen;Advisory/Consultancy, Speaker Bureau/Expert testimony, Research grant/Funding (institution): Pfizer;Advisory/Consultancy: Octimet Oncology;Advisory/Consultancy, Research grant/Funding (institution): Incyte;Advisory/Consultancy: Pierre Fabre;Advisory/Consultancy: Eli Lilly;Advisory/Consultancy, Speaker Bureau/Expert testimony, Research grant/Funding (institution), Travel/Accommodation/Expenses: Roche;Advisory/Consultancy: Astra Zeneca;Advisory/Consultancy: Gentili;Advisory/Consultancy, Speaker Bureau/Expert testimony: Dephaforum;Advisory/Consultancy, Speaker Bureau/Expert testimony, Research grant/Funding (institution): MSD;Advisory/Consultancy, Speaker Bureau/Expert testimony: Bayer;Advisory/Consultancy: Fondazione Menarini;Research grant/Funding (self): NMS;Research grant/Funding (institution): Merck KGAA;Research grant/Funding (institution): Kymab;Research grant/Funding (institution): Tesaro;Speaker Bureau/Expert testimony: Biotechespert Ltd;Speaker Bureau/Expert testimony: Prime Oncology All other authors have declared no conflicts of interest","output":"COVID-19 risk for patients undergoing anticancer treatment at the outpatient clinic of the National Cancer Institute of Milan: The COVINT study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the world-wide development of 2019 novel coronavirus, although WHO has officially announced the disease as COVID-19, one controversial term -\\"Chinese Virus\\"is still being used by a great number of people.

This study investigates boat-based recreational fishing in Western Australia from March to August 2020, where COVID-19 measures relevant to recreational fishers included various travel restrictions, and social and physical distancing measures. Information from surveys of licensed recreational fishers and fisheries compliance officers and camera footage from key boat ramps is presented. A lower proportion of Perth metropolitan fishers went fishing compared with regional fishers. Metropolitan fishers also reported fewer days fished and lower participation in demersal and shore-based line fishing than regional fishers. In contrast, compliance officers observed more fishing activity in both metropolitan and regional locations. Fishing plans were mostly affected by travel restrictions with more metropolitan fishers (57%) affected compared with regional fishers (49%). Daily recreational vessel retrievals at key boat ramps varied between locations, with metropolitan fishers initially unable to travel to regional centres. There was no decline in vessel retrievals at metropolitan boat ramps during the most rigid restrictions and northern regional boat ramps experienced substantial increases in recreational vessel activity once travel restrictions eased.

Although the phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is low, the whole genome phylogenetic tree can be divided into five clusters/clades based on the tree topology and clustering of specific mutations, but its branches exhibit low genetic distance and bootstrap support values.

Temporal and spatial analysis of these potentially adaptive mutations revealed that the incidence of some of these sites was declining after having reached an (often local) peak, whereas the frequency of other sites is continually increasing and now exhibit a worldwide distribution.

As physical distancing regulations were introduced to manage outbreaks, individuals, groups, and communities engaged extensively on social media to express their thoughts and emotions. This internet-mediated communication of self-reported information encapsulates the emotional health and mental well-being of all individuals impacted by the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to investigate the human emotions related to the COVID-19 pandemic expressed on social media over time, using an artificial intelligence (AI) framework. METHODS: Our study explores emotion classifications, intensities, transitions, and profiles, as well as alignment to key themes and topics, across the four stages of the pandemic: declaration of a global health crisis (ie, prepandemic), the first lockdown, easing of restrictions, and the second lockdown. This study employs an AI framework comprised of natural language processing, word embeddings, Markov models, and the growing self-organizing map algorithm, which are collectively used to investigate social media conversations. The investigation was carried out using 73,000 public Twitter conversations posted by users in Australia from January to September 2020. RESULTS: The outcomes of this study enabled us to analyze and visualize different emotions and related concerns that were expressed and reflected on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be used to gain insights into citizens' mental health. First, the topic analysis showed the diverse as well as common concerns people had expressed during the four stages of the pandemic. It was noted that personal-level concerns expressed on social media had escalated to broader concerns over time. Second, the emotion intensity and emotion state transitions showed that fear and sadness emotions were more prominently expressed at first; however, emotions transitioned into anger and disgust over time. Negative emotions, except for sadness, were significantly higher (P<.05) in the second lockdown, showing increased frustration. Temporal emotion analysis was conducted by modeling the emotion state changes across the four stages of the pandemic, which demonstrated how different emotions emerged and shifted over time. Third, the concerns expressed by social media users were categorized into profiles, where differences could be seen between the first and second lockdown profiles. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the diverse emotions and concerns that were expressed and recorded on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic reflected the mental health of the general public. While this study established the use of social media to discover informed insights during a time when physical communication was impossible, the outcomes could also contribute toward postpandemic recovery and understanding psychological impact via emotion changes, and they could potentially inform health care decision making. This study exploited AI and social media to enhance our understanding of human behaviors in global emergencies, which could lead to improved planning and policy making for future crises.","output":"Emotions of COVID-19: Content Analysis of Self-Reported Information Using Artificial Intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D levels are alarmingly low (<75 nmol/L) in 65-70% of North American children older than 1 year. An increased risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), asthma-related hospitalizations and use of anti-inflammatory medication have all been linked with low vitamin D. No study has determined whether wintertime vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of URTI and asthma exacerbations, two of the most common and costly illnesses of early childhood. The objectives of this study are: 1) to compare the effect of high dose (2000 IU/day) vs. standard dose (400 IU/day) vitamin D supplementation in achieving reductions in laboratory confirmed URTI and asthma exacerbations during the winter in preschool-aged Canadian children; and 2) to assess the effect of high dose vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D serum levels and specific viruses that cause URTI. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Over 4 successive winters we will recruit 750 healthy children 1C5 years of age. Participating physicians are part of a primary healthcare research network called TARGet Kids!. Children will be randomized to the standard dose or high dose oral supplemental vitamin D for a minimum of 4 months (200 children per group). Parents will obtain a nasal swab from their child with each URTI, report the number of asthma exacerbations and complete symptom checklists. Unscheduled physician visits for URTIs and asthma exacerbations will be recorded. By May, a blood sample will be drawn to determine vitamin D serum levels. The primary analysis will be a comparison of URTI rate between study groups using a Poisson regression model. Secondary analyses will compare vitamin D serum levels, asthma exacerbations and the frequency of specific viral agents between groups. DISCUSSION: Identifying whether vitamin D supplementation of preschoolers can reduce wintertime viral URTIs and asthma exacerbations and what dose is optimal may reduce population wide morbidity and associated health care and societal costs. This information will assist in determining practice and health policy recommendations related to vitamin D supplementation in healthy Canadian preschoolers.","output":"DO IT Trial: vitamin D Outcomes and Interventions in Toddlers C a TARGet Kids! randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics have a high socio-economic impact on countries. Singapore and Taiwan, which had pandemic strategies in place, fared much better than almost all other countries in the world during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. In a massive country like India, the coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected millions of people. While studies have estimated the rate of transmission and vulnerability zones, there is still a pressing need to understand the spatio-temporal progression of various pandemics across the population. Here, we review the spread of pandemics in India and identify states with a high probability of being initial hotspots. It was found that pandemics tend to follow a similar transmission route in India. For the COVID-19 pandemic, a spatial link has been established between seasons and disease progression. For instance, districts are marked where a sudden increase in cases (as high as 800%) was observed during monsoon (i.e. rainy season). Following the spatio-temporal trajectory of COVID-19 in India, we found that in post-monsoon, northern regions with hilly terrain witnessed the highest increase in the number of cases. Identifying areas on the trajectory of pandemics will help us better prepare for an outbreak more effectively in the future.

Severe COVID-19 patients often develop ARDS which is associated with poor prognosis. Assessing risk factors for COVID-19 severity is indispensable for implementing and evaluating therapeutic interventions. We investigated the temporal associations between the SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag), total Immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, and several laboratory parameters in hospitalized patients with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity. METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and total Ig Spike (S) protein-specific antibodies were determined for each patient with lateral flow assays through repeated sampling every two days. Hematological and biochemical parameters were evaluated at the same time points. RESULTS: 40 Greek COVID-19 patients (31 males, 9 females) with a median age of 59.50  16.21 years were enrolled in the study. The median time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 8.0  4.19 days. A significant negative correlation was observed between the SARS-CoV-2 Ag and total Ig levels. The temporal correlation patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 NP Ag and anti-S total Ig levels with laboratory markers varied among patients with differing degrees of COVID-19 severity.

Most human TB cases arise from long-term asymptomatic infections. Significant diagnostic challenges remain in the detection of both infection and disease development from latency in elephants due to their huge bodies. In this study, we assessed cryopreserved sera collected for over 16 years, from the first Japanese treatment case of elephant TB. Semi-quantification of IgG levels to 11 proteins showed high detection levels of 3 proteins, namely ESAT6/CFP10, MPB83 and Ag85B. The level of IgG specific to these 3 antigens was measured longitudinally, revealing high and stable ESAT6/CFP10 IgG levels regardless of onset or treatment. Ag85B-specifc IgG levels were largely responsive to onset or treatment, while those of MPB83 showed intermediate responses. These results suggest that ESAT6/CFP10 is immunodominant in both asymptomatic and symptomatic phases, making it useful in the detection of infection. On the other hand, Ag85B has the potential to be a marker for the prediction of disease onset and in the evaluation of treatment effectiveness in elephants.","output":"Monitoring IgG against Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins in an Asian elephant cured of tuberculosis that developed from long-term latency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The omnipresence of food cues in everyday life has been linked to troubled eating behavior and rising rates of obesity. While extended research has been conducted on the effects of negative emotions and stress on food consumption, very little is known about how positive emotions affect eating and particularly attention toward food cues. In the present study, we investigated whether humor impacts attentional bias toward food and whether it will affect preferences for healthy and unhealthy food items, depending on the hunger state. To do so, a group of randomly assigned participants watched funny video clips (humor group, N = 46) or neutral ones (control group, N = 49). Afterwards, they performed a modified Posner cueing task with low or high caloric food images serving as cues. We found a significant group  hunger interaction. Compared to the control group, the humor group responded more slowly to food cues when hungry, whereas the opposite was true when participants were satiated. Additionally, our results suggest that hunger possibly directs attention away from healthy food cues and toward unhealthy ones. No group differences were found with respect to food preferences and engagement and disengagement of attention. We discuss the potential of humor in counteracting aversive consequences of hunger on attention allocation toward food. We propose an underlying mechanism involving a combined reduction in cortisol levels and a decrease in activation of the reward system.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) technology cannot be implemented easily and in large scale in some communities due to lack of resources and infrastructures. Here, we report a simple colorimetric strategy derived from linker-based single-component assembly of gold nanoparticle core-spherical nucleic acids (AuNP-coreSNAs) for visual detection of PCR products of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) template. A palindromic linker is designed based on E gene of SARS-CoV-2 to program the identical colloidal SNAs into large assemblies along with a distinct red-to-purple color change. The linker acts as a probe of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in conventional PCR reaction. In the presence of the correct template, the palindromic linker, which is complementary to a short region within the amplicon, is cleaved by 5-exonuclease activity of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase. Disintegrating the palindromic linker during the amplification process inhibits the post single-component assembly formation of SNAs. So, positive and negative viral samples produce simply red and purple colors in the post PCR colorimetric test, respectively.

The study utilized 2015-2019 mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics for 29,137 Hispanic individuals who died of drug overdose. Using population estimates from the American Community Survey, age-standardized drug overdose mortality rates were calculated by specific Latine heritage and sex, nativity, educational attainment, and geographic region. Standardized rate ratios (SRRs), incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from negative binomial regression models, and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated, and multiple imputation was used for missing Latine heritage group in select models. Drug overdose mortality rates in the Puerto Rican heritage population were more than three times as high as in the Mexican heritage population (IRR 3.61 [95% CI 3.02-4.30] in unadjusted model; IRR 3.70 [95% CI 3.31-4.15] in model adjusting for age, sex, nativity, educational attainment, and region; SRR 3.23 [95% CI, 3.15-3.32] in age-standardized model with missing Hispanic heritage imputed). Higher age-standardized rates of drug overdose mortality were observed in males than females across all Latine groups, yet the magnitude of the sex differential varied by Latine heritage. The relationship between drug overdose mortality and nativity differed by Latine heritage; in all groups except Puerto Rican, overdose mortality rates were significantly higher in the US-born than those not US-born.

Low socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with lung function decline, increased exacerbation rates, increased health care utilization, and decreased survival in cystic fibrosis. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the US economy, placing people with cystic fibrosis at risk for negative impacts due to changes in social determinants of health. METHODS: To characterize the impact of COVID-19-related changes in social determinants of health in the adult cystic fibrosis population, a social determinants of health questionnaire was designed and distributed to patients as part of a quality improvement project. RESULTS: Of 132 patients contacted, 76 (57.6%) responses were received. Of these responses, 22 (28.9%) answered yes to at least one question that indicated an undesired change in social determinants of health. Patients with stable employment prior to COVID-19 were more likely to endorse undesired change in all domains of the questionnaire, and the undesired changes were most likely to be related to employment, insurance security, and access to medications. Patients receiving disability were more likely to report hardship related to utilities and food security compared with patients previously employed or unemployed. Of patients endorsing risk of socioeconomic hardship, 21 (95.5%) were contacted by a social worker and provided resources. CONCLUSION: Utilizing a social determinants of health questionnaire to screen for social instability in the context of COVID-19 is feasible and beneficial for patients with cystic fibrosis.

Various clinical manifestations have been attributed to FCV, i.e. upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), oral ulcerations, gingivostomatitis, limping syndrome and virulent systemic disease. Additionally, healthy cats can shed FCV. The aims of this study were 1) to investigate the frequency of FCV in cats with FCV-related symptoms and in healthy cats in Switzerland, 2) to assess risk and protective factors for infection, such as signalment, housing conditions, vaccination, and co-infection with URTD-associated pathogens, and 3) to address the association between clinical symptoms and FCV infection. RESULTS: Oropharyngeal, nasal and conjunctival swabs were collected in 24 veterinary practices from 200 FCV-suspect and 100 healthy cats originating from 19 cantons of Switzerland. The samples were tested for FCV using virus isolation and reverse-transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and for feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), Mycoplasma felis, Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica using real-time qPCR. Within the two populations (FCV-suspect/healthy), the observed PCR prevalences were: FCV 45 %/8 %, FHV-1 20 %/9 %, C. felis 8 %/1 %, B. bronchiseptica 4 %/2 %, M. felis 47 %/31 % and any co-infections thereof 40 %/14 %. Based on multivariable regression models amongst FCV-suspect cats (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval]), co-infection with M. felis (1.75 [0.97; 3.14]), group housing (2.11 [1.02; 4.34]) and intact reproductive status (1.80 [0.99; 3.28]) were found to be risk factors for FCV infection. In healthy cats, intact reproductive status (22.2 [1.85; 266.7]) and group housing (46.4 [5.70; 377.7]) were found to be associated with FCV infection. Based on an univariable approach, FCV-suspect cats were found to be significantly less often FCV-positive when vaccinated (0.48 [0.24; 0.94]). Oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis and stomatitis, but not classical signs of URTD were significantly associated with FCV infection (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FCV was detected in less than half of the cats that were judged FCV-suspect by veterinary practitioners. For a clinical diagnosis, FCV-related symptoms should be revisited. FCV infection was present in some healthy cats, underlining the importance of asymptomatic carriers in FCV epidemiology. To reduce FCV-related problems in multi-cat environments, reduction of group size in addition to the generally recommended vaccination are advocated.

Nevertheless, the primary energy saving (PES) and CO2 reduction potentials of this solution are strictly related to the accurate definition and management of thermal and electric loads. Data-driven analysis could represent a significant contribution for optimizing the CHP plant design and operation and then to fully deploy this potential. In this paper, the use of a bi-level optimization approach for the design of a CHP is applied to a real application (a large Italian hospital in Rome). Based on historical data of the hospital thermal and electric demand, clustering analysis is applied to identify a limited number of load patterns representative of the annual load.

A Mixed Integer Linear Programming coupled with a Genetic Algorithm is implemented to optimize the energy dispatch and size of the CHP plant, respectively, with the aim of maximizing the PES while minimizing total costs and carbon emissions. Finally, the effects of integrating biogas from the Anaerobic Digestion (AD) of the Spent Coffee Ground (SCG) and Energy Storage (ES) technologies are investigated. The results achieved provide a benchmark for the application of these technologies in this specific field, highlighting performances and benefits with respect to traditional approaches. The effective design of the CHP unit allows for achieving CO2 reduction in the order of 10%, ensuring economic savings (up to 40%), when compared with a baseline configuration where no CHP is installed. Further environmental benefits can be achieved by means of the integration of AD and ES pushing the CO2 savings up to 20%, still keeping the economical convenience of the capital investment.","output":"Data-Driven Optimal Design of a CHP Plant for a Hospital Building: Highlights on the Role of Biogas and Energy Storages on the Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A group of 25 rabies viruses (RABVs), recovered from 24 dogs and one human case, were collected from various areas in China between 2004 and 2006.

In this study, using state-of-the-art computational methods, natural products were screened and their molecular mechanism to disrupt spike RBD-ACE2 recognition was evaluated. There is the sensitivity of results to receptor ensemble docking calculations. Binding free energy and MD simulation are important tools to evaluate the thermodynamics of binding stability and the capacity of top hits to disrupt RBD-ACE2 recognition.

Our aim was to compare anti-TNF serum concentrations between patients with actively draining and closed perianal fistulas. Methods: A retrospective survey was performed in CD patients with perianal disease treated with IFX or adalimumab (ADL). Fistula closure was defined as absence of active drainage at gentle finger compression and/or fistula healing on magnetic resonance imaging. Results: We identified 66 CD patients with a history of perianal fistulas treated with IFX (n = 47) and ADL (n = 19). Median IFX serum trough concentrations ([interquartile range]) were higher in patients with closed fistulas (n = 32) compared to patients with actively draining fistulas (n = 15): 6.0 g/ml [5.4-6.9] versus 2.3 g/ml [1.1-4.0], respectively (p < .001)).

Previous studies have described the value offered by these agreements in separate source and destination country perspectives. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify and summarise existing literature on shared value creation for both source and destination countries. METHOD: We conducted a systematic scoping review of health databases and grey literature. Using Mark Moore and Colin Talbot frameworks, we summarised the public value propositions in migration agreements and how state actors addressed competing priorities. RESULTS: Most articles (34/63, 53.9%) reported transnational SHW mobility as the public value proposition for source and destination countries. Fewer articles, 14 (22.2%) and 9 (14.3%) articles, respectively, referred to achieving health workforce sustainability and building capacity for SHW migration governance as shared public values. The most identified competing public value (CPV) was an overriding focus on addressing SHW shortages in destination countries (20/63, 37.7%). Efforts to address this CPV include mitigation of the adverse effects of migration (43/63, 68.3%) and promoting health workforce development in source countries (15, 23.8%). At the same time, state actors retained regulatory discretion for protecting their countrys public health interest (34, 54%).

Respiratory related oscillation (RRO) is derived from rhythmic nasal airflow in the olfactory bulb (OB) and is conveyed to higher order brain networks, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC), where it may potentially contribute to communication between these structures by synchronizing their activities at the respiratory rate. RRO was shown to change with sleep-wake states, it is strongest in quiet waking, somewhat less in active waking, characterized with theta activity in the HC, and absent in sleep. The goal of this study was to test RRO synchronization between PFC and HC under urethane anesthesia where theta and non-theta states spontaneously alternate. We found that in theta states, PFC-HC coherences significantly correlated with OB-HC but not with OB-PFC, even though RRO was stronger in PFC than in HC. In non-theta states, PFC-HC synchrony correlated with coherences connecting OB to either PFC or HC. Thus, similar to freely behaving rats, PFC-HC synchrony at RRO was primarily dependent on the response of HC to the common rhythmic drive, but only in theta state.

We performed quantitative mass spectrometry of IAV1918-infected cells to measure host protein dysregulation.

IgG of high avidity is established during affinity maturation. A failure to achieve high avidity IgG may result in the lack of protective immunity towards infection and disease. It is known that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cellular receptor is driven by high affinity. Therefore it is predictable that protective antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 should show high affinity/avidity. AVIDITY AFTER SARS-COV-2 INFECTION: Recent findings by several groups demonstrate that the serological response towards infection with SARS-CoV-2 as well as with seasonal coronaviruses is characterized by incomplete avidity maturation, followed by a decline of the serological response. This might facilitate reinfection, prevent herd immunity and potentially allow repeated cycles of infection. CONSEQUENCES FOR VACCINATION TOWARDS SARS-COV-2: Therefore, the sole focus on antibody titers reached after vaccination towards SARS-CoV-2 might not be sufficient to evaluate the degree of achieved protection.

Materials and Methods: The MIRI model in rats was firstly constructed. Twenty-four male rats were randomly assigned into the sham group, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) group, and simvastatin group, with 8 rats in each group. Contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as serum levels of CK and inflammatory factors, in rats were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the three groups was examined. Through flow cytometry and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, apoptosis and viability in each group were detected, respectively. Relative levels of HMGB1, Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), eNOS, and thrombomodulin (TM) were finally determined. Results: Simvastatin treatment markedly enhanced SOD activity and reduced contents of MDA, LDH, and creatine kinase (CK) in MIRI rats. The increased apoptosis and decreased viability following MIRI were partially reversed by simvastatin treatment. Besides, MIRI resulted in the upregulation of inflammatory factors and chemokines. Their elevations were abolished by simvastatin. In MIRI rats, simvastatin upregulated KLF2 and p-eNOS.

However, up till now, no studies investigating this association were conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups, i.e. older adults residing in nursing homes. The objective of this study has been to explore the association of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19 infected older adults residing in nursing homes. Design We undertook a retrospective multi-centre cohort study to analyse the association between ACEi/ARB and/or statin use with clinical outcome of COVID-19. The outcomes were 1) serious COVID-19 defined as long-stay hospital admission or death within 14 days of disease onset, and 2) asymptomatic, i.e. no disease symptoms in the whole study-period while still being PCR diagnosed. Setting and participants A total of 154 COVID-19 positive subjects was identified, residing in one of two Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks. Measures Logistic regression models were applied with age, sex, functional status, diabetes and hypertension as covariates. Results We found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 (OR 2.91; CI 1.27-6.71), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (OR 2.65; CI 1.13-6.68). Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.24-1.87). There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 2.72; CI 0.59-25.1) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.48; CI 0.10-1.97). Conclusions and Implications Our data indicate that statin intake in old, frail adults could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 clinical symptoms. The role of statins and renin-angiotensin system drugs need to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomised clinical trials.","output":"The effects of ARBs, ACEIs and statins on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infection among nursing home residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI) published several guidelines addressing the medical health services helping to detect SARS CoV?2. Needing an available and specific test strategy regarding SARS-CoV?2, our own test strategy strictly followed these testing criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a retrospective analysis, we verified if such a test strategy was an effective tool in the context of infection prevention control and as reliable SARS-CoV?2 detection. Therefore, we analysed our own test results of suspected SARS-CoV?2 cases between 26 February and 6 April 2020. Additionally, we used a geovisualisation tool to visualise test frequencies and positive test results within different districts of Mannheim based on peoples addresses. RESULTS: There were on average 7% positive test results of SARS-CoV?2 within a population with typical symptoms of COVID-19 (n = 2808). There was no positive test result within an asymptomatic population (n = 448). However, one positive test result turned out to be a nosocomial infection. Finally, geovisualisation highlighted a shift of test frequencies and local positive rates for SARS-CoV?2 from one district of Mannheim to another. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our test strategy strictly based on testing criteria suggested by the Robert Koch Institute resulted in a steady rate of positive tests and allowed us to increase test capacity without causing numbers of nosocomial infections of COVID-19. Geovisualisation tools can offer support in analysing an ongoing spread of transmissible diseases.

Three scenarios, 1) no vaccination, 2) vaccination of 60% of the population over 12 months, 3) vaccination of 60% of the population over 7 months were examined. The effects of changes in t (doubling-time for the spread of infection, known to be slower in the summer months) and t (half-life of recovery from infection) on the daily number of infectious persons, the cumulative number of infected persons, and the duration of critical occupancy of intensive-care units were also determined. RESULTS Vaccination produced a marked and rapid reduction in the number of infectious persons (up to -60%) and the total number of infected persons (up to -70%). A 7-month vaccination strategy was significantly more effective than a 12-month strategy. The summer effect came too late to have an additional effect on the spread of infection. Vaccination was predicted to reduce the duration of critical occupancy of intensive-care facilities by ~ 70%. DISCUSSION The predictions are based on the assumptions that lockdown conditions are maintained and vaccine availability is not limiting.

We generated a transcriptome sequence of Hypsignathus monstrosus, the African hammer-headed bat, and additional transcriptome sequence for Rousettus aegyptiacus, the Egyptian fruit bat. We then combined these data with existing genomic and transcriptomic data from 16 other bat species. In the analysis of such datasets, there is no clear consensus on the most reliable computational methods for the curation of quality multiple sequence alignments since these public datasets represent multiple investigators and methods, including different source materials (chromosomal DNA or expressed RNA). Here we lay out a systematic analysis of parameters and produce an advanced pipeline for curating orthologous gene alignments from combined transcriptomic and genomic data, including a software package: the Mismatching Isoform eXon Remover (MIXR). Using this method, we created alignments of 11,677 bat genes, 1,107 of which contain orthologs from all 18 species.

The aim of the study was to compare the outcome of open and laparoscopic appendectomies during a transition period. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study with prospectively collected data. All patients who underwent an operation for suspected appendicitis at the Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital in Stockholm between 2006 and 2010 were included in the study. RESULTS 1745 children were included in this study, of whom 1010 had a laparoscopic intervention. There were no significant differences in the rate of postoperative abscesses, wound infections, readmissions or reoperations between the two groups. The median operating time was longer for laparoscopic appendectomy than for open appendectomy, 51 vs. 37minutes (p<0.05). The postoperative length of stay was similar in the two groups. A simple comparison between the groups suggested that laparoscopic appendectomy had a shorter median postoperative length of stay, 43 vs. 57hours (p<0.05). However, there was a trend in time for a shorter postoperative length of stay, and a trend for more of the procedures to be performed laparoscopically over time so on regression analysis, the apparent decrease in length of stay with laparoscopy could be ascribed to the general trend toward decreased length of stay over time, with no specific additional effect of laparoscopy. CONCLUSIONS Our data show no difference in outcome between open and laparoscopic surgery for acute appendicitis in children in regard of complications. The initial assumption that the patients treated with laparoscopic surgery had a shorter postoperative stay was not confirmed with linear regression, which showed that the assumed difference was due only to a trend toward shorter postoperative length of stay over time, regardless of the surgical intervention.","output":"Outcome after introduction of laparoscopic appendectomy in children: A cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we develop a likelihood-free approach for population calibration, which involves finding distributions of model parameters when fed through the model produces a set of outputs that matches available population data.

There was an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (IRR, 1.38; 95% CI: 1.12C1.71 at 15C21 days) with BNT162b2. An independent Scottish cohort provided further support for the association between ChAdOx1nCoV and GuillainCBarr syndrome (IRR, 2.32; 95% CI: 1.08C5.02 at 1C28 days). There was a substantially higher risk of all neurological outcomes in the 28 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test including GuillainCBarr syndrome (IRR, 5.25; 95% CI: 3.00C9.18). Overall, we estimated 38 excess cases of GuillainCBarr syndrome per 10 million people receiving ChAdOx1nCoV-19 and 145 excess cases per 10 million people after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. In summary, although we find an increased risk of neurological complications in those who received COVID-19 vaccines, the risk of these complications is greater following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.","output":"Neurological complications after first dose of COVID-19 vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychological science is struggling with moving forward in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially due to the halting of behavioral data collection in the laboratory. Safety barriers to assessing psychological behavior in person increased the need for remote data collection in natural settings. In response to these challenges, researchers, including our team, have utilized this time to advance remote behavioral methodology. In this article, we provide an overview of our groups strategies for remote data collection methodology and examples from our research in collecting behavioral data in the context of psychological functioning. Then, we describe the design and development of our strategies for remote data collection of mother-infant interactions, with the goal being to assess maternal sensitivity and intrusiveness, as well as infants adaptive behaviors in several developmental domains. During these virtual visits over Zoom, mother-infant dyads watched a book-reading video and were asked to participate in peek-a-boo, toy play, and toy removal tasks. After the behavioral tasks, a semi-structured interview (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale C VABS III) was conducted to assess the infants adaptive behavior in communication, socialization, daily living skills, and motor domains. We delineate the specific strategies we applied to integrate laboratory tasks and a semi-structured interview into remote data collection in home settings with mothers and infants. We also elaborate on issues encountered during remote data collection and how we resolved these challenges. Lastly, to inform protocols for future remote data collection, we address considerations and recommendations, as well as benefits and future directions for behavioral researchers in developmental psychology research.","output":"Advances in Behavioral Remote Data Collection in the Home Setting: Assessing the Mother-Infant Relationship and Infants Adaptive Behavior via Virtual Visits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile applications are increasingly regarded as important tools for an integrated strategy of infection containment in post-lockdown societies around the globe.

First, we review and categorize the economic literature concerned with narratives and work out the different paradigms that are at play. Only a subset of the literature considers narratives to be active drivers of economic activity. In order to solidify the foundation of narrative economics, we propose a definition of collective economic narratives, isolating five important characteristics. We argue that, for a narrative to be economically relevant, it must be a sense-making story that emerges in a social context and suggests action to a social group. We also systematize how a collective economic narrative differs from a topic and from other kinds of narratives that are likely to have less impact on the economy. With regard to the popular use of topic modeling as an empirical strategy, we suggest that the complementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language processing toolkit and the development of new methods is inevitable to go beyond identifying topics and be able to move towards true empirical narrative economics.","output":"Narratives in economics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiation-induced skin injury (RISI) is one of the common serious side effects of radiotherapy (RT) for patients with malignant tumors.

Prospective determination of ELISA anti-RBD IgG titer facilitated selection and transfusion of the highest titer units available. Retrospective analysis by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay revealed a median signal/cutoff (S/C) ratio of 24.0 for transfused units, a value far exceeding the recently FDA-required cutoff of 12.0 for designation of high titer convalescent plasma. With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours post-hospitalization for transfusing COVID-19 patients with high titer convalescent plasma.

A model for measuring and preventing the continued spread of COVID-19 is urgently required to provide smart health care services. This requires using advanced intelligent computing such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive computing, cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. This paper proposes a model for predicting COVID-19 using the SIR and machine learning for smart health care and the well-being of the citizens of KSA. Knowing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered cases each day is critical for mathematical modeling to be able to identify the behavioral effects of the pandemic. It forecasts the situation for the upcoming 700 days. The proposed system predicts whether COVID-19 will spread in the population or die out in the long run. Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented here as a means to forecast the progress of the outbreak and its possible end for three types of scenarios: \\"no actions,\\" \\"lockdown,\\" and \\"new medicines.\\" The effect of interventions like lockdown and new medicines is compared with the \\"no actions\\" scenario. The lockdown case delays the peak point by decreasing the infection and affects the area equality rule of the infected curves. On the other side, new medicines have a significant impact on infected curve by decreasing the number of infected people about time. Available forecast data on COVID-19 using simulations predict that the highest level of cases might occur between 15 and 30 November 2020. Simulation data suggest that the virus might be fully under control only after June 2021. The reproductive rate shows that measures such as government lockdowns and isolation of individuals are not enough to stop the pandemic.

Methods A prospective observational study including patients hospitalized for suspicion of COVID-19 in a COVID unit was performed from 20th March to 5th April 2020, in Perpignan, France. Patients for which there was a doubt upon diagnosis, who were recently under oral corticosteroids, had myeloid malignancy or human immunodeficient virus infection were excluded. SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using an RT-PCR assay, from nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Complete blood count were performed for all patients. Results One-hundred and twenty-one patient were included: 57 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 64 patients were not. Eosinophil count was lower in the COVID-19 group (median: 0/L versus 70/L, p<0.0001). To diagnose COVID-19, eosinopenia had a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 78.1% while lymphopenias were 73.7% and 62.5% respectively. Using area under curve (AUC) of receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curves, eosinophils optimal cut-off level was 10/L, sensitivity and specificity were 86%, and 79.7% respectively. Regarding the eosinophil/PMN ratio, the optimal cut-off level was 3.344, sensitivity and specificity were 87.7% and 73.4% respectively. The AUC of lymphocyte/PMN ratio was significantly lower than eosinophil/PMN ratios (0.621 versus 0.846, p=0.0003).

MATERIAL AND METHODS Blood serum samples (n = 1971) and lung autopsy material (n = 26) were obtained from different monkey species. These samples were tested for the presence of serological markers of measles, parainfluenza (PI) types 1, 2, 3, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial (RS) and adenovirus infections using enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). Detection of RS virus, metapneumovirus, PI virus types 1-4, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and adenoviruses B, C, E and bocavirus nucleic acids in this material was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The overall prevalence of antibodies (Abs) among all monkeys was low and amounted 11.3% (95% CI: 9.2-13.7%, n = 811) for measles virus, 8.9% (95% CI: 6.2-12.2%, n = 381) for PI type 3 virus, 2.5% (95% CI: 0.8-5.6%, n = 204) for PI type 1 virus, and 7.7% (95% CI: 3.8-13.7%, n = 130) for adenoviruses. When testing 26 autopsy lung samples from monkeys of different species that died from pneumonia, 2 samples from Anubis baboons (Papio nubis) were positive for of parainfluenza virus type 3 RNA. CONCLUSION Our data suggest the importance of the strict adherence to the terms of quarantine and mandatory testing of monkey sera for the presence of IgM antibodies to the measles virus that indicate the recent infection.

Fecal incontinence can either be a symptom of a disease, an epiphenomenon or a primary disease. Fecal incontinence negatively influences the ability of affected intensive patients to care for themselves. Fecal incontinence and diarrhea often occur together, which in return restricts the patients mobility. Improperly treated fecal incontinence can result in infections (e.g., skin disorders, existing catheter sores), secondary healing can be delayed (e.g., bedsores, sores on the back or groin/genital area) and can also result in contamination of other areas (e.g., intestinal infection). In the past, many improvised techniques and materials have been used to drain feces for patients who are either immobile or critically ill with temporary or persistent fecal incontinence. Continuous and safe fecal drainage is often a problem. There is no basic standard nursing concept that can be recommended or verified. At present there are a number of continuous fecal drainage systems that have been launched on the market. Different indications and fields of application have been recommended when dealing with continuous fecal drainage.

In humans, 23 members of the zDHHC family of integral membrane enzymes catalyze this modification. S-acylation is critical for the life cycle of many enveloped viruses. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has the most cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail among known human pathogens in the closely-related family of -coronaviruses; however, it is unclear which of the cytoplasmic cysteines are S-acylated or the impact of this modification on viral infectivity. Here we identify specific cysteine clusters in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that are targets of S-acylation. Interestingly, when we investigated the effect of the cysteine clusters using pseudotyped virus, mutation of the same three clusters of cysteines severely compromises viral infectivity. We developed a library of expression constructs of human zDHHC enzymes and used them to identify zDHHC enzymes that can S-acylate the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Finally, we reconstituted S-acylation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in vitro using purified zDHHC enzymes. We observe a striking heterogeneity in the S-acylation status of the different cysteines in our in cellulo experiments which, remarkably, was recapitulated by the in vitro assay.

RESULTS: A total of 206 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. Correlation between COVID-19 severity and medical information was examined by comparing AMMI and CSI. Age, hemodialysis, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were candidate predictors of the need for oxygen supply in patients with COVID-19. Coefficients associated with age, hemodialysis, and CRP were as follows: 1  age (in years, coded as 0 for values of <50, and as 1 for values of &#8805;50) + 1  hemodialysis (coded as 0 for \\"no\\", and as 1 for \\"yes\\") + 1  CRP (in mg/dL, coded as 0 for values of <1.0, and as 1 for values of &#8805;1.0).

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to better characterize the hypercoagulable state of COVID\\\\19 patients in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy. METHODS: We took plasma samples of 23 patients with COVID\\\\19 who were on prophylactic or intensified anticoagulant therapy. Twenty healthy volunteers were included to establish reference ranges. RESULTS: COVID\\\\19 patients had a mildly prolonged prothrombin time, high VWF levels and low ADAMTS13 activity. Most rotational thromboelastometry parameters were normal, with a hypercoagulable maximum clot firmness in part of the patients. Despite detectable anti\\\\Xa activity in the majority of patients, ex vivo thrombin generation was normal, and in vivo thrombin generation elevated as evidenced by elevated levels of thrombin\\\\antithrombin complexes and D\\\\dimers. Plasma levels of activated factor VII were lower in patients, and levels of the platelet activation marker soluble CD40 ligand were similar in patients and controls. Plasmin\\\\antiplasmin complex levels were also increased in patients despite an in vitro hypofibrinolytic profile.

In the absence of specific antiviral medicines to prevent or treat COVID-19, it is essential to detect the infected patients at an early stage and immediately isolate them from the healthy population. In view of the advantages of sensitivity and high spatial resolution, CT imaging has played an important role in screening and diagnosing of COVID-19 in China. The radiologic technologists performing CT scans for the infected patients become high-risk medical care personnel.

The experimental design was carried out to find the best conditions for the adsorption tests, in which concentration, mass and pH were significant. In the kinetic study, the pseudo-second-order model better described the adsorption process for acid and organo-functionalized samples. Such results indicate that the adsorption behavior probably occurs due to the phenomenon of chemisorption. Regarding the adsorption isotherms, the Langmuir model was the one that best adjusted both the experimental data of acid and the organo-functionalized samples, whose maximum adsorption capacity were 179.88 and 253.34 mg/g, respectively. This model also indicates that the sodium diclofenac is adsorbed to monolayers homogeneously through chemisorption.

Analysis of five FePV genomes revealed a distinct phylogenetic position and genomic features, with low sequence homologies to known picornaviruses especially in leader and 2A proteins. Among the viruses that belong to the closely related bat picornavirus groups 1 to 3 and the genus Sapelovirus, G+C content and sequence analysis of P1, P2, and P3 regions showed that FePV is most closely related to bat picornavirus group 3. However, FePV possessed other distinct features, including a putative type IV internal ribosome entry site/segment (IRES) instead of type I IRES in bat picornavirus group 3, protein cleavage sites, and H-D-C catalytic triad in 3C(pro) different from those in sapeloviruses and bat picornaviruses, and the shortest leader protein among known picornaviruses.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey among 3,793 healthcare workers in December 2020 in the Canton of Solothurn, Switzerland, before the start of the national COVID-19 vaccination campaign. RESULTS: Median age was 43 years (interquartile range [IQR] 31-53), 2,841 were female (74.9%). A total of 1,511 healthcare workers (39.8%) reported willingness to accept vaccination, whereas 1,114 (29.4%) were unsure and 1,168 (30.8%) would decline vaccination. Among medical doctors, 76.1% were willing, whereas only 27.8% of nurses expressed willingness. Among the 1,168 healthcare workers who would decline vaccination, 1,073 (91.9%) expressed concerns about vaccine safety and side effects. The willingness of healthcare workers to be vaccinated was associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.97, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.71-2.27) and having been vaccinated for influenza this year (aOR 2.70, 95% Cl 2.20-3.31).

By means of molecular dynamics simulations, this work addressed the behavior of 2019-nCoV in two aspects: the binding affinity of its receptor binding domain (RBD) with ACE2, and its potential conformation preferences in its unbound state. The results showed that the RBD of 2019-nCov bound much stronger with ACE2 than that of SARS-CoV due to a better organized hydrogen bond network between the former pair with most of the residues at the contact interface sharing the responsibility to hold the pair tightly. This is in contrast to the case of SARS-CoV, which strongly relied on the residues at the ends of the cleft. In its unbound state, the RBD of 2019-nCoV was found to fold part of its receptor binding motif (RBM) into a helical conformation and flip into a concave to minimize its contact with the external environment. This has the biological implication that the virus may achieve higher translational motion in the condensed phase and have a higher chance of survival by avoiding capture by the immune system before reaching its target receptor.","output":"Tracing the driving forces responsible for the remarkable infectivity of 2019-nCoV: 1.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, an AI system was developed to automatically segment and quantify the COVID-19-infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images. Five hundred thirty-one CT scans from 204 COVID-19 patients were collected from one appointed COVID-19 hospital. The automatically segmented lung abnormalities were compared with manual segmentation of two experienced radiologists using the Dice coefficient on a randomly selected subset (30 CT scans). Two imaging biomarkers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU), to assess disease severity and disease progression. The assessments were compared with patient status of diagnosis reports and key phrases extracted from radiology reports using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Cohens kappa, respectively. RESULTS: The dice coefficient between the segmentation of the AI system and two experienced radiologists for the COVID-19-infected lung abnormalities was 0.74  0.28 and 0.76  0.29, respectively, which were close to the inter-observer agreement (0.79  0.25). The computed two imaging biomarkers can distinguish between the severe and non-severe stages with an AUC of 0.97 (p value < 0.001).

The integrity of these barriers can be influenced by signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. Serotonin (5-HT) is an important vasoactive mediator of tissue edema and inflammation. However, the mechanisms that drive 5-HT-induced plasma extravasation are poorly defined. The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel is an established enhancer of signaling by GPCRs that promote inflammation and endothelial barrier disruption. Here, we investigated the role of TRPV4 in 5-HT-induced plasma extravasation using pharmacological and genetic approaches. Activation of either TRPV4 or 5-HT receptors promoted significant plasma extravasation in the airway and upper gastrointestinal tract of mice. 5-HT-mediated extravasation was significantly reduced by pharmacological inhibition of the 5-HT(2A) receptor subtype, or with antagonism or deletion of TRPV4, consistent with functional interaction between 5-HT receptors and TRPV4. Inhibition of receptors for the neuropeptides substance P (SP) or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) diminished 5-HT-induced plasma extravasation. Supporting studies assessing treatment of HUVEC with 5-HT, CGRP, or SP was associated with ERK phosphorylation. Exposure to the TRPV4 activator GSK1016790A, but not 5-HT, increased intracellular Ca(2+) in these cells. However, 5-HT pre-treatment enhanced GSK1016790A-mediated Ca(2+) signaling, consistent with sensitization of TRPV4. The functional interaction was further characterized in HEK293 cells expressing 5-HT(2A) to reveal that TRPV4 enhances the duration of 5-HT-evoked Ca(2+) signaling through a PLA(2) and PKC-dependent mechanism. In summary, this study demonstrates that TRPV4 contributes to 5-HT(2A)-induced plasma extravasation in the airways and upper GI tract, with evidence supporting a mechanism of action involving SP and CGRP release.","output":"Serotonin-induced vascular permeability is mediated by transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 in the airways and upper gastrointestinal tract of mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Viral interaction in which outbreaks of influenza and other common respiratory viruses might affect each other has been postulated by several short studies. Regarding longer time periods, influenza epidemics occasionally occur very early in the season, as during the 2009 pandemic. Whether early occurrence of influenza epidemics impacts outbreaks of other common seasonal viruses is not clear. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether early occurrence of influenza outbreaks coincides with shifts in the occurrence of other common viruses, including both respiratory and non\\\\respiratory viruses. METHODS: We investigated time trends of and the correlation between positive laboratory diagnoses of eight common viruses in the Netherlands over a 10\\\\year time period (2003C2012): influenza viruses types A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, coronavirus, norovirus, enterovirus, and rotavirus. We compared trends in viruses between early and late influenza seasons. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2012, influenza B, RSV, and coronavirus showed shifts in their occurrence when influenza A epidemics occurred earlier than usual (before week 1). Although shifts were not always consistently of the same type, when influenza type A hit early, RSV outbreaks tended to be delayed, coronavirus outbreaks tended to be intensified, and influenza virus type B tended not to occur at all. Occurrence of rhinovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, and enterovirus did not change. CONCLUSION: When influenza A epidemics occured early, timing of the epidemics of several respiratory winter viruses usually occurring close in time to influenza A was affected, while trends in rhinoviruses (occurring in autumn) and trends in enteral viruses were not.","output":"Early occurrence of influenza A epidemics coincided with changes in occurrence of other respiratory virus infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected all aspects of human life.

There is currently a scarcity of research on effective approaches for preventing and treating psychological distress in this population, particularly in humanitarian settings. The powerful impact of the home environment and family support is well known; however, approaches targeting the family are seldom developed or evaluated in such settings. We developed a brief family systemic psychosocial support intervention to be delivered through existing child protection systems with non-specialist facilitators. This paper outlines the study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of the intervention in Lebanon. METHODS: We will conduct a single-blind hybrid effectiveness-implementation multi-site RCT comparing the locally developed systemic family intervention to a waitlist control group for families residing in vulnerable regions in North Lebanon and Beqaa governorates (including families of Syrian, Palestinian, and Lebanese backgrounds). Outcomes on a range of family, adolescent, and caregiver measures will be assessed at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1), and at a 3-month follow-up for the treatment arm (T2). Families will be eligible for the trial if they are identified by implementing organisations as being medium-to-high risk for child protection concerns and have one or more adolescent aged 12C17 who demonstrates significant psychological distress on a self-report brief screening tool. Families will be randomly assigned to a treatment or a waitlist control condition. Families in the waitlist condition will receive a group version of the programme after completion of the study, to allow us to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary indications of intervention effects of this modality. The primary outcome is reduction in overall adolescent-reported psychological distress over time, with post-intervention (T1) as the primary endpoint. Secondary adolescent-reported outcomes include family functioning, psychosocial wellbeing, and emotional regulation difficulties. Secondary caregiver-reported outcomes include parenting style, family functioning, psychological distress, and emotional regulation difficulties. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide the first assessment of the effectiveness of the family systemic psychosocial support intervention for use in Lebanon, with important implications for the use of systemic, low-cost, non-specialist interventions for this age range.

The present study examined the cross_sectional association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and humoral immune response to Pfizer_BioNTech vaccine among healthcare workers. Methods: Participants were 946 healthcare workers, aged 21 to 75 years, who had completed the second dose of Pfizer_BioNTech vaccine 1 to 3 months before the survey. MetS was defined according to the Joint Interim Statement. SARS_CoV_2 spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody was measured using quantitative assays. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the geometric mean titers (GMT) and geometric mean ratio (GMR) of IgG titers, relative to MetS status. Results: A total of 51 participants (5.4%) had MetS. Healthcare workers with MetS had a significantly lower IgG titer (GMT 3882; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3124, 4824) than those without MetS (GMT 5033; 95% CI, 4395, 5764); the GMR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.64, 0.93).

We posited that the habitat relevance of a trait begets its underlying genomic complexity, so that traits within the repertoire would be differentially more complex in species successfully thriving in that habitat than in close species that cannot. To test this for the case of bloom-forming cyanobacteria, we curated 17 potentially relevant query metabolic pathways and five core pathways selected according to existing ecophysiological literature. The available 113 genomes were split into those of blooming (45) or nonblooming (68) strains, and an index of genomic complexity for each strain's version of each pathway was derived. We show that strain versions of all query pathways were significantly more complex in bloomers, with complexity in fact correlating positively with strain blooming incidence in 14 of those pathways. Five core pathways, relevant everywhere, showed no differential complexity or correlations. Gas vesicle, toxin and fatty acid synthesis, amino acid uptake, and C, N, and S acquisition systems were most strikingly relevant in the blooming repertoire. Further, we validated our findings using metagenomic gene expression analyses of blooming and nonblooming cyanobacteria in natural settings, where pathways in the repertoire were differentially overexpressed according to their relative complexity in bloomers, but not in nonbloomers. We expect that this approach may find applications to other habitats and organismal groups.IMPORTANCE We pragmatically delineate the trait repertoire that enables organismal niche specialization. We based our approach on the tenet, derived from evolutionary and complex-system considerations, that genomic units that can significantly contribute to fitness in a certain habitat will be comparatively more complex in organisms specialized to that habitat than their genomic homologs found in organisms from other habitats. We tested this in cyanobacteria forming harmful water blooms, for which decades-long efforts in ecological physiology and genomics exist. Our results essentially confirm that genomics and ecology can be linked through comparative complexity analyses, providing a tool that should be of general applicability for any group of organisms and any habitat, and enabling the posing of grounded hypotheses regarding the ecogenomic basis for diversification.","output":"The Trait Repertoire Enabling Cyanobacteria to Bloom Assessed through Comparative Genomic Complexity and Metatranscriptomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a major threat to global health(1) for which there are limited medical countermeasures(2,3).

Competition-binding, structural, and functional studies allowed clustering of the mAbs into classes recognizing distinct epitopes on the S(RBD) as well as distinct conformational states of the S trimer. Potent neutralizing mAbs recognizing non-overlapping sites, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, bound simultaneously to S and synergistically neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. In two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of either COV2-2196 or COV2-2130 alone or a combination of both mAbs protected mice from weight loss and reduced viral burden and inflammation in the lung.

A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with acute massive hemoptysis. After tracheal intubation, chest computed tomography revealed hematoma in the left lung and ruptured aortic dissection from the distal arch to the descending aorta.

Aortic dissection with adherent lung was excised, and graft replacement of the distal arch and descending thoracic aorta was performed. Proximal lung wedge resection using black cartridge stapler is a simple and quick method to control massive hemoptysis from aortic dissection; hence, this procedure is an effective option to control massive hemoptysis due to aortobronchial fistula.

The aim was to increase the autonomy of patients with severe mental illness and to bring mental health care in line with human rights. The aim of this study is to explore patient experiences of how far the new legislation has enabled them to be involved in decisions on their treatment after they were assessed as capable of giving consent and had their community treatment order (CTO) revoked due to the change in the legislation. METHOD: Individual in-depth interviews were conducted from September 2019 to March 2020 with twelve people with experience as CTO patients. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis inspired by hermeneutics. RESULTS: Almost all interviewees were receiving the same health care over two years after their CTO was terminated. Following the new legislation, they found it easier to be involved in treatment decisions when off a CTO than they had done in periods without a CTO before the amendment. Being assessed as having capacity to consent had enhanced their autonomy, their dialogues and their feeling of being respected in encounters with health care personnel. However, several participants felt insecure in such encounters and some still felt passive and lacking in initiative due to their previous experiences of coercion. They were worried about becoming acutely ill and again being subjected to involuntary treatment. CONCLUSION: The introduction of capacity-based mental health legislation seems to have fulfilled the intention that treatment and care should, as far as possible, be provided in accordance with patients wishes. Systematic assessment of capacity to consent seems to increase the focus on patients condition, level of functioning and opinions in care and treatment. Stricter requirements for health care providers to find solutions in cooperation with patients seem to lead to new forms of collaboration between patients and health care personnel, where patients have become more active participants in their own treatment and receive help to make more informed choices.","output":"Increased autonomy with capacity-based mental health legislation in Norway: a qualitative study of patient experiences of having come off a community treatment order"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is now well recognized that unacceptable inequalities in maternity care that exist due to a woman's ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation, age, residential social status within a country can have adverse effects on the outcomes of their pregnancies.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether the emotions evoked by music are enhanced by the acoustics of the space where the music was composed to be played on. We explored whether the emotional responses of western na?ve listeners to two vocal pieces from the Renaissance, one liturgical and one secular, convolved with the impulse responses of four Christian temples from the United Kingdom, were modulated by the appropriate piece/space matching. In an alternative forced choice task where participants had to indicate their preference for the original recording of the piece (not convolved with any temple-like acoustics) vs. the convolved one, no significant differences were found. However, in the tasks where participants rated their emotional in response to each piece and acoustic condition, the factorial ANCOVA analyses performed on the results revealed significant effects. We observed that, across pieces and spaces, participants found the temple-like acoustics as more transcendent, compared to the acoustics of the original version of the pieces. In addition, they rated the secular piece as more tender and the liturgical piece as more expressive in its original versions, compared to the convolved ones. We conclude that the acoustic signature of the four Christian temples causes an exaltation of certain emotions on listeners, although this effect is not associated to one or another musical piece.","output":"Experimental Enhancement of Feelings of Transcendence, Tenderness, and Expressiveness by Music in Christian Liturgical Spaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advancements in imaging and laparoscopy have led to the expansion of minimally invasive techniques in the ablation of small renal masses (SRMs).

From November 2008 to October 2010, 10 patients with SRMs underwent laparoscopy-guided Tru-Cut biopsy, MW tumour ablation, and enucleation. Mean age was 66 yr (range: 46-84 yr). Mean renal tumour diameter was 2.75 cm (range: 1.3-4.2 cm). MW antennas were applied one to three times depending on tumour volume, location, and shape. After MW thermoablation, laparoscopic enucleation was performed to evaluate the histopathologic and haemostatic effects of MW. The mean MW antenna application time was 14.1 min (range: 4-30 min). Enucleation did not require renal pedicle clamping in any of the cases because no significant bleeding took place. Preablation pathology revealed clear cell renal carcinoma of Fuhrman grade I-II in all cases. Postablation pathology showed extensive coagulative necrosis without skipped tumour areas.

Rapid and early detection of the virus is the master key to cease the rapid spread and break the human transmission chain. There are very few studies in search of an alternate and convenient diagnostic tool which can substitute nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyse the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We used real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We use Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two sampling methods. Findings This study shows a lower CT mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) sampling method. Bland-Altman analysis produces relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these specimen tools. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and Spike gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples.

METHODS: COVID-19 daily death counts for 1,976 US nonmetropolitan counties for the period March 2-July 26, 2020, were extracted from USAFacts and merged with county-level American Community Survey and Area Health Resource File data. Covariates included county percent poverty, age composition, adjacency to a metropolitan county, health care supply, and state fixed effects. Mixed-effects negative binomial regression with random intercepts to account for repeated observations within counties were used to predict differences in the average daily increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate across quartiles of percent Black and percent Hispanic. FINDINGS: Since early March, the average daily increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate has been significantly higher in rural counties with the highest percent Black and percent Hispanic populations. Compared to counties in the bottom quartile, counties in the top quartile of percent Black have an average daily increase that is 70% higher (IRR = 1.70, CI: 1.48-1.95, P < .001), and counties in the top quartile of percent Hispanic have an average daily increase that is 50% higher (IRR = 1.50, CI: 1.33-1.69, P < .001), net of covariates.

The study aimed to assess the level of occupational and leisure time PA of soldiers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore whether there was a relationship between PA and perceived work ability. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 305 men and 68 women who were territorial army soldiers aged 18-55 (MSD 32.99.01). The Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall (SDPAR) and the Work Ability Index (WAI) were used. RESULTS: The level of self-reported PA for the studied soldiers was relatively high; 80% of them met the recommendations of the WHO and were characterized by having a good (60%) or excellent (20%) WAI status. The level of occupational PA of male soldiers was higher than the level of leisure time PA, and they indicated higher levels of occupational PA and leisure time PA during the workweek than the weekend. CONCLUSIONS: Current work ability in comparison to the best in life and work ability related to the physical requirements of the work were positively correlated with leisure time PA. Work ability related to physical requirements was also positively correlated with occupational and total PA, and work ability related to mental requirements was positively correlated with total PA.

During spermiogenesis, histones in post-meiotic spermatids are removed from chromatin and replaced by protamines. Although histone-to-protamine exchange is important for sperm nuclear condensation, the underlying regulatory mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we identify PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H3K14 in post-meiotic spermatids. Generation of Phf7-deficient mice and Phf7 C160A knockin mice with impaired E3 ubiquitin ligase activity reveals defects in histone-to-protamine exchange caused by dysregulation of histone removal factor Bromodomain, testis-specific (BRDT) in early condensing spermatids. Surprisingly, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PHF7 on histone ubiquitination leads to stabilization of BRDT by attenuating ubiquitination of BRDT. Collectively, our findings identify PHF7 as a critical factor for sperm chromatin condensation and contribute to mechanistic understanding of fundamental phenomenon of histone-to-protamine exchange and potential for drug development for the male reproduction system.","output":"PHF7 Modulates BRDT Stability and Histone-to-Protamine Exchange during Spermiogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reports on the progress in the project COVIGILANT, which is aimed at developing an evaluation taxonomy for Contact Tracing Applications (CTAs) for COVID-19.

Postoperative apathy cannot always be related to a dose reduction of dopaminergic medication and stimulation itself may play a role. OBJECTIVE We studied whether apathy in DBS-treated PD patients could be a stimulation effect. METHODS In 26 PD patients we acquired apathy scores before and >6 months after DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Magnetoencephalography recordings (ON and OFF stimulation) were performed >6 months after DBS placement. Change in apathy severity was correlated with (i) improvement in motor function and dose reduction of dopaminergic medication, (ii) stimulation location (merged MRI and CT-scans) and (iii) stimulation-related changes in functional connectivity of brain regions that have an alleged role in apathy. RESULTS Average apathy severity significantly increased after DBS (p<0.001) and the number of patients considered apathetic increased from two to nine. Change in apathy severity did not correlate with improvement in motor function or dose reduction of dopaminergic medication. For the left hemisphere, increase in apathy was associated with a more dorsolateral stimulation location (p=0.010). The increase in apathy severity correlated with a decrease in alpha1 functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p=0.006), but not with changes of the medial orbitofrontal or the anterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS The present observations suggest that apathy after STN-DBS is not necessarily related to dose reductions of dopaminergic medication, but may be an effect of the stimulation itself.

Studies have begun examining people's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about COVID-19, but little is known about how these cognitive outcomes differ across racial/ethnic groups. Methods: An online survey was conducted with a convenience sample of adults ages 18 and older in the United States (n = 2,006) in May 2020, about 2 months after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Multivariable regression models were used to examine differences in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about COVID-19 across racial/ethnic groups (non-Latinx white, non-Latinx black, non-Latinx of another race, or Latinx). Results: Knowledge tended to be lower among non-Latinx blacks and Latinx participants compared to non-Latinx whites. For example, fewer non-Latinx blacks responded correctly that COVID-19 is not caused by the same virus that causes influenza (adjusted OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.90), and Latinx participants were less likely to respond correctly that people with COVID-19 do not always show symptoms of being sick (adjusted OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45-0.87).

Under the assumption that the joint distribution of the gene expressions of interest is a multivariate normal distribution, such networks can be constructed by assessing the nonzero elements of the inverse covariance matrix, the so-called precision matrix or concentration matrix. This may not reflect the true connectivity between genes by considering just pairwise linear correlations. To relax this limitative constraint, we employ Gaussian process (GP) model which is well known as computationally efficient non-parametric Bayesian machine learning technique.

In fact, GP creates the ability to use the capacity and potential of different kernels in constructing precision matrix and GRNs. In this paper, in the first step, we choose the GP with appropriate kernel to learn the considered GRNs from the observed genetic data, and then we estimate kernel hyperparameters using rule-of-thumb technique. Using these hyperparameters, we can also control the degree of sparseness in the precision matrix. Then we obtain kernel-based precision matrix similar to GLASSO to construct kernel-based GRN.

We identified all published literature relating to governance in health workforce since 2000 and analysed them on two fronts: the broad definition of governance, and the operationalisation of broad definition into key dimensions of governance. RESULTS: Existing literature adopts governance concepts established in health literature and does not adapt understanding to the health workforce context. Definitions are largely quoted from health literature whilst dimensions are focused around the sub-functions of governance which emphasise operationalising governance practices over further conceptualisation. Two sub-functions are identified as essential to the governance process: stakeholder participation and strategic direction.

We studied the clinical, systemic, mucosal, and cellular responses to two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in 62 individuals with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure that were divided into three groups based on serostatus and/or degree of symptoms: Antibody negative, Asymptomatic, and Symptomatic. In the previously SARS-CoV-2-infected (SARS2-infected) Asymptomatic and Symptomatic groups, symptoms related to a recall response were elicited after the first vaccination. Anti-S trimer IgA and IgG levels peaked after 1st vaccination in the SARS2-infected groups, and were higher that the in the SARS2-naive group in the plasma and nasal samples at all time points. Neutralizing antibodies titers were also higher against the WA-1 and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the SARS2-infected compared to SARS2-na?ve vaccinees. After the first vaccination, differences in cellular immunity were not evident between groups, but the AIM+ CD4+ cell response correlated with durability of humoral immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In those SARS2-infected, the number of vaccinations needed for protection, the durability, and need for boosters are unknown. However, the lingering differences between the SARS2-infected and SARS2-na?ve up to 10 months post-vaccination could explain the decreased reinfection rates in the SARS2-infected vaccinees recently reported and suggests that additional strategies (such as boosting of the SARS2-na?ve vaccinees) are needed to narrow the differences observed between these groups.","output":"Mucosal and systemic responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in infection na?ve and experienced individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The follow-up of recovered COVID-19 patients is still limited.

These drugs may be protective across a range of respiratory infections including bacterial and viral pneumonias. We examined long-term use of ACEi/ARBs on the risk of first pneumonia hospitalization and pneumonia-related death in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: Prospective analysis of 16,285 Chinese T2D patients with new RASi use observed between 2001 and 2019. Overlap weighting was performed to balance baseline characteristics. We used time-dependent Cox model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of outcomes while adjusting for the time-varying covariates. Results: There were 6,379 (39.2%) ACEi-users only, 4,065 (25.0%) ARBs-users and 5,841 (35.9%) non RASi-users. During a median observation of 7.6 years, 6.1% had first pneumonia hospitalization, 1.3% died during or within one month of pneumonia hospitalization and 17.6% died from other causes. No association was observed between RASi use and first pneumonia hospitalization. However, RASi-users had lower risk for pneumonia-related death (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35-0.76) than non-users [ACEi-users only: HR 0.53 (0.34-0.81);ARBs-users: HR 0.58 (0.32-1.04)]. We also noted reduced risk for all-cause death in RASi-users (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.54-0.67) [ACEi-users only: HR 0.61 (0.54-0.69);ARBs-users: HR 0.67 (0.57-0.79)]. Conclusions: Long-term use of RASi was associated with reduced risk of pneumonia-related death and all-cause death, but not first pneumonia hospitalization, in Chinese patients with T2D.

Methods: Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a naso-oropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Results: 14/34 HCWs (41%; 40  14 years, 71% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 11/34 (32%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnea before testing, which were absent in 3/14 cases (21%). Mild disease prevailed (79%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28  18 days), viral shedding (31  10 days post-symptom onset, range 15C51), and work absence (29  28 days) were prolonged. 13/14 (93%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative HCWs had a positive humoral response Higher IgG indexes were observed in individuals over 50 years of age (14.5  7.7 vs. 5.0  4.4, p = 0.012).

Conclusions: A COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and rheumatic patients, swiftly spreading over the presymptomatic stage. Mild disease without typical symptoms should be recognized and may evolve with delayed viral shedding, prolonged recovery, and adequate immune response in most individuals.","output":"A COVID-19 Outbreak in a Rheumatology Department Upon the Early Days of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Ground-glass opacities are the most frequent radiologic features of COVID-19 patients. We aimed to determine the feasibility of automated lung volume measurements, including ground-glass volumes, on the CT of suspected COVID-19 patients. Our goal was to create an automated and quantitative measure of ground-glass opacities from lung CT images that could be used clinically for diagnosis, triage and research. DESIGN: Single centre, retrospective, observational study. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic data, respiratory support treatment (synthetised in the maximal respiratory severity score) and CT-images were collected. Volume of abnormal lung parenchyma was measured with conventional semi-automatic software and with a novel automated algorithm based on voxels X-Ray attenuation. We looked for the relationship between the automated and semi-automated evaluations. The association between the ground-glass opacities volume and the maximal respiratory severity score was assessed. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in the main outcome analysis. The mean duration of automated and semi-automated volume measurement process were 15 (2) and 93 (41) min, respectively (p = 8.05*10(?8)). The intraclass correlation coefficient between the semi-automated and automated measurement of ground-glass opacities and restricted normally aerated lung were both superior to 0.99. The association between the automated measured lung volume and the maximal clinical severity score was statistically significant for the restricted normally aerated (p = 0.0097, effect-size: ?385 mL) volumes and for the ratio of ground-glass opacities/restricted normally aerated volumes (p = 0.027, effect-size: 3.3).

We high-light the fact that the vaccination hesitation is not just about vaccination, the approach of identifying explanatory hypotheses involves identifying all relevant frames of reference, all social areas that participate in establishing the appropriate interpretation context. The level of compliance with the rules could be an important explanatory hypothesis for the differences between different states in the share of vaccinated citizens. Other explanatory hypotheses: the structure of epistemic communities, community and individual cognitive resources on strategies facing the uncertainty and risk, distrust. We also assess the limits of using the deficit model. We keep in mind two cognitive asymmetries: inaction is perceived as less risky or responsible than action;the indecision is in a similar situation to the decision. Because the values that people adhere reflect their personal beliefs and convictions, and they guide the way they seek, receive, and interpret information, strategies to reduce vaccine hesitation should be based on verifying the compatibility of the intended outcome with individual values and to continue testing the various solutions to change the beliefs that contribute to the determination of vaccine hesitation or refusal.","output":"Why Don't We Get Vaccinated?

Data sources Eligible studies published up to May 28, 2020 were retrieved from Pubmed, EMbase, MedRXiv, BioRXiv collection databases. Study eligibility criteria This systematic review included cohort studies, case series and case reports of pregnant women who had COVID-19 infection as confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA testing, and had reported data regarding testing of neonates/fetuses for SARS-CoV-2 immediately after birth and up to within 48hrs of birth. In total, 30 eligible case reports describing 43 tested neonates, and 38 cohort/case series studies describing 936 tested neonates were included. Study appraisal and synthesis methods The methodological quality of all included studies was evaluated by a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Quantitative synthesis was performed on cohort/case series studies according to neonatal biological specimen site to reach pooled proportions of vertical transmission. Results Our quantitative synthesis revealed that of 936 neonates from COVID-19 infected mothers, 27 neonates had SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA positive nasopharyngeal swab, indicating a pooled proportion of 3.2% (95% CI 2.2-4.3%) for vertical transmission. Notably, the pooled proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in neonates by nasopharyngeal swab in studies from China was 2.0% (8/397) which was similar to pooled proportion of 2.7% (14/517) in studies from outside of China. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA testing in neonatal cord blood was positive in 2.9% (1/34) of samples, 7.7% (2/26) of placenta samples, 0% (0/51) of amniotic fluid and 0% (0/17) of urine samples and 9.7% (3/31) of fecal/rectal swabs. Neonatal serology was positive in 3/82 (3.7%) (based upon the presence of IgM). Conclusion Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible and appears to occur in a minority of cases of maternal COVID-19 infection in third trimester. Rates of infection are similar to other pathogens that cause congenital infections. However, given the paucity of early trimester data, no assessment can yet be made regarding rates of vertical transmission in early pregnancy as well as potential risk for consequent fetal morbidity and mortality.","output":"Vertical Transmission of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SOURCE CITATION: Beigel JH, Tomashek KM, Dodd LE, et al.

In this new situation, nurses were challenged to develop new approaches to involve family members in patient care. A better understanding of these changes and the experiences of nurses is essential to make an adaptation of procedures, and to secure a family-centred approach in care as much as possible. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate how family involvement had taken place, and to explore the experiences of nurses with family involvement during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, we aimed to formulate recommendations for the involvement of family. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using patient record review and focus-group interviews between April and July 2020. We reviewed records of patients with confirmed COVID-19, who were admitted to the COVID-19 wards at two affiliated university hospitals in the Netherlands. All records were searched for notations referring to family involvement. In two focus-groups, nurses who worked at the COVID-19 wards were invited to share their experiences. The Rigorous and Accelerated Data Reduction (RADaR) method was used to collect, reduce and analyse the data. RESULTS: In total, 189 patient records were reviewed and nine nurses participated in the focus-group meetings. Patient records revealed infrequent and often unstructured communication with focus on physical condition. Nurses confirmed that communication with family was far less than before and that the physical condition of the patient was predominant. The involvement of family in care was limited to practicalities, although more involvement was described in end-of-life situations. Nurses experienced moral distress due to the visiting restrictions, though some acknowledged that they had experienced the direct patient care so intense and burdensome, that family contact simply felt too much. CONCLUSION: The communication with and involvement of family in hospital care changed enormously during the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on the identified themes, we formulated recommendations that may be helpful for family-centered care in hospitals during periods of restricted visiting policy.","output":"Strict isolation requires a different approach to the family of hospitalised patients with COVID-19: A rapid qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the world in an unprecedented manner and South Asian countries were among the first to experience imported cases.

Methods: We evaluated available national and subnational epidemiological and burden information on COVID-19 cases and deaths in Pakistan, including projection models available to the Government at an early stage of the pandemic. Results: Pakistan, with a population of 215 million and considerable geographic diversity, experienced case introduction from pilgrims returning from the Islamic Republic of Iran, followed by widespread community transmission.

Modulating the inflammatory microenvironment may have satisfactory curative effects in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Methods Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were harvested from bone marrow. The effects of milk fat globulin protein E8 (MFG-E8) on macrophage polarisation were compared with those of M1 and M2 macrophages induced by conventional methods. The BMDMs and apoptotic PMNs co-culture system was used to assess the efficiency of efferocytosis. The biological functions of MFG-E8 in tendon-bone healing by regulating macrophage efferocytosis and polarisation were further investigated using a rat ACLR model. Results BMDMs and PMNs were successfully isolated. Compared to conventional induction methods, MFG-E8 alone did not significantly induce macrophage M1 or M2 polarisation, but it could partially reverse the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in M1 macrophages. In vitro studies revealed that appropriate dosing of MFG-E8 could significantly promote the efficiency of macrophage efferocytosis and subsequently increase M2 polarisation. More importantly, significantly increased peri-tunnel new bone formation, tighter connected interface and better mechanical properties were observed after ACLR when treated with MFG-E8 in vivo. We further demonstrated that MFG-E8 remarkably facilitated the clearance of apoptotic cells and increased the number of M2 macrophages at the interface between the tendon graft and bone tunnel in the early postoperative stage. Conclusion MFG-E8 promoted tendon-bone healing histologically and biomechanically, probably by the regulation of inflammatory processes via macrophage efferocytosis and M2 polarisation.The translational potential of this article: Regulation of macrophage efferocytosis and M2 polarization by MFG-E8 is expected to be a therapeutic strategy for promoting tendon-bone healing in patients undergoing ACLR.","output":"MFG-E8 promotes tendon-bone healing by regualting macrophage efferocytosis and M2 polarization after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many countries increasingly try to manipulate their national image abroad.

With the increasing burden on obstetric departments and the growing importance of satisfaction and right to self-determination in pregnant women, outpatient management in PPROM is a possible alternative to inpatient monitoring. The most important criterion for this approach is to ensure the safety of both the mother and the child. Due to the small number of cases (n = 116), two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing inpatient and outpatient management were unable to draw any conclusions. By 2020, eight retrospective comparative studies (cohort/observational studies) yielded the following outcomes: no significant differences in the rate of maternal complications (e.g., chorioamnionitis, premature placental abruption, umbilical cord prolapse) and in neonatal morbidity, significantly prolonged latency period with higher gestational age at birth, higher birth weight of neonates, and significantly shorter length of stay of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care, shorter hospital stay of pregnant women, and lower treatment costs with outpatient management. Concerns regarding this approach are mainly related to unpredictable complications with the need for rapid obstetric interventions, which cannot be performed in time in an outpatient setting. Prerequisites for outpatient management are the compliance of the expectant mother, the adherence to strict selection criteria and the assurance of adequate monitoring at home. Future research should aim at more accurate risk assessment of obstetric complications through studies with higher case numbers and standardisation of outpatient management under evidence-based criteria.","output":"Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes C Inpatient Versus Outpatient Management: an Evidence-Based Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La coagulopatia y la trombosis asociadas a la enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) representan un problema importante en el manejo de esta enfermedad Los estudios clinicos de los ultimos meses han demostrado que los pacientes con COVID-19 presentan un estado de hipercoagulabilidad particular, en el que se observa un aumento notable del dimero D concomitante con niveles elevados de fibrinogeno El estado de hipercoagulabilidad conduce a un mayor riesgo de trombosis, que parece ser mayor entre aquellos pacientes con sintomas criticos de COVID-19 El mejor enfoque terapeutico para prevenir los eventos tromboticos en esta nueva enfermedad aun no se ha determinado y han surgido varias preguntas con respecto a la tromboprofilaxia, como el momento adecuado para iniciar la anticoagulacion, el tipo de anticoagulante y el regimen de dosis Para abordar estas preocupaciones, varias sociedades medicas han publicado articulos de posicion para brindar la opinion de expertos en trombosis sobre el manejo de la coagulopatia y trombosis asociadas a COVID-19 Grupo Cooperativo Latinoamericano de Hemostasia y Trombosis (Grupo CLAHT) ha convocado a un panel de expertos en trombosis y hemostasia para discutir los datos disponibles sobre este tema El objetivo de esta revision es resumir la evidencia actual con respecto al deterioro hemostatico y el riesgo trombotico en el COVID-19 y proporcionar una opinion cuidadosamente revisada de los expertos latinoamericanos sobre la tromboprofilaxis y el manejo de eventos tromboticos y coagulopatia en pacientes con sospecha de COVID-19","output":"[Guia de profilaxia y tratamiento antitrombotico para pacientes con COVID-19.

Though many LTCFs experienced high case and death rates due to COVID-19, other facilities performed better, and experienced lower rates. A comprehensive understanding of performance factors affecting the transmission of COVID-19 within LTCFs is still lacking, as no published review has provided a complete perspective of LTCF management utilizing a multifactorial conceptual framework to evaluate performance during the pandemic. Recent research has consisted of strategies for infection prevention and control or studies reporting specific outcomes such as COVID-19 case and death rates within LTCFs. To address these gaps, this scoping review will identify and investigate performance factors that have affected the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in LTCFs using a multifactorial conceptual framework of performance. Methods: : The CINAHL, MEDLINE (Ovid), CAIRN, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases will be searched. Included articles will have been published in a peer-reviewed journal, in English or French, between January 1 st , 2020, and December 31 st , 2021. They will discuss the reviews population (LTCFs), concept (dimensions of performance according to a modified version of the Ministre de la sant et des services sociaux du Qubec conceptual framework), and context (COVID-19), as well as facilitators and barriers affecting performance of LTCFs.

METHODS: Descriptive study of a series of cases of patients scheduled for endoscopy during the month of May 2020, when endoscopic activity was resumed after the peak of the pandemic, following SCD, SEED, AEG and ESGE recommendations. We examined nasopharyngeal samples 48-72 hours before the appointment, by RT-PCR, in all patients. RNA extraction was performed using the kits: Qiagen?-adapted, BiosSprint?96-DNA-Blood-Kit (384). For amplification-detection of SARS-CoV-2, methods recommended by the WHO and the CDC were followed. RESULTS: 110 asymptomatic patients without close contact with a positive case in the previous 14 days were scheduled; 105 (96.4%) were negative and five (4.5%) were positive. Two patients developed respiratory symptoms after diagnosis (presymptomatic) and three remained asymptomatic. Allfive5 patients were autochthonous cases with no history of travel or residence in another city or country associated with high prevalence of infection. Four cases were women aged 60-81 years.

Light microscopy revealed a mild eosinophilic myocarditis in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart, whereas enlarged cardiomyocytes with irregular nucleus and some with cytoplasmic vacuoles in the hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy heart. Aortic and pulmonary wall were histologically normal. Immunostaining revealed diffuse presence of ACE2 in the myocardium of the heart with eosinophilic myocarditis, but only discrete presence in the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart. The RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test showed no presence of the virus in tested tissues. Despite eosinophilic myocarditis in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart, no viral traces were found in the myocardium and valve tissues. However, ACE2 was present diffusely in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart. SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the cardiac tissues of these COVID-19 asymptomatic heart donors.

The study objective was to estimate infection risks per transport for first responders and quantify how first responder use of N95 respirators and patient use of cloth masks can reduce these risks. A model was developed for two Scenarios: an ambulance transport with a patient actively emitting a virus in small aerosols that could lead to airborne transmission (Scenario 1) and a subsequent transport with the same respirator or mask use conditions, an uninfected patient; and remaining airborne SARS-CoV-2 and contaminated surfaces due to aerosol deposition from the previous transport (Scenario 2). A compartmental Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the dispersion and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent infection risks for first responders, accounting for variability and uncertainty in input parameters (i.e., transport duration, transfer efficiencies, SARS-CoV-2 emission rates from infected patients, etc.). Infection risk distributions and changes in concentration on hands and surfaces over time were estimated across sub-Scenarios of first responder respirator use and patient cloth mask use. For Scenario 1, predicted mean infection risks were reduced by 69%, 48%, and 85% from a baseline risk (no respirators or face masks used) of 2.9  10-2  3.4  10-2 when simulated first responders wore respirators, the patient wore a cloth mask, and when first responders and the patient wore respirators or a cloth mask, respectively. For Scenario 2, infection risk reductions for these same Scenarios were 69%, 50%, and 85%, respectively (baseline risk of 7.2  10-3  1.0  10-2). While aerosol transmission routes contributed more to viral dose in Scenario 1, our simulations demonstrate the ability of face masks worn by patients to additionally reduce surface transmission by reducing viral deposition on surfaces. Based on these simulations, we recommend the patient wear a face mask and first responders wear respirators, when possible, and disinfection should prioritize high use equipment.","output":"Respirators, face masks, and their risk reductions via multiple transmission routes for first responders within an ambulance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Capillaries are the smallest vessels in the body responsible for delivering oxygen and nutrients to surrounding cells. Various life-threatening diseases are known to alter the density of healthy capillaries and the flow velocity of erythrocytes within the capillaries. In previous studies, capillary density and flow velocity were manually assessed by trained specialists. However, manual analysis of a standard 20-second microvascular video requires 20 minutes on average and necessitates extensive training. Thus, manual analysis has been reported to hinder the application of microvascular microscopy in a clinical environment.

While the world was slowly moving towards achieving health for all, the pandemic destroyed progress made over the past 25 years and exposed the vulnerability of health care systems and health insurance schemes as well as their lack of resilience. Heath care systems failed to respond in a timely and efficient manner, lives have been, and continue to be, lost and vulnerable populations, especially refugees and migrants, are more at risk than ever as many are left out of country vaccination programmes. Aims The Eastern Mediterranean region hosts 13 million internally displaced persons and 12 million refugees as of 2018. Thus, adopting inclusive health financing mechanisms is crucial to addressing the crisis and protecting indigenous and displaced populations. Methods By looking at regional best practices and the response of the United Nations, we outline possible financing tools for including refugees and migrants in health insurance schemes for COVID 19 and introduce novel solutions for addressing gaps in funding. Results Among the suggested solutions are the inclusion of refugees and migrants in national health care systems, setting up community-based health insurance for migrant and refugee populations, as well as introducing a catastrophe bond financing scheme. Conclusions While COVID-19 is far from over, many countries in the EMR have included migrants in their COVID-19 vaccine rollout plans. While this is not the first instance of inclusion in some countries, many others are unable or do not prioritize migrants in their health systems, to the detriment of the entire country.

Results: An increase of 52% in the number of APC donations, but a decrease of 22% in the number of blood donations (NBDs) were detected in the third period compared to the first one. Mean APCH values were 7081550 and 512155 units in the first and third periods,respectively. The mean ESH values in the first, and third periods were 873326, and 36943143 units. Conclusion: It is obvious that we have learnt many lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, like how to face challenges in maintaining the balance between blood demand and blood supply. Utilizing media to encourage donors and implementation of Patient Blood Management on national and institutional levels may be some of the key components of a comprehensive strategy. The collaboration of Ministry of Health, TRC and hospitals was successful in securing a balance between blood supply and demand in Turkey, on which COVID-19 pandemic impacted significantly.

In an effort to preserve resources, mitigate risk, and maintain health system capacity, nonurgent surgeries have been deferred in many jurisdictions, with urgent procedures facing increasing wait times and unpredictability given potential future surges. Shared decision making, a process that integrates patient values and preferences with the scientific expertise of clinicians, may be of particular benefit during these unprecedented times. Aligning patient choices with their values, reducing unnecessary health care use, and promoting consistency between providers are now more critical than ever before.

To this end, we determined the concentration of lead in the kidney, liver, and stomach contents of 133 Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) captured in the Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin (Buenos Aires, Argentina). This basin is one of the most severe cases of water pollution in Latin America and metals like lead represent the most common chemical pollutants. Rats were trapped in nine sites with different soil and water lead concentrations, between 2014 and 2015. A positive relationship was found between lead concentration in the liver and kidney of R. norvegicus and the environmental concentration of this metal in water and soil. Although the remaining variables analyzed were also related to the lead concentration in soft tissues, they did not affect the association between the lead concentration in soft tissues and that in the environment. The lead concentration in the stomach contents was not related to any of the variables analyzed. Our results constitute the first study in an urban basin with a gradient of environmental lead concentration and suggest that the quantification of lead in the kidney and liver of rats can be used as an indicator of exposure to this metal within a large city.","output":"Are soft tissues of urban rats good indicators of exposure to heavy metal pollution?

If a patient is hemodynamically unstable and unable to undergo endoscopic therapy, a balloon tamponade device may be placed to temporize the hemorrhage until definitive management may be performed. Placement of these devices may be performed by practitioners of several different medical specialties. Placement of balloon tamponade devices requires multiple steps and several different pieces of equipment. Performing the procedure incorrectly can lead to iatrogenic injuries such as esophageal necrosis or perforation. Since this is a relatively rare procedure often placed under high-stress situations, practicing in a low-stakes setting, such as a simulation lab, allows practitioners to hone their skills. Commercially available task trainers for balloon tamponade device placement are not available. In this paper, we describe how to modify an inexpensive airway task trainer for this purpose using commonly available and cost-effective materials.","output":"Development of a Balloon Tamponade Task Trainer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, so called Last Aid courses, concerning end-of-life care for people dying, have successfully been established in community settings in several European countries, Australia, and South-America. To date, they have not been evaluated in hospital settings, where educational needs (concerning care of the dying) are especially high, and may differ from the general population. To evaluate if Last Aid courses are feasible in hospital settings, and if informational needs of hospital staff are met by the curriculum, we introduced Last Aid courses at a university hospital. Five courses were offered; participants of courses 1 and 2 completed surveys with open-ended questions; the answers were used to develop the evaluation questionnaire employed in courses 3C5. In these three courses, 55 of the 56 participants completed an evaluation survey to explore their learning goals and obtain feedback. Courses were fully booked; participants were heterogeneous with regard to their professional background. The most prevalent learning goals were preparation for emotional aspects in care of dying (65.5% ratings very important), preparation for medical/care aspects in care of dying (60.0%), and knowledge of supportive services and facilities (54.5%). Overall, the evaluation showed that Last Aid courses were more suitable to educate non-medical hospital staff about care of the dying. Medical staff, in contrast to non-medical staff, more often requested courses with an extended curriculum in order to meet their learning goals. Last Aid courses were well accepted and helped to reduce information deficits on care of the dying in a heterogeneous population of hospital staff.","output":"Lessons Learned from Introducing Last Aid Courses at a University Hospital in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compare different methods of estimating the basic reproduction number, R0, focusing on the early stages of an epidemic, and considering weekly reports of new infecteds.

Although the majority of studied polyphenols were able to inhibit bacterial growth and biofilm formation, the most promising activities were observed for rutin. Further investigation proved rutins ability to prevent/eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA urinary catheter biofilms. Besides reduction of biofilm biomass, rutin antibiofilm mechanisms included reduction of cell viability, exopolysaccharide, and extracellular DNA levels. Moderate reduction of bacterial adhesion to human keratinocytes upon treatment was observed. Rutin antivirulence mechanisms included an impact on P. aeruginosa protease, pyocyanin, rhamnolipid, and elastase production and the downregulation of the lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR, pqsA and mvfR genes. Rutin also interfered with membrane permeability. Polyphenols could repress antibiotic resistant bacteria.

ATOH1 is a key gene in the development and regeneration of hair cells. Small activating RNAs (saRNAs) can target a gene to specifically upregulate its expression. This study aimed to explore whether small activating RNAs could induce the differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells into hair cell-like cells with a combination of growth factors in vitro and thus provide a new strategy for hair cell regeneration and the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. Fifteen small activating RNAs targeting the human ATOH1 gene were designed and screened in 293 T and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and 3 of these candidates were found to be capable of effectively and stably activating ATOH1 gene expression. The selected small activating RNAs were then transfected into hair cell progenitor cells, and hair cell markers were examined 10 days after transfection. After transfection of the selected small activating RNAs, the expression of the characteristic markers of inner ear hair cells, POU class 4 homeobox 3 (POU4F3) and myosin VIIA (MYO7A), was detected. Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to differentiate into human hair cell progenitor cells. In vitro, small activating RNAs were able to induce the differentiation of hair cell progenitor cells into hair cell-like cells. Therefore, RNA activation technology has the potential to provide a new strategy for the regeneration of hair cells.","output":"Small activating RNA activation of ATOH1 promotes regeneration of human inner ear hair cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study is anchored on the use of an eco-friendly effective plasma technique and cationization treatment to improve the hydrophobic nature of polyester (PET) fabric by incorporating hydrophilic functional groups onto the PET surface.

Madder roots were used, to produce natural dyes for the green coloration of PET fabrics in both dyeing and printing processes. The color strength (K/S) was measured to study the influence of both plasma gases and the cationization treatment on the coloration of PET fabric. Exposure to nitrogen plasma gases prior to the cationization treatment showed promising results for efficient PET coloration, resulting in the selection of nitrogen as a working gas at a flow rate of 3 l/min. The results also demonstrated that by combining the nitrogen plasma technique and cationization treatment, PET fabric with a highly effective surface was obtained, resulting in improved coloration, wettability, tensile strength, and roughness properties.","output":"Highly effective surface modification using plasma technologies toward green coloration of polyester fabrics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is responsible for the ongoing 2019C2020 pandemic.

Care path for non-deferred elective hospitalizations in cardiology in the Covid-19 period. INTRODUCTION The novel coronavirus-19 (Covid-19) has rapidly resulted in a global pandemic. Our hospital had to postpone all elective admissions to increase capacity for COVID-19 patients. Therefore, a rearrangement of the elective admissions was necessary to guarantee a restart of ordinary procedures. AIM To describe the organizational model adopted for elective procedures during the Covid-19 pandemic, to guarantee maximum safety for patients and healthcare workers. METHODS Patients on waiting list for cardiac procedures were rearranged based on risks prioritization. Procedure of coronary angiography and cardiac devices (PM and ICD) implants or replacement took priority upon other cardiac procedures. Each patient underwent a telephone nurse triage to assess for any covid-19 symptoms. The hospital admissions were organized in accordance with health and safety measures declared by the National Institute of Health, with different paths according to the swab results. RESULTS A total of 66 patients were contacted and 40 accepted the hospital admission (26 refused it, for fear of infection or covid-19 related family problems). No patient resulted positive to the nasal swab. CONCLUSIONS In view of the impact on the health care system of this new pandemic, the choice of an appropriate pathway which can preserve patients' safety is essential, while guaranteeing the treatment of problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, with a high mortality rate.","output":"[Care path for non-deferred elective hospitalizations in cardiology in the Covid-19 period]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, medical students learn surgical skills through the observation of a resident or a surgeon performing the technique. Due to inconsistent practice opportunities in the clinical setting, a disparity of skill levels among students has been observed. In addition, the poor availability of faculty professors is a limiting factor in teaching and adequately preparing medical students for clerkship years. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, medical students do not have access to traditional suturing learning opportunities. Didactic courses are available on videoconferencing platforms, but they do not include technical training. OBJECTIVE: Our overarching goal is to evaluate the efficacy and usability of web-based peer-learning for advanced suturing techniques (i.e., running subcuticular sutures). We will use GEN (Gamified Educational Network), a newly developed online learning tool. We will assess students' ability to identify and to perform the right technique. We will also assess students' satisfaction with regards to GEN. METHODS: We will conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial with blinding of expert examiners. First-year medical students in the Faculty of Medicine of Universit de Montral will be randomized to four groups: 1) control group, 2) self-learning, 3) peer-learning, and 4) peer-learning with expert feedback. Each arm will have 15 participants who will learn how to perform running subcuticular sutures through videos on GEN. For our primary outcome, students' ability to identify the right technique will be evaluated before and after the intervention on GEN. They will view eight videos and rate the surgical technique using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) Global Rating Scale (GRS) and the Subcuticular Suture Checklist as evaluation criteria. For our secondary outcomes, students will anonymously record themselves performing a running subcuticular suture and will be evaluated using the same scales. Then, a survey will be sent to assess the acceptance of students. RESULTS: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by our institutional review board (CERSES 20-068-D). No participants have been recruited yet. CONCLUSIONS: Peer-learning through GEN has the potential to overcome significant limitations related to the pandemic and the lack of availability of faculty professors. Further, a decrease of the anxiety related to traditional suturing classes can be expected. We aim to create an innovative and sustainable method of teaching surgical skills to improve the efficiency and the quality of surgical training in medical faculties.

Though vaccinations have proved effective in reducing the COVID-19 related mortality, the limitation of use of vaccine against immunocompromised, comorbidity, and emerging variants remains a concern. In the current study we investigate for the first-time the efficacy of Glycyrrhiza glabra (GG) extract, a potent immunomodulator, against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. Prophylactic treatment with GG showed protection against loss in body weight and 35-40% decrease in lung viral load along with reduced lung pathology in the hamster model. Remarkably, GG reduced the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Plasminogen activator inhibito-1 (PAI-1). In-vitro, GG acted as potent immunomodulator by reducing Th2 and Th17 differentiation and IL-4 and IL-17A cytokine production. In addition, GG also showed robust potential to suppress ROS, mtROS and NETs generation in a concentration dependent manner in both human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and murine bone marrow derived neutrophils (BMDNs).

OBJECTIVES: To compare the proportion of patients fulfilling ARDS criteria during HFNO and soon after intubation, and 28-day mortality between patients treated exclusively with HFNO and patients transitioned from HFNO to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). METHODS: From previously published studies, we analyzed patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who had Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) of ?300 while treated with ?40 L/min HFNO, or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) with positive end-expiratory pressure of ?5 cm H(2)O (comparator). In patients transitioned from HFNO/NIV to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), we compared ARDS severity during HFNO/NIV and soon after IMV. We compared 28-day mortality in patients treated exclusively with HFNO/NIV versus patients transitioned to IMV. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We analyzed 184 and 131 patients receiving HFNO or NIV, respectively. A total of 112 HFNO and 69 NIV patients transitioned to IMV. Of those, 104 (92.9%) patients on HFNO and 66 (95.7%) on NIV continued to have Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) ?300 under IMV. Twenty-eight-day mortality in patients who remained on HFNO was 4.2% (3/72), whereas in patients transitioned from HFNO to IMV, it was 28.6% (32/112) (P < 0.001). Twenty-eight-day mortality in patients who remained on NIV was 1.6% (1/62), whereas in patients who transitioned from NIV to IMV, it was 44.9% (31/69) (P < 0.001).

Optimal VTE prophylaxis in COVID\\\\19 patients has not been established due to a lack of validated models for predicting VTE in this population. Our study aims to address this deficiency by identifying demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID\\\\19 patients associated with increased VTE risk. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of all adult patients (final sample, n = 355) hospitalized with confirmed COVID\\\\19 at Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia between March 1 and April 24, 2020. Demographic and clinical patient data were collected and factors associated with VTE were identified and analyzed using t\\\\tests, multivariable logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Thirty patients (8.5%) developed VTE. Patients with VTE had significantly higher D\\\\dimer levels on admission (P = 0.045) and peak D\\\\dimer levels (P < 0.0001), in addition to higher rates of vasopressor requirements (P = 0.038), intubation (P = 0.003), and death (P = 0.023).

However, observational studies point to low acceptance in most countries, and few studies have yet examined theory-based predictors of app use in the general population to guide health communication efforts. OBJECTIVE: This study utilizes established health behavior change and technology acceptance models to predict adoption intentions and frequency of current app use. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey between May and July 2020 in a German convenience sample (N=349; mean age 35.62 years; n=226, 65.3% female). To inspect the incremental validity of model constructs as well as additional variables (privacy concerns, personalization), hierarchical regression models were applied, controlling for covariates. RESULTS: The theory of planned behavior and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology predicted adoption intentions (R2=56%-63%) and frequency of current app use (R2=33%-37%). A combined model only marginally increased the predictive value by about 5%, but lower privacy concerns and higher threat appraisals (ie, anticipatory anxiety) significantly predicted app use when included as additional variables. Moreover, the impact of perceived usefulness was positive for adoption intentions but negative for frequency of current app use. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several theory-based predictors of contact tracing app use. However, few constructs, such as social norms, have a consistent positive effect across models and outcomes. Further research is required to replicate these observations, and to examine the interconnectedness of these constructs and their impact throughout the pandemic. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that promulgating affirmative social norms and positive emotional effects of app use, as well as addressing health concerns, might be promising strategies to foster adoption intentions and app use in the general population.","output":"Utilizing Health Behavior Change and Technology Acceptance Models to Predict the Adoption of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital infection control measures against COVID-19 may come into conflict with patients need for support.

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated through the viral spike glycoprotein (S2). Afterwards, the virus gets hold of the host cell machinery by employing the use of viral main protease 3CLpro and NSP15 endoribonuclease. In the present in silico study, active site mapping of the viral virulence factors was rendered by means of DoG Site Scorer. The possibility of repurposing of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a radio-chemo-modifier drug used for optimizing cancer therapy, and one of its derivative (1, 3, 4, 6-Tetra-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose, has been investigated by conducting ligand-receptor docking. Binding pose depictions of ligands and viral receptors were assessed by employing molecular dynamics analysis. Molinspiration and Toxicity Estimation Software tools were used to assess the drug likeliness, bioactivity indices and ADMETox values. 2-DG can dock efficiently with viral main protease 3CLpro as well as NSP15 endoribonuclease, thus efficiently inactivating these viral receptors leading to incapacitation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such incapacitation was possible by means of formation of a hydrogen bond between 2-DG and proline residues of viral protease. The 2-DG derivative formed a hydrogen bond with the glutamine amino acid residues of the viral spike glycoprotein. The present in silico study supports the potential benefits of using 2-DG and its glucopyranose derivative as repurposed drugs/prodrugs for mitigating the novel COVID-19 infection. Since both these moieties present no signs of serious toxicity, further empirical studies on model systems and human clinical trials to ascertain effective dose-response are warranted and should be urgently initiated.","output":"Glucose antimetabolite 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose and its derivative as promising candidates for tackling COVID-19: Insights derived from in silico docking and molecular simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Germaphobia CC a pathological aversion to microorganisms CC could be contributing to an explosion in human immune-related disorders via mass sterilisation of surfaces and reduced exposure to biodiversity.

In this study, we created an online questionnaire to acquire data on attitudes towards, and knowledge of microbes. We collected data on nature connectedness and interactions with nature and explored the relationships between these variables. We found a significant association between attitudes towards microbes and both duration and frequency of visits to natural environments. A higher frequency of visits to nature per week, and a longer duration spent in nature per visit, significantly associated with positive attitudes towards microbes. We found no association between nature connectedness and attitudes towards microbes. We found a significant relationship between knowledge of lesser known microbial groups (e.g., identifying that fungi, algae, protozoa, and archaea are microbes) and positive attitudes towards microbes. However, we also found that people who correctly identified viruses as being microbes expressed less positive views of microbes overall CC this could potentially be attributed to a COVID-19 effect. Our results suggest that basic microbial literacy and nature engagement may be important in reducing/preventing germaphobia. The results also suggest that a virus-centric phenomenon (e.g., COVID-19) could increase broader germaphobia. As the rise of immune-related disorders and mental health conditions have been linked to germaphobia, reduced biodiversity, and non-targeted sterilisation, our findings point to a feasible strategy to potentially help ameliorate these negative consequences.

We define shock as life-threatening circulatory failure that results in inadequate tissue perfusion and cellular dysoxia/hypoxia, and suggest that it can be operationalized via clinical observations. We suggest a thorough evaluation for other potential causes of shock and suggest against indiscriminate testing for coinfections. We suggest the use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) as a simple bedside prognostic score for COVID-19 patients and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to evaluate the etiology of shock. Regarding fluid therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-middleCincome countries, we favor balanced crystalloids and recommend using a conservative fluid strategy for resuscitation. Where available and not prohibited by cost, we recommend using norepinephrine, given its safety profile. We favor avoiding the routine use of central venous or arterial catheters, where availability and costs are strong considerations. We also recommend using low-dose corticosteroids in patients with refractory shock.

Cefiderocol is a novel siderophore cephalosporin antibiotic with a catechol moiety on the 3-position side chain. Cefiderocol has been shown to be potent in vitro against a broad range of Gram-negative organisms, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Recent clinical data has shown cefiderocol to be effective in the setting of complicated urinary tract infections and nosocomial pneumonia, but it has not yet been studied as treatment of bloodstream infection. METHODS: This study will use a multicentre, open-label non-inferiority trial design comparing cefiderocol and standard of care antibiotics. Eligible participants will be adult inpatients who are diagnosed with a bloodstream infection with a Gram-negative organism on the basis of a positive blood culture result where the acquisition meets the definition for healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired. It will compare cefiderocol with the current standard of care (SOC) antibiotic regimen according to the patients treating clinician. Eligible participants will be randomised 1:1 to cefiderocol or SOC and receive 5C14 days of antibiotic therapy. Trial recruitment will occur in at least 20 sites in ten countries (Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey and Greece). The sample size has been derived from an estimated 14 day, all-cause mortality rate of 10% in the control group, and a non-inferiority margin of 10% difference in the two groups. A minimum of 284 patients are required in total to achieve 80% power with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Data describing demographic information, risk factors, concomitant antibiotics, illness scores, microbiology, multidrug-resistant organism screening, discharge and mortality will be collected. DISCUSSION: With increasing antimicrobial resistance, there is a need for the development of new antibiotics with broad activity against Gram-negative pathogens such as cefiderocol. By selecting a population at risk for multi-drug-resistant pathogens and commencing study treatment early in the clinical illness (within 48 h of index blood culture) the trial hopes to provide guidance to clinicians of the efficacy of this novel agent.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and tolerability of high-dose (>12 mg) buprenorphine induction for patients with OUD presenting to an ED. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case series of ED encounters, data were manually abstracted from electronic health records for all ED patients with OUD treated with buprenorphine at a single, urban, safety-net hospital in Oakland, California, for the calendar year 2018. Data analysis was performed from April 2020 to March 2021. INTERVENTIONS: ED physicians and advanced practice practitioners were trained on a high-dose sublingual buprenorphine induction protocol, which was then clinically implemented. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vital signs; use of supplemental oxygen; the presence of precipitated withdrawal, sedation, and respiratory depression; adverse events; length of stay; and hospitalization during and 24 hours after the ED visit were reported according to total sublingual buprenorphine dose (range, 2 to >28 mg). RESULTS: Among a total of 391 unique patients (median [interquartile range] age, 36 [29-48] years), representing 579 encounters, 267 (68.3%) were male and 170 were (43.5%) Black. Homelessness (88 patients [22.5%]) and psychiatric disorders (161 patients [41.2%]) were common. A high dose of sublingual buprenorphine (>12 mg) was administered by 54 unique clinicians during 366 (63.2%) encounters, including 138 doses (23.8%) greater than or equal to 28 mg. No cases of respiratory depression or sedation were reported. All 5 (0.8%) cases of precipitated withdrawal had no association with dose; 4 cases occurred after doses of 8 mg of buprenorphine. Three serious adverse events unrelated to buprenorphine were identified. Nausea or vomiting was rare (2%-6% of cases). The median (interquartile range) length of stay was 2.4 (1.6-3.75) hours. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that high-dose buprenorphine induction, adopted by multiple clinicians in a single-site urban ED, was safe and well tolerated in patients with untreated OUD.

Similarly, the known three-dimensional structures adopt a limited number of protein folds. However, proteins exert a large variety of functions and show a remarkable ability for regulation and immediate response to intracellular and extracellular stimuli. To some degree, the wide variability of protein function can be attributed to the post-translational modifications. Post-translational modifications have been observed in all kingdoms of life and give to proteins a significant degree of chemical and consequently functional and structural diversity. Their importance is partly reflected in the large number of genes dedicated to their regulation. So far, hundreds of post-translational modifications have been observed while it is believed that many more are to be discovered along with the technological advances in sequencing, proteomics, mass spectrometry and structural biology. Indeed, the number of studies which report novel post translational modifications is getting larger supporting the notion that their space is still largely unexplored. In this review we explore the impact of post-translational modifications on protein structure and function with emphasis on catalytic activity regulation. We present examples of proteins and protein families whose catalytic activity is substantially affected by the presence of post translational modifications and we describe the molecular basis which underlies the regulation of the protein function through these modifications.

METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted with Australian adults 45 years and older in late 2019 to capture influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake, exposure to hospital-based immunization programs, missed opportunities to vaccinate and receptiveness towards the promotion and/or delivery of vaccines in the hospital setting. RESULTS Only 13 respondents reported receiving a vaccine at hospital, yet 72.2% (931/1292) indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated in that setting. Amongst those who attended hospital during 2019 and were eligible for vaccination, 57.2% and 28.3% of respondents were not immunized for pneumococcal and influenza, respectively. Missed opportunities for both vaccines were significantly higher amongst those at low-risk for influenza (65 years (low-risk): 52.9%, 65 years (high-risk): 18.3%, >65 years: 15.1%; p < 0.001) and pneumococcal (65 years (low-risk): 79.1%, 65 years (high-risk): 52.4%, >65 years: 44%; p < 0.001). Among those with a missed opportunity for hospital-based vaccination, the most common reason for not getting immunized was a lack of recommendation. Most (86.4%) reported that their general practitioner was the person or group they trusted most to receive vaccine information from. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this Australian study support international work that shows very low rates of opportunistic vaccination in hospitals despite national recommendations to vaccinate prior to discharge.

All vaccinated cattle were protected from colonization of the kidney and shedding of Leptospira in urine, as detected by culture and immunofluorescence assay. Agglutinating antibody titers were detected in vaccinated cattle at 4 weeks following vaccination, with small anamnestic response detected following experimental challenge. Only animals vaccinated with the oil emulsion-adjuvanted bacterin produced significant IgG2 titers following vaccination, and nonvaccinated animals produced serum IgA titers after experimental challenge. CD4+ and æ T cells from vaccinated cattle proliferated when cultured with antigen ex vivo Cellular responses included a marked proliferation of æ T cells immediately following experimental challenge in vaccinated cattle and release of gamma interferon (IFN-), interleukin 17a (IL-17a), and IL-12p40 from stimulated cells. Proliferative and cytokine responses were found not just in peripheral mononuclear cells but also in lymphocytes isolated from renal lymph nodes at 10 weeks following experimental challenge. Overall, effects of leptospirosis vaccination and infection were subtle, resulting in only modest activation of CD4+ and æ T cells. The use of Seppic Montanide oil emulsion adjuvants may shorten the initiation of response to vaccination, which could be useful during outbreaks or in areas where leptospirosis is endemic.IMPORTANCE Leptospirosis is an underdiagnosed, underreported zoonotic disease of which domestic livestock can be carriers. As a reservoir host for Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo, cattle may present with reproductive issues, including abortion, birth of weak or infected calves, or failure to breed. Despite years of study and the availability of commercial vaccines, detailed analysis of the bovine immune response to vaccination and Leptospira challenge is lacking. This study evaluated immunologic responses to two efficacious commercial vaccines and a novel bacterin vaccine using an adjuvant chosen for enhanced cellular immune responses. Antigen-specific responsive CD4 and æ T cells were detected following vaccination and were associated with release of inflammatory cytokines IFN- and IL-17a after stimulation. CD4 and æ cells increased in the first week after infection and, combined with serum antibody, may play a role in clearance of bacteria from the blood and resident tissues. Additionally, these antigen-reactive T cells were found in the regional lymph nodes following infection, indicating that memory responses may not be circulating but are still present in regional lymph nodes.

This review highlights current means for hydrogen production and use, and the importance of progressing R&D along key technologies and policies to drive a cost reduction in renewable hydrogen production and enable the transition of chemical manufacturing toward green hydrogen as a feedstock and fuel. The chemical industry is at the core of what is considered a modern economy. It provides commodities and important materials, e.g., fertilizers, synthetic textiles, and drug precursors, supporting economies and more broadly our needs. The chemical sector is to become the major driver for oil production by 2030 as it entirely relies on sufficient oil supply. In this respect, renewable hydrogen has an important role to play beyond its use in the transport sector. Hydrogen not only has three times the energy density of natural gas and using hydrogen as a fuel could help decarbonize the entire chemical manufacturing, but also the use of green hydrogen as an essential reactant at the basis of many chemical products could facilitate the convergence toward virtuous circles. Enabling the production of green hydrogen at cost could not only enable new opportunities but also strengthen economies through a localized production and use of hydrogen. Herein, existing technologies for the production of renewable hydrogen including biomass and water electrolysis, and methods for the effective storage of hydrogen are reviewed with an emphasis on the need for mitigation strategies to enable such a transition.","output":"Renewable hydrogen for the chemical industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: Although affected family members of individuals suffering from addiction (AFMs)show elevated levels of stress and strain they have been not adequately addressed by research and care To date, there are no reliable data on the effects of the social restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic on burden and care offers for AFMs Method: International survey of experts and a survey of treatment providers from Germany Results: While mainly an increase in strain due to the effects of the pandemic regarding increased risk behavior by the addicted family member and an increase of interpersonal conflicts is expected, also some possible positive effects on subgroups of AFMs were reported Overall, a decline in supply for relatives and a trend for reduced demand for help by AFMs were reported from treatment providers Conclusions: Effects of Addiction on the families should routinely be assessed in studies on addictive and affective disorders as well as in studies on domestic violence Evidence-based support for AFMs should be offered nationwide and digital as well Networking with other psychosocial offers should be optimized","output":"Anticipated Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Family Members Affected by Addiction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on regular life across the world has changed teenagers' use of technology Through this case study, the author analyzed, reported, and reflected on personal experience of a shift in technology use during the COVID-19 pandemic There are two parts of this case study The first part highlights the new technology used in five inside-of-school activities, including classroom learning, group projects, dance tutorials, environmental club, and affinity group The second part describes six outside-of-school actions that utilized technology, such as homework assignments, online test preparation, virtual workouts, listening to music, picking up hobbies, and interacting with peers Based on the reflections on the author's first-hand experiences, adjustments at the personal, school, and society level are discussed","output":"COVID-19 and technology use by teenagers: A case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical sciences are an important application area of artificial intelligence Healthcare requires meticulousness in the whole process from collecting data to processing It should also be handled in terms of data quality, data size, and data privacy Various data are used within the scope of the COVID-19 outbreak struggle Medical and location data collected from mobile phones and wearable devices are used to prevent the spread of the epidemic In addition to this, artificial intelligence approaches are presented by using medical images in order to identify COVID-19 infected people However, studies should be carried out by taking care not to endanger the security of the data, people, and countries needed for these useful applications Therefore, differential privacy (DP) application, which was an interesting research subject, has been included in this study CXR images have been collected from COVID-19 infected 139 and a total of 373 public data sources were used for a diagnostic concept It has been trained with EfficientNet- B0, a recent and robust deep learning model, and proposal the possibility of infected with an accuracy of 94 7% Other evaluation parameters were also discussed in detail Despite the data constraint, this performance showed that it can be improved by augmenting the dataset The most important aspect of the study was the proposal of differential privacy practice for such applications to be reliable in real-life use cases With this view, experiments were repeated with DP applied images and the results obtained were presented Here, Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) approach was used to ensure privacy assurance ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Differential Privacy Practice on Diagnosis of COVID-19 Radiology Imaging Using EfficientNet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the article is to discuss the importance of the Amazon biome for the Brazilian economy during the post-pandemic recession and we will highlight possible strategies to explode the economy without promoting the destruction of the Amazon.

While it affects not only individuals but also our collective healthcare and economic systems, testing is insufficient and costly hampering efforts to deal with the pandemic. Chest X-rays are routine radiographic imaging tests that are used for the diagnosis of respiratory conditions such as pneumonia and COVID-19. Convolutional neural networks have shown promise to be effective at classifying X-rays for assisting diagnosis of conditions; however, achieving robust performance demanded in most modern medical applications typically requires a large number of samples. While there exist datasets containing thousands of X-ray images of patients with healthy and pneumonia diagnoses, because COVID-19 is such a recent phenomenon, there are relatively few confirmed COVID-19 positive chest X-rays openly available to the research community.

We showed that droplets containing the drug albuterol, a radiolabel (99mTc-DTPA) or a model influenza virus vaccine (S-FLU) have similar aerosol characteristics. 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy showed that VMNs deliver droplets with uniform distribution throughout the lungs as well as the URT. Surprisingly MAD administration (1ml/nostril) also delivered a high proportion of the dose to the lungs, albeit concentrated in a small area. After MAD administration of influenza virus, antigen specific T cells were found at high frequency in nasal turbinates, trachea, broncho-alveolar lavage, lungs, tracheobronchial nodes and blood.

This project aimed to explore the subjective experiences of staff working in Liaison Psychiatry (LP) in the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust, (BSMHFT) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have been used to devise recommendations for subsequent waves.MethodData collection occurred as part of a mixed method service evaluation project. We invited all clinical and non-clinical staff from LP departments across BSMHFT to participate in focus groups conducted via Microsoft Teams. The focus groups were video-recorded and facilitated by a moderator and an observer. Subsequent anonymised transcripts were coded and themes were generated by at least two evaluators, using thematic analysis.ResultThe focus groups, which ranged from 21 to 69 minutes, involved consultants, junior doctors and nurses from four hospitals within BSMHFT. Six major themes emerged including an initial reduction in number yet increase in acuity of patients seen by LP, with some perception that this resulted from reduced face-to-face contact with community mental health services. A feeling that LP was lost at the interface between the physical and mental health trusts emerged as another theme. Uncertainty in adapting to unprecedented working conditions, for example, unclear guidance concerning the use of personal protective equipment, was also described alongside anxiety about contracting and transmitting SARS-Cov-2. Additionally, increased pressure was felt due to staff shortages and inadequate inter-departmental communication. Participants reported differential uptake of remote working, as well as conflicting views regarding the feasibility of remote assessments in LP.ConclusionLiaison psychiatry staff within BSMHFT continued to provide a crucial service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Focus groups with thes staff indicate several recommendations for implementation within the Trust and provoke questions for future research. Due to the unique role that LP plays in providing mental health care within general hospitals, clear guidance for LP staff is key for effective service provision and supporting LP staff. Although used widely across community mental health services, the role of remote working in LP is contentious and requires further exploration. However, there are limitations to the use of focus groups and these findings may not fully represent the experiences of LP staff throughout BSMHFT. Different themes may have emerged through the use of anonymous questionnaires.","output":"Lost between the interface of physical and mental health: focus groups exploring liaison psychiatry staff's perception about working during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection led to a substantial overhaul of the symptomatic breast services within the UK. AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pattern of primary care referrals to the symptomatic one-stop clinic during the pandemic. This study also provides a snapshot of the workings of symptomatic breast services and the scope for improvements. METHODS: The data points were collected for 1 month during the peak of the pandemic (April 2020) and compared to corresponding data points for the same month in the previous year (April 2019). This was compared to the monthly data from Wales Cancer Network (WCN) data source. A hundred patients from each month over 2 years were evaluated to get a snapshot into the working of the breast clinic. RESULTS: A total of 516 patients were referred from primary care or General Practitioners (GPs), and were seen in the Hospital one-stop breast clinic in April 2019. This number dropped to 330 patients during the peak of the pandemic in April 2020. Ninety percent of referrals from the GP were urgent suspected cancers or urgent referrals. This trend of referrals did not change over 2 years. There was a 5% and 7% cancer diagnosis rate in 2020 and 2019, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients were referred from GP as urgent or urgent suspected cancer. The cancer diagnosis rate reduced from 7 to 5% during the pandemic peak but the number of worried well patients did not reduce. The total number of referrals reduced, which is predictive of increased demand in the future.

Objective: To determine which and how many admissions to intensive care units are identified as having the lowest priority for ventilator allocation using 2 distinct sets of proposed triage criteria. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study conducted in spring 2020 used data collected from US hospitals and reported in the Philips eICU Collaborative Research Database. Adult admissions (N = 40a?439) to 291 intensive care units from 2014 to 2015 who received mechanical ventilation and were not elective surgery patients were included. Exposures: New York State triage criteria and original triage criteria proposed by White and Lo. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated for admissions. The proportion of patients who met initial criteria for the lowest level of priority for mechanical ventilation using each set of criteria and their characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Agreement was compared between the 2 sets of triage criteria, recognizing differences in stated criteria aims. Results: Among 40a?439 intensive care unit admissions of patients who received mechanical ventilation, the mean (SD) age was 62.6 (16.6) years, 54.9% were male, and the mean (SD) SOFA score was 4.5 (3.7). Using the New York State triage criteria, 8.9% (95% CI, 8.7%-9.2%) were in the lowest priority category; these lowest priority admissions had a mean (SD) age of 62.9 (16.6) years, used a median (interquartile range) of 57.3 (20.1-133.5) ventilator hours each, and had a hospital survival rate of 38.6% (95% CI, 37.0%-40.2%). Using the White and Lo triage criteria, 4.3% (95% CI, 4.1%-4.5%) were in the lowest priority category; these admissions had a mean (SD) age of 68.6 (13.2) years, used a median (interquartile range) of 61.7 (24.3-142.8) ventilator hours each, and had a hospital survival rate of 56.2% (95% CI, 53.8%-58.7%). Only 655 admissions (1.6%) were in the lowest priority category for both guidelines, with the &#954; statistic for agreement equal to 0.20 (95% CI, 0.18-0.21). Conclusions and Relevance: Use of 2 initially proposed ventilator triage guidelines identified approximately 1 in every 10 to 25 admissions as having the lowest priority for ventilator allocation, with little agreement.

By harnessing such information, epidemiologists aim to shed light on the spatio-temporal patterns of spread and to test hypotheses about the underlying interaction of evolutionary and ecological dynamics in pathogen populations. Although the field has witnessed a rich development of statistical inference tools with increasing levels of sophistication, these tools initially focused on sequences as their sole primary data source. Integrating various sources of information, however, promises to deliver more precise insights in infectious diseases and to increase opportunities for statistical hypothesis testing. Here, we review how the emerging concept of data integration is stimulating new advances in Bayesian evolutionary inference methodology which formalize a marriage of statistical thinking and evolutionary biology. These approaches include connecting sequence to trait evolution, such as for host, phenotypic and geographic sampling information, but also the incorporation of covariates of evolutionary and epidemic processes in the reconstruction procedures. We highlight how a full Bayesian approach to covariate modeling and testing can generate further insights into sequence evolution, trait evolution, and population dynamics in pathogen populations. Specific examples demonstrate how such approaches can be used to test the impact of host on rabies and HIV evolutionary rates, to identify the drivers of influenza dispersal as well as the determinants of rabies cross-species transmissions, and to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of influenza antigenicity. Finally, we briefly discuss how data integration is now also permeating through the inference of transmission dynamics, leading to novel insights into tree-generative processes and detailed reconstructions of transmission trees.

Purpose To assess international variations in CT utilization, protocols, and radiation doses in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods In this retrospective data collection study, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) coordinated a survey between May and July 2020 regarding CT utilization, protocols, and radiation doses from 62 healthcare sites in 34 countries across five continents for CT exams performed in COVID-19 pneumonia. The questionnaire obtained information on local prevalence, method of diagnosis, most frequent imaging, indications for CT, and specific policies on use of CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. Collected data included general information (patient age, weight, clinical indication), CT equipment (CT make and model, year of installation, number of detector rows), scan protocols (body region, scan phases, tube current and potential), and radiation dose descriptors (CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP)). Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations were performed. Results Data from 782 patients (median age (interquartile range) of 59(15) years) from 54 healthcare sites in 28 countries were evaluated. Less than one-half of the healthcare sites used CT for initial diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and three-fourth used CT for assessing disease severity. CTDIvol varied based on CT vendors (7-11mGy, p<0.001), number of detector-rows (8-9mGy, p<0.001), year of CT installation (7-10mGy, p=0.006), and reconstruction techniques (7-10mGy, p=0.03). Multiphase chest CT exams performed in 20% of sites (11 of 54) were associated with higher DLP compared with single-phase chest CT exams performed in 80% (43 of 54 sites) (p=0.008).

They may act as catalytic antioxidants mimicking both the structure and the reactivity of the native antioxidant enzymes active site. Thus, manganosalen complexes have been shown to exhibit superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities, and they could potentially facilitate the scavenging of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby restoring the redox balance in damaged cells and organs. Initial catalytic studies compared the potency of these compounds as antioxidants in terms of rate constants of the chemical reactivity against ROS, giving catalytic values approaching and even exceeding that of the native antioxidative enzymes. Although most of these catalytic studies lack of biological relevance, subsequent in vitro studies have confirmed the efficiency of many manganosalen complexes in oxidative stress models.

This study aims to evaluate the self-rating questionnaire commonly used for online monitoring of the psychosocial implications of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: The data were taken from the online assessment results of two groups, with a total of 765 participants. The instruments studied were Self-Rating Questionnaire (SRQ-20), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale-10 (CESD-10), used in the online assessment. Data analysis used Rasch modeling and Winsteps applications. Validity and reliability were tested, and data were fit with the model, rating scale, and item fit analysis. RESULTS: All the scales for outfit mean square (MnSq) were very close to the ideal value of 1.0, and the Chi-square test was significant. Item reliability was greater than 0.67, item separation was greater than 3, and Cronbachs alpha was greater than 0.60; all the instruments were considered very good. The raw variance explained by measures for the SRQ-20, PTSD, and CESD-10 was 30.7%, 41.6%, and 47.6%, respectively.

Despite immunization of almost all chickens with inactivated vaccines, the disease still remains widespread. We speculated that improving mucosal or cellular immune responses could contribute to improved control of H9N2 viruses. In this study, we constructed a novel Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the M1 and HA2 proteins derived from an antigenically conserved endemic H9N2 virus strain. The M1-HA2 fusion protein was cloned downstream of a gene encoding a secretory peptide, and we subsequently confirmed that the fusion protein was secreted from L. lactis by Western blotting. We assessed the immunogenicity and protective effects of this recombinant L. lactis strain. Eighty 1-day-old chickens were divided into four groups, and the experimental groups were orally vaccinated twice with the recombinant L. lactis strain. Fecal and intestinal samples, sera, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected at 7, 14, and 21 days post-vaccination (dpv). Chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed significantly increased levels of serum antibodies, T cell-mediated immune responses, and mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA). Following challenge with H9N2 virus at 21 dpv, chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed decreased weight loss, lower viral titers in the lung, and reduced lung pathological damage. In summary, our results demonstrated that a recombinant L. lactis strain expressing an H9N2 M1-HA2 fusion protein could induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity. This oral vaccine is H9N2 virus-specific and represents a significant design improvement compared with previous studies. Our study provides a theoretical basis for improving mucosal immune responses to prevent and control H9N2 virus infection.","output":"Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Expressing M1-HA2 Fusion Protein Provides Protective Mucosal Immunity Against H9N2 Avian Influenza Virus in Chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Indian national Civil Registration System (CRS) is the optimal data source for subnational mortality measurement, but is yet under development. As an alternative, data from the Sample Registration System (SRS), which covers less than 1% of the national population, is used. This article presents a comparison of mortality measures from the SRS and CRS in 2017, and explores the potential of the CRS to meet these subnational data needs. METHODS: Data on population and deaths by age and sex for 2017 from each source were used to compute national-level and state-level life tables. Sex-specific ratios of death probabilities in five age categories (0C4, 5C14, 15C29, 30C69, 70C84) were used to evaluate CRS data completeness using SRS probabilities as reference values. The quality of medically certified causes of death was assessed through hospital reporting coverage and proportions of deaths registered with ill-defined causes from each state. RESULTS: The CRS operates through an extensive infrastructure with high reporting coverage, but child deaths are uniformly under-reported, as are female deaths in many states. However, at ages 30C69 years, CRS death probabilities are higher than the SRS values in 15 states for males and 10 states for females. SRS death probabilities are of limited precision for measuring mortality trends and differentials. Data on medically certified causes of death are of limited use due to low hospital reporting coverage. CONCLUSIONS: The Indian CRS is more reliable than the SRS for measuring adult mortality in several states. Targeted initiatives to improve the recording of child and female deaths, to strengthen the reporting and quality of medically certified causes of death, and to promote use of verbal autopsy methods can establish the CRS as a reliable source of subnational mortality statistics in the near future.","output":"The civil registration system is a potentially viable data source for reliable subnational mortality measurement in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Robotic surgery offers three-dimensional visualization and precision of movement that could be of great value to hepatobiliary surgeons.

The objective of this study was to characterize the landscape of monthly prescription fill limit policies in Medicaid programs and their potential implications for expanding naloxone use for opioid overdose harm reduction. METHODS: A cross-sectional, multi-modal online and telephonic data collection strategy was used to identify and describe the presence and characteristics of monthly prescription fill limit policies across state Medicaid programs. Contextual characteristics were described regarding each states Medicaid enrollment, opioid prescribing rates, and overdose death rates. Data collection and analysis occurred between February and May 2020. RESULTS: Medicaid-covered naloxone fills are currently subject to monthly prescription fill limit policies in 10 state Medicaid programs, which cover 20% of the Medicaid population nationwide. Seven of these programs are located in states ranking in the top 10 highest per-capita opioid prescribing rates in the country. However, 8 of these programs are located in states with opioid overdose death rates below the national average. CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid beneficiaries at high risk of opioid overdose living in states with monthly prescription fill limits may experience significant barriers to obtaining naloxone. Exempting naloxone from Medicaid prescription limit restrictions may help spur broader adoption of naloxone for opioid overdose mortality prevention, especially in states with high opioid prescribing rates.

We have collected all tweets mentioned in the verdicts of fact-checked claims related to COVID-19 by over 92 professional fact-checking organisations between January and mid-July 2020 and share this corpus with the community. This resulted in 1500 tweets relating to 1274 false and 226 partially false claims, respectively. Exploratory analysis of author accounts revealed that the verified twitter handle(including Organisation/celebrity) are also involved in either creating(new tweets) or spreading(retweet) the misinformation. Additionally, we found that false claims propagate faster than partially false claims. Compare to a background corpus of COVID-19 tweets, tweets with misinformation are more often concerned with discrediting other information on social media. Authors use less tentative language and appear to be more driven by concerns of potential harm to others.

Rhizobium favelukesii has the unusual ability of being able to nodulate and fix nitrogen, albeit sub-optimally, not only with M. sativa but also with the promiscuous host Phaseolus vulgaris. Here we describe the genome of R. favelukesii OR191 and genomic features important for the symbiotic interaction with both of these hosts. The OR191 draft genome contained acid adaptation loci, including the highly acid-inducible lpiA/acvB operon and olsC, required for production of lysine- and ornithine-containing membrane lipids, respectively. The olsC gene was also present in other acid-tolerant Rhizobium strains but absent from the more acid-sensitive Ensifer microsymbionts. The OR191 symbiotic genes were in general more closely related to those found in Medicago microsymbionts. OR191 contained the nodA, nodEF, nodHPQ, and nodL genes for synthesis of polyunsaturated, sulfated and acetylated Nod factors that are important for symbiosis with Medicago, but contained a truncated nodG, which may decrease nodulation efficiency with M. sativa. OR191 contained an E. meliloti type BacA, which has been shown to specifically protect Ensifer microsymbionts from Medicago nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides. The nitrogen fixation genes nifQWZS were present in OR191 and P. vulgaris microsymbionts but absent from E. meliloti-Medicago microsymbionts. The ability of OR191 to nodulate and fix nitrogen symbiotically with P. vulgaris indicates that this host has less stringent requirements for nodulation than M. sativa but may need rhizobial strains that possess nifQWZS for N2-fixation to occur. OR191 possessed the exo genes required for the biosynthesis of succinoglycan, which is required for the Ensifer-Medicago symbiosis. However, 1H-NMR spectra revealed that, in the conditions tested, OR191 exopolysaccharide did not contain a succinyl substituent but instead contained a 3-hydroxybutyrate moiety, which may affect its symbiotic performance with Medicago hosts. These findings provide a foundation for the genetic basis of nodulation requirements and symbiotic effectiveness with different hosts.","output":"The Genome of the Acid Soil-Adapted Strain Rhizobium favelukesii OR191 Encodes Determinants for Effective Symbiotic Interaction With Both an Inverted Repeat Lacking Clade and a Phaseoloid Legume Host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi COVID-19 yang telah terjadi di Indonesia merupakan bencana yang tidak pernah diduga sebelumnya.

The model is designed to simulate the spatiotemporal spread of SARS-CoV2 disease, known as COVID-19. Our SARS-CoV2-based ABM framework (CoV-ABM) simulates the spread at any geographical scale, ranging from a village to a country and considers unique characteristics of SARS-CoV2 viruses such as its persistence in the environment. Therefore, unlike other simulators, CoV-ABM computes the density of active viruses inside each location space to get the virus transmission probability for each agent. It also uses the local census and health data to create health and risk factor profiles for each individual. The proposed model relies on a flexible timestamp scale to optimize the computational speed and the level of detail. In our framework each agent represents a person interacting with the surrounding space and other adjacent agents inside the same space. Moreover, families stochastic daily tasks are formulated to get tracked by the corresponding family members. The model also formulates the possibility of meetings for each subset of friendships and relatives. The main aim of the proposed framework is threefold: to illustrate the dynamics of SARS-CoV diseases, to identify places which have a higher probability to become infection hubs and to provide a decision-support system to design efficient interventions in order to fight against pandemics. The framework employs SEIHRD dynamics of viral diseases with different intervention scenarios.

It is expected that many families with children with ASD will experience more problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related public health restrictions. At the same time, some may experience improved functioning, due to fewer expectations and social demands. METHODS/DESIGN: In a mixed-method study to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, parents of children with ASD (ages 4C21) who were in care pre-COVID-19 at one of three large mental healthcare institutions in the region of Rotterdam participated (68 for T0, 57 for T1). The aims are (1) to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall functioning and autistic symptoms of the child/adolescent with ASD, as well as parental and family functioning (QUANT-QUAL), in both the short term and longer term, and (2) to investigate risk and protective factors (in light of resilience) (QUANT-qual) and (3) to investigate care and informational needs (QUAL-quant).

OBJECTIVE: We review the current evidence on hypoxemia in COVID-19 and place it in the context of known evidence-based management of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the emergency department. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 causes mortality primarily through the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with hypoxemia arising from shunt, a mismatch of ventilation and perfusion. Management of patients developing ARDS should focus on mitigating derecruitment and avoiding volutrauma or barotrauma. CONCLUSIONS: High flow nasal cannula and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have a more limited role in COVID-19 because of the risk of aerosolization and minimal benefit in severe cases, but can be considered. Stable patients who can tolerate repositioning should be placed in a prone position while awake. Once intubated, patients should be managed with ventilation strategies appropriate for ARDS, including targeting lung-protective volumes and low pressures. Increasing positive end-expiratory pressure can be beneficial. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators do not decrease mortality but may be given to improve refractory hypoxemia. Prone positioning of intubated patients is associated with a mortality reduction in ARDS and can be considered for patients with persistent hypoxemia. Neuromuscular blockade should also be administered in patients who remain dyssynchronous with the ventilator despite adequate sedation.

The objective was to determine prevalence of different PRDC pathogens and their variations during different seasons, including correlations with local weather conditions. A total of 974 pig farms and 22,266 pigs were sampled using TBS over a 5-year period.

In this study, we aimed to identify the pattern of local transmission of COVID-19 using mathematical modeling and predict the epidemic size and the timing of the end of the spread. METHODS: We modeled the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea by applying a mathematical model of transmission that factors in behavioral changes. We used the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data of daily confirmed cases in the country to estimate the nationwide and Daegu/Gyeongbuk area-specific transmission rates as well as behavioral change parameters using a least-squares method. RESULTS: The number of transmissions per infected patient was estimated to be about 10 times higher in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area than the average of nationwide. Using these estimated parameters, our models predicts that about 13,800 cases will occur nationwide and 11,400 cases in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area until mid-June. CONCLUSIONS: We mathematically demonstrate that the relatively high per-capita rate of transmission and the low rate of changes in behavior have caused a large-scale transmission of COVID-19 in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area in Korea.

The platforms data processing pipeline computed and geolocalized the risk index of each user and enabled the analysis of the variables and their association. Point process analysis identified geographic clustering patterns of users at risk and these were compared with the patterns of COVID-19 cases confirmed by the State Health Services. RESULTS: A total of 1,554 COVID-19 surveys were administered through the CDS app. Among the respondents, 50.4% were men and 49.6% women, with an average age of 33.5 years. Overall risk index frequencies were, in descending order: no-risk 77.8%, low risk 10.6%, respiratory symptoms 6.7%, medium risk 1.4%, high risk 2.0%, very high risk 1.5%.

We observed that high stress exposure leads to a substantially higher duration to conceive using ART, although the proportions of successful pregnancies did not differ between low-stress and high-stress groups. A significantly higher number of couples achieved pregnancy when their monthly household income was higher than EUR 1000 and if the ART method was more expensive. Additionally, we observed that advanced age, high stress levels, and the high cost of ART had a negative association with achieving pregnancy using ART.

Cell-based serological screening platforms can fulfil a crucial niche in the identification of antibodies which recognise more complex folded epitopes or those incorporating post-translation modifications which may be undetectable by other methods used to investigate the antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Here, we employed automated high content immunofluorescence microscopy (AHCIM) to assess the viability of such an approach as a method capable of assaying humoral immune responses against full length SARS-CoV-2 proteins in their native cellular state. We first demonstrate that AHCIM provides high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 N and S IgG.

The identification of M as a serological marker of high prevalence may be of value in detecting additional COVID-19 cases during the era of mass SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, where serological screening for SARS CoV-2 infections in vaccinated individuals is dependent on detection of antibodies against N.

OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine associations of race and neighborhood disadvantage with patient retention in a monitoring program offering two participation methods. (2) To measure the association of the program with emergency department visits and hospital admissions. DESIGN: Retrospective propensity-matched cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: COVID-positive outpatients at a single university-affiliated healthcare system and propensity-matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: A home monitoring program providing daily symptom tracking via patient portal app or telephone calls. MAIN MEASURES: Among program enrollees, retention (until 14 days, symptom resolution, or hospital admission) by race and neighborhood disadvantage, with stratification by program arm. In enrollees versus matched controls, emergency department utilization and hospital admission within 30 days. KEY RESULTS: There were 7592 enrolled patients and 9710 matched controls. Black enrollees chose the telephone arm more frequently than White enrollees (68% versus 44%, p = 0.009), as did those from more versus less disadvantaged neighborhoods (59% versus 43%, p = 0.02). Retention was similar in Black enrollees and White enrollees (63% versus 62%, p = 0.76) and in more versus less disadvantaged neighborhoods (63% versus 62%, p = 0.44). When stratified by program arm, Black enrollees had lower retention than White enrollees in the app arm (49% versus 55%, p = 0.01), but not in the telephone arm (69% versus 71%, p = 0.12).

Research has shown improvements in discharge planning through system-level approaches that integrate health care and social work. The purpose of this study is to describe the development and implementation of a multidisciplinary team intervention to overcome discharge barriers for patients with prolonged hospitalization. We also evaluated the impact of the intervention on length of stay, readmission rates and care team satisfaction and morale. METHODS: A multidisciplinary discharge coordination team met weekly to proactively raise and resolve patient-related discharge issues for all patients admitted to the general medicine wards. Members included hospitalists, case managers, social workers, hospital finance representatives, and patient representatives. One of the hospital physicians facilitated the meetings. RESULTS: Barriers to discharge included patient and family reluctance to discharge, medical delays in performing diagnostic tests or procedures, long-term care facility acceptance delays, and prolonged wait times for insurance approvals. Our multipronged approach decreased length of stay in our delayed discharge patient population from 15.45 days to 9.04 days, a 41.5% reduction, without an increase in readmissions.

Extensive use of antibiotics by livestock producers promotes the spread of new resistant strains, some of zoonotic concern, which increases food-borne illness in humans and causes significant economic burden on healthcare systems. Furthermore, consumer preferences for meat/poultry/fish produced without the use of antibiotics shape todays market demand. So, it is viewed as inevitable by the One Health Initiative that humans need to reduce the use of antibiotics and turn to alternative, improved means to control disease: vaccination and prophylactics. Besides the intense research focused on novel therapeutic molecules, both these strategies rely heavily on the availability of cost-effective, efficient and scalable production platforms which will allow large-volume manufacturing for vaccines, antibodies and other biopharmaceuticals. Within this context, plant-based platforms for production of recombinant therapeutic proteins offer significant advantages over conventional expression systems, including lack of animal pathogens, low production costs, fast turnaround and response times and rapid, nearly-unlimited scalability. Also, because dried leaves and seeds can be stored at room temperature for lengthy periods without loss of recombinant proteins, plant expression systems have the potential to offer lucrative benefits from the development of edible vaccines and prophylactics, as these would not require cold chain storage and transportation, and could be administered in mass volumes with minimal processing.

In this study, a microchip-based grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonic (GC-FP) assay was used to measure antibody levels that resulted from COVID-19 infection and vaccination. In addition, we measured the relative antibody binding toward antigens from the CoV2 virus variants strains B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta). Antibody levels against multiple antigens within the SARS CoV2 spike protein were significantly elevated for both vaccinated and infected individuals, while those against the nucleocapsid (N) protein were only elevated for infected individuals. GC-FP was effective for monitoring the IgG-based serological response to vaccination throughout the vaccination sequence and also resolved acute (within hours) increases in antibody levels. A significant decrease in antibody binding to antigens from the B.1.351 variant, but not B.1.1.7, was observed for all vaccinated subjects when measured by GC-FP compared to the 2019 SARS CoV2 antigens. These results were corroborated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Collectively, the findings suggest that GC-FP is a viable, rapid, and accurate method for measuring both overall antibody levels to SARS CoV2 and relative antibody binding to viral variants during infection or vaccination.

While hygiene and wearing masks make up a large portion of the currently suggested precautions by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO), social distancing is another and arguably the most important precaution that would protect people since the airborne virus is easily transmitted through the air. Social distancing while walking outside, can be more effective, if pedestrians know locations of each other and even better if they know locations of people who are possible carriers. With this information, they can change their routes depending on the people walking nearby or they can stay away from areas that contain or have recently contained crowds.

These safety bubbles are used with the constant velocity pedestrian model to predict possible future social distancing violations and warn the user with sound and vibration. Moreover, it takes into account the virus staying airborne for a certain time, hence, creating time-decaying non-safe areas in the past trajectories of the users.

RESULTS: Lower adipose tissue ACE2 expression was associated with multiple adverse cardio-metabolic health indices, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) (P = 9.14  10(?6)), obesity status (P = 4.81  10(?5)), higher serum fasting insulin (P = 5.32  10(?4)), BMI (P = 3.94  10(?4)), and lower serum HDL levels (P = 1.92  10(?7)).

However, the remarkable genetic and antigenic variability of the virus, which originate from both mutations and recombination events, represents an unsolved challenge for this disease. The present study reports on the emergence and spread of recombinant clusters detected in Italy and Spain between 2012 and 2014. A total of 36 Spanish and Italian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) field strains were investigated and genetically characterized using phylogenetic, molecular, recombination and selection pressure analyses of the complete S1 gene. Based on the partial S1 sequencing, 27 IBV strains originating from Spain and nine from Italy were initially classified as being closely related to the Guandong/Xindadi (XDN) genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene revealed that the XDN strains formed a homogeneous clade with the Spanish IBV isolates within the QX genotype, whereas there was higher variability within the Italian strains. Recombination analysis determined that these strains belonged to four groups, which originated from independent recombination events between the QX and 793B IBV genotypes. Our data support the hypothesis of two different scenarios: firstly, in Spain, the large and homogeneous clade probably originated from a single offspring of the recombinant founder, which became dominant and spread throughout the country. Secondly, the nine Italian recombinants, which are characterized by three different recombination patterns, probably represent less fitted strains, because they were less viable with respect to their recombinant parents.","output":"A novel variant of the infectious bronchitis virus resulting from recombination events in Italy and Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Formulation of carpooling schemes for mutual cost benefits between the driver and the passengers has a long history.

Conventional diagnostic tools for assessment of rhythm disorders suffer from limited availability, limited test duration time, and usability challenges. There is also a need for out-of-hospital investigation of arrhythmias. Therefore, the Norwegian ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor has been developed to simplify the assessment of heart rhythm disorders. The current study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and usability of the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor compared to conventional Holter monitors. METHODS: Parallel tests with ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor and a Holter monitor were performed in 151 consecutive patients referred for out-of-hospital long-term ECG recording at Sorlandet Hospital Arendal, Norway. All ECG data were automatically analysed by both systems and evaluated by hospital physicians. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire scoring usability parameters after the test. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients (62% men, age 54 (17) years) completed the study. The ECG quality from both monitors was considered satisfactory for rhythm analysis in all patients. AF was identified in 9 (6%) patients during the period with parallel tests. The diagnostic accuracy for automatic AF detection was 95% (95% CI 91C98) for the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor and 81% (95% CI 74C87) for the Holter system. The proportion of false-positive AF was 4% in tests analysed by the ECG247 algorithm and 16% in tests analysed by the Holter algorithm. Other arrhythmias were absent/rare. The system usability score was significantly better for ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor compared to traditional Holter technology (score 87.4 vs. 67.5, p < 0.001).

The one induced by a single lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure is practical. However, whether it is preferable to administer LPS intranasally or intratracheally remains an open question. Herein, female C57Bl/6 J mice were exposed intranasally or intratracheally to one dose of either saline or 3 mg/kg of LPS. They were studied 24 h later. The groups treated with LPS, either intranasally or intratracheally, exhibited a pronounced neutrophilic inflammation, signs of lung tissue damage and protein extravasation into the alveoli, and mild lung dysfunction. The magnitude of the response was generally not different between groups exposed intranasally versus intratracheally. However, the variability of some the responses was smaller in the LPS-treated groups exposed intranasally versus intratracheally. Notably, the saline-treated mice exposed intratracheally demonstrated a mild neutrophilic inflammation and alterations of the airway epithelium. We conclude that an intranasal exposure is as effective as an intratracheal exposure in a murine model of ARDS induced by LPS. Additionally, the groups exposed intranasally demonstrated less variability in the responses to LPS and less complications associated with the sham procedure.","output":"Intranasal versus intratracheal exposure to lipopolysaccharides in a murine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the global outbreak of COVID\\\\19 pandemic, cytokine storm conditions are regarded as the fatal step resulting in most mortality.

BACKGROUND Mounting evidence suggests that the mechanisms of weight loss and the improvement in glucose metabolism seen after LSG are related not only to gastric restriction but also to neurohormonal changes. METHODS : Fasting and postprandial levels at 60 and 120 minutes after a standard test meal of the above peptides and glucose metabolism indices were evaluated in 15 consecutive morbidly obese (MO) subjects before and 6 and 12 months after LSG. As study controls, 15 lean subjects matched for age and sex were also assessed. RESULTS Body mass index values notably decreased at 6 and 12 months (P < 0.01), postoperatively. In addition, an overall improvement of the glycemic profile of MO patients was noted. After LSG, markedly decreased fasting and postprandial levels of ghrelin, amylin, and leptin were observed. A significant postprandial increase of PYY and GLP-1 levels was also noted postoperatively. Interestingly, significantly increased levels of PP were noted only at 60 minutes postprandially after LSG. CONCLUSIONS LSG markedly improved glucose homeostasis and generated significant changes in ghrelin, PP, PYY, GLP-1, amylin, and leptin levels. These multiple hormonal actions may have several beneficial effects on the underlying mechanism of weight loss, demonstrating that LSG could be more than just a restrictive bariatric operation.","output":"Alterations in gut hormones after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: a prospective clinical and laboratory investigational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 75-year-old male presented with acute febrile respiratory illness with hypoxia and anorexia of longer duration; computed tomography (CT) of the thorax was suggestive of cavitary lung disease, with sputum smear positive for acid-fast bacilli and also having classical COVID-19 pneumonia patterns in the CT thorax; and COVID-19 rapid antigen test was positive.

Design: The characteristic, profound pro-inflammatory, hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is manifested by the high severity of illness and extensive organ dysfunction observed in these patients. SF in critically ill patients, although described previously, exhibits a uniquely complex pathogenesis in this population. Patients: Retrospective review of all COVID-19 patients (confirmed positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) admitted to a single surgical ICU for at least 48 hours between March-June 2020. Interventions: Data were extracted from a COVID-19 institutional data repository that harvested data from electronic health records and other clinical data sources. Demographics; coagulation/inflammation biomarkers; number, location, and stage of SF lesions; resource utilization; and outcomes were captured. Measurements and Main Results: 64 patients met inclusion criteria; 51 (80%) developed SF (SF+ ). Forty-three (85%) developed stage 3 or higher SF (2 = 22.66, P < .0001). Thirty-nine of 51 (76%) SF+ patients developed more than one SF lesion (2 = 13.26, P = .0003). SF+ patients manifested a profound pro-inflammatory, hypercoagulable phenotype (lower serum albumin and higher ferritin, interleukin [IL]-6 and D-dimer concentrations [all, P < .001]). Durations of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, and ICU length of stay were significantly longer (all, P < .05) in the SF + patients. Conclusions: The unique characteristics of COVID-19 dermatopathology and the strong correlation between markers of inflammation and development of SF reflect COVID-19-related organ dysfunction and its deleterious effects on the microcirculation. Considering that skin is invaded directly by SARS-CoV-2 and affected by COVID-19-related immune complex deposition and microthrombosis, SF may reflect disease as opposed to pressure injuries related to processes of care.

Recently, epigenetic alterations have been included in the classification of the CRC molecular subtype, and this points out their prognostic impact. As epigenetic modifications are reversible, they may represent relevant therapeutic targets. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), regulates gene expression. For many years, the deregulation of DNA methylation has been considered to play a substantial part in CRC etiology and evolution. Despite considerable advances in CRC treatment, patient therapy response persists as limited, and their profit from systemic therapies are often hampered by the introduction of chemoresistance. In addition, inter-individual changes in therapy response in CRC patients can arise from their specific (epi)genetic compositions. In this review article, we summarize the options of CRC treatment based on DNA methylation status for their predictive value. This review also includes the therapy outcomes based on the patient's methylation status in CRC patients. In addition, the current challenge of research is to develop therapeutic inhibitors of DNMT.

We aimed to measure SpO(2) and heart rate during the first 10 min of life in neonates receiving positive pressure ventilation (PPV) according to the Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) protocol and compare results with SpO(2) and heart rate targets set by the American Heart Association (AHA). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Mulago National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, as a substudy of the NeoSupra Trial. SpO(2) and heart rate were measured on apnoeic neonates (34 weeks) who received PPV according to HBB (room air). Those who remained distressed after PPV received supplemental oxygen (O(2)). All resuscitations were video recorded and data were extracted by video review at 1 min intervals until 10 min post partum. Data were analysed for all observations and separately for only observations before and during PPV. RESULTS: 49 neonates were analysed. Median SpO(2) at 5 min (n=39) was 67% (49C88) with 59% of the observations below AHA target of 80%. At 10 min median SpO(2) (n=44) was 93% (80C97) and 32% were below AHA target of 85%. When only observations before and during PPV were analysed, median SpO(2) at 5 min (n=18) was 52% (34C66) and 83% were below AHA target. At 10 min (n=15), median SpO(2) was 72% (57C89) and 67% were below AHA target. Median heart rates were above AHA target of 100 beats/min at all time intervals. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of neonates resuscitated with PPV after birth failed to reach the AHA SpO(2) target in this small sample, implying an increased risk of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Further studies in low-resource settings are needed to evaluate baseline data and the need for supplemental O(2) and optimal SpO(2) during PPV.

Mechanistically, it results from the immune activation and release of a variety of mediators that give rise to the signs and symptoms of this pathological event. For years, most of the research in anaphylaxis has focused on the contribution of the immune component. However, approaches that shed light on the participation of other cellular and molecular agents are necessary. Among them, the vascular niche receives the various signals (e.g., histamine) that elicit the range of anaphylactic events. Cardiovascular manifestations such as increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, hypotension, vasoconstriction, and cardiac alterations are crucial in the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis and are highly involved to the development of the most severe cases. Specifically, the endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells, and their molecular signaling outcomes play an essential role downstream of the immune reaction. Therefore, in this review, we synthesized the vascular changes observed during anaphylaxis as well as its cellular and molecular components. As the risk of anaphylaxis exists both in clinical procedures and in routine life, increasing our knowledge of the vascular physiology and their molecular mechanism will enable us to improve the clinical management and how to treat or prevent anaphylaxis. KEY MESSAGE: Anaphylaxis, the most severe allergic reaction, involves a variety of immune and non-immune molecular signals that give rise to its pathophysiological manifestations. Importantly, the vascular system is engaged in processes relevant to anaphylactic events such as increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, hypotension, vasoconstriction, and decreased cardiac output. The novelty of this review focuses on the fact that new studies will greatly improve the understanding of anaphylaxis when viewed from a vascular molecular angle and specifically from the endothelium. This knowledge will improve therapeutic options to treat or prevent anaphylaxis.","output":"Pathophysiological, Cellular, and Molecular Events of the Vascular System in Anaphylaxis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the dynamics of new generation threats have deeply influenced the economic stability in several areas of the world, especially with the onset of the Covid-19 health crisis.

By contrasting changing consumer behavior with the actions taken by local retailers, we assess whether the current pandemic is potentially a catalyst for e-commerce in Belgium. We do this based on a newly constructed framework of e-retail accessibility, as the differences between online and physical retail require a revision of the traditional economic geographical perspective on retail performance as introduced by Christaller (1933). We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic holds ample opportunities for an increase in the three components of e-retail accessibility, but that a lack of professionalism might prevent traditional local retailers to retain a share of the expanded online market.

There are three key SARS-CoV-2 enzymes potentially targetable with antivirals: papain-like protease (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Of these, PLpro is an especially attractive target because it plays an essential role in several viral replication processes, including cleavage and maturation of viral polyproteins, assembly of the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC), and disruption of host viral response machinery to facilitate viral proliferation and replication. Moreover, this enzyme is conserved across different coronaviruses and promising inhibitors have already been discovered for its SARS-CoV variant. Here we report a substantive body of structural, biochemical, and virus replication studies that identify several inhibitors of the enzyme from SARS-CoV-2 in both wild-type and mutant forms. These efforts include the first structures of wild-type PLpro, the active site C111S mutant, and their complexes with inhibitors, determined at 1.60C2.70 Angstroms. This collection of structures provides fundamental molecular and mechanistic insight to PLpro, and critically, illustrates details for inhibitors recognition and interactions. All presented compounds inhibit the peptidase activity of PLpro in vitro, and some molecules block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture assays.

This study aims to explore the psychological state of residents of Hainan Island and its influencing factors during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide a scientific basis for the formulation of psychological counseling measures to be used after the pandemic. We used the nonprobability snowball sampling method to conduct an online survey from February 21 to February 28, 2020, and collected a sample of 533 respondents. Using a binary logistic regression model and network analysis, the psychological state of residents and the main factors were analyzed during the concentrated outbreak of COVID-19 (from January 20 to February 16, 2020). The study found that during the pandemic, 92.7% of the respondents were in a poor state of mind, and 54.2% experienced severe psychological stress. The mental state is spatially expressed as a pattern of high in the middle and low in the surroundings. Second, within the four-week sample, the overall psychological tension showed an inverted U-shaped trend. Respondents feeling stressed were most common in the second week, when they accounted for 87.99% of the total. Third, individual characteristics such as gender, age, fixed expenditure, and family size significantly affect the mental state. Women, the elderly, residents with fixed expenditures, and residents with large families are at greater risk of psychological stress. Finally, external factors such as the distance between residents and the location of cases and the node degree of the pandemic transmission network have a significant impact on the psychological state. However, residents in the least developed areas of Hainan Island, which are far away from active cases and have a low node degree, are more prone to psychological pressure.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, public health measures imposed to reduce viral transmission resulted in large-scale loss of work during the early stages of the pandemic, contributing to declined mental and physical health. As the pandemic unfolded, the Australian economy began to recover and some people could return to work, whilst localised lockdowns resulted in further loss of work for others. The long-term health effects of work loss remain unexplored within the COVID-19 pandemic context, in addition to whether any health effects are persistent upon returning to work. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 2603 participants across Australia monitored changes in health and work between March and December 2020, with participants completing surveys at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months later. Outcomes described psychological distress, and mental and physical health. Linear mixed regression models examined associations between changes in health and experiences of work loss, and return to work, over time. RESULTS: Losing work during the early stages of the pandemic was associated with long-term poorer mental health, which began to recover over time as some returned to work. Physical health deteriorated over time, greater for people not working at baseline. Being out of work was associated with poorer mental health, but better physical health. These effects were larger for people that had recently lost work than for people with sustained work loss, and retaining employment played a protective role. Generally, returning to work resulted in poorer physical health and improvements in mental health, although this depended on the broader context of changes in work. CONCLUSIONS: Work cessation during the pandemic led to poor health outcomes and had long-lasting effects. Returning to work benefits mental health but may reduce physical activity in the short-term. We encourage the provision of accessible mental health supports and services immediately following loss of work, and for people with prolonged forms of work loss.

CHIKV is an enveloped virus belonging to the Togaviridae family and enters its host cell primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Upon internalization, the endocytic vesicle containing the virus particle moves through the cell and delivers the virus to early endosomes where membrane fusion is observed. Thereafter, the nucleocapsid dissociates and the viral RNA is translated into proteins. In this study, we examined the importance of the microtubule network during the early steps of infection and dissected the intracellular trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles during cell entry. We observed two distinct CHIKV intracellular trafficking patterns prior to membrane hemifusion. Whereas half of the CHIKV virions remained static during cell entry and fused in the cell periphery, the other half showed fast-directed microtubule-dependent movement prior to delivery to Rab5-positive early endosomes and predominantly fused in the perinuclear region of the cell. Disruption of the microtubule network reduced the number of infected cells. At these conditions, membrane hemifusion activity was not affected yet fusion was restricted to the cell periphery. Furthermore, follow-up experiments revealed that disruption of the microtubule network impairs the delivery of the viral genome to the cell cytosol. We therefore hypothesize that microtubules may direct the particle to a cellular location that is beneficial for establishing infection or aids in nucleocapsid uncoating. Author Summary Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus that is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Disease symptoms can include fever, rash, myalgia, and long-lasting debilitating joint pains. Unfortunately, there is currently no licensed vaccine or antiviral treatment available to combat CHIKV. Understanding the virus:host interactions during the replication cycle of the virus is crucial for the development of effective antiviral therapies. In this study we elucidated the trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles early in infection. During cell entry, CHIKV virions require an intact microtubule network for efficient delivery of the viral genome into the host cell thereby increasing the chance to productively infect a cell.","output":"Chikungunya virus requires an intact microtubule network for efficient viral genome delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES The modified double-stapling technique (DST) with vertical division of the rectum(IO-DST) has been reported as a feasible and safe procedure for performing low anastomosis during rectal cancer surgery. In this procedure, an endostapler was vertically used, instead of using a horizontally orientated linear stapler, when dividing the rectum. A previous study reported that this technique is useful for treating patients with a narrow pelvis and/or performing a very low anastomosis. METHODS The use of IO-DST anastomosis during anterior resection(AR) and low anterior resection was performed on 80 cases of rectal cancer between April 1998 and June 2004 at our institution. We reviewed those cases and evaluated the leakage rate. RESULTS We found that leakage occurred in six cases (7.5%); however, leakage was not found in cases of AR or cases with a preserved left colic artery (LCA).

However, influenza vaccination rates in the U.S. remain below public health targets and persistent structural inequities reduce the likelihood that Black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Latina/o, Asian groups, and populations of low socioeconomic status will receive the influenza vaccine. METHODS: We analyzed correlates of influenza vaccination rates using the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in the year 2020. Our analysis compared influenza vaccination as the outcome of interest with the variables age, sex, race, education, income, geographic location, health insurance status, access to primary care, history of delaying care due to cost, and comorbidities such as: asthma, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, body mass index, cancer and diabetes. RESULTS: Non-Hispanic White (46.5%) and Asian (44.1%) participants are more likely to receive the influenza vaccine compared to Non-Hispanic Black (36.7%), Hispanic (33.9%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (36.6%), and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (37.9%) participants.

Recent research on home telemonitoring demonstrated benefits concerning the capacity, patient empowerment, and treatment commitment of health care systems. Moreover, for some diseases, it revealed significant improvement in clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, when policy makers and practitioners decide whether to scale-up a technology-based health intervention from a research study to mainstream care delivery, it is essential to assess other relevant domains, such as its feasibility to be expanded under real-world conditions. Therefore, scalability assessment is critical, and it encompasses multiple domains to ensure population-wide access to the benefits of the growing technological potential for home telemonitoring services in health care. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to identify the domains and methods used in peer-reviewed research studies that assess the scalability of home telemonitoringCbased interventions under real-world conditions. METHODS: The authors followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines and used multiple databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EconLit). An integrative synthesis of the eligible studies was conducted to better explore each intervention and summarize relevant information concerning the target audience, intervention duration and setting, and type of technology. Each study design was classified based on the strength of its evidence. Lastly, the authors conducted narrative and thematic analyses to identify the domains, and qualitative and quantitative methods used to support scalability assessment. RESULTS: This review evaluated 13 articles focusing on the potential of scaling up a home telemonitoring intervention. Most of the studies considered the following domains relevant for scalability assessment: problem (13), intervention (12), effectiveness (13), and costs and benefits (10). Although cost-effectiveness was the most common evaluation method, the authors identified seven additional cost analysis methods to evaluate the costs. Other domains were less considered, such as the sociopolitical context (2), workforce (4), and technological infrastructure (3). Researchers used different methodological approaches to assess the effectiveness, costs and benefits, fidelity, and acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that when assessing scalability, researchers select the domains specifically related to the intervention while ignoring others related to the contextual, technological, and environmental factors, which are also relevant. Additionally, studies report using different methods to evaluate the same domain, which makes comparison difficult. Future work should address research on the minimum required domains to assess the scalability of remote telemonitoring services and suggest methods that allow comparison among studies to provide better support to decision makers during large-scale implementation.","output":"Domains and Methods Used to Assess Home Telemonitoring Scalability: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evans syndrome (ES) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by autoimmune hemolytic anemia along with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

This study evaluated anxiety symptom severity and associations with appetitive traits in students at a large public University in the U.S. during the pandemic. METHODS: Current undergraduate and graduate/professional students completed a cross-sectional survey in fall 2020. Demographic information, anxiety symptoms in the past 2 weeks assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and appetitive traits assessed by the Adult Eating Behavior Questionnaire (AEBQ) were evaluated. Mean scores for eight AEBQ scales (four food approach and four food avoidance traits) were calculated. Differences in mean scores were examined between participants with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score &#8805; 10) and those with mild to no anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score < 10) via independent samples t-tests and effect sizes. Associations between GAD-7 score and individual appetitive traits were also examined, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: Of the 1243 students who completed the survey (57% undergraduates; mean age = 26.5 years), 51.9% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Groups experiencing the highest degree of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms included transgender, gender fluid, and other-gendered participants (73.6%); the youngest age group [18-20 years (62%)]; undergraduate students (60.7%); and Hispanic/Latinx participants (57.7%). Participants with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms had higher scores for most food approach and avoidance traits but lower scores for enjoyment of food than those with mild to no anxiety symptoms. Effect sizes were largest for hunger and emotional over-eating (Cohen's d = 0.31 and 0.30, respectively). Adjusting for age and gender, GAD-7 score was significantly and positively associated with hunger, emotional over-eating, food and satiety responsiveness, and food fussiness and negatively associated with enjoyment of food. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of students at a U.S. University reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms during COVID-19. More severe anxiety symptoms were associated with increased hunger, emotional over-eating, and food and satiety responsiveness and decreased enjoyment of food.

The purpose of this study was to determine the distinctions among patients with COVID-19 by comparing the imaging findings of patients with suspected confirmed COVID-19 and those of patients initially suspected to have COVID-19 who were ultimately negative for the disease. METHODS: 28 isolated suspected in-patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective study from January 22, 2020 to February 6, 2020. 12 patients were confirmed to have positive severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA results, and 16 patients had negative results. The thin-section CT imaging findings and clinical and laboratory data of all the patients were evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 12 confirmed COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2-positive) patients and 16 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients in epidemiology and most of the clinical features or laboratory data. The CT images showed that the incidence of pure/mixed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) was not different between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients [9/12 (75.0%) vs 10/16 (62.5%), p = 0.687], but pure/mixed GGOs in the peripheral were more common in patients with COVID-19 [11/12 (91.7%) vs 6/16 (37.5%), p = 0.006].

Here, we examine the effect of mitigation strategies on reducing the risk of exposure to simulated respiratory aerosol particles within a classroom-style meeting room. To quantify exposure of uninfected individuals (Recipients), surrogate respiratory aerosol particles were generated by a breathing simulator with a headform (Source) that mimicked breath exhalations. Recipients, represented by three breathing simulators with manikin headforms, were placed in a meeting room and affixed with optical particle counters to measure 0.3C3 m aerosol particles. Universal masking of all breathing simulators with a 3-ply cotton mask reduced aerosol exposure by 50% or more compared to scenarios with simulators unmasked. While evaluating the effect of Source placement, Recipients had the highest exposure at 0.9 m in a face-to-face orientation. Ventilation reduced exposure by approximately 5% per unit increase in air change per hour (ACH), irrespective of whether increases in ACH were by the HVAC system or portable HEPA air cleaners. The results demonstrate that mitigation strategies, such as universal masking and increasing ventilation, reduce personal exposure to respiratory aerosols within a meeting room.

DESIGN Observational study. SETTING Population-based study of 114 countries. PARTICIPANTS General population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES For each country, we extracted: (1) the maximum rate of COVID-19 incidence increase per 100,000 population over any 5-day moving average period since the first 100 confirmed cases; (2) the maximum 14-day cumulative incidence rate since the first case; (3) the incidence and mortality within 30 days since the first case and first COVID-19-related death, respectively. We retrieved the 13 country-specific International Health Regulations capacities and constructed linear regression models to examine whether these capacities were associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, controlling for the Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Product, the population density, the Global Health Security index, prior exposure to SARS/MERS and Stringency Index. RESULTS Countries with higher International Health Regulations score were significantly more likely to have lower incidence ( coefficient -24, 95% CI -35 to -13) and mortality ( coefficient -1.7, 95% CI -2.5 to -1.0) per 100,000 population within 30 days since the first COVID-19 diagnosis. A similar association was found for the other incidence outcomes. Analysis using different regression models controlling for various confounders showed a similarly significant association. CONCLUSIONS The International Health Regulations score was significantly associated with reduction in rate of incidence and mortality of COVID-19. These findings inform design of pandemic control strategies, and validated the International Health Regulations capacities as important metrics for countries that warrant evaluation and improvement of their health security capabilities.","output":"The potential effectiveness of the WHO International Health Regulations capacity requirements on control of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study of 114 countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 continues to alter our way of living and dying.

On the modern tourist market, there are many negative phenomena that significantly affect the functioning of urban tourist destinations but primarily have an impact on the decisions of potential tourists about choosing cities as a tourist destination. These phenomena pose a threat to the development of both cities and tourism. They are conditioned by endogenous factors, which result from the functioning of the city, and exogenous ones, i.e., those related to socio-economic relations of the city with the environment, including tourist traffic. Cities, as a destination or transit tourist destination, are characterized by high concentrations of tourist traffic; hence the negative phenomena often affect urban tourist space with great intensity. The aim of this study is to identify threats affecting the possibility of shaping sustainable tourism in urban destinations. In the following parts, theseissues will be presented: urban tourism, sustainable tourism, classification and characterization of threats related to the sustainable development of urban tourism, along with empirical illustration of selected phenomena, after presenting the concept of sustainable urban tourism development policy.

In the context of a sociopolitically critical view of psychoanalytic theory and practice, I will reflect on what it means to keep conducting business as usual in an era where movements like Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, as well as the health inequities that became apparent due to the Covid\\\\19 pandemic are clear warning signs that our world is deeply troubled by injustice. I will argue that psychoanalytic theory and practice is not immune from this injustice.

Full participation of children with disabilities in daily activities creates optimal opportunities for learning and development. Previous studies have focused primarily on proxy ratings of participation of children with intellectual disabilities in daily activities. However, little is known about how the children rate barriers and facilitators to their participation in everyday activities. OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers to and facilitators for everyday activities as experienced by children with intellectual disabilities from low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries. The research questions were as follows: what barriers to participation do children with disabilities experience in everyday activities? and what facilitators to participation do children with disabilities experience in everyday activities? METHOD: A qualitative content analyses was used in this study, and individual interviews were conducted with 49 children with intellectual disabilities. The interviews were performed using pictures. The children also selected the most important activities and described in their own words the facilitators and barriers relevant to being able to perform the activities. RESULTS: The most important activities were organised leisure activities, formal learning at school, taking care of other family members and family mealtimes. Self-reported barriers identified were personal functioning, social exclusion and lack of resources. The identified facilitators included satisfaction, personal capability, being included and having access to resources.

People have little information about SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus). Internet has become a frequently used tool to obtain information in recent years, while YouTube is one of the popular sources of information with many videos on its platform. This study aims to identify the topics regarding Coronavirus that people learned about on YouTube. The videos about Coronavirus were also evaluated in terms of the reliability of their source of information. METHODS: In total, 160 videos on Coronavirus that had 500,000 or more views were analysed. The latent Dirichlet allocation method was used in the process of identifying the topics that were then compared in terms of video parameters. The reliability of the source of information provided by videos was assessed with a modified DISCERN tool. RESULTS: A proportion of 15.6 % of these videos had a scientific content, while 45 % of these videos were about the process entailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of video reliability, the difference between video types was found to be significant; videos with scientific content had more reliable sources of information (p<0.001).

To promote public adherence to these regimes, governments need to understand the public perceptions and attitudes toward NPI regimes and the factors that influence them. Twitter data offer a means to capture these insights. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries and compare the trends in public perceptions and attitudes toward NPIs across these countries. The aim is to identify factors that influenced public perceptions and attitudes about NPI regimes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed 777,869 English language tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was assessed using a Pearson correlation analysis. Topic modeling was used to isolate tweets about NPIs. A comparative analysis of NPIs between countries was conducted. RESULTS: The proportion of NPI-related topics, relative to all topics, varied between countries. The New Zealand data set displayed the greatest attention to NPIs, and the US data set showed the lowest. The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was statistically significant only for Australia (r=0.837, P<.001) and New Zealand (r=0.747, P<.001). Topic modeling produced 131 topics related to one of 22 NPIs, grouped into seven NPI categories: Personal Protection (n=15), Social Distancing (n=9), Testing and Tracing (n=10), Gathering Restrictions (n=18), Lockdown (n=42), Travel Restrictions (n=14), and Workplace Closures (n=23). While less restrictive NPIs gained widespread support, more restrictive NPIs were perceived differently across countries. Four characteristics of these regimes were seen to influence public adherence to NPIs: timeliness of implementation, NPI campaign strategies, inconsistent information, and enforcement strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter offers a means to obtain timely feedback about the public response to COVID-19 NPI regimes. Insights gained from this analysis can support government decision making, implementation, and communication strategies about NPI regimes, as well as encourage further discussion about the management of NPI programs for global health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Public Perceptions and Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Nonpharmaceutical Interventions Across Six Countries: A Topic Modeling Analysis of Twitter Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to evaluate the condition of food security before and during the new normal in Meduran Village Blimbing Village Malang City.

There is substantial research on the events surrounding ED visits, and subsequent hospitalizatons, by hospice patients. It is important however to understand that these hospital arrivals often begin with an ambulance response to the home. Emergency medical services (EMS) responses to hospice patients have been less well-studied. We conducted a retrospective study of 170 consecutive electronic patient care reports produced contemporaneously by EMS providers in several US counties during the normal course of their responses to hospice patients. We summarized descriptive epidemiology of the patients and of the incidents, and we explored the provider narratives for recurring themes. To our knowledge this is the first study to explore the contemporaneously-documented on-scene circumstances of pre-hospital care for patients enrolled in a hospice program. The median patient age was 76. Cancer, chronic lung disease, and heart failure were the most common hospice-qualifying diagnoses. Transportation of the patient from the scene occurred in 111 cases (65.3%). Consistent with previous studies based on interviews of EMS providers, the most common chief complaints included pain, dyspnea, and altered mental status. EMS was frequently called for confirmation of death, a finding not previously reported. Transitions of care, such as from curative medical care to hospice care, and from hospital to home, were a recurring theme. Gaps in care around these transitions were often evident, with EMS being called upon to fill them. Care transitions around weekends were prominent. Also emerging from the narratives was the concept that hospice enrollment is not a single event but rather a step-wise process; we developed a preliminary coding taxonomy to classify those enrollment stages. The hospice-EMS interface can be complex. Although all care by EMS providers is with the literal or implied consent of the patient, the arrival of an ambulance to a scene where emotions are running high carries a certain momentum and could lead to a cascade of interventions that, in retrospect and given other options, the patient may not have wanted. A better understanding of the hospice-EMS interface might illuminate changes that could be made to improve it, with a goal of ensuring that hospice patients and their families receive emergency medical services when they need and can benefit from them but receive other, non-EMS, services when those are more suitable to their needs. It might also improve the efficiency of an already overburdened EMS system.","output":"EMS responses to hospice patients: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza is often complicated by bacterial pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx and invade the middle ear and/or lung epithelium.

Animal models and kinetic models have improved our understanding of how influenza viruses interact with their bacterial co-pathogens and the accompanying immune responses. Data from these models indicate that considerable alterations in epithelial surfaces and aberrant immune responses lead to severe inflammation, a key driver of bacterial acquisition and infection severity following influenza. However, further experimental and analytical studies are essential to determining the full mechanistic spectrum of different viral and bacterial strains and species and to finding new ways to prevent and treat influenza-associated bacterial coinfections.

We aimed to determine to what extent Australian health and medical funders incentivise responsible research practices. METHODS: We conducted an audit of instructions from research grant and fellowship schemes. Eight national research grants and fellowships were purposively sampled to select schemes that awarded the largest amount of funds. The funding scheme instructions were assessed against 9 criteria to determine to what extent they incentivised these responsible research and reporting practices: (1) publicly register study protocols before starting data collection, (2) register analysis protocols before starting data analysis, (3) make study data openly available, (4) make analysis code openly available, (5) make research materials openly available, (6) discourage use of publication metrics, (7) conduct quality research (e.g. adhere to reporting guidelines), (8) collaborate with a statistician, and (9) adhere to other responsible research practices. Each criterion was answered using one of the following responses: Instructed, Encouraged, or No mention. RESULTS: Across the 8 schemes from 5 funders, applicants were instructed or encouraged to address a median of 4 (range 0 to 5) of the 9 criteria. Three criteria received no mention in any scheme (register analysis protocols, make analysis code open, collaborate with a statistician). Importantly, most incentives did not seem strong as applicants were only instructed to register study protocols, discourage use of publication metrics and conduct quality research. Other criteria were encouraged but were not required. CONCLUSIONS: Funders could strengthen the incentives for responsible research practices by requiring grant and fellowship applicants to implement these practices in their proposals. Administering institutions could be required to implement these practices to be eligible for funding. Strongly rewarding researchers for implementing robust research practices could lead to sustained improvements in the quality of health and medical research.

We studied the relationships between these indices, level of hypnosis (BIS level), and antinociception (predicted remifentanil effect-site concentrations, CeREMI) before and after stimulation. Also, we measured their association with movement in response to a noxious stimulus. METHODS We randomized 120 patients to one of 12 groups targeting different hypnotic levels (BIS 70, 50, and 30) and various CeREMI (0, 2, 4, or 6 ng/mL). At pseudo-steady state, baseline values were observed, and a series of stimuli were applied. Changes in BIS, CVI, heart rate (HR), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) between baseline and response period were analyzed in relation to level of hypnosis, antinociception, and somatic response to the stimuli. RESULTS CVI and BIS more accurately correlate with somatic response to an Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation-noxious stimulation than HR, MAP, CeREMI, and propofol effect-site concentration (Tukey post hoc tests P < 0.01). Change in CVI is more adequate to monitor response to stimulation than changes in BIS, HR, or MAP (as described by the Mathews Correlation Coefficient with significance level set at P < 0.001). In contrast, none of the candidate analgesic state indices was uniquely related to a specific opioid concentration and is extensively influenced by the hypnotic state as measured by BIS.

While transfer learning has garnered considerable attention in medical image analysis, its use for clinical non-image data is not well studied. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review was to explore the use of transfer learning for non-image data in the clinical literature. Methods and Findings We systematically searched medical databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL) for peer-reviewed clinical studies that used transfer learning on human non-image data. We included 83 studies in the review. More than half of the studies (63%) were published within 12 months of the search. Transfer learning was most often applied to time series data (61%), followed by tabular data (18%), audio (12%) and text (8%). Thirty-three (40%) studies applied an image-based model to non-image data after transforming data into images (e.g. spectrograms). Twenty-nine (35%) studies did not have any authors with a health-related affiliation. Many studies used publicly available datasets (66%) and models (49%), but fewer shared their code (27%). Conclusions In this scoping review, we have described current trends in the use of transfer learning for non-image data in the clinical literature.

AKI patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) likely have a greater mortality risk. Our aim was to describe outcomes of AKI patients who required RRT among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from a large diverse population in Southern California. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients with AKI requiring RRT defined as conventional hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy, or both, within Kaiser Permanente Southern California in the period of 3/14/2020 through 9/30/2020. We collected information on patient characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory values, RRT modality, mortality, and post hospitalization RRT requirements. A total of 167 COVID-19 patients, median age 62 years (range 2592), had AKI requiring RRT. Overall, 114 (68%) patients died during the hospitalization, with a median of 8 days on RRT (range 1-83). Fifty-six (49.1%) patients expired within 7 days of initiating RRT, 87 (76.3%) within 14 days, and 106 (93.0%) within 30 days. Highest mortality rates were observed among AKI RRT patients with baseline eGFR >60 (75.2%), compared to 64% and 39% among patients with eGFR 30-59 and <30 ml/min respectively. Among patients who survived and no longer required dialysis, the mean number of inpatient RRT days was 21 (SD 16). Upon discharge from the hospital 29/53 (54.7%) patients continued to require RRT on an outpatient basis. Among COVID-19 patients hospitalized with AKI requiring RRT, patient survival was low (32%). For patients who survived, more than half continued to be dialysis dependent. Given our findings and as COVID treatment continues to evolve, we hope to elucidate additional factors that may impact AKI and survival in COVID-19 patients.","output":"152 Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 and Acute Kidney Injury Requiring Renal Replacement Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to detect and respond to varying oxygen tension is an essential prerequisite to life. Several mechanisms regulate the cellular response to oxygen including the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)/factor inhibiting HIF (FIH)-hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway, cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) dioxygenase (ADO) system, and the lysine-specific demethylases (KDM) 5A and KDM6A. Using a systems-based approach we discuss the literature on oxygen sensing pathways in the context of virus replication in different tissues that experience variable oxygen tension. Current information supports a model where the PHD-HIF pathway enhances the replication of viruses infecting tissues under low oxygen, however, the reverse is true for viruses with a selective tropism for higher oxygen environments. Differences in oxygen tension and associated HIF signaling may play an important role in viral tropism and pathogenesis. Thus, pharmaceutical agents that modulate HIF activity could provide novel treatment options for viral infections and associated pathological conditions.","output":"Oxygen Sensing and Viral Replication: Implications for Tropism and Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This manuscript explores intersubjectivity through a conceptual construct for meaning-making that emphasizes three major interrelated elementsCmeaning making in interaction, making meaning with the body as well as the mind, and meaning making within an open dynamic system.

Whether ambient air pollutants increase the risk of common acute respiratory infections among adults is uncertain, yet this may help understand whether pollutants influence spread of pandemic respiratory infections like COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between ambient air pollutant exposures and respiratory infections in adults. METHODS: During five study examinations over 12 years, 6536 participants in the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) reported upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, pneumonia or febrile illness in the preceding 2 weeks. Using a validated spatiotemporal model, we estimated residential concentrations of ambient PM2.5, NOx and NO2 for the 2-6 weeks (short-term) and year (long-term) prior to each examination. RESULTS: In this population aged 44-84 years at baseline, 10%-32% of participants reported a recent respiratory infection, depending on month of examination and study region. PM2.5, NOx and NO2 concentrations over the prior 2-6 weeks were associated with increased reporting of recent respiratory infection, with risk ratios (95% CIs) of 1.04 (1.00 to 1.09), 1.15 (1.10 to 1.20) and 1.21 (1.10 to 1.33), respectively, per increase from 25th to 75th percentile in residential pollutant concentration. CONCLUSION: Higher short-term exposure to PM2.5 and traffic-related pollutants are associated with increased risk of symptomatic acute respiratory infections among adults. These findings may provide an insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19.","output":"Ambient air pollution and risk of respiratory infection among adults: evidence from the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In many settings, health care service provision has been modified to managing COVID-19 cases, and this has been affecting the provision of maternal and child health services. The aim of this study was to assess trends in selected maternal and child health services performance in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional data review was conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from April to May 2021. Routine health management information system database was reviewed from Addis Ababa Health Bureau for the period from July 2019 to March 2021 across all quarters. Proportions and mean with standard deviations were computed. T-test was used to assess statistically significant differences in services mean performance. Results PNC visit, new contraceptives accepters, safe abortion care and number of under-five years old children treated for pneumonia significantly decreased by 9.3% (p-value 0.04), 20.3% (p-value 0.004), 23.7% (p-value 0.01) and 77.2% (P-value < 0.001), respectively during the first eight months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the previous eight months average performance. The trends in ANC first visit, new contraceptive accepters, pentavalent-3 vaccination and under-five children treated for pneumonia began to decline between January-March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic began;with accelerated declines between April-June 2020 following national lockdown. The trends for the stated services began to increase during July-September 2020, during the last quarter of national lockdown. Contraceptive accepters and pentavalent-1 vaccination continued to decline and showed no recovery until January-March 2021when this study was completed. Conclusions Most of the maternal and child health services performance declined following the onset of COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown, and most of the services began recovering during July-September 2020, the last quarter of national lockdown. However, new and repeat contraceptive accepters and pentavalent-1 recipients continue to decline and show no recovery during end of the study period. Implementing COVID-19 prevention measures and assuring the community about the safety of service delivery is imperative to ensure continuity of the maternal and child health services. Regular monitoring and evaluation of services performance is required to identify slowly recovering services and respond to potentially volatile changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Assessment of Maternal and Child Health Care Services Performance in The Context of COVID-19 Pandemic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: Evidence From Routine Service Data (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most widely used test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a PCR test. PCR has very high sensitivity and is able to detect very low amounts of RNA. However, many individuals receiving a positive test result in a context of a PCR-based surveillance might be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but they are not contagious at the time of the test. The question arises regards if the cost effective, portable rapid antigen tests (RATs) have a better performance than PCR in identification of infectious individuals. In this direction, we examined the diagnostic performance of RATs from 14 different manufacturers in 400 clinical samples with known rRT-PCR cycles threshold (cT) and 50 control samples. Substantial variability was observed in the limit of detection (LOD) of different RATs (cT = 26.8C34.7). The fluorescence-based RAT exhibited a LOD of cT = 34.7. The use of the most effective RATs leads to true positive rates (sensitivities) of 99.1% and 90.9% for samples with cT  30 and cT  33, respectively, percentages that can guarantee a sensitivity high enough to identify contagious patients.

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study of 2003 consecutive patients (4006 eyes) who underwent ISBCS under topical anesthesia from January 2019 to December 2019. METHODS All charts were retrospectively reviewed. Outcome measures included intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative uncorrected (UCVA) and pinhole (PHVA) visual acuities, and autorefraction measurements. RESULTS 1218 (60.8%) female and 785 (39.2%) male patients with a mean age of 74  8 years old had a mean preoperative visual acuity of 0.503 LogMAR (Snellen 20/63). The mean axial length was 23.53  1.37 mm. The majority of eyes had monofocal intraocular lenses (IOL) implanted (n=3738, 93.3%) followed by toric (n=226, 5.6%), multifocal (n=25, 0.6%), and multifocal toric (n=17, 0.4%) IOLs. Intraoperative complications included 14 (0.3%) posterior capsule ruptures with 5 (0.1%) requiring sulcus IOL placement, and 7 (0.2%) partial zonulysis, with 3 requiring capsular tension rings (0.07%). There were no cases of endophthalmitis or toxic anterior segment syndrome.

Materials that are commonly applied to face masks are modeled to generate two different virtual masks with various levels of filtration efficiency, and the leakage percentages through the unsealed nose and cheek areas were set to 11% and 25%, respectively. The droplet propagation distance was simulated with and without mask wearing in still and windy conditions involving head wind, tail wind, and side wind. The results demonstrate that wearing a face mask reduces the transmittance distance of droplets by about 90%C95% depending on the mask type; nonetheless, the droplets can be transmitted to distances of 20C25 cm in the forward direction even with mask-wearing.

Instead of the many hundreds of cases, hospitalisation and deaths expected, there were only 150 cases nationwide with15% hospitalised but no one in ICU and no deaths. This result is a complete reversal of the gap and was due to the outstanding Indigenous leadership, that governments at all levels listened to Aboriginal wisdom and that control was handed to those who knew what to do. This result is not only evidence for why a Voice enshrined in the Constitution would work, it heralds a new way of working with Aboriginal people in Australia. This viewpoint makes the case for a different model to engage and empower First Nations to really close the gap \\\\ themselves.","output":"Australian First Nations response to the pandemic: A dramatic reversal of the gap"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salmonella Typhi is a Gram-negative pathogen that causes typhoid fever in humans. The use of antibiotics to treat typhoid has considerably mitigated its fatality risk, but rising multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) resistance in Pakistan threatens effective treatment. This study determined the prevalence of MDR and XDR S. Typhi at a local hospital in Lahore. Blood samples (n = 3000) were obtained and processed for bacterial identification. Antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using VITEK(?) 2 Compound 30 System. Statistical data analysis was performed using a MannCWhitney U and KruskalCWallis H test, respectively. The results revealed 600 positive cultures, of which the majority were found to be XDR S. Typhi (46.1%) and MDR S. Typhi (24.5%) strains. The disease burden of resistant Salmonella strains was greater in males (60.67%) than females (39.33%), with the most affected age group being 0C10 years old (70.4 %). In both the outpatient department (OPD) and general ward, the prevalence of XDR S. Typhi cases was found to be alarmingly high (48.24%), followed by MDR S. Typhi (25.04 %). The results of the statistical analysis demonstrated that the incidence of resistance in MDR and XDR S. Typhi strains was not affected by the age as well as the gender of patients (p > 0.05). The occurrence of resistant strains against four tested antibiotics (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and meropenem) was found to be similar in different wards and among hospitalized and OPD patients (p > 0.05). Maximum resistance was observed against chloramphenicol and ampicillin in the OPD and pediatric ward. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was observed to be the most effective antibiotic, followed by co-amoxiclav (p < 0.001). This study is effective in validating the existence of MDR and XDR S.

Most common psychiatric manifestations include delirium, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Long-COVID non-syndromal presentations include brain-fogginess, autonomic instability, fatigue, and insomnia. SUMMARY: SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger prior vulnerabilities based on the priming of microglia and other cells, induced or perpetuated by aging and mental and physical illnesses. COVID-19 could further induce priming of neuroimmunological substrates leading to exacerbated immune response and autoimmunity targeting structures in the central nervous system (CNS), in response to minor immune activating environmental exposures, including stress, minor infections, allergens, pollutants, and traumatic brain injury.","output":"Biological and Psychological Factors Determining Neuropsychiatric Outcomes in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Antiviral activities of a recombinant feline interferon (rFeIFN) KT-80 were evaluated against feline enteropathogenic viruses in feline and canine cell lines.

We report our experience of managing a subset of AIS patients with extracranial vascular stenting/angioplasty and intracranial revascularization. METHODS Consecutive patients who presented at three centers with AIS from tandem vascular occlusions confirmed by brain and neck CT imaging were included in the study. We retrospectively analyzed the patient demographics, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at the time of admission, treatment strategy, angiographic results using the Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score, and clinical and imaging follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients were included. The mean NIHSS score at admission was 18. Extracranial carotid occlusions with a concomitant middle cerebral artery occlusion were seen in 89.3% of patients (n=25) and vertebral artery combined with basilar artery lesions in 10.7% (n=3). An antegrade approach (ie, treatment of the extracranial lesion first) was used in 24 patients (85.7%). Proximal occlusion recanalization was achieved usually with a stent (n=27; 96.4%). Pursuant to intracranial revascularization techniques,  TICI 2A recanalization was seen in 96.4% of patients. An mRS score of  2 at 90 days was achieved in 56.5% of patients. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows preliminary data from three centers on recanalization of tandem occlusions in patients presenting with AIS. There was a preference to revascularize the proximal occlusion using a stent followed by distal recanalization with mechanical thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis or a combination of these.

We report on the implementation of a telemedicine program for the evaluation and treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases (1). Objectives: The aim of the study is to evaluate telemedicine as a viable approach for routine follow-up and management of rheumatic disease. Methods: Sixty-six patients were evaluated online by the remote rheumatologist in four weeks. The population of rheumatology patients was evaluated using a IARPLUS platform Information collected included demographic information consisting of age, gender, and primary rheumatologic diagnosis. Results: The average age of patients who were seen was 54 years and 85% of patients were women. The most common disorders included rheumatoid arthritis (22, 33%), axial spondyloarthropathies (7, 11%), and psoriatic arthritis (15,23%), systemic sclerosis (13, 20%), lupus (6, 9%), UCTD (2,3%), Sjogren and fibromyalgia (1, 1.5%). Results: All patients were given recommendations on COVID-19 vaccine administration. Therapy was remodeled in 13 patients (in particular in 5 patients with anemia intravenous iron infusion was scheduled;1 started immunosuppressant therapy for proteinuria, 4 increased methotrexate for disease activity, 2 discontinued Methotrexate for adverse events (hypertransaminasemia), 1 suspended OH-chloroquine due to retinal accumulation;2 biologic-naive patients, after a three-month of waiting due to inability to come to the hospital, started the biologic drug;22 patients received a renewal of the therapeutic plan;25 patients had a regular six-month follow up;2 ticket exemption for illness;13 consultations and/ or laboratory tests (1 pneumological consultation, 1 ophthalmological consultation, 1 request for sacro-iliac MRI, 3 nailfold videocapillaroscopies, 3 FKT, 1 musculotendinous ultrasound, 1 antibodies for celiac disease, 2 antibodies anti Sars-CoV-2).

SETTING: This study followed a convergent mixed methods design, in which a quantitative online survey (n=1081) and 10 qualitative in-depth semistructured video interviews were conducted separately in the Netherlands during AprilCAugust 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 1081 participants filled in the online survey, and 10 participants participated in the interviews. Eligibility criteria included being a university student. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on risk perception, affective response, that is, worry, and adherence to preventive guidelines were combined and analysed during this study. There were no secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: The results showed that young adults perceived their risk as low. Their affective response for their own well-being was also low; however, their affective response was high with regards to vulnerable others in their surroundings. Due to their high impersonal risk perception (ie, perceived risk to others) and high affective response, young adults adhered to most preventive guidelines relatively frequently. However, young adults sometimes neglected social distancing due to the negative effects on mental health and the uncertainty of the duration of the situation. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, high impersonal risk perception and high affective response regarding others are key motivators in young adults preventive behaviour.

Results indicate that addition of soil amendments promoted the formation of large soil aggregates (0.2-2 mm and 0.02-0.2 mm) with greater mass loading of Cd (total Cd or DTPA-extractable Cd). Moreover, significant negative correlations between the mass loading of Cd in large aggregates and Cd accumulation in wheat tissues were observed. The effectiveness in mitigating Cd phytotoxicity was dependent on the type of amendment applied. Among them, addition of HS was most effective with the highest total Cd accumulation observed in the soil fraction of 0.2-2 mm (138.1% of the control) and lowest Cd concentration observed in wheat grain (56.9% of the control).

Multinomial logistic regression models were developed to examine the associations among food insecurity transitions during COVID-19 and various sociodemographic and food access-related factors, including race/ethnicity, children in the household, loss of employment/wages, language, and issues with food availability, accessibility, affordability, and stability during the pandemic. Sociodemographic and food access-related factors associated with staying or becoming newly food insecure were similar but not identical.

These striking differences have made many biological variables attractive for future investigations. One of these variables, vitamin D, has been implicated in COVID-19 with rapidly growing scientific evidence.Areas covered: The review intended to systematically explore the sources, and immunomodulatory role of vitamin D in COVID-19. Search engines and data sources including Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI, Scopus, and Web of Science were used for data collection. The search terms used were Vitamin D, COVID-19, immune system, and antiviral mechanism. Overall, 232 sources of information were collected and 188 were included in this review.Expert opinion: Interaction of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) triggers the cellular events to modulate the immune system by regulation of many genes. Vitamin D operates as a double-edged sword against COVID-19. First, in macrophages, it promotes the production of antimicrobial and antiviral proteins like ?-defensin 2 and cathelicidin, and these proteins inhibit the replication of viral particles and promote the clearance of virus from the cells by autophagy. Second, it suppresses cytokine storm and inflammatory processes in COVID-19.","output":"Vitamin D attenuates COVID-19 complications via modulation of proinflammatory cytokines, antiviral proteins, and autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Osimertinib induced lung disease may present as a COVID pneumonia. We herein present a case of a 71 year old patient with hypoxic respiratory failure initially treated for COVID pneumonia, to be later diagnosed with Osimertinib induced pneumonitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71 year old gentleman with a 20 pack-year smoking history, epidermal growth factor receptor mutated stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastasis treated with Osimertinib, presented to the emergency room in March 2021 with shortness of breath for three days. On presentation, his oxygen saturation was 87% on room air and increased to 92% with 6 liters per minute (L/min) of oxygen. Contrast Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest excluded pulmonary embolism but revealed multifocal patchy opacities along with an interval increase in the size of his primary tumor and pulmonary nodules. Laboratory investigations revealed the absence of leukocytosis with lymphopenia and slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. COVID pneumonia was suspected despite a negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The patient was then started on treatment with Methylprednisolone (20 mg/day twice daily) and Remdesivir (200mg/day followed by 100 mg/day) due to high suspicion for COVID despite the negative test. Given the patient's immunosuppressed state, broad-spectrum antibiotics were also given for a possible bacterial infection. Over the next 24 hours, his oxygen requirements continued to escalate to 15 L/min through high flow nasal cannula. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit for management of hypoxic respiratory failure. Despite treatment for COVID and bacterial pneumonia, the patient's oxygen requirements did not improve. As a result, other differential diagnoses were investigated. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1g/day for three days) was started for suspected Osimertinib induced pneumonitis. His oxygenation and symptoms significantly improved over the next 48 hours to 4 L/min. Patient was discharged on Prednisone 60 mg/day and oxygen therapy was discontinued six days after initial presentation. DISCUSSION: We present a case of osimertinib induced pneumonitis. This diagnosis was confirmed based on the rapid clinical improvement following the initiation of high dose steroids. Few case reports in the literature describe this adverse complication and its incidence remains unclear [1]. In our case, pneumonitis developed after approximately five months of Osimertinib treatment in a patient with no previous parenchymal lung disease. Given that this complication could be life-threatening, it should be given urgent attention and the correct treatment should be administered as early as possible [2]. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, despite a typical presentation of a hypoxic respiratory failure in the era of the COVID pandemic, other differential diagnosis should always be considered.

Adequate understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and CV disease is required for optimum management of these patients. METHODS: A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic. RESULTS: Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly. Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8-12% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at present. Nonetheless, it has been consistently shown that the presence of pre-existing CV disease and/or development of acute cardiac injury are associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the current reports on COVID-19 have only briefly described CV manifestations in these patients. Given the enormous burden posed by this illness and the significant adverse prognostic impact of cardiac involvement, further research is required to understand the incidence, mechanisms, clinical presentation and outcomes of various CV manifestations in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Cardiovascular disease and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The integration of confined exciton and localized surface plasmon in a hybrid nanostructure has recently stimulated extensive interests. The mechanistic insights into the elusive exciton-plasmon interplay at the nanoscale are of both fundamental and applicable values. Herein, by taking a hybrid WSe2/CuFeS2 system as a prototype, in which the excitonic semiconductor WSe2 nanosheets are interfaced with the plasmonic semiconductor CuFeS2 nanocrystals to form a heterostructure, we design and perform an ultrafast dynamics study to glean information in this regard. Specifically, the band-alignment relationship between the two components enables the contrasting case studies in which the excitonic excited states of WSe2 are pre-selected to be on-/off-resonant with the plasmon band of CuFeS2. As revealed by the joint observations from steady-state absorption and photoexcitation-dependent/temperature-dependent femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy, an effective energy transfer process occurs in this exciton-plasmon system where the energy donor (acceptor) is the excitonic WSe2 (plasmonic CuFeS2) and its efficiency is modulated by the exciton-plasmon coupling strength. Furthermore, as inferred from the temperature-dependent fs-TA analysis, the opening of such an energy-transfer channel turns out to take place during the early phase of plasmon decay (a??1 ps). In addition, the activation energy of energy transfer for a specific exciton-state-selected case is estimated (a??200 meV). This work provides a dynamics perspective to the plasmon semiconductor-involved exciton-plasmon interplay that features excited-state selectivity of exciton band and, hence, would be of guiding value for rational design and optimization of relevant applications based on exciton-plasmon manipulation.","output":"State-selective exciton-plasmon interplay in a hybrid WSe2/CuFeS2 nanosystem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the spring and summer of 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mobilized the resources of the entire agency in a concerted effort to meet the challenges posed by the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

However, significant variations are observed in the willingness to take the vaccination by citizens across different countries. Arguably, differences in vaccination intentions will be influenced by beliefs around vaccines to influence health. Often perceptions of what others are doing and the information available guide individuals' behaviors for vaccination. This is more so in the digital age with the influence of the internet and media. This study aims to determine the factors that impact willingness to vaccinate for COVID-19. We examined factors associated with acceptance of vaccine based on (1) constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM), (2) sources of information, (3) social media usage, (4) knowledge of COVID-19 treatment, and (5) perception of government's efforts for mitigation. Randomly sampled online survey data was collected by a global firm between December 2020 and January 2021 from 372 citizens (with a response rate of 96.6%) from multiple regions, including North America, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Ordered probit regression suggests that the health belief model constructs hold. Perceived severity of COVID-19 (P < 0.001) and action cues of others taking the vaccine positively influences a subject's vaccine intent (P < 0.001), perceived benefits and perceived efficacy of the vaccine positively influences a subject's vaccine intent (P < 0.001). Perceived barriers negatively influence vaccine intent (P < 0.001). Interestingly as for media usage, mainstream media (e.g., TV, newspaper) (P = 0.006) and social media (P = 0.013) both negatively influence a subject's vaccine intent. Social media platforms that are more entertainment and social-based, such as Whatsapp, Instagram, and YouTube, have a negative and significant influence on vaccine intent (P = 0.061), compared to other more information-based social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn). Knowledge of COVID-19 treatment positively influences vaccine intent (P = 0.023). Lastly, governmental efforts' perceived reliability in mitigation strategy (P = 0.028) and response efforts (P = 0.004) negatively influence vaccine intent.

Among them, gastric duplication cysts are very rare. CASE REPORT Here we report A 23-year-old Japanese man who visited our hospital to evaluate an abdominal tumor. Abdominal computed tomography showed a well-circumscribed homogenous low-density mass measuring 6.2  6.0 cm between the pancreatic tail and the upper posterior wall on the gastric greater curvature, and the mass seemed to originate from the pancreatic tail. We found intraoperatively that the mass adhered to the stomach and pancreatic tail strongly, so we performed laparoscopic partial gastrectomy and spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Pathological findings showed that the lining epithelium of the cystic mass consisted of the gastric foveolar epithelium with fundic glands. Furthermore, the pancreatic tissue of the pancreatic tail and the muscular layer of the cystic mass were intermingled. DISCUSSION GDCs are usually diagnosed at a younger age and in adults, they are very rare. Therefore, surgical resection is considered to be the best treatment due to the difficulty of diagnosis, and also that it mimics a pancreatic cystic tumor, and malignant transformation. Complete resection of the cyst is the ideal technique and laparoscopic surgery should be selected whenever possible. CONCLUSION We experienced a case of GDC continuous to both stomach and pancreatic tail.

The study aims to evaluate the effects of long-term acclimation of plants to elevated temperature on the tolerance of their photosynthetic apparatus to heat stress. Three wheat (Triticum sp. L.) genotypes differing in leaf and photosynthetic traits were analyzed: Thesee, Roter Samtiger Kolbenweizen, and ANK 32A. The pot experiment was established in natural conditions outdoors (non-acclimated variant), from which a part of the plants was placed in foil tunnel with elevated temperature for 14 days (high temperature-acclimated variant). A severe heat stress screening experiment was induced by an exposition of the plans in a growth chamber with artificial light and air temperature up to 45 C for ~12 h before the measurements. The measurements of leaf photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, and rapid kinetics of chlorophyll a fluorescence was performed. The results confirmed that a high temperature drastically reduced the photosynthetic assimilation rate caused by the non-stomatal (biochemical) limitation of photosynthetic processes. On the other hand, the chlorophyll fluorescence indicated only a moderate level of decrease of quantum efficiency of photosystem (PS) II (Fv/Fm parameter), indicating mostly reversible heat stress effects. The heat stress led to a decrease in the number of active PS II reaction centers (RC/ABS) and overall activity o PSII (PIabs) in all genotypes, whereas the PS I (parameter REo) was negatively influenced by heat stress in the non-acclimated variant only. Our results showed that the genotypes differ in acclimation capacity to heat stress, and rapid noninvasive techniques may help screen the stress effects and identify more tolerant crop genotypes. The acclimation was demonstrated more at the PS I level, which may be associated with the upregulation of alternative photosynthetic electron transport pathways with clearly protective functions.","output":"Pre-Acclimation to Elevated Temperature Stabilizes the Activity of Photosystem I in Wheat Plants Exposed to an Episode of Severe Heat Stress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to produce augmented physics animation (APA) with the crosscutting concept of the COVID 19 pandemic APA was used as a supplement to introductory physics courses The research method used Research and Development (R&D) with the 4D development model, which consists of (1) define, (2) design, (3) develop, and (4) disseminate Assessment of the product involved three material experts from the fields of physics, chemistry, and biology In addition, an education expert was also involved, especially regarding teaching materials The user's motivation level involved thirty students (N = 30) from the Department of Physics Education, UNTIRTA, in the second semester The products produced were interactive teaching materials used augmented reality technology, integrated with crosscutting concepts of the COVID 19 pandemic The results showed that the APA developed was \\"feasible\\" in terms of material and educational aspects Also, this augmented physics animation can increase student motivation levels in deepening fundamental physics APA makes it easier to understand the concepts of physics associated with real life, especially concerning the COVID 19 pandemic ? 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc All rights reserved","output":"Development of Augmented Physics Animation (APA) with the Integration of Crosscutting Concepts about the Covid-19 as a Supplement to the Introductory Physics Course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While COVID-19 has primarily been characterized by the respiratory impact of viral pneumonia, it affects every organ system and carries a high consequent risk of death in critically ill patients.

There is a sparsity of evidence in respect of the efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE) used during restraint for reducing risk of infection. METHODS: A series of choreographed restraint episodes were used to simulate contact contamination in research participants playing the roles of staff members and a patient. For comparison, one episode of simulated recording of physical observations was taken. Ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent material was used to track the simulated contact contamination, with analysis undertaken using established image registration techniques of UV photographs. This was repeated for three separate sets of PPE. RESULTS: All three PPE sets showed similar performance in protecting against contamination transfer. For teams not utilising coveralls, this was dependent upon effective cleansing as part of doffing. There were similar patterns of contamination for restraint team members assigned to specific roles, with hands and upper torso appearing to be higher-risk areas. The restraint-related contamination was 23 times higher than that observed for physical observations. DISCUSSION: A second layer of clothing that can be removed showed efficacy in reducing contact contamination. PPE fit to individual is important. Post-restraint cleansing procedures are currently inadequate, with new procedures for face and neck cleansing required.

METHODS A bicomponent conformal (BCC) RFA probe providing sectorial sequential ablation followed by circumferential cutting is designed and evaluated. Three-dimensional finite-element analysis model was developed with temperature feedback-controlled simulation of RFA for electrode design and optimization. The prototype bipolar BCC probe with three embedded thermocouples was constructed and evaluated in tissue-mimicking phantoms. RESULTS Maximum tissue temperature was kept <100 oC with power applied <15 W. A 10-min ablation time was used for each sequence and after four sequential RFA, a large ablation zone of 55 cm3 was achieved. Our experiment confirmed that lesions exceeding 3.7 cm could be ablated and separated from the surrounded tissue. CONCLUSION The new BCC probe is, thus, capable of controlled ablation followed by circumferential separation of the lesions, when required. SIGNIFICANCE The results of these experiments provide the proof of concept validation that the BCC probe has the potential to ablate by sequential heating tumors in solid organs >3.5 cm then separate them by electrosurgical cutting from the surrounding normal parenchyma. The combined RF ablation and physical separation could completely destroy the cancer cells at the ablation site, thus, avoid any local recurrence of cancer.

The presence of additive biomacromolecules has been known to influence various stages of the precipitation process from nucleation to crystal growth. In the current work, well-defined sequences of short, negatively charged peptides, oligo(l-glutamic acids), were utilized as a model, inspired by contiguous sequences of acidic amino acids in natural biomineralization proteins. The precipitate morphology and phases, the element time profile in solution and in the precipitates, as well as the kinetics during the precipitation process were analyzed to explain the effect of these short peptides on calcium phosphate precipitation. The results show that peptides can delay the phase transformation of an amorphous precursor phase to hydroxyapatite and that there is an optimal chain length for this effect at a given concentration of peptide. This study is the first part of a two-part series and is followed by a subsequent work to reveal the mechanism by which these short peptides influence the calcium phosphate precipitation.","output":"Oligo(l-glutamic acids) in Calcium Phosphate Precipitation: Chain Length Effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs expressed by almost all metazoans, have key roles in the regulation of cell differentiation, organism development and gene expression. Thousands of miRNAs regulating approximately 60 % of the total human genome have been identified. They regulate genetic expression either by direct cleavage or by translational repression of the target mRNAs recognized through partial complementary base pairing. The active and functional unit of miRNA is its complex with Argonaute proteins known as the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). De-regulated miRNA expression in the human cell may contribute to a diverse group of disorders including cancer, cardiovascular dysfunctions, liver damage, immunological dysfunction, metabolic syndromes and pathogenic infections. Current day studies have revealed that miRNAs are indeed a pivotal component of host-pathogen interactions and host immune responses toward microorganisms. miRNA is emerging as a tool for genetic study, therapeutic development and diagnosis for human pathogenic infections caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. Many pathogens can exploit the host miRNA system for their own benefit such as surviving inside the host cell, replication, pathogenesis and bypassing some host immune barriers, while some express pathogen-encoded miRNA inside the host contributing to their replication, survival and/or latency. In this review, we discuss the role and significance of miRNA in relation to some pathogenic viruses.","output":"Mammalian microRNA: an important modulator of host-pathogen interactions in human viral infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study compared the co-ingestion of glucose and fructose on exogenous and endogenous substrate oxidation during prolonged exercise at terrestrial high altitude (HA) versus sea level, in women. METHOD Five women completed two bouts of cycling at the same relative workload (55% Wmax) for 120 minutes on acute exposure to HA (3375m) and at sea level (~113m). In each trial, participants ingested 1.2 g.min of glucose (enriched with C glucose) and 0.6 g.min of fructose (enriched with C fructose) before and every 15 minutes during exercise. Indirect calorimetry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry were used to calculate fat oxidation, total and exogenous carbohydrate oxidation, plasma glucose oxidation and endogenous glucose oxidation derived from liver and muscle glycogen. RESULTS The rates and absolute contribution of exogenous carbohydrate oxidation was significantly lower at HA compared with sea level (ES>0.99, P<0.024), with the relative exogenous carbohydrate contribution approaching significance (32.66.1 vs. 36.06.1%, ES=0.56, P=0.059) during the second hour of exercise. In comparison, no significant differences were observed between HA and sea level for the relative and absolute contributions of liver glucose (3.21.2 vs. 3.10.8%, ES=0.09, P=0.635 and 5.11.8 vs. 5.41.7 grams, ES=0.19, P=0.217), and muscle glycogen (14.412.2% vs. 15.89.3%, ES=0.11, P=0.934 and 23.119.0 vs. 28.717.8 grams, ES=0.30, P=0.367). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in total fat oxidation between HA and sea level (66.321.4 vs. 59.67.7 grams, ES=0.32, P=0.557).

Without social distancing, the spread of COVID-19 will grow exponentially, but social distancing and people's learning behavior (isolating, staying at home, wearing face masks, washing hands, restricting the size and frequency of group gatherings, etc.) can significantly impede the epidemic spread, flatten the infection curve, and change the final outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results demonstrate that strict social distancing and people's learning behavior can be effective in slowing the spread rate and significantly reducing the total number of infections, daily infection rate, peak of daily infections, and duration of the epidemic. Under strict social distancing, the rise and fall of infections would be nearly symmetric about the peak of of daily infections, and the epidemic spread would be essentially over within 60 days. Relaxing social distancing and people learning behaviors will significantly increase the total and daily numbers of infections and prolong the course of the outbreak.

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Online international survey. Single-best, open box and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questions. PARTICIPANTS: The survey was sent to 35 509 HCPs in 124 countries and was open from 7 to 21 May 2020. 2237/3237 (69.1%) HCPs from 115 countries who consented to participate completed the survey. 1058 (47.3%) completed the HADS. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, depression and anxiety among HCPs in relation to country and PPE availability. ANALYSES: Univariate analyses were used to investigate associations without generating erroneous causal conclusions. RESULTS: Confirmed/suspected SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 13.0%. PPE provision concerns were raised by 74.1% of participants; highest among trainees/resident physicians (83.9%) and among HCPs in Spain (89.7%). Most participants worked in self-perceived high-risk areas with SARS-CoV-2 (67.5%C87.0%), with proportionately more trainees interacting with suspected/confirmed infected patients (57.1% vs 24.2%C40.6%) and sonographers seeing more patients who did not wear a mask (33.3% vs 13.9%C7.9%). The most frequent PPE combination used was gloves and a surgical mask (22.3%). UK and US respondents reported spending less time self-isolating (8.8 days) and lower satisfaction with their national pandemic response (37.0%C43.0%). 19.8% and 8.8% of respondents met the criteria for moderate to severe anxiety and depression, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Reported prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCPs is consistent with literature findings. Most respondents used gloves and a surgical mask, with a greater SARS-CoV-2 prevalence compared with those using full PPE. HCPs with the least agency (trainees and sonographers) were not only more likely to see high-risk patients but also less likely to be protected.

Presently, researchers across the globe are in a quest to identify/develop drugs or vaccines by targeting different non-structural proteins (Nsps) of SARS CoV-2. One such important drug target is Nsp5/main protease (Mpro) which plays a critical role in the viral replication. This cysteine protease/Mpro of SARS CoV-2 has high sequence similarity with the same protease from SARS CoV-1. Previously, it has been shown experimentally that eight polyphenols derived from the root of Isatis indigotica show inhibitory effect on the cleavage/catalytic activity of the SARS CoV-1 Mpro. But whether these polyphenols exhibit any inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 Mpro is unclear. To explore this possibility, here, we have adopted various computational approaches. Polyphenols that qualified the pharmacological parameters (indigo, sinigrin, hesperetin and daidzein) and two well-known Mpro inhibitors (N3 and lopinavir) were subjected to molecular docking studies. Two of them (sinigrin and hesperetin) were selected by comparing their binding affinities with N3 and lopinavir. Sinigrin and hesperetin interacted with the two most important catalytic residues of Mpro (His41 and Cys145). Molecular dynamics studies further revealed that these two Mpro-polyphenol complexes are more stable and experience less conformational fluctuations than Mpro-N3/lopinavir complex. The Mpro-hesperetin complex was more compact and less expanded than Mpro-sinigrin complex. These findings were additionally validated by MM-GBSA analysis. As a whole, our study revealed that these two polyphenols may be potent SARS CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors and may possibly be considered for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Depicting the inhibitory potential of polyphenols from Isatis indigotica root against the main protease of SARS CoV-2 using computational approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thermoresponsive polymers play an important role in designing drug delivery systems for biomedical applications.

The addition of dexamethasone affected the thermoresponsive behavior of one of the copolymers, nPrOx(20)-MeOx(180), in the aqueous medium by shifting the cloud point temperature to lower values. In addition, the formation of microparticles containing dexamethasone was observed during the heating of the samples. The morphology and number of microparticles were affected by the structure and concentration of copolymer, the drug concentration, and the temperature. The crystalline nature of formed microparticles was confirmed by polarized light microscopy, confocal Raman microscopy, and wide-angle X-ray scattering.

This disproportionately excluded older people - one of the groups with least access to (or experience of) using the internet. Approximately 11.5 million people in the UK lack digital skills and 4.8 million people never go online, with around half (51%) of these being aged over 65. The Greater Manchester (GM) response was to work collaboratively with a number of key Ageing groups to develop Keeping Well at Home, a booklet providing evidence based health and wellbeing information and advice for older people during COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS: An evaluation of the booklet was undertaken during summer 2020 by the Healthy Ageing team at the Applied Research Collaboration GM. As national restrictions on movement remained in place at the time, a postal questionnaire was distributed to a sample of older adults in GM. RESULTS: Nearly 500 questionnaires were returned. The response was overwhelmingly positive; 92% found the information helpful; 90% agreed the booklet would help older people stay healthy during lockdown; 74% had used the home exercises section; 78% found the tips for keeping their mind well helpful. Around 50% of respondents did not have internet access. Paper based resources was the preferred choice for 92% of respondents with only 6% opting for digital versions. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from the evaluation challenges the growing trend towards communicating just through digital channels, and emphasises the need for tailored paper-based materials for older adults. The Keeping Well at Home booklet also shows the value of working with older adults to ensure the content and design are inviting to readers.

The common imaging finding is usually as a lung infiltrate or consolidation of some type of distribution or another. Trying to find the putative cause for the imaging pattern is a good first step in narrowing the differential diagnosis and answering the question: what accounts for this pattern on imaging studies? Most of these diseases have an acute or subacute onset and exhibit restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests. When treated promptly, they resolve completely with little or no residual injury to the lung architecture. On a small biopsy it is important to have a clinical history and imaging results before embarking on a descriptive rather than a definitive diagnosis. The smaller the sample, the more information is needed to complete the picture. Pulmonologists should be advised to target the part of the lung that should provide the most information related to the process under investigation.

We determined the rate of re-infection, associated factors and mortality during follow up in a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We analyzed 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who received serial tests in total of 62 healthcare facilities in United States between December 1, 2019 to November 13, 2020. Re-infection was defined by two positive tests separated by interval of greater than 90 days two after resolution of first infection was confirmed by two or more consecutive negative tests. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with re-infection. RESULTS: Re-infection was identified in 0.7% (n=63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5%-0.9%) during follow up of 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean period (standard deviation [SD]) between two positive tests was 116  21 days. A logistic regression analysis identified that asthma (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2) and nicotine dependence/tobacco use (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6-4.5) were associated with re-infection. There was a significantly lower rate of pneumonia, heart failure, and acute kidney injury observed with re-infection compared with primary infection among the 63 patients with re-infection There were two deaths (3.2%) associated with re-infection.

However, its role in the regulation of lateral root formation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the apple SUMO E3 ligase MdSIZ1 promotes lateral root formation. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, the auxin response factor MdARF8 was screened out as a protein-protein interaction partner of the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme MdSCE1, indicating that MdARF8 may be a substrate for MdSIZ1. The interaction between MdARF8 and MdSCE1 was confirmed by pull-down, Y2H, and Co-IP assays. MdSIZ1 enhanced the conjugating enzyme activity of MdSCE1 to form a MdSCE1-MdSIZ1-MdARF8 complex, thereby facilitating SUMO modification. We identified two arginine substitution mutations at K342 and K380 in MdARF8 that blocked MdSIZ1-mediated SUMOylation, indicating that K342 and K380 are the principal SUMOylation sites of the MdARF8 protein. Moreover, MdARF8 promoted lateral root formation in transgenic apple plants, and the phenotype of reduced lateral roots in the Arabidopsis siz1-2 mutant was restored in siz1-2/MdARF8 complementary plants.

As per the literature, the SARS-CoV-2 is known to exploit humanACE2 receptors (similar toprevious SARS-CoV-1) for gaining entry into the host cell for invasion, infection, multiplication and pathogenesis. However, considering the higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 along with the complex etiology and pathophysiological outcomes seen in COVID-19 patients, it seems that there may be an alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2. I performed comparative protein sequence analysis, database based gene expression profiling, bioinformatics based molecular docking using authentic tools and techniques for unveiling the molecular basis of high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to previous known coronaviruses. My study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) harbors a RGD motif in its receptor binding domain (RBD) and the motif is absent in all other previously known SARS-CoVs. The RGD motif is well known for its role in cell-attachment and cell-adhesion. My hypothesis is that the SARS-CoV-2 may be (via RGD) exploiting integrins, that have high expression in lungs and all other vital organs, for invading host cells. However, an experimental verification is required. The expression of ACE2, which is a known receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was found to be negligible in lungs. I assume that higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 could be due to this RGD-integrin mediated acquired cell-adhesive property. Gene expression profiling revealed that expression of integrins is significantly high in lung cells, in particular v6, 51, v8 and an ECM protein, ICAM1. The molecular docking experiment showed the RBD of spike protein binds with integrins precisely at RGD motif in a similar manner as a synthetic RGD peptide binds to integrins as found by other researchers. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a number of phosphorylation sites that can induce cAMP, PKC, Tyr signaling pathways. These pathways either activate calcium ion channels or get activated by calcium. In fact, integrins have calcium & metal binding sites that were predicted around and in vicinity of RGD-integrin docking site in our analysis which suggests that RGD-integrins interaction possibly occurs in calcium-dependent manner. The higher expression of integrins in lungs along with their previously known high binding affinity (K(D) = 4.0nM) for virus RGD motif could serve as a possible explanation for high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. On the contrary, human ACE2 has lower expression in lungs and its high binding affinity (K(D)= 15nM) for spike RBD alone could not manifest significant virus-host attachment. This suggests that besides human ACE2, an additional or alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is likely to exist. A highly relevant evidence never reported earlier which corroborate in favor of RGD-integrins mediated virus-host attachment is an unleashed cytokine storm which causes due to activation of TNF- and IL-6 activation; and integrins role in their activation is also well established. Altogether, the current study has highlighted possible role of calcium and other divalent ions in RGD-integrins interaction for virus invasion into host cells and suggested that lowering divalent ion in lungs could avert virus-host cells attachment.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Attachment to Host Cells is Possibly Mediated via RGD-Integrin Interaction in a Calcium-dependent Manner and Suggests Pulmonary EDTA Chelation Therapy as a Novel Treatment for COVID 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plenty of serologic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed so far, thus documenting the importance of evaluating the relevant features of the immune response to this viral agent.

Thus, this study is conducted to fill the gap by identifying important factors contributing to the severity of crashes involving children. Here child is defined as any passengers under 9 years old. A first step in identifying factors to the severity of crashes involving children is implementing a reliable statistical method that could account for heterogeneity across various observations. So, in this study, to account for the heterogeneity in the dataset, the standard cumulative link model (CLM) was extended to the random effect model, while instead of assigning the subjective attribute for random effect, an objective hierarchy through the finite mixture modeling (FMM) was used. The FMM was employed in the context of the CLM to prevent the loss of information due to disaggregation of the dataset into the homogeneous datasets. The comparison results highlighted that the random effect model by the objective hierarchy would result in a significant improvement in the model fit compared with the standard cumulative link model. The results highlighted factors such as safety equipment in use, type of collision, and various drivers' characteristics and actions such as belting condition, alcohol and drug involvement are some of the factors contributing to the severity of child crashes. As expected, the main findings of our results highlighted that various drivers' actions and behaviors are the main causes that children would undergo a higher severity level in crashes.

While the exact mechanism is unclear, 3 processes seem to play important roles in sepsis-related thrombosis and mortality: tissue factor expression on circulating monocytes and microparticles, hypercoagulability (increased clot firmness), and hypofibrinolysis. Rotational thromboelastometry is a point-of-care viscoelastic technique that uses the viscoelastic properties of blood to monitor coagulation. Using various assays, viscoelastometry could monitor this triad of changes in severely ill, COVID-19-positive patients. Similarly, with the increased incidence of coagulopathy, many patients are placed on anticoagulants, making management more difficult depending on the agents utilized. Viscoelastometry might also be used in these settings to monitor anticoagulation status and guide therapy, as it has in other areas. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case series of 6 patients with different stages of disease and different management plans. These cases occurred at the height of the pandemic in New York City, which limited testing abilities. We first discuss the idea of using the NaHEPTEM test as a marker of tissue factor expression in COVID-19. We then present cases where patients are on different anticoagulants and review how viscoelastometry might be used in a patient on anticoagulation with COVID-19.

It can be subdivided into three major classifications based on the component of the neuromuscular system (i.e. peripheral nerves or skeletal muscle or both) that are affected.

We assessed whether early treatment of AD signs/symptoms with pimecrolimus could influence long-term outcome by preventing disease flares. METHODS Early intervention with pimecrolimus was compared with a conventional AD treatment strategy (ie, emollients and topical corticosteroids). In this 1-year, controlled, double-blind study, 713 AD patients (2-17 years) were randomized 2:1 to a pimecrolimus-based or conventional regimen. Both groups used emollients for dry skin. Early AD signs/symptoms were treated with pimecrolimus cream or, in the conventional treatment group, vehicle to prevent progression to flares. If flares occurred, moderately potent topical corticosteroids were mandated. The primary efficacy endpoint was ranked flares at 6 months. Safety was monitored clinically, and a skin recall-antigen test was performed at study completion. RESULTS BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS: The mean age for both groups was approximately 8 years, and the majority of patients had moderate disease at baseline. PATIENT FOLLOW-UP AND EXPOSURE TO STUDY MEDICATION: The mean duration of follow-up (+/-standard error) was 303.7 (+/-5.30) days in the pimecrolimus group and 235.2 (+/-9.40) days in the control group. The discontinuation rate was significantly higher in the control group than in the pimecrolimus group (51.5% vs 31.6% at 12 months), and proportionately more patients with severe or very severe disease discontinued in the control group. The main reason for the higher discontinuation rate in the control group was unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (30.4% vs 12.4%). This resulted in a substantially higher mean number of study medication treatment days in the pimecrolimus group compared with the control group: 211.9 (69.8% of study days) versus 156.0 (66.3% of study days). Of those patients who completed 12 months on study, 14.2% and 7.0% of patients in the pimecrolimus and vehicle groups, respectively, used study medication continuously. EFFICACY Patients in the pimecrolimus group experienced significantly fewer AD flares than those in the control group, according to the primary efficacy analysis on ranked flares of AD (Van Elteren test). The proportion of patients who completed 6 or 12 months with no flares was approximately twice as high in the pimecrolimus group compared with control (61.0% vs 34.2% at 6 months; 50.8% vs 28.3% at 12 months). Fewer flares were observed in the pimecrolimus group regardless of baseline disease severity, so even severe patients derived benefit from the treatment. The analysis of time to first flare showed that treatment with pimecrolimus was associated with a significantly longer flare-free period (log- rank test). Covariate analysis indicated a statistically significant effect on time to first flare of baseline Eczema Area and Severity Index score, and whether patients had \\"severe\\" or \\"very severe\\" disease at baseline according to the Investigators' Global Assessment, although patients in all baseline disease severity subgroups benefited from treatment. Age had no significant effect. Fewer patients in the pimecrolimus group required topical corticosteroid therapy compared with control (35.0% vs 62.9% at 6 months; 42.6% vs 68.4% at 12 months), and patients in the pimecrolimus group spent fewer days on topical corticosteroid therapy (57.4% vs 31.6% [pimecrolimus vs control, respectively] spent 0 days on topical corticosteroid therapy, 17.1% vs 27.5% 1-14 days, and 25.5% vs 41.0% >14 days over the 12 months of the study). This steroid-sparing effect of pimecrolimus was evident despite pimecrolimus-treated patients being on study longer than patients in the control group. The average proportion of study days spent on second-line corticosteroids was 4.08% in the pimecrolimus group and 9.10% in the control group. Analysis of Eczema Area and Severity Index over time showed significantly lower median scores, thus indicating better disease control in the pimecrolimus group compared with the control group. Similar results were obtained from analysis of the Investigators' Global Assessment (not shown). The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to the number of patients using antihistamines during the study (57.2% vs 62.9%, pimecrolimus vs control, respectively). SAFETY There were no appreciable differences between treatment groups in the overall incidence of adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were common childhood infections and ailments, including nasopharyngitis, headache, and cough. The incidence of suspected drug-related adverse events was not significantly different in the pimecrolimus group (24.7% vs 18.7%--pimecrolimus vs control), and the incidence of serious adverse events was low (8.3% vs 5.2%--pimecrolimus vs control). Life-table analysis of incidence of adverse events revealed no significant differences between the treatment groups, except for cough. Local tolerability was good in both treatment groups. The most common application site reaction reported was sensation of burning (10.5% vs 9.3%--pimecrolimus vs control). There were no major differences between treatment groups in the duration or severity of application site reactions, most of which were mild-to-moderate and transient, occurring within the first week of treatment. Skin infections were reported in both groups. There were no between-group differences in the life-table analysis of time to first occurrence of bacterial skin infections nor in the adjusted incidence of bacterial skin infections. Although there were no significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of individual viral skin infections, the incidence of grouped viral skin infections (12.4% vs 6.3%--pimecrolimus vs control) showed a slightly higher incidence in the pimecrolimus group. Laboratory values and vital signs showed no significant between-group differences. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in response to recall antigens in those patients who remained on study for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of early AD signs/symptoms with pimecrolimus was effective in preventing progression to flares in more than half the patients, reducing or eliminating the need for topical corticosteroids. The benefits were consistently seen at 6 months across important disease severity subgroups and with respect to the various predefined efficacy endpoints. Furthermore, these benefits were sustained for 12 months, providing evidence that long-term treatment with pimecrolimus leads to better control of AD. Treatment with pimecrolimus was well tolerated and was not associated with clinically relevant adverse events compared with the conventional treatment group. The results reported here offer the prospect of effective long-term management of AD with reduced need for topical corticosteroids.","output":"Efficacy and safety of pimecrolimus cream in the long-term management of atopic dermatitis in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of a new Coronavirus has developed into a global pandemic with about 10 5 million reported cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide Our prospective paper reports an updated analysis of the impact that this pandemic had on the Italian agri-food sector during the national lockdown and discusses why and how this unprecedented economic crisis could be a turning point to deal with the overall sustainability of food and agricultural systems in the frame of the forthcoming European Green Deal Its introductory part includes a wide-ranging examination of the first quarter of pandemic emergency, with a specific focus on the primary production, to be understood as agriculture (i e , crops and livestock, and their food products), fisheries, and forestry The effect on the typical food and wine exports, and the local environment tourism segments is also taken into account in this analysis, because of their old and deep roots into the cultural and historical heritage of the country The subsequent part of the paper is centered on strategic lines and research networks for an efficient socio-economic and territorial restart, and a faster transition to sustainability in the frame of a circular bio-economy Particular emphasis is given to the urgent need of investments in research and development concerning agriculture, in terms of not only a fruitful penetration of the agro-tech for a next-generation agri-food era, but also a deeper attention to the natural and environmental resources, including forestry As for the rest of Europe, Italy demands actions to expand knowledge and strengthen research applied to technology transfer for innovation activities aimed at providing solutions for a climate neutral and resilient society, in reference to primary production to ensure food security and nutrition quality Our expectation is that science and culture return to play a central role in national society, as their main actors are capable of making a pivotal contribution to renew and restart the whole primary sector and agri-food industry, addressing also social and environmental issues, and so accelerating the transition to sustainability","output":"Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the Italian agri-food sector: an analysis of the quarter of pandemic lockdown and clues for a socio-economic and territorial restart"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective.

Method. We propose a data-driven approach, grounded on a mixture model, to forecast the dynamics of the number of deaths from COVID-19 in a given focal country using data from countries that are ahead in time in terms of COVID-19-induced mortality. In this approach, the mortality curves of ahead-in-time countries are used to build predictors, which are then used as the components of the mixture model. This approach was applied to eight second-line European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden), using Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom as well as the Hubei province in China to build predictors. For this analysis, we used data pooled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Results. In general, the second-line European countries tend to follow relatively mild mortality curves (typically, those of Switzerland and Hubei) rather than fast and severe ones (typically, those of Spain, Italy, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom). From a methodological viewpoint, the performance of our forecasting approach is about 80% up to 8 days in the future, as soon as the focal country has accumulated at least two hundreds of deaths.

METHODS: MERS patients with ARDS seen during the 2014 outbreak and COVID-19 patients with ARDS admitted between March and December 2020 in our hospital were included, and their clinical characteristics, ventilatory course, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Forty-nine and 14 patients met the inclusion criteria for ARDS in the COVID-19 and MERS groups, respectively. Both groups had a median of four comorbidities with high Charlson comorbidity index value of 5 points (P>0.22). COVID-19 patients were older, obese, had significantly higher initial C-reactive protein (CRP), more likely to get trial of high-flow oxygen, and had delayed intubation (P0.04). The postintubation course was similar between the groups. Patients in both groups experienced a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, and majority received paralytics, dialysis, and vasopressor agents (P>0.28). The respiratory and ventilatory parameters after intubation (including tidal volume, fraction of inspired oxygen, peak and plateau pressures) and their progression over 3 weeks were similar (P>0.05). Rates of mortality in the ICU (53% vs. 64%) and hospital (59% vs. 64%) among COVID-19 and MERS patients (P0.54) were very high. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some distinctive differences between COVID-19 and MERS patients prior to intubation, the respiratory and ventilatory parameters postintubation were not different. The higher initial CRP level in COVID-19 patients may explain the steroid responsiveness in this population.","output":"Comparison of characteristics and ventilatory course between coronavirus disease 2019 and Middle East respiratory syndrome patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has triggered global efforts to develop therapeutics. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), critical for viral replication, is a key target for therapeutic development.

We have examined the binding modes of ebselen and its derivative in Mpro via high resolution co-crystallography and investigated their chemical reactivity via mass spectrometry. Stronger Mpro inhibition than ebselen and potent ability to rescue infected cells were observed for a number of derivatives. A free selenium atom bound with cysteine of catalytic dyad has been revealed in crystallographic structures of Mpro with ebselen and MR6-31-2 suggesting hydrolysis of the enzyme bound organoselenium covalent adduct and formation of a phenolic by-product, confirmed by mass spectrometry.

T2D was presented with an increased risk of thrombotic complications at the background of impaired insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between insulin sensitivity indices and serum AT3 activity in patients with T2D. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in patients with T2D who consented to participate in the study at the Endocrinology Department of Affiliated 2 Hospital of Nantong University from January 2015 to June 2018. All patients received serum AT3 activity test and 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Basal and systemic insulin sensitivity were assessed by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and Matsuda index (ISI(Matsuda)), respectively, from the OGTT. And other relevant clinical data were also collected. RESULTS: Total of 1612 patients with T2D were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 58.67  13.09 years and a median diabetes duration of 6 years (interquartile range, 1C10 years). Across ascending quartiles of serum AT3 activity, HOMA-IR progressively decreased, while ISI(Matsuda) progressively increased (all P for trend < 0.001). Moreover, serum AT3 activity was negatively correlated with HOMA-IR (r = ?0.189, P < 0.001) and positively correlated with ISI(Matsuda) (r = 0.221, P < 0.001). After adjusting for other metabolic risk factors, hemostatic parameters and glucose-lowering therapies by multivariate linear regression analysis, HOMA-IR ( = ?0.185, t = ?5.960, P < 0.001) and ISI(Matsuda) ( = 0.197, t = 6.632, P < 0.001) remained independently associated with the serum AT3 activity in patients with T2D, respectively.

Industry convergence, the key to digital transformation, entails, for firms, both various opportunities for innovation and the crisis of falling behind. Therefore, from the perspective of firms, it is critical to examine how digital transformation affects their industries and products as well as how they perceive and respond to digital transformation. This is ultimately a matter of how firms survive and maintain sustainable growth in this great upheaval of digital transformation. Based on the understanding of the concept of digital transformation, this study explores how high-growth firms perceive various aspects of digital transformation. The findings show that digital transformation involves a change of firms based on constant innovation, not simply the acceptance of technology, and that there is a large digital divide that depends on the firm size and industry type. Based on the above, this study derives implications in terms of the innovation activities of firms to ensure that digital transformation does not serve as a handicap and barrier for firms. ? 2021 by the authors.

Among 30,098 consecutive patients undergoing first coronary revascularization in the CREDO-Kyoto PCI/CABG (Coronary Revascularization Demonstrating Outcome Study in Kyoto Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting) registry cohort-2 and 3, we compared clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients with and without risk factors stratified by their presentation (STEMI n = 8,312, NSTE-ACS n = 3,386, and CCS n = 18,400). Patients with risk factors were defined as having at least one of the following risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and current smoking. The proportion of patients without risk factors was low (STEMI: 369 patients [4.4%], NSTE-ACS: 110 patients [3.2%], and CCS: 462 patients [2.5%]). Patients without risk factors compared with those with risk factors more often had advanced age, low body weight, and malignancy and less often had history of atherosclerotic disease and prescription of optimal medical therapy. In patients with STEMI, patients without risk factors compared with those with risk factors were more often women and more often had atrial fibrillation, long door-to-balloon time, and severe hemodynamic compromise. During a median of 5.6 years follow-up, patients without risk factors compared with those with risk factors had higher crude incidence of all-cause death. After adjusting confounders, the mortality risk was significant in patients with CCS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.49, p = 0.04) but not in patients with STEMI (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.27, p = 0.52) and NSTE-ACS (HR 1.07, 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.54, p = 0.73). In conclusion, among patients undergoing coronary revascularization, patients without standard cardiovascular risk factors had higher crude incidence of all-cause death compared with those with at least one risk factor.

DESIGN: Cross sectional analysis. DATA SOURCES: World Health Organization's draft landscape of covid-19 candidate vaccines, along with company disclosures to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, company and foundation press releases, government press releases, and media reports. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND DATA ANALYSIS: Premarket purchase commitments for covid-19 vaccines, publicly announced by 15 November 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Premarket purchase commitments for covid-19 vaccine candidates and price per course, vaccine platform, and stage of research and development, as well as procurement agent and recipient country. RESULTS: As of 15 November 2020, several countries have made premarket purchase commitments totaling 7.48 billion doses, or 3.76 billion courses, of covid-19 vaccines from 13 vaccine manufacturers. Just over half (51%) of these doses will go to high income countries, which represent 14% of the world's population. The US has reserved 800 million doses but accounts for a fifth of all covid-19 cases globally (11.02 million cases), whereas Japan, Australia, and Canada have collectively reserved more than one billion doses but do not account for even 1% of current global covid-19 cases globally (0.45 million cases). If these vaccine candidates were all successfully scaled, the total projected manufacturing capacity would be 5.96 billion courses by the end of 2021. Up to 40% (or 2.34 billion) of vaccine courses from these manufacturers might potentially remain for low and middle income countries-less if high income countries exercise scale-up options and more if high income countries share what they have procured. Prices for these vaccines vary by more than 10-fold, from $6.00 (4.50; ?4.90) per course to as high as $74 per course. With broad country participation apart from the US and Russia, the COVAX Facility-the vaccines pillar of the World Health Organization's Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator-has secured at least 500 million doses, or 250 million courses, and financing for half of the targeted two billion doses by the end of 2021 in efforts to support globally coordinated access to covid-19 vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview of how high income countries have secured future supplies of covid-19 vaccines but that access for the rest of the world is uncertain. Governments and manufacturers might provide much needed assurances for equitable allocation of covid-19 vaccines through greater transparency and accountability over these arrangements.","output":"Reserving coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines for global access: cross sectional analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affected 9.3% of adults worldwide in 2019.

Psychological outcomes were assessed according to the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Influencing factors were assessed by COVID-19 knowledge, mindful coping scale, and sense of control scale. Results: Our sample is comprised of 563 University students (male = 172, mean age = 21.52). Among them, 382 are medical students. Among the participants, 12.26, 18.47, and 8.53% have moderate to severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Compared with the non-medical students, the medical students had a higher knowledge level of COVID-19, a higher sense of awareness, and fewer mental health symptoms. After controlling the covariance, perceived constraints of sense of control were negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress among both medical and non-medical students. Prevention of negative emotions by mindful coping was negatively associated with depression and anxiety among non-medical students. Knowledge of COVID-19 is not associated with mental distress among medical and non-medical students. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic in China, the mental health of University students was affected. Our findings suggested that a sense of control is a protective factor for both medical and non-medical students, while mindful coping is a protective factor for only non-medical students.","output":"Factors Influencing Mental Health Among Chinese Medical and Non-medical Students in the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Le diabte rend la grossesse en tat  risque de complications.

Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has also been proposed as a treatment of critically ill patients. In this retrospective observational cohort study drawn from electronic health records we sought to describe the association between mortality and hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients were hospitalized at a 13-hospital network spanning New Jersey USA between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2. Follow up was through May 5, 2020. Among 2512 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 there have been 547 deaths (22%), 1539 (61%) discharges and 426 (17%) remain hospitalized. 1914 (76%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 1473 (59%) received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. After adjusting for imbalances via propensity modeling, compared to receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in associated mortality for patients receiving any hydroxychloroquine during the hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.80-1.22]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.27]), or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.75-1.28]). The 30-day unadjusted mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, the combination or neither drug was 25%, 20%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Among 547 evaluable ICU patients, including 134 receiving tocilizumab in the ICU, an exploratory analysis found a trend towards an improved survival association with tocilizumab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.57-1.00]), with 30 day unadjusted mortality with and without tocilizumab of 46% versus 56%. This observational cohort study suggests hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, was not associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab demonstrated a trend association towards reduced mortality among ICU patients.

Objectives: We compared the phenomenology of TikTok tics to typical tic disorders. We chose to analyze the most widely viewed videos and therefore focused on the most popular content creators. Methods: Videos with the keywords tic, Tourette, or tourettes were reviewed to identify content creators between March 11, 2020 and March 30, 2021. We performed a quantitative assessment of TikTok tics as well as a descriptive analysis of the entire series of videos of each content creator. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 18.8 years old, and the majority were women. Unlike the predominance of facial movements in typical tics, arm movements were most frequent. Average tics per minute was 29, and almost all recorded TikTok tics were severe, causing significant disability. Whereas coprolalia and self-injurious behavior are only infrequently encountered in typical tic disorders, they were present in the overwhelming majority of TikTok subjects. Conclusions: TikTok tics are distinct from what is typically seen in patients with Tourette syndrome, although share many characteristics with functional tics. We believe this to be an example of mass sociogenic illness, which involves behaviors, emotions, or conditions spreading spontaneously through a group.

In India, 65% of the population lives in villages where infrastructural constraints limit the access to molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 infection. Especially, the requirement of a cold chain transport for sustained sample integrity and associated biosafety challenges pose major bottlenecks to the equitable access. Here, we developed an innovative clinical specimen collection medium, named SupraSens microbial transport medium (SSTM). SSTM allowed a cold chain-independent transport at a wide temperature range (15C to 40C) and directly inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (<15 min). Evaluation of SSTM compared to commercial viral transport medium (VTM) in field studies (n = 181 patients) highlighted that, for the samples from same patients, SSTM could capture more symptomatic (26.67%, 4/15) and asymptomatic (52.63%, 10/19) COVID-19 patients. Compared to VTM, SSTM yielded significantly lower quantitative PCR (qPCR) threshold cycle (Ct) values (mean Ct > ?3.50), thereby improving diagnostic sensitivity of SSTM (18.79% [34/181]) versus that of VTM (11.05% [20/181]). Overall, SSTM had detection of COVID-19 patients 70% higher than that of VTM. Since the logistical and infrastructural constraints are not unique to India, our study highlights the invaluable global utility of SSTM as a key to accurately identify those infected and control COVID-19 transmission. Taken together, our data provide a strong justification to the adoption of SSTM for sample collection and transport during the pandemic. IMPORTANCE Approximately forty-four percent of the global population lives in villages, including 59% in Africa (https://unhabitat.org/World%20Cities%20Report%202020). The fast-evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2 and its extremely contagious nature warrant early and accurate COVID-19 diagnostics across rural and urban population as a key to prevent viral transmission. Unfortunately, lack of adequate infrastructure, including the availability of biosafety-compliant facilities and an end-to-end cold chain availability for COVID-19 molecular diagnosis, limits the accessibility of testing in these countries. Here, we fulfill this urgent unmet need by developing a sample collection and transport medium, SSTM, that does not require cold chain, neutralizes the virus quickly, and maintains the sample integrity at broad temperature range without compromising sensitivity. Further, we observed that use of SSTM in field studies during pandemic improved the diagnostic sensitivity, thereby establishing the feasibility of molecular testing even in the infrastructural constraints of remote, hilly, or rural communities in India and elsewhere.","output":"A Cold Chain-Independent Specimen Collection and Transport Medium Improves Diagnostic Sensitivity and Minimizes Biosafety Challenges of COVID-19 Molecular Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Torsional deformities of the lower limbs in children and adolescents are a common cause of in-toeing gait and cause gait deviations. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of children and adolescents with suspected Idiopathic Torsional Deformities (ITD) and pain, gait function, activity and participation. METHODS: A retrospective review of all children and adolescents who attended our Centre over a 5-year period for evaluation of the effect of ITD. All children completed three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA), standardized physical examination, medical imaging and the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI). Statistical analysis was completed using two sample t-tests, Pearson's Correlation and linear regression. RESULTS: Fifty children and adolescents, 40 females and 10 males with a mean age of 13.5 years were included. Children reported a high prevalence of pain(86%), had increased internal hip rotation(p = 0.002) and decreased external hip rotation(p < 0.001) on physical examination when compared to published normative data. Medical imaging showed a mean(SD) femoral neck anteversion (FNA) of 38(13) and external tibial torsion of 39(12). Mean(SD) PODCI score was 32(16), indicating these children are functioning below their typically developing peers. The 3DGA kinematics show deviations from typical data including hip rotation, foot progression, pelvic tilt, hip flexion and knee extension. Observed mild kinetic deviations were within typical limits. The relationship between FNA and gait parameters, FNA and PODCI and gait and PODCI were weak. SIGNIFICANCE: These children and adolescents have altered gait and experience pain leading to impaired function and diminished participation.

We aimed to investigate the impact of the pandemic on acute alcohol intoxication (AAI) in France. METHODS We identified all hospital stays related to alcohol abuse in 2018-2020. Differences in number of hospitalizations between 2019 and 2020 were tested using Poisson regressions. Differences between observed and expected deliveries of drugs used in alcohol dependence in 2020 were also studied. RESULTS There was a decrease in the number of hospitalizations for AAI between 2019 and 2020 (-9677[-114%],RR:089[088-089]). This decrease was observed among men and women of all age groups, except women  85 years. We observed an increase in in-hospital mortality during 2020 and more hospitalizations for AAI with certain medical complications, especially during the first 2020 lockdown. There was a drop in observed deliveries of drugs used in alcohol dependence during the first 2020 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS The decrease in the number of hospitalizations for AAI in 2020 could be explained by several factors: fewer available hospital beds due to COVID-19, individuals with AAI delaying or avoiding medical care due to COVID-19 fears, and decreases driven by younger age groups returning to live with parents and socializing less. While alcohol consumption patterns have changed with the implementation of social distancing measures and lockdowns, the increase in mortality and the share of hospitalizations with complications suggest that these measures had an impact on event severity in a context of strained access to healthcare.","output":"Effects of the 2020 health crisis on acute alcohol intoxication: A nationwide retrospective observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to determine the frequency of fragmented QRS (FQRS) in patients with SARS - COV - 2.

The data of the patients in the inpatient ward and in the intensive care unit were recorded separately. The duration of QRS and presence of FQRS were evaluated by two experienced cardiologists. The patients were divided into two groups as FQRS positive and FQRS negative considering presence of FQRS. Moreover, the frequency of FQRS in the patients in the inpatient ward and in the intensive care unit were compared with each other. RESULTS: FQRS was found in 24% of the patients who had SARS-COV-2. There was no difference between FQRS positive and negative groups in terms of age and gender. Heart rate was higher in FQRS positive group. C-reactive protein (7.25a?a?6.65a?mg/dl vs. 4.80a?a?4.48a?mg/dl; pa?=a?.02) levels were also significantly higher in the FQRS positive group.

Our computational studies identified six ligands as potential inhibitors against Rhizopus delemar, including 12,28-Oxamanzamine A, vialinin B and deoxytopsentin for CotH3; pramiconazole and saperconazole for Lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase; and Hesperidin for Mucoricin. Interestingly, 12,28-Oxamanzamine A showed a maximum binding affinity with all three proteins (CotH3: ? 10.2 kcal/mol Lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase: ? 10.9 kcal/mol Mucoricin: ? 8.6 kcal/mol). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our investigation identified 12,28-Oxamanzamine A, vialinin B, deoxytopsentin, pramiconazole, saperconazole and hesperidin as potent bioactive compounds for treating mucormycosis that may be considered for further optimisation techniques and in vitro and in vivo studies.

Indeed, outcomes of complex interventions are dependent on how the intervention is implemented in practice and evaluations of implementation process are therefore pivotal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which a transition program for adolescents with congenital heart disease was delivered as intended. Research questions were 1) to what level of fidelity was the program delivered? and 2) what potential moderating factors affected the delivery of the program and overall fidelity? METHODS: A mixed methods design was used, where a process evaluation was embedded in the STEPSTONES randomized controlled trial in Sweden. The implementation fidelity framework by Carrol (2007) and Hasson (2010) was used to design, collect and analyze data. Quantitative data consisted of intervention records on adherence and were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Qualitative data on moderators affecting fidelity were collected through interviews, log-books and focus group interviews with healthcare professionals implementing the intervention and participatory observations of the implementation process. Data were analyzed with deductive content analysis. Triangulation was used to integrate quantitative and qualitative data within the fidelity framework. RESULTS: Six out of eight components of the transition program were delivered to an extent that adhered to the program theory or achieved a high level of fidelity. However, components involving peer support had a low attendance by the participating sample (32.2%), and the joint transfer meeting was challenging to implement, despite achieving high adherence. Moderators affecting the implementation process were the adolescents and healthcare professionals engagement in the intervention, contextual factors and a lack of standard operating procedures for all components in the program. CONCLUSION: Barriers and facilitators for a future implementation of transition programs have been illuminated in this study. The use of an implementation fidelity framework in the process evaluation proved successful in providing a comprehensive evaluation of factors affecting the implementation process. However, implementation fidelity must be considered in relation to adaptations to the local and personal prerequisites in order to create interventions that can achieve fit.

METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we sought to assess the durability of rubella virus (RV)-specific humoral immunity in a healthy population (n = 98) of adolescents and young adults at two timepoints: ~7 and ~17 years after two doses of MMR-II? vaccination. Levels of circulating antibodies specific to RV were measured by ELISA and an immune-colorimetric neutralization assay. RV-specific memory B cell responses were also measured by ELISpot. RESULTS: Rubella-specific IgG antibody titers, neutralizing antibody titers, and memory B cell responses declined with increasing time since vaccination; however, these decreases were relatively moderate. Memory B cell responses exhibited a greater decline in men compared to women. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, rubella-specific humoral immunity declines following vaccination, although subjects' antibody titers remain well above the currently recognized threshold for protective immunity.

METHODS: Using a prospective cohort design, a two-stage methodology was conducted to collect data from women seeking maternal care at the King Abdullah University Hospital in northern Jordan. In the first stage, perceived social support was assessed among pregnant women using the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey. During the first six months after childbirth, postpartum women were contacted to complete the second stage, wherein their perceptions of infant-focused anxieties were assessed using the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale. In our study, two types of infant-focused anxieties were investigated among a final sample of 419 mothers: infant safety and welfare anxieties and practical infant care anxieties. RESULTS: The results of multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that providing pregnant women with high levels of emotional support from close social networks (= ?0.08, p= 0.01) and perceiving informational support from health care providers (= ?0.71, p< 0.01) were protective factors for reducing the levels of postpartum anxiety concerning infant safety and welfare. Our findings also demonstrated that pregnant mothers who perceived high informational support from health care providers had a lower level of postpartum anxiety about practical infant care (= ?0.20, p< 0.01). In contrast, mothers who reported receiving high tangible support from close social networks during pregnancy had a significantly higher level of perceived anxiety concerning practical infant care after delivery (= 0.13, p= 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that postpartum anxiety would be reduced if effective informational support were readily available for pregnant women. There is a clear need for building bridges between women, their families, and providers to distinguish the specific type and amount of support that should be provided to mothers during pregnancy.","output":"The Impact of Perceived Social Support During Pregnancy on Postpartum Infant-Focused Anxieties: A Prospective Cohort Study of Mothers in Northern Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Mode of delivery has become an important highlight in managing pregnancy with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the possible risk of viral transmission from mother to baby, especially during the peripartum period. This study aimed to review the mode of delivery and the possible risk of vertical transmission related to delivery routes in pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS Literature research was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCO database with the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pregnancy, vertical transmission, and delivery. The extracted data were as follows: author, country, study design number of cases, maternal age, mode of delivery, and the SARS-CoV-2 status in neonates. RESULTS Of 11 studies found, vaginal birth was reported in 218 cases (34.53%) and cesarean delivery was reported in 385 women (65.47%). The indication for cesarean delivery was majority due to COVID-19 related condition (53.61%). In total, 8 neonates who confirmed positive for COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay were reported. The pooled odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for SARS-CoV-2-positive neonates in cesarean delivery compared with vaginal birth was 0.622 (0.237-1.633) with p = 0.335.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical practices of spine surgeons within the Asia Pacific region. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 pandemic had changed spine surgeons' clinical practices and their concerns toward personal and family risk of infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out from May 4, 2020 to June 4, 2020. The questionnaire was administered using REDCAP. The online questionnaire includes four sections. First section includes surgeon's demographics, background, type of clinical practice, and status of pandemic in their country. Second section includes volume and the type of spine surgery practice before the COVID pandemic. Third section includes changes of clinical practice during the pandemic and the last section was regarding their concern on COVID transmission. RESULTS: Total of 222 respondents from 19 countries completed the questionnaire. During the pandemic, 92.3% of the respondents felt their clinical practice was affected. 58.5% respondents reported reduced outpatient clinic hours and 74.6% respondents reported reduced operation theatre hours due to the enforcement by the hospital administration. The mean reduction of clinic volume for all countries was 48.1%. There was a significant reduction in the number of surgeries performed in Japan, Malaysia, India, Philippines, and South Korea. This was due to reduced patient load. More than 60% of respondents were worried being infected by COVID-19 virus and >68% were worried of transmission to their family members. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the clinical and surgical practice of spine surgeons in the Asia Pacific region. Clinics were closed or the practice hours reduced. Similarly, surgical theaters were closed, reduced, or limited to semi-emergency and emergency surgeries. Spine surgeons were moderately concerned of contracting COVID-19 during their clinical practice but were extremely concerned to transmit this disease to their family members.

Media attention has highlighted the ways that global, coordinated access to vaccines has been limited during the pandemic. It has also exposed how some countries have secured vaccine supply, through bilateral purchase agreements and the way pharmaceutical companies have priced, negotiated, and delivered these supplies. Much of the focus of this debate has been on the vaccine supply winners and losers, but the voices of public opinion have been more limited. METHODS: We explore the concepts of vaccine nationalism and internationalism from the perspective of vaccine trial participants, using an empirical perspectives study that involved interviews with phase I/II COVID-19 vaccine trial participants in Oxford, UK. We surveyed and interviewed participants between September and October 2020 about their views, motivations and experiences in taking part in the trial. RESULTS: First, we show how trial participants describe national and international ideas about vaccination as intertwined and challenge claims that these positions are mutually exclusive or oppositional. Second, we analyse these viewpoints further to show that vaccine nationalism is closely connected with national pride and metaphors of a countrys scientific achievements. Participants held a global outlook and were highly supportive of the prioritisation of vaccines by global need, but many were also pessimistic that such a solution could be possible. CONCLUSION: Trial participants constitute an informed public group, with situated public expertise that the global community could draw on as an expert opinion. We argue that vaccine nationalism is strongly attached to national character and, therefore, it is more difficult for ownership of a vaccine to be though of as international.","output":"Vaccine nationalism and internationalism: perspectives of COVID-19 vaccine trial participants in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this survey-based study was to evaluate the implementation of virtual learning in a single academic general surgery program, compared with the well-established face-to-face academic curriculum used before. METHODS: From April 2020 to the present, virtual sessions were created via Zoom Videos Communications, Inc. (San Jose, CA, USA). A survey composed of 15 questions about the perceived quality and utility of the virtual sessions was developed. The survey was sent out to all general surgery residents of a general surgery program in November of 2020. RESULTS: All residents enrolled in the program answered the survey, i.e., 22 (73.3%) men and 8 (26.7%) women with 6 (20.2%) residents per year (PGY 1CPGY 5). Over half of residents (n = 17, 56.7%) felt similar academic performance during online sessions when compared to the older model. Perceptions of the level of organization of academic sessions increased during the online model (n = 20, 66.7%). Twenty (66.7%) residents agreed it was easier to attend sessions during the online model. Fourteen (46.7%) residents reported their attendance to the sessions increased, and 14 (46.7%) residents would prefer this modality after the pandemic is over, with 8 (26.7%) being neutral about it. CONCLUSION: This study, to our knowledge, is the first to survey general surgery residents about the transition from a face-to-face curriculum to an e?learning curriculum.

To histologically define neuropathological effects of IL-6 inhibition in an experimental VILI model. VILI was simulated in anesthetized adult mice using a 35cc/kg tidal volume mechanical ventilation model. There were two controls groups: 1) spontaneously breathing, or 2) anesthetized and mechanically ventilated with 10cc/kg tidal volume to distinguish effects of anesthesia from VILI. Two hours prior to inducing VILI, mice were treated with either anti-IL-6 antibody, anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, or saline. Neuronal injury, stress, and inflammation were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), a neuronal apoptosis marker, was significantly increased in the frontal (p<0.001) and hippocampal (p<0.0001) brain regions and accompanied by significant increases in c-Fos and heat shock protein-90 in the frontal cortices of VILI mice compared to controls (p<0.001). These findings were not related to cerebral hypoxia and there was no evidence of irreversible neuronal death. Frontal and hippocampal neuronal CC3 were significantly reduced with anti-IL-6 antibody (p<0.01 and p<0.0001, respectively), anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (p<0.05 and p<0.0001, respectively) compared to saline VILI mice.

Many pathogens subvert autophagy to enhance their replication, but the mechanisms these pathogens use to initiate the autophagy process have not been elucidated. This study identifies rotavirus as a pathogen that encodes a viroporin, nonstructural protein 4, which releases endoplasmic reticulum calcium into the cytoplasm, thereby activating a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase- and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling pathway to initiate autophagy. Rotavirus hijacks this membrane trafficking pathway to transport viral proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to sites of viral replication to produce infectious virus. This process requires PI3K activity and autophagy-initiation proteins Atg3 and Atg5, and it is abrogated by chelating cytoplasmic calcium or inhibiting calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-. Although the early stages of autophagy are initiated, rotavirus infection also blocks autophagy maturation. These studies identify a unique mechanism of virus-mediated, calcium-activated signaling that initiates autophagy and hijacks this membrane trafficking pathway to transport viral proteins to sites of viral assembly.","output":"Autophagy hijacked through viroporin-activated calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase- signaling is required for rotavirus replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The generation of mean flows is a long-standing issue in rotating fluids.

Using boundary-layer theory, we determine the mean zonal flows generated by nonlinear interactions within the viscous Ekman layer. These flows are of interest because they survive in the relevant planetary regime of both vanishing forcings and viscous effects. We extend the theory to take into account (i) the combination of spatial and temporal perturbations, providing new mechanically driven zonal flows (e.g. driven by latitudinal librations), and (ii) the spheroidal geometry relevant for planetary bodies. Wherever possible, our analytical predictions are validated with direct numerical simulations. The theoretical solutions are in good quantitative agreement with the simulations, with expected discrepancies (zonal jets) in the presence of inertial waves generated at the critical latitudes (as for precession). Moreover, we find that the mean zonal flows can be strongly affected in spheroids.

[...]the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine mandates, opposition to school-based vaccination requirements was perhaps the foremost expression of vaccine resistance in modern life. In some regards, medical questions are a very present but ever-evolving concern for vaccine-hesitant parents.2 The 1970s and 1980s saw a rise of antivaccination parental advocacy in the United States and the United Kingdom, spurred by a potential link between pertussis vaccination and neurologic disorders.3 More recently, Andrew Wakefield's now debunked work suggested a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.4,5 In each case, however, concerns lingered long after it was made clear scientifically that these concerns were unfounded.3,6 The controversy over school-based vaccination requirements can also be analyzed using the rights-based framework articulated in Colgrove and Samuel's work, giving us better insight into the durability of vaccine hesitancy even after specific medical concerns are allayed. In 1922, the Supreme Court established, in Zucht v. King, that conditioning access to education on vaccine compliance did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.7 Rosalyn Zucht, the plaintiff, relied on a rights-based framing to justify her opposition to the vaccine mandate in question, arguing that it violated her liberty without affording her due process to contest the vaccination requirements. \\"9 Decades later, in a taxonomy of antivaccine advocates post-Wakefield, Anna Kirkland noted that a radical antivaccine underpinning comes from what she terms the \\"libertarian health freedom movement,\\" which includes a political theory of government illegitimacy in all healthcare matters.6 Many of the advocacy groups she studied, such as the Citizens' Council for Health Freedom (an advocacy group of nonphysicians) and the American College of Physicians and Surgeons (an ideologically right-wing group of private physicians that is now more commonly known as the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons), can be seen as the political and philosophical heirs to groups discussed by Colgrove and Samuel, such as the Anti-Vaccination League of America.","output":"Understanding Vaccine Hesitancy and Refusal Through a Rights-Based Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are a growing number of areas, e.g. epidemiology and within-organism cancer evolution, where re-analysing all available data from scratch every time new data becomes available or old data is refined is no longer feasible. All these and related areas can benefit from online phylogenetic inference that can booster previous data analyses. Here, we make the case that adding/removing taxa from an analysis can have substantial non-local impact on the tree that is inferred, both in a model based setting, as well as for distance based methods. Consequently, online phylogenetic algorithms may require global updates of the trees and other parameters, a task that in general is highly non-trivial. Motivated by this observation, we designed an online algorithm that benefits from a parallelism in a Bayesian setting that is substantially more efficient than re-running the analysis from scratch. Furthermore, our algorithm is not sensitive to the number of sequences added, allowing the sequence data to grow/be refined iteratively.

Lassa fever, caused by LASV, results in thousands of annual deaths. Although decades have elapsed since the identification of the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) as a natural reservoir of LASV, little effort has been made to characterize LASV infection in its reservoir. The natural route of infection and transmission of LASV within M. natalensis remains unknown, and the clinical impact of LASV in M. natalensis is mostly undescribed. Herein, using an outbred colony of M. natalensis, we investigate the replication and dissemination dynamics of LASV in this reservoir following various inoculation routes. Inoculation with LASV, regardless of route, resulted in a systemic infection and accumulation of abundant LASV-RNA in many tissues. LASV infection in the Natal multimammate mice was subclinical, however, clinical chemistry values were transiently altered and immune infiltrates were observed histologically in lungs, spleens and livers, indicating a minor disease with coordinated immune responses are elicited, controlling infection. Intranasal infection resulted in unique virus tissue dissemination dynamics and heightened LASV shedding, compared to subcutaneous inoculation. Our study provides important insights into LASV infection in its natural reservoir using a contemporary infection system, demonstrating that specific inoculation routes result in disparate dissemination outcomes, suggesting intranasal inoculation is important in the maintenance of LASV in the natural reservoir, and emphasizes that selection of the appropriate inoculation route is necessary to examine aspects of viral replication, transmission and responses to zoonotic viruses in their natural reservoirs.","output":"Inoculation route-dependent Lassa virus dissemination and shedding dynamics in the natural reservoir C Mastomys natalensis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is changing rapidly and requires different strategies to maintain immunization.

We plan to evaluate the adverse events (AEs) and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines in HCWs at a single center. This cohort study included HCWs fully vaccinated with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1. Blood samples were taken eight weeks after the second vaccination with both COVID-19 vaccines and six months after the second vaccination from participants with the BNT162b2 vaccine. The primary endpoint for immunogenicity was the serum neutralizing antibody responses eight weeks after vaccination. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of various AEs within 28 days of each vaccination. Between 16 March and 23 June 2021, 115 participants were enrolled (65 in the ChAdOx1 group and 50 in the BNT162b2 group). Significantly higher surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) inhibition was observed in participants vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 (mean (SD) 91.4 (9.68)%) than in those vaccinated with ChAdOx1 (mean (SD) 73.3 (22.57)%). The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine was maintained across all age and gender categories. At six months after the second dose, serum antibody levels declined significantly in the BNT162b2 group.

In the case of China, the trust of rural women has undergone tremendous changes along with the development of rural areas. It is seen that the trust of rural women has changed from localized to generalized trust, and it is stated that the major factor leading to this transformation is education. To explore the phenomenon empirically, the current study uses the survey data of rural women sourced from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) over the year 2018. Through the ordered probit model, the study reveals that education plays a significant role in influencing rural womens generalized trust and localized trust. Through mediation analysis, the study further reveals that reliance on Internet information, access to public resources, and income are the factors mediating the relationship between education and generalized trust. Besides, the outcomes further unveil that the impact of education on localized trust is stronger when the level of mobility is low. For robustness check, the current study additionally employs a regression discontinuity model.

A cross-sectional survey and comparisons of key biomarkers between survivors and nonsurvivors were performed. Results: : Over the study period, 42 nonsurvivors and 52 survivors were included. The overall case fatality rate for critical patients with COVID-19 was approximately 45%. The average age was 69.179.55 years, and the majority had underlying health problems such as hypertension (56[60%]) and diabetes (18[19%]). The median length of ICU stay was 8 days (IQR 4, 13). Compared with survivors, nonsurvivors were more likely to develop sepsis (42[100%] vs. 34[65%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (40[95%] vs. 28[54%]) and organ dysfunction. In addition, the dynamic changes in some biomarkers were significantly different between the two groups. The trajectories of temperature revealed that the group with a high temperature on admission that steadily declined had the highest percentage of deaths (93.33%). Conclusion: Patients aged 60 years or older with many concomitant diseases were at highest risk, and the fatality rate started to increase with age.

However, the signals directing ASC migration into the inflamed CNS are poorly characterized. This study demonstrates that CXCR3 mediates CNS accumulation of ASC during neurotropic coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis. Expansion of CXCR3-expressing ASC in draining lymph nodes prior to accumulation within the CNS was consistent with their recruitment by sustained expression of CXCR3 ligands during viral persistence. Both total and virus-specific ASC were reduced greater than 80% in the CNS of infected CXCR3(-/-) mice. Similar T cell CNS recruitment and local T cell-dependent antiviral activity further indicated that the ASC migration defect was T cell independent. Furthermore, in contrast to the reduction of ASC in the CNS, neither virus-specific ASC trafficking to bone marrow nor antiviral serum antibody was reduced relative to levels in control mice. Impaired ASC recruitment into the CNS of infected CXCR3(-/-) mice coincided with elevated levels of persisting viral RNA, sustained infectious virus, increased clinical disease, and mortality. These results demonstrate that CXCR3 ligands are indispensable for recruitment of activated ASC into the inflamed CNS and highlight their local protective role during persistent infection.","output":"CXCR3-dependent plasma blast migration to the central nervous system during viral encephalomyelitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Regulatory T cells (Tregs), traditionally recognized as potent suppressors of immune response, are increasingly attracting attention because of a second major function: residing in parenchymal tissues and maintaining local homeostasis. However, the existence, unique phenotype and function of so-called tissue Tregs in the heart remain unclear. Methods: In mouse models of myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R injury) or cardiac cryoinjury, the dynamic accumulation of Tregs in the injured myocardium was monitored. The bulk RNA-sequencing was performed to analyze the transcriptomic characteristics of Tregs from the injured myocardium after MI or I/R injury. Photoconversion, parabiosis, single-cell TCR sequencing and adoptive transfer were applied to determine the source of heart Tregs. The involvement of the interleukin (IL)-33/ST2 axis and secreted acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein (Sparc), a molecule upregulated in heart Tregs, was further evaluated in functional assays. Results: We showed that Tregs were highly enriched in the myocardium of MI, I/R injury and cryoinjury mice. Transcriptomic data revealed that Tregs isolated from the injured hearts had plenty of differentially expressed transcripts compared to their lymphoid counterparts including heart draining lymphoid nodes, with a phenotype of promoting infarct repair, indicating a unique characteristic. The heart Tregs were accumulated mainly due to recruitment from circulating Treg pool, while local proliferation also contributed to their expansion. Moreover, a remarkable case of repeatedly detected TCR of heart Tregs, more than that of spleen Tregs, suggests a model of clonal expansion. Besides, HelioshighNrp-1high phenotype proved the mainly thymic origin of heart Tregs, with a small contribution of phenotypic conversion of conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs), proved by the analysis of TCR repertoires and Tconvs adoptive transfer experiments. Notably, the IL-33/ST2 axis was essential for sustaining heart Treg populations. Finally, we demonstrated that Sparc, which was highly expressed by heart Tregs, acted as a critical factor to protect the heart against MI by increasing collagen content and boosting maturation in the infarct zone. Conclusions: We identified and characterized a phenotypically and functionally unique population of heart Tregs, which may lay the foundation to harness Tregs for cardioprotection in MI and other cardiac diseases.","output":"A Unique Population of Regulatory T Cells in Heart Potentiates Cardiac Protection from Myocardial Infarction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the increasing spread of COVID-19 in the U.S., with currently the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths in the world, most states in the nation have enforced travel restrictions resulting in drastic reductions in mobility and travel.

Diagnosing these infections using nucleic acid amplification presents technical challenges, one of which is facilitating the different optimal annealing temperatures needed for each virus. To overcome this problem we developed a diagnostic molecular strip which combined a generic nested touchdown protocol with in-house primer master-mixes that could recognise 12 common respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Over an 18 month period a total of 222 specimens were tested by both immunofluorescence and the molecular strip. The specimens came from 103 males (median age 3.5 y), 80 females (median age 9 y) and 5 quality assurance scheme specimens. Viruses were recovered from a number of specimen types including broncho-alveolar lavage, nasopharyngeal secretions, sputa, post-mortem lung tissue and combined throat and nasal swabs. Viral detection by IF was poor in sputa and respiratory swabs. A total of 99 viruses were detected in the study from 79 patients and 4 quality control specimens: 31 by immunofluorescence and 99 using the molecular strip. The strip consistently out-performed immunofluorescence with no loss of diagnostic specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The touchdown protocol with pre-dispensed primer master-mixes was suitable for replacing virus culture for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses which were negative by immunofluorescence.

METHODS We did a retrospective database review of all patients receiving CHLT at a children's hospital between 2006 and 2014. Information collected included preoperative characteristics, intraoperative management, blood transfusions, and postoperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Five pediatric CHLTs were performed over an 8-year period. All patients had a history of complex CHD with multiple sternotomies, three of whom had failing Fontan physiology. Patient age ranged from 7 to 23 years and weight from 29.5 to 68.5 kg. All CHLTs were performed using an en-bloc technique where both the donor heart and liver were implanted together on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The median operating room time was 14.25 h, median CPB time was 3.58 h, and median donor ischemia time was 4.13 h. Patients separated from CPB on dopamine, epinephrine, and milrinone infusions and two required inhaled nitric oxide. All patients received a massive intraoperative blood transfusion post CPB with amounts ranging from one to three times the patient's estimated blood volume. The patient who required the most transfusions was in decompensated heart and liver failure preoperatively. Four of the five patients received an antifibrinolytic agent as well as a procoagulant (prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant activated Factor VII) to assist with hemostasis. There were no 30-day thromboembolic events detected. Postoperatively the median length of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and stay to hospital discharge was 4, 8, and 37 days, respectively.

METHODS: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, randomised, parallel group phase 2 trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of oral angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist C21 in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and CRP  50-150 mg/L conducted at eight sites in India (NCT04452435). Patients were randomly assigned 100 mg C21 bid or placebo for 7 days in addition to standard of care. Primary endpoint: reduction in CRP. The study period was 21 July to 13 October 2020. FINDINGS: 106 patients were randomised and included in the analysis (51 C21, 55 placebo). There was no significant group difference in reduction of CRP, 81% and 78% in the C21 and placebo groups, respectively, with a treatment effect ratio of 0.85 [90% CI 0.57, 1.26]. In a secondary analysis in patients requiring supplemental oxygen at randomisation, CRP was reduced in the C21 group compared to placebo. At the end of the 7-day treatment, 37 (72.5%) and 30 (54.5%) of the patients did not require supplemental oxygen in the C21 and placebo group, respectively (OR 2.20 [90% CI 1.12, 4.41]). A post hoc analysis showed that at day 14, the proportion of patients not requiring supplemental oxygen was 98% and 80% in the C21 group compared to placebo (OR 12.5 [90% CI 2.9, 126]). Fewer patients required mechanical ventilation (one C21 patient; four placebo patients), and C21 was associated with a numerical reduction in the mortality rate (one vs three in the C21 and placebo group, respectively). Treatment with C21 was safe and well tolerated. INTERPRETATION: Among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 receiving C21 for 7 days there was no reduction in CRP compared to placebo. However, a post-hoc analysis indicated a marked reduction of requirement for oxygen at day 14.

Timely and effective predictors of survival and death rates are crucial for improving the management of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we evaluated the predictors of mortality based on the demographics, comorbidities, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and vital signs of 500 patients with COVID-19 admitted at Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, the biggest hospital in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: Five hundred hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Subsequently, electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, and laboratory test results were collected and analyzed. They were divided into two groups: expired and discharged. Demographics, clinical, and laboratory data were compared among the two groups. The related factors with death in the patients were determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression approaches. RESULTS: Among the 500 hospitalized patients, most patients were male (66.4% versus 33.6%). The expired group had more patients ?70 years of age compared with the discharged group (32.9% versus 16.3%, respectively). Almost 66% of the expired patients were hospitalized for ?5 days which was higher than the discharge group (26.9%). Patients with a history of opium use in the expired group were significantly higher compared to the discharged group (14.8% versus 8.6%, p = 0.04) as well as a history of cancer (15.5% versus 4.7%, p < 0.001). Out of the 500 patients with COVID-19, four patients (2.6%) were HIV positive, all of whom expired. Dyspnea (76.4%), fever (56.6%), myalgia (59.9%), and dry cough (67%) were the most common chief complaints of hospitalized patients. Age ?70 years (adjusted odds ratio = 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.02C6.04), being female (adjusted odds ratio = 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.25C3.41), days of hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio = 5.73; 95% confidence interval, 3.49C9.41), and having cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 3.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.42C7.39) were identified as independent predictors of mortality among COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Discharged and expired COVID-19 patients had distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics, which were separated by principal component analysis.

There have been concerns that care deferral may have negative health effects, but it is hoped that telemedicine can provide a viable alternative. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand what type of health care services were being deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the role played by telemedicine to fill in care gaps, and changes in attitudes toward telemedicine. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of survey responses from 1694 primary care patients in a mid-sized northeastern city. Our main outcomes were use of telemedicine and reports of care deferral during the shutdown. RESULTS: Deferred care was widespread-48% (n=812) of respondents deferred care-but it was largely for preventive services, particularly dental and primary care, and did not cause concerns about negative health effects. In total, 30.2% (n=242) of those who delayed care were concerned about health effects, with needs centered around orthopedics and surgery. Telemedicine was viewed more positively than prior to the pandemic; it was seen as a viable option to deliver deferred care, particularly by respondents who were over 65 years of age, female, and college educated. Mental health services stood out for having high levels of deferred care. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary health system shutdowns will give rise to deferred care. However, much of the deferrals will be for preventive services. The effect of this on patient health can be moderated by prioritizing surgical and orthopedic services and delivering other services through telemedicine. Having telemedicine as an option is particularly crucial for mental health services.","output":"Consumer Reported Care Deferrals Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the Role and Potential of Telemedicine: Cross-Sectional Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During COVID-19, many people in the world experienced tremendous suffering.

Traditionally, the Korean Church has not had much concern about the matter of public worship and the sacraments for those who are cognitively challenged, except for a few churches which have special departments for ministries to special populations. During the COVID-19 situation, these ministries have slowed, which means that those who benefited have had few opportunities to join worship services or participate in religious education.

Bitter taste receptor phenotype appears to be associated with the clinical course and symptom duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between T2R phenotype and patient clinical course after infection with SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study was performed from July 1 through September 30, 2020, at a tertiary outpatient clinical practice and inpatient hospital in the United States among 1935 participants (patients and health care workers) with occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. EXPOSURE: Exposure to SARS-CoV-2. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants underwent T2R38 phenotype taste testing to determine whether they were supertasters (those who experienced greater intensity of bitter tastes), tasters, or nontasters (those who experienced low intensity of bitter tastes or no bitter tastes) and underwent evaluation for lack of infection with SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and IgM and IgG testing. A group of participants was randomly selected for genotype analysis to correlate phenotype. Participants were followed up until confirmation of infection with SARS-CoV-2 via PCR testing. Phenotype of T2R38 was retested after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The results were compared with clinical course. RESULTS: A total of 1935 individuals (1101 women [56.9%]; mean [SD] age, 45.5 [13.9] years) participated in the study. Results of phenotype taste testing showed that 508 (26.3%) were supertasters, 917 (47.4%) were tasters, and 510 (26.4%) were nontasters. A total of 266 participants (13.7%) had positive PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 55 (20.7%) required hospitalization. Symptom duration among patients with positive results ranged from 0 to 48 days. Nontasters were significantly more likely than tasters and supertasters to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio, 10.1 [95% CI, 5.8-17.8]; P < .001), to be hospitalized once infected (odds ratio, 3.9 [1.5-10.2]; P = .006), and to be symptomatic for a longer duration (mean [SE] duration, 23.7 [0.5] days vs 13.5 [0.4] days vs 5.0 [0.6] days; P < .001). A total of 47 of 55 patients (85.5%) with COVID-19 who required inpatient admission were nontasters. Conversely, 15 of 266 patients (5.6%) with positive PCR test results were supertasters. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study suggests that T2R38 receptor allelic variants were associated with participants innate immune response toward SARS-CoV-2. The T2R phenotype was associated with patients clinical course after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nontasters were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the other 2 groups, suggesting enhanced innate immune protection against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Association Between Bitter Taste Receptor Phenotype and Clinical Outcomes Among Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advancing age and chronic health conditions, significant risk factors for severe COVID-19, are associated with a pro-inflammatory state, termed inflamm-aging.

In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or slowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social distancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of social sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing down some others so that the social contacts across the network can be minimized. We model this problem as a network population game, where every individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can minimize all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be found for every one, when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large class of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes many well studied network types, which are easy to identify or construct, and can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or allow certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular subnetworks.

METHODS: Using electronic health record data from 47 practices within a large pediatric primary care network, we identified visits for ARTI from April to September 2020. For these visits, we categorized antibiotic management consistent with clinical guidelines as guideline concordant. We compared telemedicine and in-person visit guideline-concordant antibiotic management, diagnoses, and antibiotic prescribing using chi-square tests and examined trends over time using descriptive statistics. Antibiotic stewardship during the study period included learning collaborative videoconferences and sharing of clinic and clinician-level metrics through an interactive dashboard. RESULTS: During the 6-month period, 8332 ARTI visits were identified, with 3003 (36%) via telemedicine.

The computational expense of explicitly integrating the equations of motion in molecular dynamics currently is a severe limit on the number and length of trajectories which can be generated for complex systems. Approximate, but more computationally efficient, generative models can be used in place of explicit integration of the equations of motion, and can produce meaningful trajectories at greatly reduced computational cost. Here, we demonstrate a very simple synMD approach using a fine-grained Markov state model (MSM) with states mapped to specific atomistic configurations, which provides an exactly solvable reference. We anticipate this simple approach will enable rapid, effective testing of enhanced sampling algorithms in highly non-trivial models for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium problems. We demonstrate the use of a MSM to generate atomistic synMD trajectories for the fast-folding miniprotein Trp-cage, at a rate of over 200 milliseconds per day on a standard workstation. We employ a non-standard clustering for MSM generation that appears to better preserve kinetic properties at shorter lag times than a conventional MSM. We also show a parallelizable workflow that backmaps discrete synMD trajectories to full-coordinate representations at dynamic resolution for efficient analysis.","output":"Simple synthetic molecular dynamics for efficient trajectory generation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Mapping of COVID-19 infection in the city can help us know more about how the disease is distributed and spread. This study was conducted to investigate the geographical distribution of probable COVID-19 patients who were transferred to destination hospitals by emergency medical services (EMS) in the first wave of the epidemic, in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed based on recorded missions during the first 3-month period of the pandemic in Tehran, Iran. All probable cases of COVID-19 who were transferred to the hospitals following contact with Tehran EMS during the study period were enrolled. Arc-GIS software was utilized to draw the distribution map of the contact places of the cases. RESULTS: In this study, the data of 4018 patients were analyzed (60.9% male). The mean age of the patients was 54.1  20.7 years; and the mean age of the patients had increased with time during the studied 3 months (p = 0.003). The average incidence rate of this disease in Tehran during the study period was 4.6 per 10,000 population. Generally, the lowest and highest raw frequencies of Tehran COVID-19 contamination were seen in municipal districts 21 and 4, respectively. The raw frequency of cases during the 3-month study period also showed that the highest number of cases in Tehran occurred in municipal districts 5 and 4, respectively. CONCLUSION: In the present study, using geographic information systems (GIS), geographical distribution map of COVID-19 in Tehran, Iran, during the first 3 months of the pandemic was drawn.","output":"The Geographical Distribution of Probable COVID-19 Patients Transferred by Tehran Emergency Medical Services; a Cross Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of COVID-19, major media outlets and health organizations have been eager to provide projections on the spread of infectious disease through a population based on different variables.

Main funding source(s): Part of this project was realized with financial support from the city of Antwerp in the context of the call \\"Innovative solutions for Corona BACKGROUND: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face cardiology visits had to be replaced by teleconsultations but lacking the standard performed electrocardiogram. Instead, app-based monitoring of patients heart rate and rhythm using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology was available as an alternative to aid these teleconsultations. PURPOSE: Evaluation of the feasibility to initiate remotely PPG recordings with FibriCheck (Qompium, Hasselt, Belgium) and of the value of using FibriCheck before and after teleconsultation to substitute in-person arrhythmia consultations in three Belgian hospitals (Antwerp University Hospital, Heilig-Hart Hospital Lier and Jessa Hospital Hasselt). METHODS: Patients known with AF or with suspected arrhythmia symptoms during teleconsultation were contacted for the activation of FibriCheck seven days before or after a teleconsultation respectively, as shown in Figure 1. Instructions and a QR code were sent to the patients to download and activate FibriCheck. The code automatically links the application to an online platform available for the treating physician. Patients were asked to record their heart rhythm three times a day and when they experienced symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 92 patients (mean age: 64.7  17.4) were contacted during the first COVID-19 peak, of which a total of 22 patients declined because not owing a smartphone or tablet (n = 11) or they were not willing or not capable to use FibriCheck (n = 11). A significant age difference was seen between the 22 non-participants versus the 70 participants (mean age 73.8  18.7 vs. 61.9  15.9; p = 0.004). Half of the patients, eligible for PPG monitoring (n = 38, 54.9%), were initiated before a planned (tele)consultation. Of these, four patients (10.5%) were diagnosed with an arrhythmia by using FibriCheck, of which two had frequent extrasystoles and two had a recurrence of AF and rate control was adapted. Of the 32 patients who used FibriCheck after a teleconsultation due to symptomatic palpitations, extrasystoles (n = 3) or high suspicion for a new AF diagnosis (n = 2) was established via FibriCheck. Early in-office evaluation was organised for the patients with a new diagnosis of AF, and rhythm control was initiated. In the majority of patients (57.1%), teleconsultation with FibriCheck was reassuring so that they could be followed-up according to their normal schedule. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, cardiologists were able to obtain important additional information using the FibriCheck application when performing teleconsultations. The possibility to successfully complete teleconsultations using the FibriCheck data, and its broad applicability, create opportunities to implement FibriCheck in standard clinical practice as an easy tool to monitor patients before or after in-person consultations or even hospitalisations.","output":"App based monitoring of heart rate via FibriCheck to facilitate teleconsultations: from COVID-19 to clinical practice?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: First detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the novel coronavirus (i e , \\"COVID-19\\") pandemic stretched the medical system in Wuhan and posed an immense challenge to the state's risk communication efforts Timely access to quality healthcare information during outbreaks of infectious diseases can be effective to curtail the spread of disease and feelings of anxiety While these existing studies have greatly extended our knowledge about online health information seeking behavior, processes and motivations, rarely have the findings been applied to an outbreak Moreover, there is relatively little recent research on how people in China are using the Internet for seeking health information in a time of a pandemic OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to explore how people in China are using the Internet for seeking health information in a time of a pandemic Drawing on previous research of online health information seeking, this study asks the following research questions: How was the \\"#COVID-19 Patient Seeking Help\\" hashtag being used by patients in Wuhan seeking health information on Weibo at the peak of the outbreak?;What kinds of health information were patients in Wuhan seeking on Weibo at the peak of the outbreak?

Since then, multiple studies have examined this association with a handful also exploring the role of facility quality in explaining resident deaths from the virus. Despite this wide interest, no previous study has investigated how the relation between quality and COVID-19 mortality among nursing home residents may have changed, if at all, over the progression of the pandemic. This understanding is indeed lacking given that prior studies are either cross-sectional or are analyses limited to one specific state or region of the country. To address this gap, we analyzed changes in nursing home resident deaths across the US between June 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021 (n = 12,415 nursing homes X 8 months) using both descriptive and multivariable statistics. We merged publicly available data from multiple federal agencies with mortality rate (per 100,000 residents) as the outcome and CMS 5-star quality rating as the primary explanatory variable of interest. Covariates, based on the prior literature, consisted of both facility- and community-level characteristics. Findings from our secondary analysis provide robust evidence of the association between nursing home quality and resident deaths due to the virus diminishing over time. In connection, we discuss plausible reasons, especially duration of staff shortages, that over time might have played a critical role in driving the quality-mortality convergence across nursing homes in the US.","output":"Interpreting COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents in the US: The changing role of facility quality over time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 Coronavirus variants are emerging across the globe causing ongoing pandemics. It is important to estimate the case fatality ratio (CFR) during such an epidemic of a potentially fatal disease. METHODS: Firstly, we have performed a non-parametric approach for odds ratios with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) and illustrated relative risks and cumulative mortality rates of COVID-19 data of Spain. We have demonstrated the modified non-parametric approach based on Kaplan-Meier (KM) technique using COVID-19 data of Italy. We have also performed the significance of characteristics of patients regarding outcome by age for both gender. Furthermore, we have applied a non-parametric cure model using Nadaraya-Watson weight to estimate cure-rate using Israel data. Simulations are based on R- software. RESULTS: The analytical illustrations of these approaches predict the effects of patients based on covariates in different scenarios. Sex differences are increased from ages less than 60 years to 60-69 years but decreased thereafter with the smallest sex difference at ages 80 years in a case for estimating both purposes RR (Relative Risk) and OR (Odds Ratio). The non-parametric approach investigates the range of cure-rate ranges from 5.3% to 9% and from 4% to 7% approximately for male and female respectively. The modified KM estimator performs for such censored data and detects the changes in CFR more rapidly for both gender and age-wise. CONCLUSION: Older-age, male-sex, number of comorbidities and access to timely health care are identified as some of the risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in Spain. The non-parametric approach has investigated the influence of covariates on models and it provides the effect in both gender and age.

RESULTS: A case-control study was conducted on 55 COVID-19 as the case and 55 matched control pregnant women in Hormozgan, Iran. Patients were considered to be cases if they had a positive COVID-19 test plus a positive chest X-ray result. Our measures were COVID-19 symptoms, including laboratory evaluations, clinical symptoms, and maternal and neonatal outcomes. The most prevalent symptoms related to COVID-19 were fever (69.09%) and cough (58.18%). Less common symptoms included fatigue, diarrhea, shortness of breath, sore throat, and myalgia. Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (58.18%) and antibiotic therapy (45.45%) were the most prevalent management in COVID-19 patients. Based on our findings, maternal and obstetric outcomesneonatal in case groupssuch as mode of delivery, premature rupture of membrane, postpartum hemorrhage, perineal resection rate, neonates birth weight, Apgar score, and neonatal asphyxia rate were similar to pregnant women without COVID-19. We observed a higher incidence rate of premature delivery in COVID-19 cases (25 vs. 10%) (p < 0.05).

Serum was also obtained following immunization with approved vaccines. IgG antibody to the spike protein binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was assayed with a fluorescent bead-based immunoassay that takes advantage of the high dynamic range of fluorescent molecules using flow cytometry. A sensitive and high-throughput neutralization assay that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein onto a lentivirus and measures pseudoviral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK-293 cells was used. Results: 436 patients were enrolled (mean age 17 years, range 2-26 years, 58% male, 71% Crohn disease, 29% ulcerative colitis, IBD-unspecified). 44 (10%) of enrolled subjects had SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG antibodies.

Results revealed droplet travel distances of almost 2 m for the strongest cough case. Also, the presence of droplets smaller than 5 mu m of diameter, the main virus spreader, was considerably larger than particles of bigger size. Additionally, most of the droplets evaporate or fall to the ground within 2 s after their injection. The remaining ones that stayed above the waistline or remained suspended in the air followed trajectories coming from buoyancy effects rather than being driven by the initial velocity profile.

There was hardly any previous experience in the areas of videotherapy and -consultations (15.4% and 3%, respectively), but at the same time mostly imaginability of implementation (54.2% and 56%, respectively) and the belief that they could motivate themselves to do so (51.8%). A total of 69% welcomed technical support for the implementation of videotherapy. CONCLUSION: In principle, there seems to be both, a need and an interest in telematics in healthcare such as videotherapy and video consultations, even if further barriers such as technical implementation need to be addressed. An expansion of telemedical services and infrastructure seems desirable not only in the pandemic situation, but also in the long term against the backdrop of demographic change, especially in an area like Schleswig-Holstein. Further studies are needed.","output":"Parkinsons patients situation during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic and their interest in telemedicine A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Qi-Shen-Ke-Li (QSKL), a traditional Chinese formula prepared from six herbs, has long been used for the treatment of coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure. However, the herbal combination mechanism and underlying material basis of this multi-herbal formula are not clear. In this study, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method to simultaneously determine multiple bioactive compounds in QSKL was established and validated. Using the developed method, 18 bioactive components in rat plasma after oral administration of QSKL formula and its single herb extracts were quantified. Based on these results, PK parameters (T1/2 , Tmax , Cmax , AUC0-48h , and AUC0-&#8734; ) of the 18 bioactive components were analyzed and compared by using PKSlover 2.0 PK software. The experimental data suggested that significant changes in PK profiles were observed between the QSKL formula and its single herb extracts. The herbal combination in QSKL significantly influences the system exposure and the PK behaviors of the 18 bioactive components, indicating multicomponent interactions among the herbs. This study provides insight into the herbal combination mechanism and underlying material basis of the QSKL formula.","output":"Quantitative analysis and pharmacokinetic comparison of multiple bioactive components in rat plasma after oral administration of Qi-Shen-Ke-Li formula and its single herb extracts by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Photobioelectrocatalysis has recently attracted particular research interest owing to the possibility to achieve sunlight-driven biosynthesis, biosensing, power generation, and other niche applications.

We investigated whether the type of surgeons facemask impacts patients perception of the physicianCpatient relationship, influences their understanding of what the surgeon said, or affects their perceived empathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with an appointment in the orthopedic outpatient clinic of a tertiary university hospital during the 2-week study period were included. During consultations, all surgeons wore a non-transparent (first study week) or transparent facemask (second study week). Results of 285 of 407 eligible patients were available for analysis. The doctorCpatient relationship was evaluated using the standardized Patient Reactions Assessment (PRA) and a 10-point Likert-scale questionnaire ranging from 0 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). RESULTS: A non-transparent facemask led to more restrictions in the physicianCpatient communication and a worse understanding of what the surgeon said. Patients understanding improved with a transparent facemask with greatest improvements reported by patients aged 65 years and older (non-transparent: 6 [IQR 5C10] vs. transparent: 10 [IQR 9C10], p < 0.001) and by patients with a self-reported hearing impairment (non-transparent: 7 [IQR 3C7] vs. transparent: 9 [IQR 9C10], p < 0.001). The median PRA score was higher when surgeons wore a transparent facemask (p = 0.003).

SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, infects hosts after binding to ACE2 receptors present on cells from many structures pertaining to the respiratory, cardiac, hematological, neurological, renal and gastrointestinal systems. COVID-19, however, appears to trigger a severe cytokine storm syndrome in pulmonary structures, resulting in oxidative stress, exacerbated inflammation and alveolar injury. Due to the recent nature of this disease no treatments have shown complete efficacy and safety. More recently, however, researchers have begun to direct some attention towards GSH and NAC. These natural antioxidants play an essential role in several biological processes in the body, especially the maintenance of the redox equilibrium. In fact, many diseases appear to be strongly related to severe oxidative stress and deficiency of endogenous GSH. The high ratios of ROS over GSH, in particular, appear to reflect severity of symptoms and prolonged hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. This imbalance interferes with the body's ability to detoxify the cellular microenvironment, fold proteins, replenish antioxidant levels, maintain healthy immune responses and even modulate apoptotic events. Oral administration of GSH and NAC is convenient and safe, but they are susceptible to degradation in the digestive tract. Considering this drawback, nebulization of GSH and NAC as an adjuvant therapy may therefore be a viable alternative for the management of the early stages of COVID-19.","output":"Nebulization of Glutathione and N-Acetylcysteine as an Adjuvant Therapy for COVID-19 Onset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is associated with significant impairment of functioning and high treatment costs. Identification of patients at high risk of TRS at the time of their initial diagnosis may significantly improve clinical outcomes and minimise social and functional disability. We aim to develop a prognostic model for predicting the risk of developing TRS in patients with first-episode schizophrenia and to examine its potential utility and acceptability as a clinical decision tool. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use two well-characterised longitudinal UK-based first-episode psychosis cohorts: Aetiology and Ethnicity in Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses and Genetics and Psychosis for which data have been collected on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We will identify candidate predictors for the model based on current literature and stakeholder consultation. Model development will use all data, with the number of candidate predictors restricted according to available sample size and event rate. A model for predicting risk of TRS will be developed based on penalised regression, with missing data handled using multiple imputation. Internal validation will be undertaken via bootstrapping, obtaining optimism-adjusted estimates of the models performance. The clinical utility of the model in terms of clinically relevant risk thresholds will be evaluated using net benefit and decision curves (comparative to competing strategies). Consultation with patients and clinical stakeholders will determine potential thresholds of risk for treatment decision-making. The acceptability of embedding the model as a clinical tool will be explored using qualitative focus groups with up to 20 clinicians in total from early intervention services. Clinicians will be recruited from services in Stafford and London with the focus groups being held via an online platform.

METHODS: Sixty participants were enrolled in this study, including 30 people in N95 mask group and 30 people in surgical mask group. Two interviews, three days apart, were performed with all participants. The participants were asked not to use any mask before the first interview while they were asked to use the determined mask just before the second interview for 8 h. In both interviews, the mucociliary clearance times (MCTs) were measured and participants were asked to score ten distinct sinonasal complaints using visual analog scale (VAS). Data obtained from first interview were named pre-mask data, data obtained from second interview were called after-mask data. In both groups, pre-mask MCTs and VAS scores were compared with after-mask MCTs and VAS scores. RESULTS: After-mask MCTs (mean = 13.03  6.05 min) were significantly longer than pre-mask MCTs (mean = 10.19  4.21 min) in N95 mask group (p = 0.002).

However, there are several challenges in practice leading to different outcomes across Indian states. Inadequate understanding of how national tobacco control policies achieve their results under varied circumstances obstruct the implementation and scaling up of effective strategies. This study is a realist evaluation using largely qualitative methods to understand the implementation process of Indias tobacco control policies. It will do so by evaluating Indias Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) and the National Tobacco Control Program (NTCP). The study aims to examine how, why, for whom and under which circumstances COTPA and NTCP are implemented in India. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A realist synthesis on implementation of tobacco control policies in low-income and middle-income countries is conducted. This is followed by qualitative data collection and analysis in three Indian states selected based on data from two rounds of the Global Adult Tobacco Survey. The study comprises of three steps (1): development of initial programme theories, (2) testing and refinement of initial programme theories and (3) testing and validation of refined programme theories. We will interview policy-makers, programme managers and implementers to identify facilitators and barriers of implementation. The purpose is to identify context-specific evidence-based strategies to gain insights into the implementation process of COTPA and NTCP.

METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 60 patients were randomly allocated into three equal groups. The first group received 1500 shocks on the carpal tunnel, the second group received 1500 shocks on the carpal tunnel and median nerve pathways, and the third group was the control group. In all three groups, patients received conventional physiotherapy for ten sessions. In addition, patients in experimental groups received four sessions of radial shockwave. Pain and paresthesia intensity, sensory and motor distal latency were evaluated as primary outcomes. Boston carpal tunnel Questionnaire scores were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Evaluations were performed at baseline, 1 and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment. RESULTS: Pain and paresthesia intensity and Boston questionnaire score significantly decreased in all three groups, but the greater improvement was noted in shockwave groups. Sensory and motor distal latency were only improved in shockwave groups. In terms of clinical and electrophysiological parameters, two groups of shockwaves showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Radial shockwave combined with conventional physiotherapy is an effective noninvasive treatment for mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome that produces greater and longer-lasting results than conventional physiotherapy alone. There were no differences observed between utilizing radial shockwave on the carpal tunnel or median nerve pathways on the palmar surface of the hand, in terms of clinical and electrophysiological measurements.

This viral infection triggers a wide spectrum of symptoms that span from fibril illnesses to more severe symptoms such as haemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. These severe symptoms have been associated with dysregulated immune response propagated by the virulence factor, non-structural protein (NSs). Thus, this study investigates the effects of lithium on NF-B translocation and RFVF-induced inflammation in Raw 264.7 macrophages. METHODS: The supernatant from RVFV-infected Raw 264.7 cells, treated with lithium, was examined using an ELISA assay kit to measure levels of cytokines and chemokines. The H(2)DCF-DA and DAF-2 DA florigenic assays were used to determine the levels of ROS and RNS by measuring the cellular fluorescence intensity post RVFV-infection and lithium treatment. Western blot and immunocytochemistry assays were used to measure expression levels of the inflammatory proteins and cellular location of the NF-B, respectively. RESULTS: Lithium was shown to stimulate interferon-gamma (IFN-) production as early as 3 h pi. Production of the secondary pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), were elevated as early as 12 h pi. Treatment with lithium stimulated increase of production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10) in RVFV-infected and uninfected macrophages as early as 3 h pi. The RVFV-infected cells treated with lithium displayed lower ROS and RNS production as opposed to lithium-free RVFV-infected control cells. Western blot analyses demonstrated that lithium inhibited iNOS expression while stimulating expression of heme oxygenase (HO) and IB in RVFV-infected Raw 264.7 macrophages. Results from immunocytochemistry and Western blot assays revealed that lithium inhibits NF-B nuclear translocation in RVFV-infected cells compared to lithium-free RVFV-infected cells and 5 mg/mL LPS controls. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that lithium inhibits NF-kB nuclear translocation and modulate inflammation profiles in RVFV-infected Raw 264.7 macrophage cells.","output":"Lithium inhibits NF-B nuclear translocation and modulate inflammation profiles in Rift valley fever virus-infected Raw 264.7 macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 crisis and consequent confinement restrictions have caused significant psychosocial stress and reports of sleep complaints, which require early management, have increased during recent months. To help individuals concerned about their sleep, we developed a smartphone-based app called KANOPEE that allows users to interact with a virtual agent dedicated to autonomous screening and delivering digital behavioral interventions. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the feasibility of this app, in terms of inclusion rate, follow-up rate, perceived trust and acceptance of the virtual agent, and effects of the intervention program, in the context of COVID-19 confinement in France. METHODS: The virtual agent is an artificial intelligence program using decision tree architecture and interacting through natural body motion and natural voice. A total of 2069 users aged 18 years and above downloaded the free app during the study period (April 22 to May 5, 2020). These users first completed a screening interview based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) conducted by the virtual agent. If the users were positive for insomnia complaints (ISI score >14), they were eligible to join the 2-stage intervention program: (1) complete an electronic sleep diary for 1 week and (2) follow personalized sleep recommendations for 10 days. We collected and analyzed the following measures: sociodemographic information, ISI scores and sleep/wake schedules, and acceptance and trust of the agent. RESULTS: Approximately 76% (1574/2069) of the app users completed the screening interview with the virtual agent. The virtual agent was well accepted by 27.4% (431/1574) of the users who answered the acceptance and trust questionnaires on its usability, satisfaction, benevolence, and credibility. Of the 773 screened users who reported sleep complaints (ISI score >14), 166 (21.5%) followed Step 1 of the intervention, and only 47 of those (28.3%) followed Step 2. Users who completed Step 1 found that their insomnia complaints (baseline mean ISI score 18.56, mean ISI score after Step 1 15.99; P<.001) and nocturnal sleep quality improved significantly after 1 week. Users who completed Step 2 also showed an improvement compared to the initial measures (baseline mean ISI score 18.87, mean ISI score after Step 2 14.68; P<.001). Users that were most severely affected (ISI score >21) did not respond to either intervention.

The rapid increase in the number of cases has caused widespread panic among people and has become the main public health problem in the world. Severe patients often have difficult breathing and/or hypoxemia after 1 week of onset. A few critically ill patients may not only rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, but also may cause coagulopathy, as well as multiple organs failure (such as heart, liver and kidney) or even death. This article is to analyze the predictive role of clinical features in patients with COVID-19 for severe disease, so as to help doctor monitor the severity-related features, restrain the disease progress, and provide a reference for improvement of medical treatment. METHODS The clinical data of 208 patients with COVID-19 who were isolated and treated in Changsha Public Health Treatment Center from January 17, 2020 to March 14, 2020 were collected. All patients were the mild and ordinary adult patients on admission, including 105 males and 103 females from 19 to 84 (median age 44) years old. According to the \\"Program for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infected pneumonia (Trial version 7)\\" issued by the General Office of National Health Committee and Office of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine as the diagnostic and typing criteria. According to progression from mild to severe disease during hospitalization, the patients were divided into a mild group (n=183) and a severe transformation group (n=25). The clinical features such as age, underlying disease, blood routine, coagulation function, blood biochemistry, oxygenation index, and so on were analyzed. Among them, laboratory tests included white blood cell (WBC), lymphocytes (LYM), neutrophil (NEU), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), plasma fibrinogen (Fib), activated partial prothrombin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), D-dimer, total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and oxygen partial pressure in arterial blood. Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fractional concentration of inspiratory oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was calculated. The variables with statistical significance were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Patients in the severe transformation group had more combined underlying diseases than those in the mild group (P<0.05). From the perspective of disease distribution, patients in the severe transformation group had more combined hypertension (P<0.05). In the severe transformation group, PT was significantly longer, the levels of Fib, ALT, AST, CK, LDH, and CRP were significantly higher than those in the mild group (P<0.05 or P<0.001), while LYM, ALB, and PaO2/FiO2 were significantly lower than those in the mild group (P<0.05 or P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis was performed on clinical features with statistically significant differences. Combined with hypertension, LYM, PT, Fib, ALB, ALT, AST, CK, LDH, and CRP as independent variables, and having severe disease or not was the dependent variable. The results show that combined hypertension, decreased LYM, longer PT, and increased CK level were independent risk factors that affected the severity of COVID-19 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The patients with mild COVID-19 who are apt to develop severe diseases may be related to combined hypertension, decreased LYM, and longer PT, and increased CK level. For the mild patients with these clinical features, early intervention may effectively prevent the progression to severe diseases.","output":"Predictive role of clinical features in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 for severe disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An impressive reduction in emergency department patient attendance was observed during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic coupled with an increase in the burden of patients with respiratory failure compared with the same period in 2019.

All these factors may have contributed to the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurrence increase observed during the same period. The OHCAs rate increase can recognize 2 great sets of causes: the infection-related and the pandemic-related ones. If the first recognizes different underlying mechanisms that can be dealt with more and more effectively as evidence accumulates, we must remember also the latter: the fear of in-hospital contagion and the willingness not to further burden the health system, which can prevent some citizens from the activation of the emergency medical services (EMS) even in the case of symptoms suspected for time-dependent diseases, resulting in at-home deterioration until the OHCA occurrence.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate perineogenital pain intensity and quality as well as short-term complications after BMGU, and to describe the impact of pain and complications on stricture recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial including 135 patients, who underwent BMGU from 2014 to 2015, was performed. INTERVENTION: One-stage BMGU. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Patient-reported perineogenital pain was assessed by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale and the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire preoperatively and at 1, 5, and 21 d, and 3, 6, and 12 mo postoperatively. Complications were assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification and the Comprehensive Complication Index. Pain and complications were compared according to stricture recurrence. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At a mean follow-up of 2115 mo, 29 patients (21%) had stricture recurrence. Pain intensity as well as sensory and affective pain quality decreased over time, reaching a minimum at 6 mo. Postoperative complications at days 5 (95% of patients) and 21 (27% of patients) were predominantly \\"minor\\" (Clavien-Dindo classification grade&#8804;IIIa).

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study including patients admitted to the ICU of the Teaching Hospital Policlinico Umberto I in Rome from April 2020 to March 2021 was performed. Data on age, gender, hospitalization, different types of devices (ventilation, central venous and urinary catheter), number and type of device-related HAI were collected. Statistical analyses were performed with Episheet and STATA 13. RESULTS: Out of 347 patients admitted in the ICUs, 329 were included in the study (217 had COVID-19 and 112 had not). In the COVID-19 group, patients were mainly male (69.58%) with a mean age of 62.513.5 years, whereas the other group was slightly older (63.216.2 years) and more balanced between the two sexes (52.68% male). A total of 133 patients developed at least one HAI, 94 of which were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Globally, 246 HAIs were diagnosed: 163 occurred in the COVID group and 83 in the No-COVID one. The cumulative days of hospitalization were 3233 for the COVID group and 2134 for the No-COVID. The incidence of HAI considered for 1000 days of hospitalization among COVID patients was 50.42 (IC 95%: 42.97-58.78), compared to 38.89 (IC 95%: 30.98-48.22) for the No-COVID one, for an incidence rate ratio of 1.30 (IC 95%: 0.99-1.71).

This in turn may result in respiratory failure and in death. Experimentally, acetylcholine (ACh) modulates the acute inflammatory response, a neuro-immune mechanism known as the inflammatory reflex. Recent clinical evidence suggest that electrical and chemical stimulation of the inflammatory reflex may reduce the burden of inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases.

To determine the relationships among photosynthesis, ROS, and defence responses to powdery mildew in wheat, we compared the responses of the Pm40-expressing wheat line L658 and its susceptible sister line L958 at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-inoculation (hpi) with powdery mildew via analyses of transcriptomes, cytology, antioxidant activities, photosynthesis, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. The results showed that H2O2 accumulation in L658 was significantly greater than that in L958 at 6 and 48 hpi, and the enzymes activity and transcripts expression of peroxidase and catalase were suppressed in L658 compared with L958. In addition, the inhibition of photosynthesis in L658 paralleled the global downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes. Furthermore, the expression of the salicylic acid-related genes non-expressor of pathogenesis related genes 1 (NPR1), pathogenesis-related 1 (PR1), and pathogenesis-related 5 (PR5) was upregulated, while the expression of jasmonic acid- and ethylene-related genes was inhibited in L658 compared with L958. In conclusion, the downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes likely led to a decline in photosynthesis, which may be combined with the inhibition of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) to generate two stages of H2O2 accumulation. The high level of H2O2, salicylic acid and PR1 and PR5 in L658 possible initiated the hypersensitive response.","output":"Potential Role of Photosynthesis in the Regulation of Reactive Oxygen Species and Defence Responses to Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici in Wheat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The third most frequent chronic condition, and the fourth most common cause of death, in Poland is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The diagnosis and treatment of COPD is the responsibility of the general practitioner (GP); the GP also serves as gatekeeper, referring patients to the other levels of public health care system when necessary. Undertreatment of COPD can result in a greater frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations. Elderly patients require special attention due to the increased prevalence of COPD and systemic comorbidities. However, both the occurrence of exacerbations and the quality of life of the patients may be improved by developing and implementing guidelines for practice and ensuring their adherence. This proposal concerns the development of a checklist-based educational program to assist general practitioners in managing COPD patients. METHODS No less than eighty-four general clinics in the Lodz region, Poland (28 clusters in each of three study arms), will be identified, randomized, and included in the trial. The trial will be based on anonymized data in electronic health records within the national public health care system. The educational intervention program will consist of GPs in two intervention arms being provided with a COPD management checklist: those in the first intervention arm with receive the checklist once at the beginning, while those in the second with receive it twice. The third (control) arm receives standard care without the checklist. The study used the International Code of Diseases (ICD)-10 for COPD. The primary aim is to determine the effect of interventions delivered to general practitioners (GPs) in primary health care. These interventions are aimed at decreasing the hospitalization of elderly patients with medical code J-44 (COPD) as the main reason for hospital admission. DISCUSSION The results of this trial will be directly applicable to primary care in Poland and add new data to the growing body of evidence regarding interventions aimed at improving chronic illness care.

Most regimens utilize rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, which may affect the clinical course of novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)]. Here we describe the first case of mild COVID-19 during ongoing oncological treatment without significant deterioration after rituximab administration. CASE SUMMARY: A 74-year-old female with an enlargement of her right palatine tonsil was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma following tonsillectomy and started immunochemotherapy according to the rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone regimen. At home before the fourth cycle, she developed nonspecific symptoms (excessive fatigue, loss of appetite and nausea), misdiagnosed as adverse effects of chemotherapy. Unexpectedly, interim positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan, performed shortly before rituximab administration, revealed previously nonexistent pulmonary changes, potentially of infectious etiology. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab (with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) performed the following day. Despite rituximab infusion, the patient remained oligosymptomatic and was discharged home for self-isolation. Having reached a negative SARS-CoV-2 status before the subsequently scheduled regimen, the patient successfully received six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and obtained complete remission by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. CONCLUSION: Our case shows that rituximab-based immunotherapy due to follicular lymphoma may have no evident negative effect on the COVID-19 clinical course.","output":"Low symptomatic COVID-19 in an elderly patient with follicular lymphoma treated with rituximab-based immunotherapy: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The optimal approach for cancer screening after an ischemic stroke remains unclear. AIMS: We sought to summarize the existing evidence regarding the frequency and predictors of cancer after an ischemic stroke. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: We searched seven databases from January 1980 to September 2019 for articles reporting malignant tumors and myeloproliferative neoplasms diagnosed after an ischemic stroke (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42019132455). We screened 15,400 records and included 51 articles. The pooled cumulative incidence of cancer within one year after an ischemic stroke was 13.6 per thousand (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-24.8), higher in studies focusing on cryptogenic stroke (62.0 per thousand; 95% CI, 13.6-139.3 vs 9.6 per thousand; 95% CI, 4.0-17.3; p = 0.02) and those reporting cancer screening (39.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 16.4-70.6 vs 7.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 2.5-14.1; p = 0.003). Incidence of cancer after stroke was generally higher compared to people without stroke. Most cases were diagnosed within the first few months after stroke. Several predictors of cancer were identified, namely older age, smoking, and involvement of multiple vascular territories as well as elevated C-reactive protein and d-dimers. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of incident cancer after an ischemic stroke is low, but higher in cryptogenic stroke and after cancer screening. Several predictors may increase the yield of cancer screening after an ischemic stroke. The pooled incidence of post-stroke cancer is likely underestimated, and larger studies with systematic assessment of cancer after stroke are needed to produce more precise and valid estimates.","output":"Frequency and predictors of occult cancer in ischemic stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a bioaccumulative neurotoxin produced by certain sulfate-reducing bacteria and other anaerobic microorganisms. Because microorganisms differ in their capacity to methylate mercury, the abundance and distribution of methylating populations may determine MeHg production in the environment. We compared rates of MeHg production and the distribution of hgcAB genes in epilimnetic sediments from a freshwater lake that were experimentally amended with sulfate levels from 7 to 300 mg L-1. The most abundant hgcAB sequences were associated with clades of Methanomicrobia, sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and unknown environmental sequences. The hgcAB+ communities from higher sulfate amendments were less diverse and had relatively more Deltaproteobacteria, whereas the communities from lower amendments were more diverse with a larger proportion of hgcAB sequences affiliated with other clades. Potential methylation rate constants varied 52-fold across the experiment. Both potential methylation rate constants and % MeHg were the highest in sediments from the lowest sulfate amendments, which had the most diverse hgcAB+ communities and relatively fewer hgcAB genes from clades associated with sulfate reduction. Although pore water sulfide concentration covaried with hgcAB diversity across our experimental sulfate gradient, major changes in the community of hgcAB+ organisms occurred prior to a significant buildup of sulfide in pore waters. Our results indicate that methylating communities dominated by diverse anaerobic microorganisms that do not reduce sulfate can produce MeHg as effectively as communities dominated by sulfate-reducing populations.","output":"Diverse Communities of hgcAB+ Microorganisms Methylate Mercury in Freshwater Sediments Subjected to Experimental Sulfate Loading."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy (CSPN) is a common generalized slowly progressive neuropathy, second in prevalence only to diabetic neuropathy. Most patients with CSPN have significant pain. Many medications have been tried for pain reduction in CSPN, including antiepileptics, antidepressants, and sodium channel blockers. There are no comparative studies that identify the most effective medication for pain reduction in CSPN. Objective: To determine which medication (pregabalin, duloxetine, nortriptyline, or mexiletine) is most effective for reducing neuropathic pain and best tolerated in patients with CSPN. Design, Setting, and Participants: From December 1, 2014, through October 20, 2017, a bayesian adaptive, open-label randomized clinical comparative effectiveness study of pain in 402 participants with CSPN was conducted at 40 neurology care clinics. The trial included response adaptive randomization. Participants were patients with CSPN who were 30 years or older, with a pain score of 4 or greater on a numerical rating scale (range, 0-10, with higher scores indicating a higher level of pain). Participant allocation to 1 of 4 drug groups used the utility function and treatment's sample size for response adaptation randomization. At each interim analysis, a decision was made to continue enrolling (up to 400 participants) or stop the whole trial for success (80% power). Patient engagement was maintained throughout the trial, which helped guide the study and identify ways to communicate and disseminate information. Analysis was performed from December 11, 2015, to January 19, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive nortriptyline (n = 134), duloxetine (n = 126), pregabalin (n = 73), or mexiletine (n = 69). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a utility function that was a composite of the efficacy (participant reported pain reduction of &#8805;50% from baseline to week 12) and quit (participants who discontinued medication) rates. Results: Among the 402 participants (213 men [53.0%]; mean [SD] age, 60.1 [13.4] years; 343 White [85.3%]), the utility function of nortriptyline was 0.81 (95% bayesian credible interval [CrI], 0.69-0.93; 34 of 134 [25.4%] efficacious; and 51 of 134 [38.1%] quit), of duloxetine was 0.80 (95% CrI, 0.68-0.92; 29 of 126 [23.0%] efficacious; and 47 of 126 [37.3%] quit), pregabalin was 0.69 (95% CrI, 0.55-0.84; 11 of 73 [15.1%] efficacious; and 31 of 73 [42.5%] quit), and mexiletine was 0.58 (95% CrI, 0.42-0.75; 14 of 69 [20.3%] efficacious; and 40 of 69 [58.0%] quit). The probability each medication yielded the highest utility was 0.52 for nortriptyline, 0.43 for duloxetine, 0.05 for pregabalin, and 0.00 for mexiletine. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that, although there was no clearly superior medication, nortriptyline and duloxetine outperformed pregabalin and mexiletine when pain reduction and undesirable adverse effects are combined to a single end point.

We included all stroke cases in our analysis for prediction of in-hospital mortality, and separately analyzed arterial infarcts for vascular territory of ischemic strokes. Results: There were 62 stroke cases among 3923 COVID-19 admissions (incidence 1.6%). Data was available for 58 patients {mean age 52.6 years; age range 17 - 91; F/M=20/38; 24% (14/58) aged [] 40; 51% (30/58) hypertensive; 36% (21/58) diabetic; 41% (24/58) with O2 saturation <95% at admission; 32/58 (55.17 %) in-hospital mortality}. Among 58 strokes, there were 44 arterial infarcts, seven bleeds, three arterial infarcts with associated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, two combined infarct and bleed, and two of indeterminate type. Among the total 49 infarcts, Carotid territory was the commonest affected (36/49; 73.5%), followed by vertebrobasilar (7/49; 14.3%) and both (6/49; 12.2%).

Patients with poor saturation at admission were older (58 vs 49 years) and had more comorbidities and higher mortality (79% vs 38%). Mortality was similar in young strokes and older patients, although the latter required more intense respiratory support. Logistic regression analysis showed that low GCS and requirement for increasing intensity of respiratory support predicted in-hospital mortality.

Resultantly, many viruses have evolved mechanisms in which to evade the IFN-I response. Here we tested the impact of expression of 27 different SARS-CoV-2 genes in relation to their effect on IFN production and activity using three independent experimental methods. We identified six gene products; NSP6, ORF6, ORF7b, NSP1, NSP5 and NSP15, which strongly (>10-fold) blocked MAVS-induced (but not TRIF-induced) IFN production. Expression of the first three of these SARS-CoV-2 genes specifically blocked MAVS-induced IFN-promoter activity, whereas all six genes induced a collapse in IFN mRNA levels, corresponding with suppressed IFN protein secretion. Five of these six genes furthermore suppressed MAVS-induced activation of IFNs, however with no effect on IFN or IFN production. In sharp contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells remained extremely sensitive to anti-viral activity exerted by added IFN-Is. None of the SARS-CoV-2 genes were able to block IFN-I signaling, as demonstrated by robust activation of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) by added interferon. This, despite the reduced levels of STAT1 and phospho-STAT1, was likely caused by broad translation inhibition mediated by NSP1. Finally, we found that a truncated ORF7b variant that has arisen from a mutant SARS-CoV-2 strain harboring a 382-nucleotide deletion associating with mild disease (382 strain identified in Singapore & Taiwan in 2020) lost its ability to suppress type I and type III IFN production. In summary, our findings support a multi-gene process in which SARS-CoV-2 blocks IFN-production, with ORF7b as a major player, presumably facilitating evasion of host detection during early infection. However, SARS-CoV-2 fails to suppress IFN-I signaling thus providing an opportunity to exploit IFN-Is as potential therapeutic antiviral drugs.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 suppresses IFN production mediated by NSP1, 5, 6, 15, ORF6 and ORF7b but does not suppress the effects of added interferon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malaria elimination can benefit from time and cost-efficient approaches for antimalarials such as drug repurposing.

The most productive country was the United States of America (USA), followed by the United Kingdom and Australia. International authorship collaboration was evident in 57 (36.1%) studies. The average citation rate was 23.4 per study, with an average annual citation rate of 2.1. CONCLUSIONS: Published research employing imaging to assess foot osteoarthritis has increased substantially over the past four decades. Although plain radiography remains the gold standard modality, the emergence of MRI and USI in the past two decades continues to advance knowledge and progress research in this field.

Automation systems have been developed to improve these issues. In the process of automation, images are processed and sent to the remote brain for processing and decision making. It is noted that the image is written for compaction to reduce processing and computational costs. Images require large storage and transmission resources to perform their operations. A good strategy for pictures compression can help minimize these requirements. The question of compressing data on accuracy is always a challenge. Therefore, to optimize imaging, it is necessary to reduce inconsistencies in medical imaging. So this document introduces a new image compression scheme called the GenPSOWVQ method that uses a recurrent neural network with wavelet VQ. The codebook is built using a combination of fragments and genetic algorithms. The newly developed image compression model attains precise compression while maintaining image accuracy with lower computational costs when encoding clinical images. The proposed method was tested using real-time medical imaging using PSNR, MSE, SSIM, NMSE, SNR, and CR indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed GenPSOWVQ method yields higher PSNR SSIMM values for a given compression ratio than the existing methods. In addition, the proposed GenPSOWVQ method yields lower values of MSE, RMSE, and SNR for a given compression ratio than the existing methods.","output":"Optimal Medical Image Size Reduction Model Creation Using Recurrent Neural Network and GenPSOWVQ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urban expansion can fundamentally alter wildlife movement and gene flow, but how urbanization alters pathogen spread is poorly understood. Here, we combine high resolution host and viral genomic data with landscape variables to examine the context of viral spread in puma (Puma concolor) from two contrasting regions: one bounded by the wildland urban interface (WUI) and one unbounded with minimal anthropogenic development (UB). We found landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) spread in the WUI, but not in the unbounded region. The most important predictors of viral spread also differed; host spatial proximity, host relatedness, and mountain ranges played a role in FIV spread in the WUI, whereas roads might have facilitated viral spread in the unbounded region. Our research demonstrates how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread, providing a more nuanced understanding of host-pathogen relationships to inform disease ecology in free-ranging species.","output":"Host relatedness and landscape connectivity shape pathogen spread in the puma, a large secretive carnivore."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the globe, short-term modeling forecasts provide time-critical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies.

Workers personal resilience can be an important factor in preserving psychological health, but how this exactly works in high stakes situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires further exploration. Similarly, the role of team social climate as contributor to individual psychological health seems obvious, but how it exactly prevents workers from developing depressive complaints in prolonged crises remains under investigated. The present paper therefore applies conservation of resources theory to study the relationships between resilience, team social climate, and depressive complaints, specifically focusing on worries about infections as an important explanatory mechanism. Based on questionnaire data of 1126 workers from five hospitals in the Netherlands during the second peak of the pandemic, this paper estimates a moderated-mediation model. This model shows that personal resilience negatively relates to depressive complaints ( = ?0.99, p < 0.001, 95%CI = ?1.45C?0.53), partially as personal resilience is negatively associated with worries about infections ( = ?0.42, p < 0.001, 95%CI = ?0.50C?0.33) which in turn are positively related to depressive complaints ( = 0.75, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.31C1.19). Additionally, team social climate is associated with a lower effect of worries about being infected and infecting others on depressive complaints ( = ?0.88, p = 0.03, 95% CI = ?1.68C?0.09). These findings suggest that resilience can be an important individual level resource in preventing depressive complaints. Moreover, the findings imply that hospitals have an important responsibility to maintain a good team social climate to shield workers from infection related worries building up to depressive complaints.","output":"Were Not Gonna Fall: Depressive Complaints, Personal Resilience, Team Social Climate, and Worries about Infections among Hospital Workers during a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has severely impacted dentists, who are at a great risk of infection.

An online questionnaire, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), was sent to Italian dentists during the final days of the lockdown with items about anxiety, fear, distress, perceived risk for operators, and concerns about orthodontic patients caused by working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were analyzed with a chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. The level of significance was set as p < 0.05. A total of 349 dentists completed the survey, including 183 orthodontists. Returning to their daily work activity was a source of anxiety for 192 participants and this was associated with the level of distress (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; p < 0.001). Most of the orthodontists (67.6%) thought that they would increase the number of working hours during the week (OR = 1.8; p = 0.007).

The low dimensionality suggests strong dependency among the standardised growth rates of cases and deaths per capita and the OxCGRT Covid-19 Stringency Index for a country over 2020-2021. Given the low dimensional structure, it may be feasible to model observable Covid-19 dynamics with few parameters. Importantly, we identify spatial autocorrelation in the intrinsic dimension distribution worldwide. Moreover, we highlight that high-income countries are more likely to lie on low-dimensional manifolds, likely arising from aging populations, comorbidities, and increased per capita mortality burden from Covid-19.

Following a descriptive research design, this study used surveys to collect primary data from 235 students in graduate and undergraduate programs in India. The DASS-21 scale was used to check the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress students experienced. Furthermore, a four-point COPE scale was used to identify coping strategies students adopted. The results showed that students experienced high levels of stress and anxiety during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although depression levels were not alarming, most students were worried about several aspects of their lives and careers.

In August 2020, an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in multiple mink farms in Utah and was associated with high mink mortality and rapid viral transmission between animals. The outbreaks epidemiology, pathology, molecular characterization, and tissue distribution of virus within infected mink is provided. Infection of mink was likely by reverse zoonosis. Once established, infection spread rapidly between independently housed animals and farms, and caused severe respiratory disease and death. Clinical signs were most notably sudden death, anorexia, and increased respiratory effort. Gross pathology examination revealed severe pulmonary congestion and edema. Microscopically there was pulmonary edema with moderate vasculitis, perivasculitis, and fibrinous interstitial pneumonia. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of tissues collected at necropsy demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in multiple organs including nasal turbinates, lung, tracheobronchial lymph node, epithelial surfaces, and others. Whole genome sequencing from multiple mink was consistent with published SARS-CoV-2 genomes with few polymorphisms. The Utah mink SARS-CoV-2 strain fell into Clade GH, which is unique among mink and other animal strains sequenced to date and did not share other spike RBD mutations Y453F and F486L found in mink. Localization of viral RNA by in situ hybridization revealed a more localized infection, particularly of the upper respiratory tract. Mink in the outbreak reported herein had high levels of virus in the upper respiratory tract associated with mink-to-mink transmission in a confined housing environment and were particularly susceptible to disease and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Author Summary The recent emergence and worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus has resulted in worldwide disease and economic hardship. The virus, known as SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have originated in bats and has spread worldwide through human-to-human virus transmission. It remains unclear which animal species, other than humans, may also be susceptible to viral infection and could naturally transmit the virus to susceptible hosts. In this study, we describe an outbreak of disease and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed mink in Utah, United States. The investigation reveals that mink can spread the virus rapidly between animals and that the disease in mink is due to the viral infection and damage to tissues of the upper and lower respiratory system. The determination that mink are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 indicates the need for strict biosecurity measures on mink farms to remediate mink-to-mink and human-to-mink transmission for the protection of mink, as well as prevent potential transmission from mink to humans.","output":"An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 with high mortality in mink (Neovison vison) on multiple Utah farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and pituitary dysfunction may occur. Therefore, we investigated neuroendocrine changes, in particular, secondary adrenal insufficiency, using a dynamic test and the role of autoimmunity in pituitary dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. The single-center, prospective, case-control study included patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 and healthy controls. Basal hormone levels were measured, and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test was performed. Antipituitary (APA) and antihypothalamic antibodies (AHA) were also determined. We examined a total of 49 patients with COVID-19 and 28 healthy controls. The frequency of adrenal insufficiency in patients with COVID-19 was found as 8.2%. Patients with COVID-19 had lower free T3, IGF-1, and total testosterone levels, and higher cortisol and prolactin levels when compared with controls. We also demonstrated the presence of APA in three and AHA in one of four patients with adrenal insufficiency. In conclusion, COVID-19 may result in adrenal insufficiency, thus routine screening of adrenal functions in these patients is needed.

Cohorting patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) into 'bubbles' has been proposed as an infection-control mechanism. In this paper, we present a novel and flexible model for clustering patient care in healthcare facilities into bubbles in order to minimize infection spread. Our model aims to control a variety of costs to patients/residents and HCPs so as to avoid hidden, downstream adverse effects of clustering patient care. This model leads to a discrete optimization problem that we call the BUBBLECLUSTERING problem. This problem takes as input a temporal visit graph, representing HCP mobility, including visits by HCPs to patient/resident rooms. The output of the problem is a rewired visit graph, obtained by partitioning HCPs and patient rooms into bubbles and rewiring HCP visits to patient rooms so that patient-care is largely confined to the constructed bubbles. Even though the BUBBLECLUSTERING problem is intractable in general, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem that can be solved optimally for problem instances that arise from typical hospital units and long-term-care facilities. We call our overall solution approach Cost-aware Rewiring of Networks (CoRN). We evaluate CoRN using fine-grained-movement data from a hospital-medical-intensive-care unit as well as two long-term-care facilities. These data were obtained using sensor systems we built and deployed. The main takeaway from our experimental results is that it is possible to use CoRN to substantially reduce infection spread by cohorting patients and HCPs without sacrificing patient-care, and with minimal excess costs to HCPs in terms of time and distances traveled during a shift. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Modeling and Evaluation of Clustering Patient Care into Bubbles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During a pandemic, there are many situations in which the first available vaccines may not have as high effectiveness as vaccines that are still under development or vaccines that are not yet ready for distribution, raising the question of whether it is better to go with what is available now or wait. METHODS: In 2020, the team developed a computational model that represents the U.S. population, COVID-19 coronavirus spread, and vaccines with different possible efficacies (to prevent infection or to reduce severe disease) and vaccination timings to estimate the clinical and economic value of vaccination. RESULTS: Except for a limited number of situations, mainly early on in a pandemic and for a vaccine that prevents infection, when an initial vaccine is available, waiting for a vaccine with a higher efficacy results in additional hospitalizations and costs over the course of the pandemic. For example, if a vaccine with a 50% efficacy in preventing infection becomes available when 10% of the population has already been infected, waiting until 40% of the population are infected for a vaccine with 80% efficacy in preventing infection results in 15.6 million additional cases and 1.5 million additional hospitalizations, costing $20.6 billion more in direct medical costs and $12.4 billion more in productivity losses.

Indeed, just before the Fed announced its unprecedented intervention into the municipal (muni) bond market, spreads of muni over Treasury yields rose in line with the unemployment rate and appeared headed to levels not seen since the Great Depression, when real municipal gross investment plunged 35 percent below 1929 levels. To prevent a repeat, the Fed created the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) to purchase newly issued, (near) investment grade state and local government bonds at normal ratings-based interest rate spreads over Treasury bonds plus a fee of 100 basis points, later reduced to 50 basis points. Despite a modest take-up, the MLF has effectively capped muni spreads at near normal levels plus the Fed fee and limited the extent to which interest rate spreads could have amplified the impact of the Covid pandemic. To establish the MLF the Fed needed Treasury indemnification against default losses.

Current research concerning CC focused on adoption and acceptance. However, there is still a scarcity of research concerning such technologys continued use in an organizational setting. Drawing on the prior literature in organizational-level continuance, this paper established a positivist quantitative-empirical study to bridge the research gap and assess the precursors for a continuance of cloud technology in HEIs. Subsequently, this study developed a conceptual framework by integrating the IS success model and the IS discontinuance model through the lens of the TOE framework. The data were collected from the decision-makers of Malaysian HEIs that have adopted CC services, and analyzed using Structural equation Modelling (SEM) based on Partial Least Squares (PLS). The results indicate that the continuance intention can be predicted by technology, organizational, environmental, and other contextualized factors, explaining 85.2% of the dependent variables variance. The paper closes with a discussion of the research limitations, contribution, and future directions.","output":"Analyzing Continuance of Cloud Computing in Higher Education Institutions: Should We Stay, or Should We Go?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disease associated with a reduced peripheral blood platelet count. The phenotype is variable with some patients suffering no bleeding whilst others have severe bleeding which may be fatal. Variability in clinical behaviour and treatment responses reflects its complex underlying pathophysiology. Historically the management has relied heavily on immune suppression. Recent studies have shown that the older empirical immune suppressants fail to alter the natural history of the disease and are associated with a poor quality of life for patients. Newer treatments, such as the thrombopoietin receptor agonists, have transformed ITP care. They have high efficacy, are well tolerated and improve patients quality of life. A greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of this disorder has helped develop a number of new targeted therapies. These include inhibitors of the neonatal Fc receptor inhibitors, Bruton tyrosine kinase and complement pathway.

We propose a model for testing in a population experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19, and derive an expression for TPP in terms of well-defined parameters related to testing and presence of other pathogens causing COVID-19 like symptoms. In the absence of dramatic shifts of testing practices in time or between locations, the TPP is positively correlated with the incidence of infection. We show that the proportion of tested individuals who present COVID-19 like symptoms encodes similar information to the TPP but has different relationships with the testing parameters, and can thus provide additional information regarding dynamic changes in TPP and incidence. Finally, we compare data on confirmed cases and TPP from US states up to October 2020. We conjecture why states may have higher or lower TPP than average.

Results: In all, 15 (8.62%) patients experienced chest distress/breath shortness, where 8 of the 15 were severely ill. This means severely ill patients need an extended amount of time to recover after discharge; next, 20 (11.49%) patients experienced anxiety and 21 (12.07%) had headache/insomnia and a small fraction of them complained of anosmia/ageusia, indicating that these patients need treatment for mental and psychological health issues.

In these facilities, viral transmission can be facilitated by shortages of human and material resources, which can lead to suboptimal application of infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures. To improve the dissemination of COVID-19 IPC guidelines, we developed a serious game called \\"Escape COVID-19\\" using Nicholson's RECIPE for meaningful gamification, as engaging serious games have the potential to induce behavioral change. OBJECTIVE: As the probability of executing an action is strongly linked to the intention of performing it, the objective of this study was to determine whether LTCF employees were willing to change their IPC practices after playing \\"Escape COVID-19.\\" METHODS: This was a web-based, triple-blind, randomized controlled trial, which took place between November 5 and December 4, 2020. The health authorities of Geneva, Switzerland, asked the managers of all LTCFs under their jurisdiction to forward information regarding the study to all their employees, regardless of professional status. Participants were unaware that they would be randomly allocated to one of two different study paths upon registration. In the control group, participants filled in a first questionnaire designed to gather demographic data and assess baseline knowledge before accessing regular online IPC guidelines. They then answered a second questionnaire, which assessed their willingness to change their IPC practices and identified the reasons underlying their decision. They were then granted access to the serious game. Conversely, the serious game group played \\"Escape COVID-19\\" after answering the first questionnaire but before answering the second one. This group accessed the control material after answering the second set of questions. There was no time limit. The primary outcome was the proportion of LTCF employees willing to change their IPC practices. Secondary outcomes included the factors underlying participants' decisions, the domains these changes would affect, changes in the use of protective equipment items, and attrition at each stage of the study. RESULTS: A total of 295 answer sets were analyzed. Willingness to change behavior was higher in the serious game group (82% [119/145] versus 56% [84/150]; P<.001), with an odds ratio of 3.86 (95% CI 2.18-6.81; P<.001) after adjusting for professional category and baseline knowledge, using a mixed effects logistic regression model with LTCF as a random effect. For more than two-thirds (142/203) of the participants, the feeling of playing an important role against the epidemic was the most important factor explaining their willingness to change behavior. Most of the participants unwilling to change their behavior answered that they were already applying all the guidelines.

This also affected the panel discussion that we had planned in order to collect practical and application-oriented perspectives on transdisciplinarity in academics. As restrictions of traveling and gatherings on social events across the globe intensified, digital conferences gradually developed into an effective format for academic exchange. In this respect, we were thrilled when we were able to save the two-hour panel discussion \\"Crossing Borders, Creating Together: An Interdisciplinary Dialogue on Transdisciplinary Knowledge Production\\" on 15 June 2020 using a live video broadcast. The main questions from the conference served as a guide: To what extent do academic publications and knowledge production rely on reflexivity and self-reflection? What consequences does this have for the selfpositioning of researchers in the tense relationship between academia and society? The question of how meaningful academic activities are in society and for society correlates directly with the question of the relevance of transdisciplinary research, that is occasionally addressed as a possibility, a demand, a request, or even a necessity.

AIM: In this study, we explore the potential inhibitory effects of some active polyphenolic constituents of Rhus spp. (sumac) against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme (M(pro); 6LU7). METHODS: 26 active polyphenolic compounds of Rhus spp. were studied for their antiviral activity by molecular docking, drug likeness, and synthetic accessibility score (SAS) as inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). RESULTS: The results show that all tested compounds of sumac provided good interaction with the main active site of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), with better, lower molecular docking energy (kcal/mol) compared to the well-known drugs chloroquine and favipiravir (Avigan).

The limitations of the use of aluminium salts that are unable to elicite cell responses against intracellular pathogens such as those causing malaria, tuberculosis, or AIDS, have driven the development of new alternative adjuvants such as QS-21, a triterpene saponin purified from Quillaja saponaria. PURPOSE: The aim of this review is to attempt to clarify the mechanism of action of QS-21 through either receptors or signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo with special emphasis on the co-administration with other immunostimulants in new adjuvant formulations, called adjuvant systems (AS). Furthermore, the most relevant clinical applications will be presented. METHODS: A literature search covering the period 2014C2018 was performed using electronic databases from Sci finder, Science direct, Medline/Pubmed, Scopus, Google scholar. RESULTS: Insights into the mechanism of action of QS-21 can be summarized as follows: 1) in vivo stimulation of Th2 humoral and Th1 cell-mediated immune responses through action on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and T cells, leading to release of Th1 cytokines participating in the elimination of intracellular pathogens. 2) activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse APCs with subsequent release of caspase-1 dependent cytokines, Il-1 and Il-18, important for Th1 responses. 3) synthesis of nearly 50 QS-21 analogs, allowing structure/activity relationships and mechanistic studies. 4) unique synergy mechanism between monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL A) and QS-21, formulated in a liposome (AS01) in the early IFN- response, promoting vaccine immunogenicity. The second part of the review is related to phase I-III clinical trials of QS-21, mostly formulated in ASs, to evaluate efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of adjuvanted prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases, e.g. malaria, herpes zoster, tuberculosis, AIDS and therapeutic vaccines against cancer and Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: The most advanced phase III clinical applications led to the development of two vaccines containing QS-21 as part of the AS, the Herpes Zoster vaccine (HZ/su) (Shingrix?) which received a license in 2017 from the FDA and a marketing authorization in the EU in 2018 and the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine (Mosquirix?) against malaria, which was approved by the EMA in 2015 for further implementation in Sub-Saharan countries for routine use.","output":"Updated insights into the mechanism of action and clinical profile of the immunoadjuvant QS-21: A review()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a portable filter test setup, filtration using nanofiber filters on real aerosols from mixed vehicular emission and ambient pollutants has been studied. The size of aerosols being monitored is between 10 and 433nm. Although some of the aerosols, such as diesel particulate matter are known to have fractal dimensions, comparison using the equivalent aerodynamic diameter provides a good interpretation of the filtration behavior. Different parameters, such as aerosol size, face velocity, and fiber basis weight, have been investigated in the study. A new dimensionless parameter, the specific filter resistance , is introduced.  measures the viscous drag on flow through the fibers in the filter with a given fiber basis weight ( has also been independently derived from the dimensional analysis in Appendix E). Therefore a low value of  would be more favorable for air filtration. In the test examples,  is approximately unity. Through multilayering/multimodule nanofiber configuration using a nanofiber filter electrospun from polyvinyl alcohol, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to improve the filtration efficiency by increasing the basis weight of nanofibers while maintaining both constant quality factor (QF) and . On the other hand, the traditional approach of increasing basis weight of fibers in a single-layer nanofiber configuration would only lead to reduction in QF and increasing . As real aerosols from mixed vehicular emission and ambient pollutants are typically less than 200nm with Peclet number less than 10, diffusion plays an important role in the capture of these tiny aerosols by a nanofiber filter. The single-fiber efficiency due to diffusion based on testing has been closely examined, and it compares quite well with the diffusion correlation prediction. Despite this agreement, there is increasing deviation of the test results as compared to the theoretical prediction, especially at a large Peclet number (greater than 10) and at high face velocity greater than 0.07m/s. This may be attributed to unavoidable complicated aerosolCaerosol interaction for polydispersed aerosols challenging the filter, especially at a high velocity. In general, the behavior of ambient aerosols is very similar to that of controlled laboratory using solid sodium chloride aerosols lending assurance of laboratory development in simulating real situations. In the second part of the chapter, ambient aerosols have been used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 virus (100nm) transmission by air which is an important issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have demonstrated that nearly 90% capture of these airborne virus can be achieved with a 6-module electrostatic charged PVDF filter. This demonstrates very importantly that dielectrophoretic capture (charge induction followed by electrostatic charge attraction) with charged nanofiber filter also works for ambient aerosols. The pressure drop of the filter at 5.3cm/s can be quite low at 26Pa. Comparing with the NaCl aerosol test using the same filter, the ambient aerosol efficiency can be 6%C24% lower depending on the number of modules deployed in the multimodule electret filter, with the difference being less with more modules in the multimodule filter. Thus, the ambient aerosol is more difficult to filter due to interaction of aerosols of different sizes. By increasing the number of modules, the multimodule approach follows nearly an iso-QF curve;both high efficiencies and QF can be reached. We have obtained similarly favorable comparison for the 50-55nm aerosol and the 300-nm aerosols which simulate the smallest and largest size of airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus (with carrier), respectively. The ambient aerosol test results have been compared to those using monodispersed sodium chloride aerosols filter tests using the same test filters in the laboratory under controlled condition, with similar findings, yet the sodium chloride aerosol capture efficiency is slightly higher by a few percentages (absolute).","output":"Chapter twelve - Filtration of ambient aerosols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new decade often begins with new life, new relationships and new purposes.

METHODS: This was a scale-out implementation and mixed-method evaluation study. Nav-CARE was implemented in 12 hospice and 3 nonhospice community-based organizations spanning five provinces in Canada. Volunteers visited clients in the home approximately every 2 weeks for 1 year with some modifications required by the COVID-19 public health restrictions. Qualitative evaluation data were collected from key informants (n = 26), clients/family caregivers (n = 57), and volunteers (n = 86) using semistructured interviews. Quantitative evaluation data included volunteer self-efficacy, satisfaction, and quality of life, and client engagement and quality of life. FINDINGS: Successful implementation was influenced by organizational capacity, stable and engaged leadership, a targeted client population, and skillful messaging. Recruitment of clients was the most significant barrier to implementation. Clients reported statistically significant improvements in feeling they had someone to turn to, knowing the services available to help them in their community, being involved in things that were important to them, and having confidence in taking care of their illness. Improvements in clients quality of life were reported in the qualitative data, although no statistically significant gains were reported on the quality of life measure.

The data were collected between April 2021 and May 2021 via an in\\\\depth individual interview form. The COREQ checklist was followed in the study. RESULTS: As a result of the interviews, we identified four main themes: the impacts of COVID\\\\19 on life, the impact of COVID\\\\19 on cancer treatment, the biggest fear during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and the metaphors of struggling with cancer during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The disruption of treatment services during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and women's fear of infection by the virus led to delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment. This situation caused the women's state of health to deteriorate, and the resultant regret and sadness that they experienced had an adverse effect on their mental health. Furthermore, women's self\\\\isolation due to the fear of infection by the virus had a negative effect on their psychosocial health. Telehealth services should be provided for cancer patients to obtain accurate information and to easily access information about treatment processes during the pandemic, and telepsychological hotlines and peer support groups should be established to improve the psychosocial health of patients.","output":"Two wars on one front: Experiences of gynaecological cancer patients in the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic required not only the reorientation of learning to remote form but also a change in the form of state-funded school lunches.

Methods: An online interview questionnaire concerning the acceptance or hesitancy toward vaccination for COVID-19 was designed and 543 patients with IBD in China were invited to complete the structured self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Results: Of all the participants, 50.7% were indecisive about the vaccination and only 16.0% opted for it. Vaccination hesitancy was significantly associated with women and those without medical or biomedical backgrounds. The acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination was higher in participants with no history of immune-modifying therapies, especially in those without immunosuppressants. Participants who considered vaccination critically important to self-health or the health of others were more likely to choose immediately or later vaccination. Safety and potential adverse reactions, personal hypoimmunity, efficacy, and reliability of COVID-19 vaccines were the top three concerns of the participants that were independent of their willingness for vaccination. Conclusions: This study discloses the presence of hesitancy for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with IBD.

A secondary aim was to examine the interrelationship between emotional, physical, and social problems during recovery. METHODS: : We utilised data from the UK Biobank, an on-going, prospective population-based cohort study. We employed propensity score matching to assess differences in outcomes between patients with a critical care encounter and patients admitted to the hospital (first admission to hospital available) without critical care. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse emotional, physical and social outcomes following critical illness and the relationships between these health domains. FINDINGS: : Data from 1,618 patients were analysed. The median time to follow-up in the critical care cohort was 4427 days (IQR:788C6146) vs 4516 days (IQR: 811C6369) in the non-critical care, hospitalised cohort. Across the two time periods assessed (pre and post 2000), patients exposed to critical care were more likely to experience mental health issues such as depression (p < 0.01) and social isolation (p = 0.01) following discharge from hospital. The critical care cohort were also more likely to have social problems such as the requirement for government funded welfare support (p = 0.02). In the critical care cohort, social and emotional health were closely correlated (p < 0.001, 95% CI:0.33C0.54). The nature of physical problems changed over time; pre-2000 there was a significant difference between the critical and non-critical care in physical outcomes following discharge from hospital, however, there was no difference detected between the two cohorts post-2000.

It has also impacted on the global populations mental health and caused negative psychosocial effects, which may lead to psychological crises. During the pandemic, the challenges for quarantine hotel employees are not only the increased workloads created by operating a quarantine hotel but also high psychological stress associated with job insecurity, risk of exposure and contagion for themselves, their friends and families. This research attempts to explore COVID-19-related depression, anxiety, and stress among quarantine hotel employees in China. The mental health of quarantine hotel employees, who have faced unprecedented changes, is paramount while they provide hospitality and care for healthcare workers and quarantine guests during mandatory quarantine periods. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that applied convenience sampling to collect questionnaire samples from 170 quarantine hotel employees in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic, from May 20 to June 10, 2020. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to collect data. The study uses descriptive analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The results reveal that 43.5% of respondents report moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression; 68.2% have moderate to extremely severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.2% indicated moderate to extremely severe stress symptoms. Quarantine hotel employees who have a higher level of education are less likely to experience anxiety, and those with higher incomes are less likely to experience depression. DISCUSSION: In order to mitigate the increasing levels of anxiety and depression among their staff, quarantine hoteliers or managers urgently need to implement mental health assistance programs, such as providing extra training in hygiene and knowledge about COVID-19, offering online counseling and psychological support services, training in positive thinking, encouraging staff to keep in touch with their personal support networks, and constructing a resilience model.","output":"Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 on Quarantine Hotel Employees in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T lymphocytes play a major role in many immune responses.

Methods: : A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate HCWs including doctors, nurses and technicians from sixty hospitals in Beijing to obtain the perception of COVID-19 epidemic and the attitudes towards vaccination before before the completion of vaccine phase III clinical trials. Multivariate analysis was applied to evaluate the associated factors with intention to get vaccination. Results: : A total of 8040 HCWs was recruited. 67.1% reported they would get vaccination, others said unsure or would not. Half of the HCWs were unsure whether the outbreak in China would come back and the global epidemic would last for a long time. 67.6% agreed the epidemic can be prevented by vaccination. Positive associated factors with willingness to get vaccination were mainly included epidemic situation prognosis, perception of disease severity, self infection risk and disease can be prevented by vaccine, etc. Two positive factors of wanted the vaccine free of charge (OR:5.807, 95%CI:5.083-6.635, P<0.001) and believed vaccine approved for license have been fully evaluated in clinical trials (OR:4.485, 95%CI:3.849-5.227, P<0.001) were strongly associated with willingness to get vaccination, while two factors of highest academic degree (OR:0.840, 95%CI:0.772-0.914, P<0.001) and professional ranks and titles (OR:0.930, 95%CI:0.865-1.000, P=0.049) were negative associated . Conclusions: : A little above moderate willingness to get COVID-19 vaccination was found among HCWs in Beijing before the vaccine being licensed.

In addition, the effect of a percutaneous heel cord lengthening (HCL) during TAA on ankle motion is poorly understood. METHODS: A total of 357 primary TAAs treated with a 3-component device (336 patients, mean age 62.6 [24-85] years) performed between May 2003 and November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Sagittal ankle ROM was assessed according to a previously published protocol preoperatively (PreOP), 1 year postoperatively (PostOP), and at the last available follow-up (LastFU). Pain assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed at the same time points. The effect of a percutaneous HCL on ankle ROM and VAS for pain was also evaluated. RESULTS: Preoperative ankle ROM increased from mean 31.3 (0-69) to 33.9 (5-65) degrees 1 year postoperatively (P = .0002) and decreased to 31.9 (5-70) degrees at the LastFU (P = .007). Percutaneous HCL showed no effect on ankle ROM development after TAA (P = .141). Ankle ROM improvement after TAA (PreOP to LastFU) was higher in ankles with lower preoperative ankle motion (P < .0001). A lower ankle ROM at the last follow-up tended to be associated with a higher pain level (P = .056). CONCLUSION: Although ankles with a lower preoperative sagittal ROM gained motion, the current data suggest that TAA has little potential to increase the preoperative available ankle motion. In some patients with a high preoperative ankle ROM, a slight decrease of ankle motion was observed postoperatively. Patients with limited ankle motion at long-term follow-up tended toward experiencing higher pain levels. The short- and long-term effect of a percutaneous HCL on ankle ROM following TAA was minimal.

The present study aimed to investigate the predictors of disease severity and thus determine the trends for disease progression early. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with COVID-19 were recruited from Fuyang Second People's Hospital from January to February 2020. Patients' demographic, epidemiological, and clinical data were collected, and the relationships between these variables and disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 158 cases were included according to COVID-19 diagnosis, and the treatment schemes were analyzed for identification of early indicators affecting COVID-19 progression. Severe cases accounted for 18.99% of the diagnosed cases. Analysis showed that patients' age (&#967;2=10.640,=0.041); the time interval between onset and diagnosis (&#967;2=7.278, P=0.026); the source of cases (&#967;2=5.557, P=0.018); fever (&#967;2=5.676, P=0.014); dyspnea (&#967;2=113.085, P<0.001); muscle or joint pain (&#967;2=3.900, P=0.048); chest pain (&#967;2=13.446, P=0.006); the levels of lymphocytes (t=2.917, P=0.014), C-reactive protein (U=730.00, P<0.001), and aspartate aminotransferase (U=1235.00, P=0.002); damage in both lungs within 3 days of admission (&#967;2=7.632, P=0.003); and diabetes (&#967;2=6.675, P=0.010) were significantly correlated with the trend of intensification.

The study was part of an international multicenter study by the World Health Organisation (WHO).2 The Doctors, nurses, housekeeping staff, clerks, and other staff working in this DCH were considered as HCWs. HCWs working in this DCH with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited as cases and other HCWs working in this DCH in the same Ward/ICU/office without infection were recruited as controls (incidence density sampling). Three controls were taken per case. The questions were in the Likert scale. RESULTS There were 25 cases and their 75 controls. There was no significant difference between cases and controls with respect to age, sex, occupation, education, and comorbidities and all controls were negative for antibodies at the time of the interview. Most (70%) of the HCWs were doctor by profession followed by nurses (19%). All HCWs were trained in IPC (infection Prevention and Control). Most (96%) HCWs reported that PPE (personal protective equipment) is available in sufficient quantity. There was no significant difference between cases and controls with respect to those having direct contact with the patient's materials, surroundings, and following hand hygiene.

Assessment of the full range of evidence generated to date to understand the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time, its determinants and the immunity it confers will have a range of clinical and policy implications for this novel pathogen. This review comprehensively evaluated evidence describing the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. METHODS: Systematic review. Keyword-structured searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer. Articles were independently screened on title, abstract and full text by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements. Data were double-extracted into a pre-designed template, and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the Public Health Ontario Meta-tool for Quality Appraisal of Public Health Evidence (MetaQAT) tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. RESULTS: 150 papers were included. Most studies (113 or 75%) were observational in design, were based wholly or primarily on data from hospitalised patients (108, 72%) and had important methodological limitations. Few considered mild or asymptomatic infection. Antibody dynamics were well described in the acute phase, up to around three months from disease onset, but the picture regarding correlates of the antibody response was inconsistent. IgM was consistently detected before IgG in included studies, peaking at weeks two to five and declining over a further three to five weeks post-symptom onset depending on the patient group; IgG peaked around weeks three to seven post-symptom onset then plateaued, generally persisting for at least eight weeks. Neutralising antibodies were detectable within seven to 15 days following disease onset, with levels increasing until days 14-22 before levelling and then decreasing, but titres were lower in those with asymptomatic or clinically mild disease. Specific and potent neutralising antibodies have been isolated from convalescent plasma. Cross-reactivity but limited cross-neutralisation with other human coronaviridae was reported. Evidence for protective immunity in vivo was limited to small, short-term animal studies, showing promising initial results in the immediate recovery phase. CONCLUSIONS: Literature on antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is of variable quality with considerable heterogeneity of methods, study participants, outcomes measured and assays used. Although acute phase antibody dynamics are well described, longer-term patterns are much less well evidenced. Comprehensive assessment of the role of demographic characteristics and disease severity on antibody responses is needed. Initial findings of low neutralising antibody titres and possible waning of titres over time may have implications for sero-surveillance and disease control policy, although further evidence is needed. The detection of potent neutralising antibodies in convalescent plasma is important in the context of development of therapeutics and vaccines. Due to limitations with the existing evidence base, large, cross-national cohort studies using appropriate statistical analysis and standardised serological assays and clinical classifications should be prioritised.","output":"Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Mortality in care homes has had a prominent focus during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages, and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. Aim: To analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years. Study Design and Setting: We used anonymised Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and administrative data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. Methods: We calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. Results: Survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1.72 (1.55, 1.90) compared to 2016.

Thromboelastographic investigations are useful point-of-care devices to assess coagulation and fibrinolysis. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the hypothesis that the procoagulatory state in COVID-19 patients is associated with impaired fibrinolysis system. METHODS: Altogether, 29 COVID-19 patients admitted to normal wards or to the intensive care unit (ICU) were included in this descriptive study. Whole blood samples were investigated by thromboelastography to assess coagulation and fibrinolysis. Additionally, standard routine coagulation testing and immunoassays for factors of fibrinolysis as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activity and &#945;2-antiplasmin (A2AP) were performed. RESULTS: A significantly increased lysis resistance and a significantly longer time of lysis after adding tissue plasminogen activator were observed in blood samples from ICU COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (maximal lysis: 3.25  0.56 vs. 6.20  0.89%, p = 0.0127; lysis time: 365.7  44.6 vs. 193.2  16.3 seconds, p = 0.0014).

CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with impaired fibrinolytic activity in blood, where fibrinolytic inhibitors are elevated leading to an increased resistance to clot lysis.

Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes lung infection, gastrointestinal symptoms described in COVID-19 patients and detection of the viral RNA in feces of infected patients drove attentions to a possible fecal-oral transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. However, not only the viral RNA but also the infectious viral particles are required for the viral infection and no proof has been demonstrated the transmission of the infectious virus particles via the fecal-oral route yet. Growing evidence indicates the crosstalk between gut microbiota and lung, that maintains host homeostasis and disease development with the association of immune system. This gut-lung interaction may influence the COVID-19 severity in patients with extrapulmonary conditions. Severity of COVID-19 has mostly associated with old ages and underlying medical conditions. Since the diversity in the gut microbiota decreases during aging, dysbiosis could be the reason for older adults being at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19. We believe that gut microbiota contributes to the course of COVID-19 due to its bidirectional relationship with immune system and lung. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota results in gut permeability leading to secondary infection and multiple organ failure. Conversely, disruption of the gut barrier integrity due to dysbiosis may lead to translocation of SARS-CoV-2 from the lung into the intestinal lumen via circulatory and lymphatic system.

METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify eligible studies. The inclusion criteria were as follows: confirmed diagnosis of IBD; definitive EIMs; treatment with TOF; human study and published in English. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score and Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias were used to determine the quality of the selected studies. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and were included. For nonrandomized studies, 16 were low quality, 5 were moderate quality, and 1 was high quality. For the one randomized controlled trial, the overall bias risk was low. The most concerning EIMs were dermatological manifestations, rheumatologic manifestations, and others, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, uveitis, and Takayasu arteritis. After administering doses of 5-20 mg/d TOF, the included studies reported varying degrees of clinical remission for both the primary disease and EIMs, except for musculoskeletal EIMs. CONCLUSION: TOF might benefit EIMs in IBD, especially ulcerative colitis, and elevated dosages and longer treatment times may increase its effectiveness.

Researchers are typically interested in getting estimates of both short-run (SR) and long-run (LR) elasticities, along with their standard errors. This study aimed to contribute with estimations of demand elasticities of world phosphate fertilisers. It answered the research question How world demand of phosphate fertilisers is affected by its own price changes, cross price changes, income changes and other variables?. Short and long run elasticities are calculated using an economic model in this paper. The findings indicate that global phosphate demand is price inelastic both in the short and long run. In addition, in both the short and long run, income elasticity, cross price elasticity, and cross yield elasticity are inelastic. Our modeling predicts that phosphate consumption for fertilisers will increase from 45.35 million tons in 2018 to around 59.16 million tons by 2028; which implies that an average annual growth rate of 2.7% of P 2 O 5 will be required every year by phosphate consumers and that additional production capacity may be needed in order to meet this future demand.

The hemadsorption phenomenon also provides evidence for virus-erythrocyte interactions, which is based on the attachment of erythrocytes to infected cells in culture having hemagglutinin at their surfaces. This phenomenon reflects the interaction between erythrocytes and viral envelope components. The major virus groups that react with erythrocytes include myxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, pseudomyxoviruses, adenoviruses, arboviruses, reoviruses, enteroviruses, and miscellaneous hemagglutinating viruse (rubella virus, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and oncogenic viruses). The agglutination of erythrocytes by the direct action of viral particles was first described in connection with myxoviruses. This led directly to the discovery of viral neuraminidasea property unique to myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses. A number of viruses unrelated to myxoviruses have since been shown to agglutinate erythrocytes of various species. The visible result of viral hemagglutination is the pattern formed at the bottom of a test tube or well plate by lattices of red cells lightly conjoined by viral hemagglutinin. Hemagglutination serves as a useful direct means of titering intact viral particles or hemagglutinating subunits.","output":"Virus-Erythrocyte Interactions 1 1 Supported by grants from the National Instihtcs of Health (A1 03165, 06814;AM 13200)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The improved cosmesis and recovery from minimally invasive techniques has seen a dramatic rise in its popularity.

This study aimed to examine adolescents PA at school (PAS) and PA out-of-school (PAO), screen-based sedentary behaviors (SbSB), health-related fitness, and knowledge understanding about PA and fitness before and during the pandemic. Methods: Three rounds of data were collected: Time 1 pre-pandemic (January 2020; n = 405), Time 2 schools partially reopened (February 2021; n = 412), and Time 3 schools fully reopened (March 2021; n = 450). Adolescents completed the Youth Activity Profile, the 20 m Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER) test and Plank test, and a written test, to measure the behaviors (T1, T2, T3), fitness (T2CT3), and knowledge (T1, T2, T3), respectively. Results: Inferential statistical analyses revealed a significant time effect for the behaviors and fitness. From T1 to T2 PAO decreased but PAS increased; whereas SbSB decreased at T3 compared to T1 and T2. Health-related fitness improved from T2 to T3. Further, the change patterns for SbSB varied by grade, and those for knowledge understanding varied by gender. Conclusion: The findings confirm the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents active living but varied by school grade and gender.

Methods included a quantitative analysis of deidentified patient electronic health record data from 3 HCOs, supplemented by qualitative interviews to further understand opportunities and barriers. The analysis indicated that the data necessary for calculation of the AIS measure are available within HCOs and that measure performance could be enhanced with supplemental data from external sources, such as state immunization registries. Although HCOs rates were consistent with national estimates, this research further validated that adult immunization rates in the United States are low and highlighted the profound disparities that exist. For instance, the likelihood of completing all age-appropriate vaccinations was lower if patients were Black or African American, enrolled in Medicaid, or without health insurance. As a result of this study, the authors concluded that the AIS measure is feasible for use in medical groups and could potentially help drive quality improvements in immunization rates; however, there are considerations for implementation particularly if providers are being held accountable for measure performance.","output":"Using Quality Measures to Drive Improvements in Immunization Rates: Findings from a Real-World Evaluation from 3 US Health Care Organizations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a recent increase in speech research utilizing data recorded with participants' personal devices, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on face-toface interactions.

From a preventive and therapeutic point of view, there are two concerns that affect institutions and healthcare professionals: global immunization (which is still far from being achieved) and the availability of drugs capable of preventing its consequences in the infected patient. In this sense, the role that melatonin can play is has been assessed in the recent literature. Justification and Objectives: the serious health, social and economic consequences of COVID-19 have forced an urgent search for preventive methods, such as vaccines, among others, and therapeutic methods that could be alternatives to the drugs currently used. In this sense, it must be accepted that one of the most recommended has been the administration of melatonin. The present study proposes to carry out a systematic review of its possible role in the treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19. Material and methods: a systematic review of the literature related to the prevention of COVID-19 through the administration of melatonin was carried out, following the sequence proposed by the Prisma Declaration regarding the identification and selection of documents, using the specialized health databases Trip Medical Database, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Medline Plus, BVS, Cuiden and generic databases such as Dialnet, Web of Science and Google Scholar for their retrieval. Appro-priate inclusion and exclusion criteria are described for the articles assessed. The main limitation of the study has been the scarcity of works and the lack of defining a specific protocol in terms of dosage and administration schedule. Results: once the selection process was completed, and after an in-depth critical analysis, 197 papers were selected, and 40 of them were finally used. The most relevant results were: (1) melatonin prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection, (2) although much remains to be clarified, at high doses, it seems to have a coadjuvant therapeutic effect in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and (3) melatonin is effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Discussion: until group immunization is achieved in the population, it seems clear that we must continue to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and, in the absence of a specific and effective antiviral therapy, it is advisable to continue researching and providing drugs that demonstrate validity based on the scientific evidence. In this regard, we believe that the available studies recommend the administration of melatonin for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, sleep-inducing, CD147, Mpro, p65 and MMP9 protein suppressing, nephrotoxicity-reducing and highly effective and safe effects. Conclusions: (1) melatonin has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and Mpro and MMP9 protein-inhibitory activity. (2) It has been shown to have a wide margin of safety. (3) The contributions reviewed make it an effective therapeutic alternative in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Despite reports of neonatal COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has not been consistently isolated in perinatal samples, thus definitive proof of transplacental infection is still lacking. To address these questions, we assessed investigative tools used to confirm maternal-fetal infection and known protective mechanisms of the placental barrier that prevent transplacental pathogen migration. Forty studies of COVID-19 pregnancies reviewed suggest a lack of consensus on diagnostic strategy for congenital infection. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction of neonatal swabs was universally performed, a wide range of clinical samples was screened including vaginal secretions (22.5%), amniotic fluid (35%), breast milk (22.5%) and umbilical cord blood. Neonatal COVID-19 was reported in eight studies, two of which were based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in neonatal blood. Histological examination demonstrated sparse viral particles, vascular malperfusion and inflammation in the placenta from pregnant women with COVID-19. The paucity of placental co-expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors involved in cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2, may explain its relative insensitivity to transplacental infection.

Recent scholarship gives reason to suspect that a constellation of beliefs known as Christian nationalism may be associated with support for such violence. We build on this work, arguing that religious ideologies like Christian nationalism should be associated with support for violence, conditional on several individual characteristics that can be inflamed by elite cues. We turn to three such factors long-studied by scholars of political violence: perceived victimhood, reinforcing racial and religious identities, and support for conspiratorial information sources. Each can be exacerbated by elite cues, thus translating individual beliefs in Christian nationalism into support for political violence. We test this approach with original survey data collected in the wake of the Capitol attacks. We find that all the identified factors are positively related to each other and support for the Capitol riot; moreover, the relationship between Christian nationalism and support for political violence is sharply conditioned by white identity, perceived victimhood, and support for the QAnon movement. These results suggest that religions role in contemporary right-wing violence is embedded with non-religious factors that deserve further scholarly attention in making sense of support for political violence.

Despite the Brazilian national guideline protecting breastfeeding practices, there are many concerns about protecting infants from their infected mothers. This study aimed to analyze how the Brazilian hospitals and maternity services promote and support mothers suspected or diagnosed with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional and multicenter study which collected data from 24 Brazilian hospitals and maternity services between March and July 2020. Representatives of the institutions completed a questionnaire based on acts to promote and support breastfeeding, the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, and Brazil's federal law recommendations. RESULTS: The results showed that in delivery rooms, 98.5% of the services prohibited immediate and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their infants and did not support mothers to initiate breastfeeding in the first hour. On the postnatal ward, 98.5% of the services allowed breastfeeding while implementing respiratory hygiene practices to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Companions for mothers were forbidden in 83.3% of the hospitals. Hospital discharge was mostly between 24 and 28 h (79.1%); discharge guidelines were not individualized. Additionally, a lack of support was noticed from the home environment's health community network (83.3%). Hospital and home breast pumping were allowed (87.5%), but breast milk donation was not accepted (95.8%). There was a lack of guidance regarding the use of infant comforting strategies.

The importance of access to formal financial networks in enabling positive and significant economic outcomes has been demonstrated in many settings in the literature. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adds further credence to the necessity of unlocking access to basic financial services for more resilience to consumption and investment collapse. In this paper, we particularly investigate the impact of financial inclusion on non-resources tax revenue based on a sample of 63 developing countries over the period 2004-2017.

The aim of this study was to compare the COVID-19 fear experienced by COVID-19 intensive care unit staff and general intensive care unit staff, and the effects of this fear on mental health. Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 156 participants, 90 (57.7%) participants from the COVID-19 intensive care unit and 66 (42.3%) from the general intensive care unit, were included. A printed questionnaire consisting of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), and demographic data were used. Results: Female gender, being a nurse, and working in COVID-19 intensive care unit, were associated with higher depression, anxiety, and stress scores. A significant relationship was found between fear of COVID-19 and depression (=0.399, p=0.044), anxiety (=0.456, p=0.019), and stress (=0.418, p=0.033). Furthermore, as compared to general intensive care unit staff, COVID-19 intensive care unit staff who may have high-risk contact were approximately twice times more likely to experience anxiety and fear of COVID-19 and 3.5 times more likely to suffer from depression and stress. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the mental health of intensive care staff. Attention should be paid to the mental health of females and nurses working in the COVID-19 intensive care unit.

OBJECTIVE: To examine outcomes and risk factors associated with COVID-19 clinical severity in a large, diverse cohort of North American patients with MS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This analysis used deidentified, cross-sectional data on patients with MS and SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by health care professionals in North American academic and community practices between April 1, 2020, and December 12, 2020, in the COVID-19 Infections in MS Registry. Health care professionals were asked to report patients after a minimum of 7 days from initial symptom onset and after sufficient time had passed to observe the COVID-19 disease course through resolution of acute illness or death. Data collection began April 1, 2020, and is ongoing. EXPOSURES: Laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection or highly suspected COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcome with 4 levels of increasing severity: not hospitalized, hospitalization only, admission to the intensive care unit and/or required ventilator support, and death. RESULTS: Of 1626 patients, most had laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (1345 [82.7%]), were female (1202 [74.0%]), and had relapsing-remitting MS (1255 [80.4%]). A total of 996 patients (61.5%) were non-Hispanic White, 337 (20.8%) were Black, and 190 (11.7%) were Hispanic/Latinx. The mean (SD) age was 47.7 (13.2) years, and 797 (49.5%) had 1 or more comorbidity. The overall mortality rate was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.5%-4.3%). Ambulatory disability and older age were each independently associated with increased odds of all clinical severity levels compared with those not hospitalized after adjusting for other risk factors (nonambulatory: hospitalization only, odds ratio [OR], 2.8 [95% CI, 1.6-4.8]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.6-7.8]; death, OR, 25.4 [95% CI, 9.3-69.1]; age [every 10 years]: hospitalization only, OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.99-1.7]; death, OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this registry-based cross-sectional study, increased disability was independently associated with worse clinical severity including death from COVID-19. Other risk factors for worse outcomes included older age, Black race, cardiovascular comorbidities, and recent treatment with corticosteroids. Knowledge of these risk factors may improve the treatment of patients with MS and COVID-19 by helping clinicians identify patients requiring more intense monitoring or COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Outcomes and Risk Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a North American Registry of Patients With Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the long-term outcomes and health-related quality of life in patients with blunt thoracic injuries over 6 months from hospital discharge and develop models to predict long-term patient-reported outcomes. DESIGN: A prospective observational study using longitudinal survey design. SETTING: The study recruitment was undertaken at 12 UK hospitals which represented diverse geographical locations and covered urban, suburban and rural areas across England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 337 patients admitted to hospital with blunt thoracic injuries were recruited between June 2018COctober 2020. METHODS: Participants completed a bank of two quality of life surveys (Short Form-12 (SF-12) and EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Levels) and two pain questionnaires (Brief Pain Inventory and painDETECT Questionnaire) at four time points over the first 6 months after discharge from hospital. A total of 211 (63%) participants completed the outcomes data at 6 months after hospital discharge. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Three outcomes were measured using pre-existing and validated patient-reported outcome measures. Outcomes included: Poor physical function (SF-12 Physical Component Score); chronic pain (Brief Pain Inventory Pain Severity Score); and neuropathic pain (painDETECT Questionnaire). RESULTS: Despite a trend towards improving physical functional and pain at 6 months, outcomes did not return to participants perceived baseline level of function. At 6 months after hospital discharge, 37% (n=77) of participants reported poor physical function; 36.5% (n=77) reported a chronic pain state; and 22% (n=47) reported pain with a neuropathic component. Predictive models were developed for each outcome highlighting important data collection requirements for predicting long-term outcomes in this population.

We assess changes in the prevalence of food-related hardships in the UK population from April to July 2020. METHOD: We analysed longitudinal data on food-related hardships for 11,104 respondents from the April-July 2020 waves of the Understanding Society COVID-19 web survey with linked data from the 2017-9 wave of the annual Understanding Society survey. Outcome variables were reports of being hungry but not eating and of being unable to eat healthy and nutritious food in the last week, which were adapted from the Food Insecurity Experience Scale. We used unadjusted estimates to examine changes in population prevalence and logistic regression to assess the association between employment transitions and both outcomes at the individual level. FINDINGS: The prevalence of reporting an inability to eat healthy or nutritious food rose from 3?2% in April to 16?3% in July 2020. The largest increases in being unable to eat healthy or nutritious food were among Asian respondents, the self-employed, and 35-44-year-olds. The prevalence of being hungry but not eating rose from 3?3% in April to 5?1% in July, with the largest increases observed among unemployed individuals below age 65. Those moving from employment to unemployment had higher odds of being hungry but not eating in the last week relative to furloughed individuals (OR = 2?2; p < 0?05; 95% CI: 1?1 to 4?2) and to the persistently employed (OR = 3?5; p < 0?001; 95% CI: 1?8 to 6?9), adjusting for age, highest qualification in 2017-19, net household income in 2017-19 (equivalized), gender, race/ethnicity, number children at home (aged 0-4, 5-15, and 16-18), cohabitation status, and government office region. Respondents moving from employment to unemployment also had higher odds of reporting an inability to eat healthy and nutritious food relative to furloughed individuals (OR = 1?9; p < 0?05; 95% CI: 1?4 to 3?2) and to the persistently employed (OR = 2?0; p < 0?01; 95% CI: 1?2 to 3?4). No statistically significant differences were found between furloughed individuals and the persistently employed in their probability of reporting either outcome. INTERPRETATION: Food-related hardships increased substantially in the UK between April and July 2020, largely driven by reports of an inability to eat healthy and nutritious food. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and Self-Employment Income Support Scheme appeared to have conferred some protection, but more could have been done to mitigate the problems we describe in obtaining affordable food.

METHODS: Using PubMed, the authors searched for articles containing information on the utilization of MNs in inflammatory disorders as assessed from in vitro and animal studies, and in clinical trials, in terms of exerting anti-inflammatory actions. RESULTS: The retrieved literature provided evidence relating acute pathologic conditions, such as sepsis and pneumonia, with a number of redox endpoints of biological and clinical relevance. Among these findings, both ALA and CARN were effective in counteracting inflammation-associated redox biomarkers, while CoQ10 showed decreased levels in proinflammatory conditions. MN-associated antioxidant actions were applied in a number of acute disorders, mostly using one MN. The body of literature assessing the safety and the complementary roles of MNs taken together suggests an adjuvant role of MN combinations in counteracting oxidative stress in sepsis and other acute disorders, including COVID-19-associated pneumonia.

However, therapeutic targets for effective treatment and early intervention of AP are still urgently required to be identified. Here, we have observed that the expression of pancreatic lincRNA-EPS, a long intergenic noncoding RNA, is dynamically changed during both caerulein-induced AP (Cer-AP) and sodium taurocholate-induced severe AP (NaTc-SAP). The expression pattern of lincRNA-EPS is negatively correlated with the typical inflammatory genes such as IL-6, IL-1, CXCL1, and CXCL2. Further studies indicate that knockout of lincRNA-EPS aggravates the pathological symptoms of AP including more induction of serum amylase and lipase, severe edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and acinar necrosis in both experimental AP mouse models. Besides these intrapancreatic effects, lincRNA-EPS also protects against tissue damages in the extra-pancreatic organs such as lung, liver, and gut in the NaTc-SAP mouse model. In addition, we have observed that more serum pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-6 in the lincRNA-EPS-/- NaTc-SAP mice and more extracellular HMGB1 around injured acinar cells in the pancreas from lincRNA-EPS-/- NaTc-SAP mice, compared to their respective controls.

Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of \\"open-label placebos\\" (OLPs) have remained subject of debate. Furthermore, it is unclear whether OLPs are similarly effective when provided remotely, as is sometimes required e.g. in the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a randomized-controlled trial, we examined the effects of OLP plus treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone on symptom reduction in people with allergic rhinitis (N = 54) over the course of two weeks. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, OLP was provided remotely (i.e. sent via postal service). To investigate the potential influence of the clinical encounter on the effects of OLP, we manipulated the perception of the virtual clinical encounter, both with respect to verbal and nonverbal factors (augmented vs. limited encounter). RESULTS: The results of the manipulation check confirmed that the augmented clinical encounter was evaluated more positively than the limited encounter, in terms of perceived warmth of the provider. Participants from all treatment groups showed significant symptom reduction from baseline to two weeks later, but OLP had no incremental effect over TAU. Participants benefitted more from OLP when they did not take any other medication against allergic symptoms than when taking medication on demand. When controlling for baseline symptoms, a significant treatment by encounter interaction was found, pointing to greater symptom improvement in the OLP group when the encounter was augmented, whereas the control group improved more when the encounter was limited. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates that providing OLP and enhancing the encounter remotely is possible, but their effectiveness might be lower in comparison to previous studies relying on physical patient-provider interaction.

RESULTS: The average working time of 72.7 hours/week before the pandemic was decreased to 65.6 hours/week during the pandemic (p < 0.001). The time working in the operating room was significantly decreased during the pandemic, but not in the emergency centre and outpatient clinic. The education times for lecture and clinical case discussion were decreased during the pandemic (both, p < 0.001), respectively. While the use of traditional teaching methods was decreased, the use of online-based teaching methods was increased (p < 0.001). However, satisfaction level with online-based teaching methods was significantly lower compared with that of traditional teaching methods. The average working time exposed to the patients with COVID-19 was 9.7 hours/week. About 47.6% of orthopaedic residents experienced isolation or quarantine.

Although COVID-19 emergent with significant mortality, there is no availability of definite treatment measures. It is now extremely desirable to identify potential chemical entities against SARS-CoV-2 for the treatment of COVID-19. In the present study, a state-of-art virtual screening protocol was implemented on three anti-viral specific chemical libraries against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Particularly, viewing the large-scale biological role of Mpro in the viral replication process it has been considered as a prospective anti-viral drug target. Herein, on collected 79,892 compounds, hierarchical multistep docking followed by relative binding free energy estimation has been performed. Thereafter, implying a user-defined XP-dock and MM-GBSA cut-off scores as -8.00 and -45.00 kcal/mol, chemical space has been further reduced. Exhaustive molecular binding interactions analyses and various pharmacokinetics profiles assessment suggested four compounds (ChemDiv_D658-0159, ChemDiv_F431-0433, Enamine_Z3019991843 and Asinex_LAS_51389260) as potent inhibitors/modulators of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In-depth protein-ligand interactions stability in the dynamic state has been evaluated by 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies along with MM-GBSA-based binding free energy estimations of entire simulation trajectories that have revealed strong binding affinity of all identified compounds towards Mpro. Hence, all four identified compounds might be considered as promising candidates for future drug development specifically targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro; however, they also need experimental assessment for a better understanding of molecular interaction mechanisms.","output":"Structure-based identification of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors from anti-viral specific chemical libraries: an exhaustive computational screening approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The perinatal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still largely unknown. This study aimed to describe the features and outcomes of pregnant women with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection after the universal screening was established in a large tertiary care center admitting only obstetric related conditions without severe COVID-19 in Mexico City. This retrospective case-control study integrates data between April 22 and May 25, 2020, during active community transmission in Mexico, with one of the highest COVID-19 test positivity percentages worldwide. Only pregnant women and neonates with a SARS-CoV-2 result by quantitative RT-PCR were included in this study. Among 240 pregnant women, the prevalence of COVID-19 was 29% (95% CI, 24% to 35%); 86% of the patients were asymptomatic (95% CI, 76%-92%), nine women presented mild symptoms, and one patient moderate disease. No pregnancy baseline features or risk factors associated with severity of infection, including maternal age > 35 years, Body Mass Index >30 kg/m(2), and pre-existing diseases, differed between positive and negative women. The median gestational age at admission for both groups was 38 weeks. All women were discharged at home without complications, and no maternal death was reported. The proportion of preeclampsia was higher in positive women than negative women (18%, 95% CI, 10%-29% vs. 9%, 95% CI, 5%-14%, P<0.05). No differences were found for other perinatal outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 test result was positive for nine infants of positive mothers detected within 24h of birth. An increased number of infected neonates were admitted to the NICU, compared to negative neonates (44% vs. 22%, P<0.05) and had a longer length of hospitalization (2 [2C18] days vs. 2 [2C3] days, P<0.001); these are potential proxies for illness severity.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Governmental- designated facility in the eastern province, Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANTS: 128 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 quarantined individuals who had a history of travel abroad in the last 14 days before the quarantine or were in direct contact with laboratory-confirmed cases. The study was from March 18th-till April 16th. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MEASURES: The clinical presentation, prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined subjects, and the difference between virus clearance among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. RESULTS: Sixty-nine of the 128 residents (54%) were completely asymptomatic until the end of the study. The remaining 59 residents (46%) had only mild symptoms. The most common symptom was a sudden loss of smell and taste, accounting for 47.5%. The median time to virus clearance was significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic residents cleared the virus at a median of 17 days (95% CI, 12.4C21.6) from the first positive PCR vs. 11days (95% CI, 8.7C13.3) in the asymptomatic group (P = 0.011). False-negative test results occurred in 18.8% of the total residents and false-positive results in 3%. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among quarantined travelers and those identified by contact tracing is high in our study. Therefore, testing, tracing, and isolating travelers and contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, regardless of symptoms, were very effective measures for early disease identification and containment. Loss of taste and smell were the most common presentations in our mild symptomatic residents and should be used as a screening tool for COVID-19. The persistent positive PCR beyond 14 days observed in the mild symptomatic residents despite being symptoms free, warrant further studies to determine its implications on disease spread and control.","output":"Silent disease and loss of taste and smell are common manifestations of SARS-COV-2 infection in a quarantine facility: Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 has been recognized as the causal factor in a series of severe cases of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China which has been named Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO.

METHODS 173 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving tocilizumab in Reggio Emilia province Hospitals between 11 March and 3 June 2020 were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Clinical improvement was defined as status improvement on a six-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. A composite outcome of intubation/death was also evaluated. CRP and IL-6 levels were determined before TCZ administration (T0) and after 3 (T3), and 7 (T7) days. RESULTS At multivariate analysis T0 and T3 CRP levels were negatively associated with clinical improvement (OR 0.13, CI 0.03-0.55 and OR 0.11, CI 0.0-0.46) (p=0.006 and p=0.003) and positively associated with intubation/death (OR 17.66, CI 2.47-126.14 and OR 5.34, CI: 1.49-19.12) (p=0.01 and p=0.004). No significant associations with IL-6 values were observed. General linear model analyses for repeated measures showed significantly different trends for CRP from day 3 to day 7 between patients who improved and those who did not, and between patients who were intubated or died and those who were not (p<0.0001 for both).

Determining parameters and their values is particularly challenging in the case of models of pathophysiology, for which data for calibration is sparse. Multiple data sources might be required, and data may not be in a uniform or desirable format. We describe a calibration strategy to overcome the challenges of scarcity and heterogeneity of calibration data. Our strategy focuses on parameters where initial values cannot be easily derived from the literature and where final values are estimated via calibration with constraints set by relevant data. When combined with a covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), this step-by-step approach can be applied to a wide range of biological models.

Associations between OCT parameters and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were analyzed. Based on the location of the inner margin of INL, all patients were divided into three stages and the mean comparison between the three stages was analyzed. RESULTS PIRT (r = 0.6489; p < 0.0001) and pseudohole depth (r = 0.5266; p < 0.0001) had a statistically significant correlation with BCVA. Statistically significant visual acuity differences were found in eyes with DRIL (p < 0.001) and IZ disruption (p = 0.018), but not in ELM disruption (p = 0.916), EZ disruption (p = 0.581), and cotton ball sign (p = 0.075).

The quality of life of health care workers plays an important role in their skilful delivery of work. Our study assesses their quality of life (QOL) during COVID-19 pandemic so that appropriate measures can be taken to improve their well-being. METHODS: This was an online crosssectional survey among healthcare workers of COVID-19 designated government hospitals in districts Abbottabad, Manshera and Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan from 23rdJune till 25thJuly, 2020. QOL was assessed using validated WHO QOL BREF. Univariate and multivariate linear regression were used to assess the factors associated with QOL among HCWs. RESULTS: A total of 362 HCWs participated in the study. The mean scores of physical, psychological, social relationships, environmental domains were 60.7 (17.40), 59.70 (17.30), 67.90 (17.90), and 58.20 (18.40) respectively. Hospital where the respondents were working was the consistent predictor of QOL scores in all four domains with generally lower scores associated with other hospitals compared to Ayub Medical Hospital. Years of experience were positively associated with psychological, social relationship and environmental domains. Designation was associated with social relationship domain only.

Monitoring of the viral load will be a valuable method to reduce the optimal number of quarantine days, especially in presymptomatic and symptomatic carriers of their households. The traditional three-generation families living together are seen frequently in East Asia, including in Taiwan. Study Design We report on a family cluster with six individuals infected with coronavirus disease in Taiwan. Methods The current public policy in Taiwan is quarantine for at least 14 days, based on the incubation period, or until the patient has tested negative three days in a row using the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Details on the onset date of clinical symptoms, throat swab conversion, and course of disease were collected from medical records retrospectively. Results In the household of this three-generation Taiwanese family, the infection rate was 60%. The ratio of males to females was 4:2, and the age range was 11C85 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic disease was 33.3% (2/6). The longest throat swab conversion time was 37 days, and the estimated course of disease from symptoms to first conversion of throat swab was 59 days. Conclusions Large families, including three-generation families in a single dwelling, should be monitored when the index case is found. Presymptomatic and symptomatic family members could be quarantined for an appropriate duration which, in our experience, is 2 months.","output":"A three-generation family cluster with COVID-19 infection: Should quarantine be prolonged?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to examine the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the WorkCFamily Behavioral Role Conflict Scale (WFBRC-S), which was originally developed to measure workCfamily behavioral role conflict in American adults with a wide variety of occupations such as nurses and chief executive officers. This study used a methodological research design. The study population consisted of 235 married men and women aged 20 years or older who were living in various cities, who had been employed for three years or more. The validity of the content, construct, convergent, discriminant, and criterion related, as well as the reliability of the WFBRC-S-K, was assessed. The WFBRC-S Korean version consists of 25 items. It was found that through the validity of the composition and standards of WFBRC-S-K, it was possible to measure the conflict by focusing on behavior so that a comprehensive evaluation of the role conflict between family and work, and work and family, can be performed. Five items in the WFBRC-S-K were excluded with a standardized factor loading of less than 0.50. We applied the modified index to improve the model fit to build a model, it supports a good fit and reliable score for the Korean version of the WFBRC-S model.

However, the exact molecular mechanism of SFJDC remains unclear. The present study aims to determine the potential pharmacological mechanisms of SFJDC in the treatment of COVID-19 based on network pharmacology. METHODS: The network pharmacology-based strategy includes collection and analysis of active compounds and target genes, network construction, identification of key compounds and hub target genes, KEGG and GO enrichment, recognition and analysis of main modules, as well as molecule docking. RESULTS: A total of 214 active chemical compounds and 339 target genes of SFJDC were collected. Of note, 5 key compounds ( ? -sitosterol, luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin, and stigmasterol) and 10 hub target genes (TP53, AKT1, NCOA1, EGFR, PRKCA, ANXA1, CTNNB1, NCOA2, RELA and FOS) were identified based on network analysis. The hub target genes mainly enriched in pathways including MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway, which could be the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of SFJDC for treating COVID-19. Moreover, the key compounds had high binding activity with three typical target genes. CONCLUSIONS: By network pharmacology analysis, SFJDC was found to effectively improve immune function and reduce inflammatory responses based on its key compounds, hub target genes, and the relevant pathways. These findings may provide valuable evidence for explaining how SFJDC exerting the therapeutic effects on COVID-19, providing a holistic view for further clinical application.","output":"Exploring the Potential Mechanism of Shufeng Jiedu Capsule for Treating COVID-19 by Comprehensive Network Pharmacological Approaches and Molecular Docking Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this commentary we argue that the hygiene hypothesis may apply to COVID-19 susceptibility and also that residence in low hygienic conditions acts to train innate immune defenses to minimize the severity of infection.

This program was developed to provide telephone support to at-risk patients who had received HHC prior to the COVID-19 lockdown. In total, 16 Care Transition Managers participated in the project and over 4,000 patients received a call from the clinical team. Approximately 44% of the calls did not require any further follow up, 20% of the patients did not answer the call, and 3% of patients were referred back to HHC. Another 13% needed education and assistance with social issues. The calls provided a means of safe connection and support between providers and patients during the pandemic and facilitated access to health and social resources. However, the most beneficial aspect of the program was the opportunity for seasoned HHC nurses to identify clinical changes in the health of patients and to assist them in the triage process.

We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged &#8805;20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 57% (95% CI 51-64) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 149% (132-169) by Jan 15, 2021. With 265% (234-298) of adult residents having been infected in ?le-de-France (Paris region) compared with 51% (45-58) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 050) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 074). The proportion infected was twice as high (204%, 156-263) in 20-49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (97%, 69-141). 402% (343-463) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 493% (429-559) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 089).

Here, we investigated these parameters in blue tit populations inhabiting deciduous versus evergreen forests, and insular versus mainland areas, in the context of a previously described strong phenotypic differentiation. Neighboring population pairs of deciduous and evergreen habitats were weakly genetically differentiated (F (ST) = 0.003 on average), nevertheless with a statistically significant effect of habitat type on the overall genetic structure. This low differentiation was consistent with the strong and long\\\\lasting gene flow between populations inferred by demographic modeling. In turn, insular and mainland populations were moderately differentiated (F (ST) = 0.08 on average), in line with the inference of moderate ancestral migration, followed by isolation since the end of the last glaciation. Effective population sizes were large, yet smaller on the island than on the mainland. Weak and nonparallel footprints of divergent selection between deciduous and evergreen populations were consistent with their high connectivity and the probable polygenic nature of local adaptation in these habitats. In turn, stronger footprints of divergent selection were identified between long isolated insular versus mainland birds and were more often found in regions of low recombination, as expected from theory.

Upon exposure to different population and changing environment, the viral strain might experience different mutational bias that leads to genetic diversity among the viral population. Also, the diversification can be influenced by distinct selection pressure on different viral genomes. We have carried out a comparative genomic analysis of 82 SARS-CoV2 genomes. We have evaluated their evolutionary divergence, substitution pattern, and rates. Viral genomes under distinct selection pressure have been identified. Sites that experience strong selection pressure also have been identified. Our result shows that the translational preference of a few codons is strongly correlated with the mutational bias imposed by genome compositional constraint and influenced by natural selection. Few genomes are evolving with a higher mutational rate with a distinct signature of nucleotide substitution in comparison to others.

These studies are important for economical, veterinary, and human medical perspectives. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy techniques elaborate the structureCfunction relation studies by utilizing various computational approaches for structure-assisted designing of drug molecules and antiviral against viruses.

Little is known about the initial responses of human lung alveoli to SARS-CoV-2 infection due in part to inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease. Here we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of the distal lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2, using AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture after their derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iAT2s). We find that SARS-CoV-2 induces a rapid global transcriptomic change in infected iAT2s characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype predominated by the secretion of cytokines encoded by NF-kB target genes, delayed epithelial interferon responses, and rapid loss of the mature lung alveolar epithelial program. Over time, infected iAT2s exhibit cellular toxicity that can result in the death of these key alveolar facultative progenitors, as is observed in vivo in COVID-19 lung autopsies. Importantly, drug testing using iAT2s confirmed the efficacy of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating putative mechanisms used for viral entry in human alveolar cells. Our model system reveals the cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to infection, providing a platform for further drug development and facilitating a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Human Lung Alveolar Type 2 Cells Elicits a Rapid Epithelial-Intrinsic Inflammatory Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Impaired immune response to COVID-19 vaccines have been observed in autoimmune rheumatic disease patients. Determining the most effective and safe vaccine regimen is critically needed in such a population. We aim to compare the immunogenicity and safety of three COVID-19 vaccine regimens in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: SLE and RA patients aged 18-65 years who received inactivated (CoronaVac or COVILO), adenovirus-vectored (AZD1222), or heterogeneous (AZD1222/BNT162b2) vaccines were enrolled. Humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed at day 28 after the second vaccination. This was performed using the serum binding antibody level against receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (anti-RBD Ig) and IFNy-ELISpot assay (ELISpot) respectively. Reactogenicity was reviewed on day 7 following each vaccination. Disease activity was assessed before and on day 28 after the second vaccination. Results: The cohort consisted of 94 patients (64 SLE and 30 RA). Inactivated, AZD1222, and AZD1222/BNT162b2 vaccines were administered to 23, 43, and 28 patients, respectively. Anti-RBD titers were lowest in the inactivated vaccine group (2.84 AU/mL; 95% CI 0.96-8.44), followed by AZD1222 (233.7 AU/mL; 95% CI 99.0 - 505.5) and AZD1222/BNT162b2 (688.6 AU/mL; 95% CI 271 - 1745), p 0<0.0001. After adjusting for relevant factors, the inactivated vaccine was associated with the lowest humoral response, while adenovirus-vectored/mRNA vaccine was the highest. The proportion of positive ELISpot test was also lowest in the inactivated vaccine group (27%), followed by the adenovirus-vectored vaccine (67%), and adenovirus-vectored/mRNA vaccine (73%)(p = 0.03). All types of vaccine were well-tolerated. There was no flare of autoimmune disease post-vaccination. Conclusion: Adenovirus-vectored and adenovirus-vectored/mRNA vaccines elicited a stronger humoral and cellular immune response than inactivated vaccines, suggesting that they may be more suitable in SLE and RA patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy.","output":"Comparison of immunogenicity and safety of inactivated, adenovirus-vectored and heterologous adenovirus-vectored/mRNA vaccines in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 originally emerged in Wuhan in December 2019.

We investigated the genetic determinants of Lp(a) concentrations in a large prospective multiethnic cohort. We tested the association for potential causality between genetically determined higher Lp(a) concentrations and CAD using a multivariable Mendelian randomization strategy. Approach and Results: We studied 371 212 participants of the UK Biobank with available Lp(a) and genome-wide genetic data. Genome-wide association analyses confirmed 2 known and identified 37 novel loci (P<510-8) associated with Lp(a). Testing these loci as instrumental variables in an independent cohort with 60 801 cases and 123 504 controls, each SD genetically elevated Lp(a) conferred a 1.30 ([95% CI, 1.20-1.41] P=5.5310-11) higher odds of CAD.

However, the majority of them primarily concern the topological structure of PPI networks and lack of the consideration for the native organized structure among protein complexes. The PPI networks generated by high-throughput technology include a fraction of false protein interactions which make it difficult to identify protein complexes efficiently. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised protein complex detection model based on non-negative matrix tri-factorization, which not only considers topological structure of a PPI network but also makes full use of available high quality known protein pairs with must-link constraints.

In addition, the proposed two protein complex detection algorithms outperform a diverse range of state-of-the-art protein complex identification algorithms on both synthetic networks and human related PPI networks.","output":"Identifying Protein Complexes With Clear Module Structure Using Pairwise Constraints in Protein Interaction Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic led to dramatic changes in economic activity in 2020 We use estimates of emissions changes for 2020 in two Earth System Models (ESMs) to simulate the impacts of the COVID-19 economic changes Ensembles of nudged simulations are used to separate small signals from meteorological variability Reductions in aerosol and precursor emissions, chiefly Black Carbon (BC) and sulfate (SO4), led to reductions in total anthropogenic aerosol cooling through aerosol-cloud interactions The average overall Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) peaks at +0 290 15 Wm?2 in spring 2020 Changes in cloud properties are smaller than observed changes during 2020 Impacts of these changes on regional land surface temperature range up to +0 3K The peak impact of these aerosol changes on global surface temperature is very small (+0 03K) However, the aerosol changes are the largest contribution to radiative forcing and temperature changes as a result of COVID-19 affected emissions, larger than ozone, CO2 and contrail effects","output":"Climate Impacts of COVID-19 Induced Emission Changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Our purpose was to verify whether extensive dissection toward the sacrospinous ligament (SSL) needed for mesh fixation during anterior compartment repair increases the risk of postoperative voiding difficulties. METHODS A total of 124 patients after anterior compartment mesh repair without simultaneous suburethral sling placement operated on in the period 2005-2012 were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. Patients with previous anti-incontinence surgery with normal urodynamics were not excluded; 30 patients with incomplete data, severe perioperative complications, and urinary retention before and after the surgery were excluded. Urinary retention was defined as post-void residual over 150 ml more than 48 h after permanent catheter removal. The rate of urinary retention after anterior compartment repair by mesh anchored to the SSL from an anterior approach (SSLS group) was compared to that following transobturator mesh repair often combined with SSL fixation from the posterior approach (TOT group). RESULTS Of the 94 patients considered for statistical analysis, 62 were from the SLSS group and 32 from the TOT group. The groups were comparable in age (mean 65.5 vs 66.3), body mass index (24.8 vs 25.9), and parity (2.4 vs 2.9). Patients from the SSLS group had higher rates of prior vaginal reconstructive (27 vs 19 %) and anti-incontinence surgery (26 vs 19 %). Postoperative urinary retention was statistically significantly more frequent in the SSLS group compared to the TOT group [(17 (27 %) vs 2 (6.25 %), odds ratio 5.7, 95 % confidence interval 1.2-26.3, p = 0.027]. Hospital discharge with self-catheterization was statistically insignificantly more frequent in the SSLS group [8 % (5) vs 3 % (1)]. CONCLUSIONS Extensive dissection needed for SSL suspension from an anterior approach may lead to more frequent postoperative voiding difficulties. This phenomenon could be explained by more considerable injury to pelvic splanchnic nerves during the dissection. A large prospective study is needed for validation of our results.","output":"Voiding difficulties after vaginal mesh cystocele repair: does the perivesical dissection matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 with its rapid expansion has led to extraordinary implications in our understanding of viral infections and their management globally.

The fold topology is captured by a contracted fold which merges helices separated by bulges and removes hairpin loops. Contracted folds are either trivial or pseudoknotted. Strand folding is characterised by a rigid-vertex polarised strand graph, whose vertices correspond to double-helices and edges correspond to strands joining those helices. Each vertex has a plumbline whose polarisation direction defines the helical axis. That polarised graph has a corresponding circular ribbon diagram and canonical alphanumeric fold label. Key features of the fully-flagged fold are the arrangement of complementary domains along the strand, described by a numerical bare fold label, and a pair of binary flags: a parity flag that specifies the twist in each helix (even or odd half-twists), and an orientation flag that characterises each double-helix as parallel or antiparallel. A simple algorithm is presented to translate an arbitrary fold label into a polarised strand graph. Any embedding of the graph in 3-space is an admissible fold geometry; the simplest embeddings minimise the number of edge-crossings in a planar graph drawing. If that number is zero, the fold lies in one of two classes: (a)-type relaxed folds, which contain conventional junctions and (b)-type folds whose junctions are described as meso-junctions in H. Wang and N.C. Seeman, Biochem, vol. 34, pp920-929. (c)-type folds induce polarised strand graphs with edge-crossings, regardless of the planar graph drawing. Canonical fold labelling allows us to sort and enumerate all semi-flagged folds with up to six contracted double-helices as windings around the edges of a graph-like fold skeleton, whose cyclomatic number - the fold genus - ranges from 0 C 3, resulting in a pair of duplexed strands along each skeletal edge. Those semi-flagged folds admit both even and odd double-helical twists. Appending specific parity flags to those semi-flagged folds gives fully-flagged (a)-type folds, which are also enumerated up to genus-3 cases. We focus on all-antiparallel folds, characteristic of conventional ssRNA and enumerate all distinct (a), (b) and (c)-type folds with up to five double-helices. Those circular folds lead to pseudoknotted folds for linear ssRNA strands. We describe all linear folds derived from (a) or (b)-type circular folds with up to four contracted double-helices, whose simplest cases correspond to so-called H, K and L pseudoknotted folds, detected in ssRNA. Fold knotting is explored in detail, via constructions of so-called antifolds and isomorphic folds. We also tabulate fold knottings for (a) and (b)-type folds whose embeddings minimise the number of edge-crossings and outline the procedure for (c)-type folds. The inverse construction - from a specific knot to a suitable nucleotide sequence - results in a hierarchy of knots. A number of specific alternating knots with up to 10 crossings emerge as favoured fold designs for ssRNA, since they are readily constructed as (a)-type all-antiparallel folds.","output":"Folds induced by multiple parallel or antiparallel double-helices: (pseudo)knotting of single-stranded RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most important paraclinical tool for assessing drug response in multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trials.

Herein, an example of Pt SA-Zn0.5 Cd0.5 S (Pt SA-ZCS) displays interesting phenomena when facing the Brownian collision of ions in aqueous photocatalysis. Via the synchrotron radiation, surface techniques, microscopy and theory calculations, results show that there exist two kinds of Pt sites: PtZn-sub -S3 (Pt substituting the Zn site) and Ptads -S2 (Pt adsorbing on the surface). In Na2 S, the S2- can coordinate with Pt atoms and peel them from the Ptads -S2 sites, but left more stable PtZn-sub -S3 sites, bringing a low but stable catalytic activity (19.40 mmol g-1 h-1 ). While in ascorbic acid, the ascorbic acid ions show less complex ability with Pt atoms, but can decrease the migration barrier of Ptads -S2 sites (67.18 down to 35.96 mmol g-1 h-1 , 52.03% drop after 6 h). Therefore, the Ptads -S2 sites gradually aggregate into nanoclusters, bringing a high but decayed catalytic activity.

In appreciating these capacity-dependent deaths, this paper reports on the clinically-led development of a stochastic discrete event simulation model designed to capture the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. With application to a large public hospital in England during an early stage of the pandemic, the purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity. Based on information available at the time, results suggest that total capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced by 75% through a combination of increasing capacity from 45 to 100 beds, reducing length of stay by 25%, and flattening the peak demand to 26 admissions per day. Accounting for the additional capacity-independent deaths, which occur even when appropriate care is available within the intensive care setting, yields an aggregate reduction in total deaths of 30%.

It has been proposed that lockdown conditions disproportionately impact those living with chronic pain, requiring adaptation to treatment and care strategies. We investigated how lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom impacted individuals with chronic pain (N=431) relative to a healthy control group (N=88) using an online survey. In accordance with the fear-avoidance model, we hypothesised increases in perceived pain and psychological distress that would be mediated by pain catastrophizing. Survey questions answered during the lockdown period, probing patients self-perceived changes retrospectively, revealed that people with chronic pain perceived increases in their pain severity compared to before lockdown. They were also more adversely affected by lockdown compared to pain-free individuals, demonstrating greater increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased loneliness and reduced levels of physical exercise. Pain catastrophizing was found to be an important factor in predicting the extent of self-perceived increases in pain, and accounted for the relationship between decreased mood and pain. Perceived decreases in levels of physical exercise also independently predicted perceptions of increased pain. Interestingly, actual changes in pain symptoms (measured at two time points at pre- and post-lockdown in a subgroup, N = 85) did not change significantly on average, but those reporting increases also demonstrated greater baseline levels of pain catastrophizing. Overall, the findings suggest that remote pain management provision to target reduction of catastrophizing and increases to physical activity could be beneficial for chronic pain patients in overcoming the adverse effects of lockdown.","output":"Adverse effects of COVID-19 related lockdown on pain, physical activity and psychological wellbeing in people with chronic pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to investigate whether macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) predicts the prognosis of COVID-19 disease.

RESULTS: Forty seven patients in ICU, and 40 patients in ward were included. With respect to MIF levels and biochemical biomarkers, there was a statistically significant difference between the ICU and ward patients (p< 0.024).

METHODS: This is a prospective comparative study. Enrolled subjects were independently assessed by both tele-ophthalmology and face-to-face assessment. Agreement level between the two modalities for diagnosis and severity were compared using kappa statistic. Diagnostic accuracy of tele-ophthalmology was determined using the face-to-face consultation serving as the gold standard. Costs were compared by calculating the downstream costs generated by each modality in terms of investigations and treatment. RESULTS: A total of 860 eyes of 430 patients were assessed during the study period. Tele-ophthalmology consultations had significantly high agreement with face-to-face consultations in the diagnosis and grading of all three ocular conditions; cataracts, glaucoma, and AMD. Diagnosis and grading of cataracts and AMD reached [Formula: see text] values of > 0.8, while diagnosis and grading of glaucoma reached [Formula: see text] values between 0.61 and 0.8. In terms of diagnostic accuracy, tele-ophthalmology consultations were highly sensitive and specific for AMD with greater than 99% sensitivity and specificity achieved by tele-ophthalmology. There was high specificity when diagnosing cataracts, but lower sensitivity at 87.8%. Conversely, there was high sensitivity for diagnosing glaucoma, but lower specificity at 76.5%.

However, there is limited research in adult patients and to investigate how VR can be sustainably implemented in health care organizations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and acceptability of using VR for adult patients undergoing chemotherapy, and to identify the factors that would enable the sustained use of VR during chemotherapy in health care organizations. METHODS: Patients undergoing chemotherapy were recruited to participate in a VR intervention during chemotherapy infusion. Participants were observed during the session and completed a postintervention survey. Each participant was invited to participate in a semistructured interview about their experience. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients participated in the study, 5 of whom participated in semistructured interviews. Findings indicated that the use of VR was acceptable for patients undergoing chemotherapy and the intervention was also feasible. Some participants felt that the VR was an effective distraction during chemotherapy infusion, although most still seemed to be aware of how long their treatment was taking. Although VR was acceptable and feasible to patients, interviews identified several barriers to sustained implementation, including access to a reliable app library and impact on staff workloads. CONCLUSIONS: VR was acceptable to patients with a diagnosis of cancer undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Patients found VR beneficial for breaking up the monotony of treatment, to provide an additional choice of activity in addition to other recreation, and in some instances as a distraction from the treatment itself. However, there are challenges to address if VR is to be implemented in practice for this patient group.","output":"Experiences of Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy With Virtual Reality: Mixed Methods Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has urged the development and implementation of guidelines and protocols on diagnosis, management, infection control strategies, and discharge planning. However, very little is currently known about neonatal COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Thus, many questions arise with regard to respiratory care after birth, necessary protection to health care workers (HCW) in the delivery room and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and safety of bag and mask ventilation, noninvasive respiratory support, deep suctioning, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Indeed, these questions have created tremendous confusion amongst neonatal HCW. In this manuscript, we comprehensively reviewed the current evidence regarding COVID-19 perinatal transmission, respiratory outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 and infants with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the evidence for using different respiratory support modalities and aerosol-generating procedures in this specific population. The results demonstrated that to date, neonatal COVID-19 infection is uncommon, generally acquired postnatally, and associated with favorable respiratory outcomes. The reason why infants display a milder spectrum of disease remains unclear. Nonetheless, the risk of severe or critical illness in young patients exists. Currently, the recommended respiratory approach for infants with suspected or confirmed infection is not evidence based but should include all routinely used types of support, with the addition of viral filters, proper personal protective equipment, and placement of infants in isolation rooms, ideally with negative pressure. As information is changing rapidly, clinicians should frequently watch out for updates on the subject.

We assessed prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors during the first wave of the pandemic among healthcare professionals in Spain. METHODS: All workers in 18 healthcare institutions (6 AACC) in Spain were invited to web-based surveys assessing individual characteristics, COVID-19 infection status and exposure, and mental health status (May 5 - September 7, 2020). We report: probable current mental disorders (Major Depressive Disorder-MDD- [PHQ-8&#8805;10], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD- [GAD-7&#8805;10], Panic attacks, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder -PTSD- [PCL-5&#8805;7]; and Substance Use Disorder -SUD-[CAGE-AID&#8805;2]. Severe disability assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale was used to identify probable \\"disabling\\" current mental disorders. RESULTS: 9,138 healthcare workers participated. Prevalence of screen-positive disorder: 28.1% MDD; 22.5% GAD, 24.0% Panic; 22.2% PTSD; and 6.2% SUD. Overall 45.7% presented any current and 14.5% any disabling current mental disorder. Workers with pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders had almost twice the prevalence than those without. Adjusting for all other variables, odds of any disabling mental disorder were: prior lifetime disorders (TUS: OR=5.74; 95%CI 2.53-13.03; Mood: OR=3.23; 95%CI:2.27-4.60; Anxiety: OR=3.03; 95%CI:2.53-3.62); age category 18-29 years (OR=1.36; 95%CI:1.02-1.82), caring \\"all of the time\\" for COVID-19 patients (OR=5.19; 95%CI: 3.61-7.46), female gender (OR=1.58; 95%CI: 1.27-1.96) and having being in quarantine or isolated (OR= 1.60; 95CI:1.31-1.95).

Methods: Forty-four children who were newly diagnosed with KD were selected as the KD group. They were divided into acute phase of KD and subacute phase of KD. They were also separated into groups with and without coronary artery disease (CAD) (CAD+ and CADC, respectively). Meanwhile, 44 children hospitalized with febrile disease and 44 healthy children were selected as a febrile control group and normal control group, whom were attended to at Children's Hospital of Soochow University at the same time. We detected the concentration of IFN- and PLT of peripheral blood serum for all three groups and analyzed the difference. Results: At acute and subacute phases of KD, both IFN- and PLT are higher than both the febrile control group and healthy control group, especially at subacute phase; the difference between groups was statistically significant, P < 0.05. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of IFN- and PLT at acute phase of KD were 0.81 and 0.72, respectively; the sensitivity and specificity were 97.22 and 63.64%, and 57.89 and 73.86%, respectively. The AUCs of combined IFN- and PLT were 0.81 at acute phase and 0.96 at subacute phase of KD, with sensitivity and specificity of 97.22 and 55.26%, and 86.36 and 100%, respectively. The cutoff value of combined IFN- and PLT detection was IFN- = 3.51 pg/ml and PLT = 303  10(9)/L at acute phase of KD, IFN- = 4.21 pg/ml and PLT = 368  10(9)/L at subacute phase from plot vs. criterion values.

Methods to correct these batch effects are error-prone, as previous findings have shown. RESULTS Here, we demonstrate how using the R function ComBat to correct simulated Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450 K) and Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Kit (EPIC) DNAm data can lead to a large number of false positive results under certain conditions. We further provide a detailed assessment of the consequences for the highly relevant problem of p-value inflation with subsequent false positive findings after application of the frequently used ComBat method. Using ComBat to correct for batch effects in randomly generated samples produced alarming numbers of false discovery rate (FDR) and Bonferroni-corrected (BF) false positive results in unbalanced as well as in balanced sample distributions in terms of the relation between the outcome of interest variable and the technical position of the sample during the probe measurement. Both sample size and number of batch factors (e.g. number of chips) were systematically simulated to assess the probability of false positive findings. The effect of sample size was simulated using n = 48 up to n = 768 randomly generated samples. Increasing the number of corrected factors led to an exponential increase in the number of false positive signals. Increasing the number of samples reduced, but did not completely prevent, this effect. CONCLUSIONS Using the approach described, we demonstrate, that using ComBat for batch correction in DNAm data can lead to false positive results under certain conditions and sample distributions. Our results are thus contrary to previous publications, considering a balanced sample distribution as unproblematic when using ComBat. We do not claim completeness in terms of reporting all technical conditions and possible solutions of the occurring problems as we approach the problem from a clinician's perspective and not from that of a computer scientist. With our approach of simulating data, we provide readers with a simple method to assess the probability of false positive findings in DNAm microarray data analysis pipelines.","output":"Simulating ComBat: how batch correction can lead to the systematic introduction of false positive results in DNA methylation microarray studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 has imposed a series of unique challenges on the food retail and food service sectors in Canada.

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for immediate and greater understanding of the immune evasion mechanisms used by CoVs. Interferon (IFN)-is the body's natural antiviral agent, but its Janus kinase/signal transducer and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway is often antagonized by viruses, thereby preventing the upregulation of essential IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). Therapeutic IFN-has disappointingly weak clinical responses in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 infected patients, indicating that these CoVs inhibit the IFN-JAK/STAT pathway. Here we show that in lung alveolar A549 epithelial cells expression of MERS-CoV-nsp2 and SARS-CoV-1-nsp14, but not MERS-CoV-nsp5, increased basal levels of total and phosphorylated STAT1 & STAT2 protein, but reduced IFN--mediated phosphorylation of STAT1-3 and induction of MxA. While MERS-CoV-nsp2 and SARS-CoV-1-nsp14 similarly increased basal levels of STAT1 and STAT2 in bronchial BEAS-2B epithelial cells, unlike in A549 cells, they did not enhance basal pSTAT1 nor pSTAT2. However, both viral proteins reduced IFN--mediated induction of pSTAT1-3 and ISGs (MxA, ISG15 and PKR) in BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, even though IFN--mediated induction of pSTAT1-3 was not affected by MERS-CoV-nsp5 expression in BEAS-2B cells, downstream ISG induction was reduced, revealing that MERS-CoV-nsp5 may use an alternative mechanism to reduce antiviral ISG induction in this cell line. Indeed, we subsequently discovered that all three viral proteins inhibited STAT1 nuclear translocation in BEAS-2B cells, unveiling another layer of inhibition by which these viral proteins suppress responses to Type 1 IFNs. While these observations highlight cell line-specific differences in the immune evasion effects of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 proteins, they also demonstrate the broad spectrum of immune evasion strategies these deadly coronaviruses use to stunt antiviral responses to Type IFN.","output":"Inhibition of the IFN-JAK/STAT Pathway by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 Proteins in Human Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been recommended as a suitable choice for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure before mechanical ventilation (MV); however, delaying MV with HFNC therapy is still a dilemma between the technique and clinical management during the ongoing pandemic. Methods: Retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients treated with HFNC therapy from four hospitals of Wuhan, China.

Results: Among the training cohort, the median duration of HFNC therapy was 6 (range, 3C11), and 147 experienced HFNC failure within 7 days of HFNC initiation. Early predictors of HFNC failure on the basis of a multivariate regression analysis included age older than 60 years [odds ratio (OR), 1.93; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08C3.44; p = 0.027; 2 points], respiratory rate-oxygenation index (ROX) <5.31 (OR, 5.22; 95% CI, 2.96C9.20; p < 0.001; 5 points) within the first 4 h of HFNC initiation, platelets < 125  10(9)/L (OR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.46C6.35; p = 0.003; 3 points), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) >7.0 pg/mL (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.79C6.23; p < 0.001; 3 points) at HFNC initiation. A weighted risk-stratification model of these predictors showed sensitivity of 80.3%, specificity of 71.2% and a better predictive ability than ROX index alone [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.807 vs. 0.779, p < 0.001].

The difference between the two PACC scores was calculated and used in multiple linear regression to assess which variables were associated with a difference in PACC scores. FINDINGS: Of the 43 participants who were invited to this external study, 28 were re-assessed. The median duration in days between the in-person and the remote assessments was 236.5 days (7.9 months) (IQR 62.5). There was a strong positive correlation between the two assessments for the PACC score, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 082 (95% CI 066, 098). The multiple linear regression found that the only predictor of the PACC difference was the time between assessments. INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence on the feasibility of performing cognitive tests online, with the PACC tests being successfully administered through videoconferencing. This is relevant, especially during times when face-to-face assessments cannot be performed.","output":"Feasibility study of assessing the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) score via videoconferencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regardless of the anatomic site of malignant bowel obstruction leading to the need for palliative intervention, decisions must consider the natural history of the disease, the availability and success of nonsurgical treatments, the individual patient's symptom severity, goals, preferences, quality, and expectancy of life.

The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication. METHODS: Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI. RESULTS: The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (p = 0.0002), higher FiO(2) (p = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (p = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (p = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 mol/L versus 112 mol/L, p = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, p = 0.04]).

Methods An online survey was conducted among 5,175 Chinese adolescents from June 9th to 29th in 2020 to investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI) during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. A gender-specific stepwise logistic regression model was used. All analyses were performed with STATA 15.0. Results About 3% of the participants had reported having SI during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period. The prevalence of female SI (3.64%, 95% CI: 2.97C4.45%) was higher than that of males (2.39%, 95% CI: 1.88C3.05%) (2 = 6.87, p = 0.009).

Re-deployment of personnel and cessation of elective services are commonplace. However, there is a continued need for both emergency and oncological surgery. A national review of practice was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, to assess impact on services, staffing and training. METHODS: Key aspects of current plastic surgery practice in the United Kingdom were examined in this cross-sectional study; operating capacity, location of theatre lists (national health service or outsourced private institutions (PIs)), differences across sub-specialties, change in anaesthesia practices, staffing, re-deployment, on-call provision and impact on training. RESULTS: Three-hundred and forty-four plastic surgeons in the United Kingdom provided practice data across 51 units. Theatre capacity and outpatient services were markedly reduced. Outsourcing of operating lists to PIs was widely utilised. Increased use of local anaesthetic hand procedures, the prioritisation of shorter operations with reduced microsurgery in both head and neck/lower limb and almost complete cessation of breast reconstruction were noted, together with marked regional variations. Re-deployment occurred at all staffing levels, whilst telemedicine played a critical role in both patient management and training. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has enforced unprecedented changes to surgical care delivery and training, as identified by examination of plastic surgery nationally in the United Kingdom. Novel means to support continued elective and emergency services, including oncology have been identified.

Our previous research showed that PPV can activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) signaling pathway and then up-regulate the expression of interleukin (IL)-6. OBJECTIVES: Herein, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the non-structural protein NS1 of PPV also has the same function. METHODS: Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot, immunofluorescence assay and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that PPV NS1 protein can up-regulate the expression levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, PPV NS1 protein was found to induce the phosphorylation of IB, then leading to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-B. In addition, the NS1 protein activated the upstream pathways of NF-B. Meanwhile, TLR2-siRNA assay showed TLR2 plays an important role in the activation of NF-B signaling pathway induced by PPV-NS1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that PPV NS1 protein induced the up-regulated of IL-6 expression through activating the TLR2 and NF-B signaling pathways.

Secondary objective of the study is to examine the association between LUS score and disease severity. Finally, we describe the local epidemiology of paediatric CAP during the study period in the era of COVID-19 by comparing it with the previous 2 years. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective single-centre study carried out on patients aged 18 or younger and over the month of age admitted to the Paediatric Unit of our Foundation for suspected community-acquired pneumonia or SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia during the third pandemic wave of COVID-19. Quantitative variables were elaborated with ShapiroCWilks test or median and interquartile range (IQR). Student's t-test was used for independent data. Association between quantitative data was evaluated with Pearson correlation. ROC curve analysis was used to calculate best cut-off of LUS score in paediatric patients. Area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensibility, and specificity are also reported with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of the LUS score in pneumonia, the area underlying the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.27C1) thus showing a discrete discriminatory power, with a sensitivity of 89.66% and specificity 50% setting a LUS score greater than or equal to 1 as the best cut-off. Nine patients required oxygen support and a significant statistical correlation (p = 0.0033) emerged between LUS score and oxygen therapy.

However, the use of masks often causes soaring temperatures and thick humid air, leading to thermal and wear discomfort and breathing difficulties for a number of people, and further increasing the elevated risk of heat illnesses including heat stroke and heat exhaustion. When wearers become highly active or work under high tension, the excess sweat generated negatively affects the functionality of masks. Here, we report on an innovative design of an air-conditioned mask (AC Mask) system, facilitating thermoregulation in the mask microclimate, ease of breathing, and wear comfort. The AC Mask system is developed by integrating a cost-effective and lightweight thermoelectric (TE) and ventilation unit in a wearable 3D printed mask device, compatible with existing disposable masks, to protect end users safely against toxic particles such as viruses. A wind-guided tunnel has been developed for quick and efficient ventilation of cooling air. Based on a human trial, reductions in the apparent microclimate temperature and the humidity by 3.5 C and 50%, respectively, have been achieved under a low voltage. With the excellent thermal management properties, the AC Mask will find also wide application among professional end-users such as construction workers, firefighters, and medical personnel.","output":"Development of wearable air-conditioned mask for personal thermal management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses to the Spike (S) protein monomer, S protein native trimeric form or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were evaluated in cohorts of individuals with acute infection (n=93) and in individuals enrolled in a post-infection seroprevalence population study (n=578) in Switzerland. Commercial assays specific for the S1 monomer, for the N protein and a newly developed Luminex assay using the S protein trimer were found to be equally sensitive in antibody detection in the acute infection phase samples. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection cohort. Seroprevalence in a 'positive patient contacts' group (n=177) was underestimated by N protein assays by 10.9 to 32.2% and the 'random selected' general population group (n=311) was reduced up to 45% reduction relative to S protein assays. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was significantly more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.IMPORTANCE In the present study, we have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in sera of acute and post-infection phase subjects. Our results indicate that antibody responses against viral S and N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute phase of infection but that responses against N appear to wane in the post-infection phase while those against S protein persist over time. The most sensitive serological assay in both acute and post-infection phases used the native S protein trimer as binding antigen that has significantly greater conformational epitopes for antibody binding compared to the S1 monomer protein used in other assays. We believe that these results are extremely important in order to generate correct estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population. Furthermore, the assessment of antibody responses against the trimeric S protein will be critical to evaluate the durability of the antibody response and for the characterization of a vaccine-induced antibody response.","output":"Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike versus Nucleoprotein Antibody Responses Impact the Estimates of Infections in Population-Based Seroprevalence Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Despite historical exclusion, there has been recent recognition of the need to address the health of pregnant women in research on vaccines against emerging pathogens. However, pregnant womens views and decision-making processes about vaccine research participation during infectious disease outbreaks remain underexplored. This study aims to examine womens decision-making processes around vaccine research participation during infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: We conducted qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews with pregnant and recently pregnant women (n = 13), eliciting their views on four hypothetical Zika Virus vaccine research scenarios and probing their decision-making processes around participation. After recorded interviews were transcribed, thematic analysis was conducted based on a priori and emergent themes. RESULTS: Most women interviewed were accepting of vaccine research scenarios. Three broad themesevidence, risk, and trustcharacterized womens decision-making processes. Women varied in how different types and levels of evidence impacted their considerations, which risks were most salient to their decision-making processes, and from whom they trusted recommendations about vaccine research participation. Exemplary quotes from each theme are presented, and lessons for vaccine development during the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks are discussed.

Interlocking between individual units is enabled by providing grooves, male and female joint on them. Hence less mortar is required for construction of masonry units while using these interlocking bricks. Various trails and tests will be conducted on these interlocking bricks by addition of various materials such as E-wastes, coir pith and saw dust in clay soil. Hence the cost of these masonry units will be reduced. All these various mixtures are mixed at different proportions and ideal mixture are to be found then the grooves are to be altered by male and female joints. Further in addition of clay and sand, wooden powder and coir pith are to be added so that while burning of these masonry units results in good colour and more strength (35% improved strength while comparing to an A-Class brick). Optimum ratio with minimal cost and max efficiency with sustainability to the environment is recommended to the market. In the past year there was a spread of pandemic COVID 19. Precautious measures are taken to avoid the spread of this pandemic. By considering this situation a chemical is to be added in this masonry unit which will be acting as an disinfectious agent which will avoid the entry of various common viruses and bacteria like rhino viruses, salmonella. This ability of the masonry unit will last more than 24 months and beyond. And this can also be replenished after specific period of time.

Kinsenoside (Kin) serves as an active small-molecule component derived from traditional medicinal herb displaying multiple pharmacological actions in cancers, hyperglycemia, and liver disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Kin on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ALI and further explore possible molecular mechanisms. Kin was administered orally (100 mg/kg/day) for 7 consecutive days before LPS instillation (5 mg/kg). After 12 hours, pathological injury, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress were detected. The results demonstrated that Kin significantly alleviated lung pathological injury and decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), apart from inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Meanwhile, Kin also promoted mitochondrial fusion and restrained mitochondrial fission in mice with ALI. In terms of mechanism, Kin pretreatment increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the protein level of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). In Ampk- knockout mice challenged with LPS, Kin lost its pulmonary protective effects, accompanied by lower NRF2 level. In vitro experiments further unveiled that either AMPK inhibition by Compound C or NRF2 knockdown by siRNA abolished the protective roles of Kin in LPS-treated A549 lung epithelial cells. And NRF2 activator TAT-14 could reverse the effects of Ampk- deficiency. In conclusion, Kin possesses the ability to prevent LPS-induced ALI by modulating mitochondrial dynamic equilibrium in lung epithelial cell in an AMPK/NRF2-dependent manner.","output":"The Activation of AMPK/NRF2 Pathway in Lung Epithelial Cells Is Involved in the Protective Effects of Kinsenoside on Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Total hip (THR) and total knee replacements (TKR) are two highly successful orthopaedic procedures that reduce pain for people with osteoarthritis. Previous evidence suggests that physical activity, at best, remains the same pre- to post-operatively, and in some instances declines. The PEP-TALK trial evaluates the effects of a group-based, behaviour change intervention on physical activity following a THR or TKR. METHODS: PEP-TALK is an open, phase III, pragmatic, multi-centre, parallel, two-arm, two-way superiority randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of usual care plus a behaviour change therapy compared with usual care alone following primary THR or TKR. The primary outcome is the UCLA Activity Score at 12 months post-randomisation which will be analysed using a linear mixed effects model. Secondary outcomes measured at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation include the UCLA Activity Score, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, Oxford Hip/Knee Score, Numerical Rating Scale for Pain, Generalised Self-Efficacy Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L index and EQ-VAS and complications or adverse events.

At present, these programs are poorly integrated into existing health information technology infrastructure and clinical workflows, resulting in barriers to provider-level knowledge of, interaction with, and support of patients who use dDPPs. Tools that can facilitate patient-provider interaction around dDPPs may contribute to improved patient engagement and adherence to these programs and improved health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use a rigorous, user-centered design (UCD) methodology to develop a theory-driven system that supports patient engagement with dDPPs and their primary care providers with their care. METHODS: This study will be conducted in 3 phases. In phase 1, we will use systematic UCD, Agile software development, and qualitative research methods to identify key user (patients, providers, clinical staff, digital health technologists, and content experts) requirements, constraints, and prioritization of high-impact features to design, develop, and refine a viable intervention prototype for the engagement system. In phase 2, we will conduct a single-arm feasibility pilot of the engagement system among patients with prediabetes and their primary care providers. In phase 3, we will conduct a 2-arm randomized controlled trial using the engagement system. Primary outcomes will be weight, BMI, and A(1c) at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes will be patient engagement (use and activity) in the dDPP. The mediator variables (self-efficacy, digital health literacy, and patient-provider relationship) will be measured. RESULTS: The project was initiated in 2018 and funded in September 2019. Enrollment and data collection for phase 1 began in September 2019 under an Institutional Review Board quality improvement waiver granted in July 2019. As of December 2020, 27 patients have been enrolled and first results are expected to be submitted for publication in early 2021. The study received Institutional Review Board approval for phases 2 and 3 in December 2020, and phase 2 enrollment is expected to begin in early 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will provide guidance for the design and development of technology to integrate dDPP platforms into existing clinical workflows. This will facilitate patient engagement in digital behavior change interventions and provider engagement in patients use of dDPPs. Integrated clinical tools that can facilitate patient-provider interaction around dDPPs may contribute to improved patient adherence to these programs and improved health outcomes by addressing barriers faced by both patients and providers.

The second method involves the formation of ratio spectra and taking the absorption difference at two selected wavelengths of peak and trough of a spectrum. In the ratio first derivative method peak amplitudes were measured at 235.2 nm and 259.1 nm for simultaneous quantification of REM and TEN respectively. The fourth method was based on the measurement of the peak amplitude of zero-order spectra of analytes generated from the mixture spectrum by subtraction of a constant from the ratio spectrum followed by multiplication with divisor spectrum, Further, the proposed methods were validated systematically to confirm the linearity, precession, accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity.

The baseline survey was completed in late 2020. Difference in differences analysis and analysis of project exposure variables will be used to determine impact. Due to COVID-19, all interviews were carried out using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). RESULTS: We interviewed 2,091 women with children under two years of age, with phone numbers obtained from health facilities in survey areas. The response rate (11.6% completed interviews) was similar or higher than typical phone surveys. Interviews included complex questions related to 11 nutrition practices, including women's and children's dietary recall. Average interview length was 31 minutes. 4% of respondents dropped before completing the call. Advantages of phone interviews included reduced travel costs, improved quality control, and real-time data review. Disadvantages included high non-response, inability to observe items such as handwashing stations, and potential biases related to phone ownership.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been observed to have a greater mortality impact on subgroups of people in the population who are deemed to be at higher medical disease risk. Individuals with cardiovascular disorders are one such COVID-19-associated high-mortality risk group. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence is accumulating that COVID-19 infection may worsen an individual's future cardiovascular health, and, preinfection/postinfection cardiovascular evaluation may be warranted to determine if progressive cardiovascular damage has occurred because of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, focusing on the association between COVID-19 severity and cardiac-specific biomarkers, including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin T (TnT)/troponin I (TnI), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase, and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB). TnT had the highest odds ratio or OR (11.83) indicating the greatest association with COVID-19 severity, followed by NT-proBNP (7.57), TnI (6.32), LDH (4.79), D-dimer (4.10), creatine kinase (3.43), and CK-MB (3.35). All of the biomarkers studied were significantly correlated with COVID-19 severity including severe symptoms, ICU care, and mortality (Pa??<a??0.0001, except Pa??<a??0.01 for CK-MB).

Although interventions exist to address mental health issues following exposure to disasters, emergencies, and humanitarian crises, considerably less is known about web-based unguided interventions to help mitigate the negative impacts of such events. Additionally, in contexts in which emergencies reduce access to in-person care, remote forms of support are critical, yet there are limited studies on the use of such interventions. Evidence-based, easy-to-use, scalable interventions are direly needed for this population. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of an unguided electronic mental health program, COVID-19 Anxiety and Stress Resilience Training (COAST), tailored to first responders and health care personnel, based on scientific evidence and empirically based techniques. METHODS: We developed COVID-19-specific training modules focusing on several domains that are previously reported as key to resilience and stress recovery: self-efficacy, mindfulness, sleep quality, and positive thinking. The program was made available to 702 first responders between May and August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic, work-, and COVID-19-related information was collected, and psychometric questionnaires were completed. We examined user acceptance and user activity, including module choice and participant feedback. RESULTS: In total, 52 of 702 (7%) first responders to whom we reached out used the program at least once. COAST use was independent of age, sex, or baseline levels of self-efficacy, mindful awareness, sleep quality, and positive thinking (for all, P>.39). First responders who had tested positive and those who had been quarantined were more likely to engage in the program. A click count analysis per module showed that participants used the self-efficacy and mindfulness modules most often, with 382 and 122 clicks, respectively, over 15 weeks. Overall, first responders expressed satisfaction with the program. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement of first responders in the multimodule web-based COAST program was feasible and the first responder cohort expressed overall satisfaction with the program. Those in more difficult circumstances, including those in quarantine and those who tested positive, may be more likely to engage in such programs. Further controlled studies could pave the way for efficacy studies and the development of additional modules, including just-in-time interventions or blended interventions combining individual use of an unguided self-help intervention, such as COAST, with subsequent individual psychotherapy for those who continue to experience stress and psychological symptoms.","output":"Multimodule Web-Based COVID-19 Anxiety and Stress Resilience Training (COAST): Single-Cohort Feasibility Study With First Responders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The invariance of the Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale (PCIBS) was evaluated in 12 Latin American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay). A total of 5183 people from the aforementioned countries participated, selected using the snowball sampling method. Measurement invariance was assessed by multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA) and Multi-Group Factor Analysis Alignment (CFA-MIAL). In addition, item characteristics were assessed based on Item Response Theory. The results indicate that the original five-item version of the PCIBS is not adequate; whereas a four-item version of the PCIBS (PCIBS-4) showed a good fit in all countries. Thus, using the MG-CFA method, the PCIBS-4 achieved metric invariance, while the CFA-MIAL method indicated that the PCIBS-4 shows metric and scalar invariance. Likewise, the four items present increasing difficulties and high values in the discrimination parameters. The comparison of means of the PCIBS-4 reported irrelevant differences between countries; however, Mexico and Peru presented the highest frequency of preventive behaviors related to COVID-19. It is concluded that the PCIBS-4 is a unidimensional self-report measure which is reliable and invariant across the twelve participating Latin American countries. It is expected that the findings will be of interest to social and health scientists, as well as those professionals directly involved in public health decision making.","output":"Cross-Cultural Validation of a New Version in Spanish of Four Items of the Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale (PCIBS) in Twelve Latin American Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This is the first phylodynamic study attempted on SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India to infer the current state of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evolution using phylogenetic network and growth trends Materials & Methods: Out of 286 retrieved whole genomes from India, 138 haplotypes were used to build a phylogenetic network The birth-death serial model (BDSIR) package of BEAST2 was used to calculate the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 Population dynamics were investigated using the stamp date method as implemented in BEAST2 and BEAST 1 10 4 Results: A median-joining network revealed two ancestral clusters A high basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was found An exponential rise in the effective population size of Indian isolates was detected Conclusion: The phylogenetic network reveals dual ancestry and possibility of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in India","output":"Phylogenomics and phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 genomes retrieved from India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We construct an SIR-type compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 which incorporates as a parameter the susceptible individuals' cautiousness level, and utilises nonlinear incidence and recovery rates.

METHODS: This article describes the results of an 8-week, 75-min per week, Climate Change and Human Health ECHO (CCHH ECHO) synchronous telementoring course for post-licensure health professionals. The primary goals were: to increase knowledge, self-efficacy, and communication skills. Participants were eligible to receive up to 10 h of no-cost continuing education credits and a certificate for completing the program. RESULTS: The 8-week course included 625 unique participants from 25 countries. An interprofessional group of clinicians, health professionals, and educators included: 130/28% PhD, 92/20% MD/DO, 52/12% RN/NP/PA, 50/11% MPH. The prospective survey demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge, confidence, attitudes (P < .001) and communication skills (P = .029) at 3 months post course.

METHODS Among the 476 patients in LEVANT 2, 126 patients (mean age 67.19.6 years; 79 men) were enrolled at the 8 participating German sites between August 2011 and July 2012 and were randomized 2:1 to treatment with the Lutonix DCB (n=83) vs an uncoated balloon during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA, n=43). All patients had intermittent claudication or rest pain (Rutherford categories 2-4). Average lesion length was 58 mm and average treated length was 100 mm. Severe calcification was present in 11% of lesions, and 23% were total occlusions. The efficacy outcome was primary patency at 12 months, and the safety outcome was 12-month freedom from a composite of perioperative death, index limb-related death, amputation (below or above the ankle), and index limb revascularization. Secondary endpoints included target lesion revascularization (TLR), major adverse events, and functional outcomes. RESULTS Demographic, clinical, and lesion characteristics were matched between Lutonix DCB and PTA groups, as were the final percent diameter stenosis (19%) and procedure success (91%). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 12-month primary patency rate was 80% vs 58% (p=0.015) and the composite safety endpoint rate was 94% vs 72% (p=0.001), respectively. Freedom from TLR was higher for DCBs (96%) vs PTA (82%, p=0.012). Major adverse events were similar for both groups. The benefit favoring DCB over PTA was observed in German men and women. Compared to the non-German LEVANT 2 cohort, there was a shorter time between insertion and inflation of treatment balloons (21.8 vs 39.5 seconds, p<0.001) in the German cohort. Balloons were inflated to higher pressures (9.0 vs 7.7 atm, p<0.001) but for a shorter period of time (130 vs 167 seconds, p<0.001), and although treated lesions in the German cohort had a higher baseline stenosis, final postprocedure diameter stenosis was lower (19% vs 22%, p=0.04) than in the non-German patients. CONCLUSION Superiority of DCB over PTA in the German cohort of LEVANT 2 was demonstrated for primary patency, composite safety, and freedom from TLR. The benefit of DCB was also consistent for both genders. Geographic or regional differences in procedural variables may account for the different outcomes between the German and non-German cohorts.","output":"German Center Subanalysis of the LEVANT 2 Global Randomized Study of the Lutonix Drug-Coated Balloon in the Treatment of Femoropopliteal Occlusive Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Learning online from home bubbles through the use of information communication technology (ICT) stretches the engagement and enactment of v (relational connections) between students and lecturers as well as Pacific people in the community.

Methods: We extracted relative search volumes from Google Trends? (January 2015 to May 2020) for keywords related to the 4 procedure categories of male infertility, erectile dysfunction, Peyronie's disease and vasectomy. The most popular keywords in each category were used to assess immediate (30 days preceding and following official recommendation from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on March 18, 2020) and long-term (January 1, 2015 to March 18, 2020 vs March 19, 2020 to May 21, 2020) shifts in public interest. Lastly, we assessed geographical variations in public interest during the phase I reopening period from April 24 to May 31, 2020. Results: There was an immediate reduction in interest across all 4 categories following the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommendation. Long-term post-announcement relative search volume was lower than pre-announcement relative search volume in all categories as well, namely male infertility (54.33% vs 68.74%, p?0.02), erectile dysfunction (45.00% vs 76.74%, p &lt;0.0001), Peyronie's disease (48.33% vs 77.95%, p &lt;0.0001) and vasectomy (51.33% vs 66.73%, p?0.0005).

The types of rapid learning envisioned to address Covid-19 and future public health crises require a systems approach that enables sharing of data and lessons learned at scale. Agreement on a systems approach augmented by technology and standards will be foundational to making such learning meaningful and to ensuring its scientific integrity. With this purpose in mind, a group of individuals from Spain, Italy, and the United States have formed a transatlantic collaboration, with the aim of generating a proposed comprehensive standards-based systems approach and data-driven framework for collection, management, and analysis of high-quality data. This framework will inform decisions in managing clinical responses and social measures to overcome the Covid-19 global pandemic and to prepare for future public health crises. We first argue that standardized data of the type now common in global regulated clinical research is the essential fuel that will power a global system for addressing (and preventing) current and future pandemics. We then present a blueprint for a system that will put these data to use in driving a range of key decisions. In the context of this system, we describe and categorize the specific types of data the system will require for different purposes and document the standards currently in use for each of these categories in the three nations participating in this work. In so doing, we anticipate some of the challenges to harmonizing these data but also suggest opportunities for further global standardization and harmonization. While we have scaled this transnational effort to three nations, we hope to stimulate an international dialogue with a culmination of realizing such a system.","output":"Addressing the Covid-19 pandemic and future public health challenges through global collaboration and a data-driven systems approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of infectious disease is an inherently stochastic process. As such, real time control and prediction methods present a significant challenge. For diseases which spread through direct human interaction, (e.g., transferred from infected to susceptible individuals) the contagion process can be modeled on a social-contact network where individuals are represented as nodes, and contacts between individuals are represented as links. The model presented in this paper seeks to identify the infection pattern which depicts the current state of an ongoing outbreak. This is accomplished by inferring the most likely paths of infection through a contact network under the assumption of partially available infection data. The problem is formulated as a bi-linear integer program, and heuristic solution methods are developed based on sub-problems which can be solved much more efficiently. The heuristic performance is presented for a range of randomly generated networks and different levels of information. The model results, which include the most likely set of infection spreading contacts, can be used to provide insight into future epidemic outbreak patterns, and aid in the development of intervention strategies.","output":"Inferring Contagion Patterns in Social Contact Networks with Limited Infection Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multicellular organisms are composed of tissues with diverse cell sizes.

It was a descriptive study using routinely collected importation data. We found the MAF imported pesticides for farming only during 2010, 2014 and 2021, in response to growing food insecurity and associated with Ebola and COVID-19 outbreaks.

The hazard class risk classification of imported pesticides decreased over time. Increasing amounts of imported fungicides could increase the risk of future fungal resistance among humans. We found that in responding to escalating food insecurity, the government dramatically increased the amount of pesticide importation to improve crop production.

The immune system poses the critical interactive chain between the human body and the virus. Here, we make efforts to examine whether comorbidity with type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects the immunological response in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective pilot study investigating immunological characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with or without comorbid T2D. Two subcohorts of sex- and age-matched participants were eligible for data analysis, of which 33 participants were with T2D and the remaining 37 were nondiabetic (NDM). Cellular immunity was assessed by flow cytometric determination of surface markers including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD16, and CD56 in peripheral blood. Levels of C reactive protein, immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE), and complements (C3, C4) were detected by rate nephelometry immunoassay. And Th1/Th2 cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, and IFN-) were detected by Cytometric Bead Array. RESULTS: Neutrophil counts were found to be significantly higher in the T2D group than in the NDM group and had a significant relevance with clinical severity. Lymphocyte frequencies showed no significant differences in the two groups. However, the proportions and absolute counts of T, Tc, Th, and NK cells decreased in both groups to different degrees. An abnormal increase in neutrophil count and a decrease in lymphocyte subpopulations may represent risk factors of COVID-19 severity. The level of IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and C4 showed no significant difference between the two groups, while the IgE levels were higher in the T2D group than in the NDM group (p < 0.05). Th1 cytokines including IFN-, TNF-, and IL-6, as well as CRP, appeared significantly higher in the T2D group.

However, anastomotic leakage and stricture are still important clinical problems after esophagogastric anastomosis, causing burdensome symptoms and poor quality of life. Herein, we describe a novel cervical end-to-side triangulating esophagogastric anastomoasis using linear stapler. METHODS A total of 90 patients (85 % male; mean age 63 years) with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent cervical end-to-side esophagogastric triangular anastomosis using a linear stapler after minimally invasive esophagectomy between November 2006 and April 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The median operation time was 602 min (range 424-936 min). The volume of blood loss during the entire operative procedure was 127 ml (range 0-700 ml). There were no cases of anastomotic leakage in this study, although four patients (4.4 %) developed dysphagia associated with benign anastomotic stricture formation. All patients with a benign anastomotic stricture underwent balloon dilation, which resulted in improvement in their symptoms.

The primary outcome was successful intubation on the first attempt without physiological instability (defined as an absolute decrease in the peripheral oxygen saturation of >20% from the preintubation baseline level or bradycardia with a heart rate of <100 beats per minute) in the infant. RESULTS: The primary intention-to-treat analysis included the outcomes of 251 intubations in 202 infants; 124 intubations were assigned to the high-flow group and 127 to the standard-care group. The infants had a median postmenstrual age of 27.9 weeks and a median weight of 920 g at the time of intubation. A successful intubation on the first attempt without physiological instability was achieved in 62 of 124 intubations (50.0%) in the high-flow group and in 40 of 127 intubations (31.5%) in the standard-care group (adjusted risk difference, 17.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0 to 29.2), for a number needed to treat of 6 (95% CI, 4 to 17) for 1 infant to benefit. Successful intubation on the first attempt regardless of physiological stability was accomplished in 68.5% of the intubations in the high-flow group and in 54.3% of the intubations in the standard-care group (adjusted risk difference, 15.8 percentage points; 95% CI, 4.3 to 27.3). CONCLUSIONS: Among infants undergoing endotracheal intubation at two Australian tertiary neonatal intensive care units, nasal high-flow therapy during the procedure improved the likelihood of successful intubation on the first attempt without physiological instability in the infant.

Clinical demographic, laboratory, and instrumental indexes and associated factors were studied with one-way and multivariate logistic regression analysis.Results This study included 402 patients aged 18 to 95 years (mean age, 62.914.6 years); 43.0a??% of them were older than 65 years. COVID-19 was frequently associated with chronic comorbidities, including arterial hypertension (74.4a??%), obesity (41.6a??%), history of ischemic heart disease (12.9a??%), atrial fibrillation (18.9a??%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (13.0a??%), and oncological diseases (9.2a??%). 13.0a??% of patients were smokers; less than 10% had chronic lung diseases. 3.9% of patients had a combination of COVID-19 and acute coronary pathology, including acute myocardial infarction (MI) in 3.2a??% (13) and unstable angina in 0.7a??% (3). The most frequent clinical manifestation of COVID-19 were four symptoms: cough (81.1a??%), weakness (80.3a??%), shortness of breath (71.6a??%), and fever (62.7a??%). 46.5% of patients had shortage of breath and chest pain/compression, 40.3% had headache, 31.1% had myalgia, 28.8% had anosmia, and 25.5% had ageusia. Arterial oxygen saturation was &lt;93.0a??% in 55.7a??% of cases. According to laboratory blood tests the patients had anemia (58.2a??%), lymphopenia (34.8a??%), neutropenia (19.2a??%), thrombocytopenia (11.9a??%), and increased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP, 87.3a??%), interleukin-6 (89.3a??%), ferritin (62.1a??%), and D-dimer (49.2a??%). 56.2% of patients required various regimens of oxygen support. 83 (20.6%) patients were admitted to intensive care and resuscitation units; invasive artificial ventilation was performed only for 34 (8.5a??%) patients. In-hospital mortality was 7.7a??% (31a??/a??402). One-way regression analysis identified major factors associated with death during the stay in the hospital: age &gt;55 years, NEWS scale score &gt;4.0, oxygen saturation &lt;92.0a??%, blood glucose &gt;5.4 mmol/l, hs-CRP &gt;25.7a??mg/l, and creatinine clearance &lt;72.0a??ml/min. Furthermore, the risk increased with increasing degree of changes in each factor. According to results of the multivariate regression analysis, three most significant predictors of the hard endpoint, all-cause death during the stay in the hospital, were more than 5-fold increases in aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase compared to normal levels (relative risk (RR) 16.8 at 95a??% confidence interval (CI) 5.0-56.3, ??&lt;0.001), pronounced changes in the lungs consistent with a CT-4 picture as shown by computed tomography (CT) (RR 13.4; 95a??% CI 3.9-45.5, ??&lt;0.001), and MI/unstable angina during the stay in the hospital (RR 11.3; 95a??% CI 1.4-90.6, ??=0.023).

Staple-line buttressing is largely adopted as an acceptable reinforcement but data regarding leaks have been equivocal. This study compared staple-line leaks in five reinforcement options during LSG: no reinforcement (NO-SLR), oversewing (suture), nonabsorbable bovine pericardial strips (BPS), tissue sealant or fibrin glue (Seal), or absorbable polymer membrane (APM). METHODS This systematic review study of articles published between 2012 and 2016 regarding LSG leak rates aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Variables of interest included leak rates, bleeding, and complications in addition to surgical and population parameters. An independent Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of patients with and without leaks for the different reinforcement options. RESULTS Of the 1633 articles identified, 148 met inclusion criteria and represented 40,653 patients. Differences in age (older in APM; p = 0.001), starting body mass index (lower in Suture; p = 0.008), and distance from pylorus (closer in BPS; p = 0.04) were observed between groups, but mean bougie size was equivalent. The overall leak rate of 1.5% (607 leaks) ranged from 0.7% for APM (significantly lower than all groups; p  0.007 for next lowest leak rate) to 2.7% (BPS).

METHODS From September 2009 to October 2014, data from 377 patients who had intended SILS sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis at our institution were collected in a prospective database. The patients were categorized in the following subgroups: group 1 (normal weight, body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m(2)), group 2 (overweight, BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)), group 3 (obesity, BMI 30-34.9 kg/m(2)), and group 4 (morbid obesity, BMI > 35 kg/m(2)).

In the United States, the prevalence of DM in ages 65 years is twofold higher than the national average for adult populations. Telemedicine and community health workers (CHWs) are emerging diabetes care models but their impact on older adults with limited resources are relatively neglected within the medical literature. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this systematic review was to explore the impact of telemedicine and CHW interventions for improving A1C levels and self-management behaviors among underserved older adults with DM. DATA SOURCES A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane databases using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses as a reporting guideline. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes self-management education (DSME) administered through telemedicine and CHW interventions were effective for improving A1C levels, self-care adherence, and patient and provider satisfaction among adults aged 50 years. Common barriers to diabetes care include inadequate resources, lack of transportation, inconsistent means of communications, social isolation, and low motivation. Community health workers and telemedicine were effective in improving disease management and optimizing care coordination within the vulnerable adult populations. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Well-coordinated, evidence-based, and population-centered interventions can overcome the unique disparities experienced by underserved older adults with diabetes. Incorporating DSME-guided telemedicine and CHW interventions into primary care can mitigate diabetes-related complications in older populations. The lack of evidence specific to adults aged 65 years calls for a universally accepted age range when referring to older adults in future research.","output":"Diabetes management among underserved older adults through telemedicine and community health workers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At Montefiore Medical Center in The Bronx, NY, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was admitted on March 11, 2020.

Although the PD program was successful in its ability to provide much-needed kidney replacement therapy when hemodialysis was not available, challenges to delivering adequate PD dosage included difficulties providing nurse training and availability of supplies. Providing adequate clearance and ultrafiltration for patients in intensive care units was especially difficult due to the high prevalence of a hypercatabolic state, volume overload, and prone positioning.

Previously, we characterized two intrinsic transglutaminase substrates with inactivating activities against subtilisin and dispase. This report now describes a novel substrate that inhibits papain, bromelain, and trypsin. Papain was the most sensitive protease; thus, the protein was designated Streptomyces papain inhibitor (SPI). To avoid transglutaminase-mediated glutamine deamidation during culture, SPI was produced by Streptomyces mobaraensis at various growth temperatures. The best results were achieved by culturing for 30-50 h at 42 degrees C, which yielded high SPI concentrations and negligibly small amounts of mature transglutaminase. Transglutaminasespecific biotinylation displayed largely unmodified glutamine and lysine residues. In contrast, purified SPI from the 28 degrees C culture lost the potential to be cross-linked, but exhibited higher inhibitory activity as indicated by a significantly lower Ki (60 nM vs. 140 nM). Despite similarities in molecular mass (12 kDa) and high thermostability, SPI exhibits clear differences in comparison with all members of the wellknown family of Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitors. The neutral protein (pI of 7.3) shares sequence homology with a putative protein from Streptomyces lavendulae, whose conformation is most likely stabilized by two disulfide bridges. However, cysteine residues are not localized in the typical regions of subtilisin inhibitors. SPI and the formerly characterized dispase-inactivating substrate are unique proteins of distinct Streptomycetes such as Streptomyces mobaraensis. Along with the subtilisin inhibitory protein, they could play a crucial role in the defense of vulnerable protein layers that are solidified by transglutaminase.","output":"A novel transglutaminase substrate from Streptomyces mobaraensis inhibiting papain-like cysteine proteases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) is described as pleural effusion secondary to liver cirrhosis after ruling out other etiologies. We aim to assess the efficacy of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) placement in refractory HH in this systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive search of literature was performed from inception to December 2020. The authors reviewed, selected, and abstracted the data from eligible studies into Covidence, a systematic review software. Cochrane criteria was used to rate each study for the risk of bias. The data abstracted were described using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 test. RESULTS: Ten studies involving a total of 269 patients were included. The studies were analyzed for the proportion of pleurodesis achieved, the average time to pleurodesis, total complication rate, pleural infection rate, and mortality. A proportion of 47% of the total subjects included achieved spontaneous pleurodesis in an average duration of 104.3 days. The frequency of total complication rate was noted to be 30.36%. The incidence of pleural cavity infection was described to be 12.4% and death resulting from complications of IPC was 3.35%. CONCLUSION: The current management options for the refractory pleural effusion in HH include repeated thoracenteses, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, surgical repair of defects in the diaphragm, and liver transplantation.

METHODS: The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization, and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social media on mobile devices. RESULTS: HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients. The syndromic surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic emergencies. The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources.

Of the 15 nurses who were included as study subjects on a night shift, eight took two short naps (the Nap condition), and seven worked without taking a nap (the No-nap condition) during the night shift. We measured sublingual temperature and the bispectral index (BIS), obtained heart rate and heart rate variability measures from an electrocardiogram (ECG), and evaluated sleepiness and fatigue levels every hour using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Both subjective sleepiness and fatigue increased between 4:00 and 5:00, with no significant differences observed between the two groups. However, the low- to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF) in the Nap condition group was found to be significantly lower than in the No-nap condition group. Furthermore, a sudden, brief increase in HF values was observed in the No-nap condition group in the morning. The results of this study suggest that taking two short naps may effectively reduce tension and prevent a brief increase in HF values by suppressing sympathetic nervous activity in the morning.","output":"Effects of two 15-min naps on the subjective sleepiness, fatigue and heart rate variability of night shift nurses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In-needle microextraction consists of the confinement of the sorbent, by coating or packing, inside a metallic needle. The size of the needles reduces the eluent requirements providing an efficient preconcentration of the analytes.

The coating consists of the in-surface polymerization of dopamine at pH 8.5 and mild conditions (room temperature and water as solvent). The PDA coating over the stainless-steel surface confers the needles with a high extraction ability towards the target analytes. After the extraction, the eluates were analyzed by direct infusion MS spectrometry, working in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, which provided a sample throughput of 30 samples per hour. The variables affecting the synthesis (number of coating cycles, the concentration of dopamine, and needle surface pre-treatment) and the extraction (sample salinity, sample loading cycles, and the number of elution strokes) were studied in depth. Under the optimum conditions, a matrix-matched calibration model was built. The limits of quantification are between 2 and 5 ng mL(?1) with linear ranges up to 1000 ng mL(?1) for all analytes. The precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), is better than 10% for all analytes. Accuracy was calculated as recovery, and the obtained values are between 84% and 107%.

The present study examined the relationship between grit and lifestyle behaviors during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and initial lockdowns in the United States. It was hypothesized that those with more grit would engage in healthier lifestyle behaviors of increased physical activity, less sedentary time, and better eating habits. Using an internet-based survey, data was collected from adults from April 13th to May 4th, 2020. Survey questions focused on demographics, grit, physical activity and sedentary time, and dietary habits. Associations between grit and lifestyle were examined using a combination of hierarchical multiple regression analyses and ANCOVAs. The sample of 888 adults (age: 34.814.0) was 74.2% female. Those with higher grit were more physically active, reported less sedentary time, and practiced better dietary habits. Collectively, these findings suggest that grit may help individuals lead a healthier lifestyle during stressful or negative events such as a global pandemic.

In this work, we used RNAseq expression profiling and immunofluorescence microscopy to characterise neurospheres-derived cells (NDC), that simply and reliably grow from neurospheres (NS) obtained from nasal biopsies. We utilized differential expression analysis to explore the molecular changes that occur during transition from NS to NDC. We found that processes associated with neuronal and vascular cells are downregulated in NDC. A comparison with public transcriptomes revealed a depletion of neuronal and glial components in NDC.

Theoretically, we develop first-principles methods to predict these interaction variations and reveal their correlation in large temperature and strain ranges.

As reported by the World Health Organization, there are currently more than 100 million infectious cases with an average mortality rate of about five percent all over the world. To avoid serious consequences on peoples lives and the economy, policies and actions need to be suitably made in time. To do that, the authorities need to know the future trend in the development process of this pandemic. This is the reason why forecasting models play an important role in controlling the pandemic situation. However, the behavior of this pandemic is extremely complicated and difficult to be analyzed, so that an effective model is not only considered on accurate forecasting results but also the explainable capability for human experts to take action pro-actively. With the recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, the emerging Deep Learning (DL) models have been proving highly effective when forecasting this pandemic future from the huge historical data. However, the main weakness of DL models is lacking the explanation capabilities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel combination of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) neural network known as BeCaked. With pandemic data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, our model achieves 0.98 R2 and 0.012 MAPE at world level with 31-step forecast and up to 0.99 R2 and 0.0026 MAPE at country level with 15-step forecast on predicting daily infectious cases.

The objective of this large cohort study is to compare outcomes between patients undergoing TEP or TAPP. METHODS Based on prospective data of the Swiss association of laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgery, all patients undergoing unilateral TEP or TAPP between 1995 and 2006 were included. The following outcomes were compared: conversion rates, intraoperative and postoperative complications, duration of operation. RESULTS Data on 4,552 patients undergoing TEP (n=3,457) and TAPP (n=1,095) were collected prospectively. Average age and American Society of Anesthesiologists score were similar in the two groups. Patients undergoing TEP had a significantly higher rate of intraoperative complications (TEP 1.9% vs. TAPP 0.9%, p=0.029) and surgical postoperative complications (TEP: 2.3% vs. TAPP: 0.8%, p=0.003). The postoperative length of stay was longer for patients undergoing TAPP (2.9 vs. 2.3 days, p=0.002), whereas the duration of the operation was longer for TEP (66.6 vs. 59.0 min, p<0.001) and the conversion rate was higher (TEP 1.0% vs. TAPP 0.2%, p=0.011). CONCLUSIONS This study is one of the first population-based analyses comparing TEP and TAPP in a prospective cohort of more than 4,500 patients. Intraoperative and surgical postoperative complications were significantly higher in patients undergoing TEP. TEP is also associated with longer operating times and higher conversion rates. Therefore, on a population-based level, the TAPP technique appears to be superior to the TEP repair in patients undergoing unilateral inguinal hernia repair.","output":"TAPP or TEP?

Patients access to specialist clinics and family medicine clinics was limited. In this situation, pharmacists were likely the first option for patients health information. On 18 March 2020, the National Health Fund issued modifications that increased the accessibility to primary health care such as telemedicine. The development of e-health in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic included the implementation of electronic medical records (EDM), telemedicine development, e-prescription, and e-referrals implementation. We investigated this emergencys effect on patients health habits, access to healthcare, and attitude to vaccination. Materials and methods: An anonymous study in the form of an electronic and paper questionnaire was conducted in March 2021 among 926 pharmacies patients in Poland. The content of the questionnaire included access to medical care, performing preventive examinations, implementation of e-prescriptions, patient satisfaction with telepathing, pharmaceutical care, and COVID-19 vaccination. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 456 (49.2%) patients experienced worse access to a doctor. On the other hand, 483 (52.2%) patients did not perform preventive examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost half of the patients (45.4% (n = 420)) were not satisfied with the teleconsultation visit to the doctor. A total of 90% (n = 833) of the respondents do not need help in making an appointment with a doctor and buying medications prescribed by a doctor in the form of an e-prescription. In the absence of access to medical consultation, 38.2% (n = 354) of respondents choose the Internet as a source of medical advice. However, in the absence of contact with a doctor, 229 persons (24.7%) who took part in the survey consulted a pharmacist. In addition, 239 persons (25.8%) used pharmacist advice more often during the COVID-19 pandemic than before its outbreak on 12 March 2020. Moreover, 457 (49.4%) respondents are satisfied with the advice provided by pharmacists, and even 439 patients of pharmacies (47.4%) expect an increase in the scope of pharmaceutical care in the future, including medical advice provided by pharmacists. Most of the respondents, 45.6% (n = 422), want to be vaccinated in a hospital or clinic, but at the same time, for a slightly smaller number of people, 44.6% (n = 413), it has no meaning where they are will be vaccinated against COVID-19. Conclusions: Telemedicine is appreciated by patients but also has some limitations. The COVID-19 pandemic is the chance for telemedicine to transform from implementations to a routine healthcare system structure. However, some patients still need face-to-face contact with the doctor or pharmacist. Pharmacists are essential contributors to public health and play an essential role during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Large sets are more expensive, take longer preparation time due to instrument counting and as a consequence take more total operating time. Furthermore, more instruments need to be unnecessarily purchased, stored and cleaned post procedure. Simple paediatric plastic surgery procedures including nailbed repair or laceration repair require limited and largely replicating operative instrument set. We have therefore introduced Small Minor Plastic Surgical set (MS) containing only 10 instruments. We audited its effectiveness and introduced a revised version of the set as per feedback, permanently arranged into theatre operative set collection.

However, the degree and prevalence of hyperlipasemia was not uniform across studies. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 1,092 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and at least one available lipase result. The number and frequency of patients with lipase above the upper reference limit (URL), >3 URL, and >6 URL were estimated. Correlations between lipase values and other biomarkers of organ or tissue damage were performed to identify possible extra-pancreatic sources of lipase release. The potential prognostic role of lipase to predict death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission during hospitalization was also evaluated. RESULTS Lipase was >URL in 344 (31.5%) of COVID-19 patients. Among them, 65 (5.9%) and 25 (2.3%) had a peak lipase >3 URL and >6 URL, respectively. In the latter group, three patients had acute pancreatitis of gallstone or drug-induced etiology. In others, the etiology of lipase elevations appeared multifactorial and could not be directly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No correlation was found between lipase and other tested biomarkers of organ and tissue damage.

This admission, Initial Troponin I peaked at 0.87 ng/mL and ECG without ischemic changes. Cardiac MRI (CMR) showed no myocarditis/pericarditis but moderate-severely hypokinetic apical cap, distal inferior and septal walls, with a small focus of subendocardial scar/infarction involving the distal septum (Fig.1A,B,C).

SETTING Nine municipalities in Finland which started CRC screening with faecal immunochemical test (FIT) in April 2019 with cut-off levels 70 g Hg/g faeces for men and 25 g Hg/g faeces for women. PARTICIPANTS Men (n=13 059) and women (n=14 669) aged 60-66 years invited to screening during the first programme year. OUTCOME MEASURES Participation rates, positivity rates, detection rates of CRC and advanced adenoma (AA), and positive predictive values (PPV) of FIT for CRC and AA. RESULTS Altogether 21 993 invitees returned stool samples. The participation rate of women (83.4%; 95% CI 82.8 to 84.0) was significantly higher than that of men (74.7%; 95% CI 73.9 to 75.4). The positivity rates were 2.4% (2.2 to 2.7) and 2.8% (2.5 to 3.1), respectively. In total, 37 CRCs and 116 AAs were detected. The detection rates of CRC and AA per 1000 participants were 1.8 (1.1 to 2.9) and 7.2 (5.6 to 9.1) for men and 1.6 (0.9 to 2.4) and 3.8 (2.8 to 5.0) for women. The PPVs per 100 positive tests were 6.6 (4.0 to 10.3) and 25.7 (20.6 to 31.4) for men and 6.4 (3.9 to 9.8) and 15.5 (11.6 to 20.2) for women. CONCLUSIONS The chosen FIT strategy narrowed the gap in the diagnostic performance between men and women especially in the detection of CRC. The participation rates were excellent. The levels of positivity and detection rates were moderate and need further action. The results indicate that gender-specific protocols can be introduced to organised CRC screening. It is yet to be seen whether they are more effective than a uniform screening protocol.","output":"Piloting gender-oriented colorectal cancer screening with a faecal immunochemical test: population-based registry study from Finland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the global population's health and well-being.

We aimed to examine the associations of combined sleep patterns and genetic susceptibility with incident CKD. Methods: This large-scale prospective cohort study included 370,671 participants without CKD at baseline (2006-2010) in UK Biobank data. Five sleep behaviors were made up of sleep duration, insomnia, snoring, chronotype, and daytime sleepiness according to questionnaire. Overall sleep patterns by summing the five scores were created. Weighted genetic risk score of kidney function was calculated. Incident CKD was recorded from death register, primary care, and hospital inpatient records. A subset of 41,130 individuals who participated both the initial assessment visit and follow-up visit (2012+) was also used. Results: During a median follow-up of 10.6 years (about 3.9 million person-years), we documented 6,365 patients with incident CKD. In five sleep behaviors, sleep 7-8 h/day, free of insomnia and no frequent daytime sleepiness were independently associated with incident CKD, with a 12% (95%CI 7-16), 9% (3-14), 13% (9-18) lower risk, respectively. Compared to those with a sleep score of 0-1, participants with a score of 5 had a 21% (10-31%) lower risk of CKD. 17.1% of CKD in this cohort could be attributed to total poor sleep pattern.

Despite common COVID-19 symptoms, variability in clinical phenotypes was reported worldwide. Reports on SARS-CoV-2 suggest causing neurological manifestation. In addition, the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and its complexity are largely unclear. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the possible transport of exosome from SARS-CoV-2Cinfected lungs to the brain regions associated with neurodegenerative diseases using multiple transcriptome datasets of SARS-CoV-2Cinfected lungs, RNA profiles from lung exosome, and gene expression profiles of the human brain. Upon transport, the transcription factors localized in the exosome regulate genes at lateral substantia nigra, medial substantia nigra, and superior frontal gyrus regions of Parkinsons disease (PD) and frontal cortex, hippocampus, and temporal cortex of Alzheimers disease (AD). On SARS-CoV-2 infection, BCL3, JUND, MXD1, IRF2, IRF9, and STAT1 transcription factors in the exosomes influence the neuronal gene regulatory network and accelerate neurodegeneration. STAT1 transcription factor regulates 64 PD genes at lateral substantia nigra, 65 at superior frontal gyrus, and 19 at medial substantia nigra. Similarly, in AD, STAT1 regulates 74 AD genes at the temporal cortex, 40 genes at the hippocampus, and 16 genes at the frontal cortex. We further demonstrate that dysregulated neuronal genes showed involvement in immune response, signal transduction, apoptosis, and stress response process. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 may dysregulate neuronal gene regulatory network through exosomes that attenuate disease severity of neurodegeneration.

To address this difficult scientific problem, we need to understand how transformations in social-ecological systems caused by multifaceted interactions with anthropogenic environmental changes such as urbanization, agricultural transformations, and natural habitat alterations, produce feedbacks that affect natural communities and ultimately their pathogens, animal host, and human populations. Focusing on the complex interactions among natural and human systems at diverse spatial, temporal, and organizational scales, we describe the development of a framework for analyzing social-ecological models, to understand how these systems function and the processes through which these systems interact with each other to influence disease outbreaks. To address multi-scale issues within the framework, we draw upon multiple social science theories and methods (e.g., environmental economics, geography, decision and risk science, urban and regional development, and spatial information science). We posit that the framework helps to identify potential vulnerabilities of CNH systems to disturbances, describing important elements as a starting point for the development and testing of more general CNH systems. We also posit that transformations in the elements and how they relate to each other are key in determining the robustness of CNH systems. Given the importance and difficulty of research on social-ecological systems, we recommend a carefully considered theoretical rationale and a model-guided methodological approach.

To improve identification of HIV-positive individuals, Nigeria developed an Enhanced Community Case-Finding Package (ECCP). We describe ECCP implementation in nine states and assess its effect. METHODS: ECCP included four core strategies (small area estimation [SAE] of people living with HIV [PLHIV], map of HIV-positive patients by residence, HIV risk-screening tool [HRST], and index testing [IT]) and four supportive strategies (alternative healthcare outlets, performance-based incentives for field testers, Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes, and interactive dashboards). ECCP was deployed in nine of 10 states prioritized for ART scale-up. Weekly program data (October 2019CMarch 2020) were tracked and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the total 774 LGAs in Nigeria, using SAE, 103 (13.3%) high-burden LGAs were identified, in which 2605 (28.0%) out of 9,294 hotspots were prioritized by mapping newly identified PLHIV by residential addresses.

METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective cohort and nested case-control study. A total of 96 eligible patients with COVID-19 in convalescence were enrolled from Beijing Youan Hospital and Beijing Huimin Hospital and followed up from the hospital discharged day. Patients were divided into the CM (64 cases) and the control groups (32 cases) based on the treatment with or without CM and followed up at 14, 28, 56, and 84 days after discharge. In the CM group, patients received the 28-day CM treatment according to two types of CM syndrome. Improvements in clinical symptoms, CM syndrome, and absorption of lung inflammation were observed. RESULTS: All the 96 patients completed the 84-day follow-up from January 21 to March 28, 2020. By the 84th day of follow-up, respiratory symptoms were less than 5%. There was no significant difference in the improvement rates of symptoms, including fatigue, sputum, cough, dry throat, thirst, and upset, between the two groups (P>0.05). Totally 82 patients (85.42%) showed complete lung inflammation absorption at the 84-day follow-up.

Laboratory studies investigating office stress have mostly relied on data from participants that were tested individually on abstract tasks. In this study, we examined the effect of psychosocial office stress and work interruptions on the psychobiological stress response in a realistic but controlled group office environment. We also explored the role of cognitive stress appraisal as an underlying mechanism mediating the relationship between work stressors and the stress response. METHODS AND MATERIALS Ninety participants (44 female; mean age 23.11  3.80) were randomly assigned to either a control condition or one of two experimental conditions in which they were exposed to psychosocial stress with or without prior work interruptions in a realistic multi-participant laboratory setting. To induce psychosocial stress, we adapted the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups to an office environment. Throughout the experiment, we continuously monitored heart rate and heart rate variability. Participants repeatedly reported on their current mood, calmness, wakefulness and perceived stress and gave saliva samples to assess changes in salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase. Additionally, cognitive appraisal of the psychosocial stress test was evaluated. RESULTS Our analyses revealed significant group differences for most outcomes during or immediately after the stress test (i.e., mood, calmness, perceived stress, salivary cortisol, heart rate, heart rate variability) and during recovery (i.e., salivary cortisol and heart rate). Interestingly, the condition that experienced work interruptions showed a higher increase of cortisol levels but appraised the stress test as less threatening than individuals that experienced only psychosocial stress. Exploratory mediation analyses revealed a blunted response in subjective measures of stress, which was partially explained by the differences in threat appraisal. DISCUSSION The results showed that experimentally induced work stress led to significant responses of subjective measures of stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system. However, there appears to be a discrepancy between the psychological and biological responses to preceding work interruptions. Appraising psychosocial stress as less threatening but still as challenging could be an adaptive way of coping and reflect a state of engagement and eustress.","output":"The effects of acute work stress and appraisal on psychobiological stress responses in a group office environment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The health benefits of walking through greenspace have earned widespread academic attention in recent years and have been termed therapeutic mobilities. As a result, walking groups are actively encouraged by health professionals as a way to promote healthy ageing. This paper examines whether the promotion of community-led walking groups relies upon overly optimistic understandings that portray walking in greenspace as an inherently therapeutic practice. Accordingly, this paper introduces the concept of detrimental mobilities to explore how the shared movement promoted via walking groups may not always be inherently therapeutic and may have some detrimental impacts on the individuals who take part in these activities. Drawing on findings from in-depth walking interviews with older members of the Walking for Health scheme in Southampton, England, this paper examines how mobilities have the potential to disable, as much as they enable, health and wellbeing.","output":"Therapeutic or detrimental mobilities?

In disease, its local induction promotes pathogenic neovascularisation while its inhibition leads to reduced dysfunctional angiogenesis. Here we examine the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in defective angiogenesis mediated by LRG1. IL-6 treatment induced LRG1 expression in endothelial cells and ex vivo angiogenesis cultures and promoted vascular growth with reduced mural cell coverage. In Lrg1(?/?) explants, however, IL-6 failed to stimulate angiogenesis and vessels exhibited improved mural cell coverage. IL-6 activated LRG1 transcription through the phosphorylation and binding of STAT3 to a conserved consensus site in the LRG1 promoter, the deletion of which abolished activation. Blocking IL-6 signalling in human lung endothelial cells, using the anti-IL6 receptor antibody Tocilizumab, significantly reduced LRG1 expression. Our data demonstrate that IL-6, through STAT3 phosphorylation, activates LRG1 transcription resulting in vascular destabilisation. This observation is especially timely in light of the potential role of IL-6 in COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary microvascular complications, where targeting IL-6 has been beneficial. However, our data suggest that a therapy directed towards blocking the downstream angiopathic effector molecule LRG1 may be of greater utility.","output":"Angiopathic activity of LRG1 is induced by the IL-6/STAT3 pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Abnormal nutritional status is frequently seen in patients with chronic diseases. To date, no study has investigated the detailed characteristics of abnormal nutritional status among Wilson's disease (WD) patients in the Chinese cohort. This study aimed to describe the nutritional status of WD patients, with a particular focus on the differences between patients with different phenotypes. Methods: The study subjects comprised 119 healthy controls, 129 inpatients (hepatic subtype, n = 34; neurological subtype, n = 95) who were being treated at the affiliated hospital of the Institute of Neurology, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine. All of the subjects were assessed for body composition by using bioelectrical impedance analysis. All WD patients received anthropometry, nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS2002), and laboratory test (hemocyte and serum biomarkers) additionally. Results: Compared with healthy controls, the fat mass and rate of total body and trunk were significantly higher in WD patients (P < 0.001), the muscle and skeletal muscle mass of total body and trunk were significantly lower in WD patients (P < 0.001). Compared with hepatic subtype patients, the fat mass and rate of total body, trunk, and limbs were significantly lower in neurological subtype patients (P<0.01); while there were no significant differences in muscle and skeletal muscle between these two subtypes. The overall prevalence of abnormal nutritional status in WD patients was 43.41% (56/129). The prevalence of high-nutritional risk and overweight in WD patients was 17.83% (23 of 129) and 25.58% (33 of 129), respectively. Compare with patients with high nutritional risk, macro platelet ratio, alkaline phosphatase, the basal metabolic rate (p < 0.05), creatinine, trunk fat rate (p < 0.01) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in patients without nutritional risk (p < 0.001). Patients with a high nutritional risk tend to have a lower cholinesterase concentration (x(2) = 4.227, p < 0.05). Conclusion: Both patients with H-subtype and N-subtype are prone to have an abnormal nutritional status.

The present study intended to conduct a perception-based analysis to get an idea of people's psychosocial and socio-economic crisis, and the possible environmental crisis, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Methods: A perception-based questionnaire was put online for Bangladeshi citizens of 18 years and/or older. The sample size was 1,066 respondents. Datasets were analyzed through a set of statistical techniques including principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis. Results: There was a positive significant association between fear of the COVID-19 outbreak with the struggling healthcare system (p < 0.05) of the country. Also, there was a negative association between the fragile health system of Bangladesh and the government's ability to deal with the pandemic (p < 0.05), revealing the poor governance in the healthcare system. A positive association of shutdown and social distancing with the fear of losing one's own or a family members' life, influenced by a lack of healthcare treatment (p < 0.05), reveals that, due to the decision of shutting down normal activities, people may be experiencing mental and economic stress. However, a positive association of the socio-economic impact of the shutdown with poor people's suffering, the price hike of basic essentials, the hindering of formal education (p < 0.05), and the possibility of a severe socio-economic and health crisis will be aggravated. Moreover, there is a possibility of a climate change-induced disaster and infectious diseases like dengue during/after the COVID-19 situation, which will create severe food insecurity (p < 0.01) and a further healthcare crisis. Conclusions: The partial lockdown in Bangladesh due to the COVID-19 pandemic increased community transmission and worsened the healthcare crisis, economic burden, and loss of GDP despite the resuming of industrial operations. In society, it has created psychosocial and socio-economic insecurity among people due to the loss of lives and livelihoods. The government should take proper inclusive steps for risk assessment, communications, and financial stimulus toward the public to alleviate their fear and anxiety, and to take proper action to boost mental health and well-being.","output":"Psychosocial and Socio-Economic Crisis in Bangladesh Due to COVID-19 Pandemic: A Perception-Based Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) causing COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) initially was identified in China in December 2019. It has resulted in a pandemic with increasing spread of the virus in the U.S. The county health departments around U.S. are spearheading the response to contain the spread of this virus. METHODS: This project was a survey of county health departments in the state of Kansas with data collection period from April 15 to April 24, 2020. This study evaluated the staffing, resources, and funding of these health departments and how it was affecting the efforts to contain COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the responses. RESULTS: A total of 75% of the county health departments in Kansas responded to the survey. In 89% of locations, the staffing had not increased. Most health departments had an average of five people and the four largest ones had 30 to 98 staff working on COVID-19. Most locations used the Kansas Department of Health and Environment criteria for testing and used a combination of state or private laboratories. The results of the tests were available three days or longer in 62% and after five days in 14% of sites. All locations were active in contact tracing, but most had one to three people for this purpose and in 90% the contact tracing interview was via phone calls. There was no change in funding in 21% and decreased funding in 8.5% of health departments. Most locations had an average of five nasopharyngeal swabs on the day of the survey. The most common needs expressed were help to increase testing capability, more public education, more personal protective equipment, increased personnel, and assistance with contract tracing.

The objective of the study was to determine SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers of Kaunas hospitals and to compare two methods for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Materials and Methods: A total of 432 healthcare workers in Kaunas hospitals were enrolled in this study. Each participant filled a questionnaire including questions about their demographics, contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, acute respiratory symptoms, and whether they contacted their general practitioner, could not come to work, or had to be hospitalized. Capillary blood was used to test for SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) a lateral flow immunoassay. Serum samples were used to test for specific IgG and IgA class immunoglobulins using semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results: 24.77% of study participants had direct contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. A total of 64.81% of studied individuals had at least one symptom representing acute respiratory infection, compatible with COVID-19. Lateral flow immunoassay detected SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG class immunoglobulins in 1.16% of the tested group.

Following a socioecological framework, the current study examines the moderating role of grit (perseverance and consistency) and social support in the association between COVID-19 infection risk and depressive symptoms. A sample of 1,251 young adults under home quarantine (62.6% female; M (age) = 20.92 years, SD = 1.47; age ranged from 18 to 25 years) was involved in this study, and they were asked to complete a set of self-reported questionnaires online. Results of a linear regression analysis exhibited that COVID-19 infection risk was positively associated with depressive symptoms in young adults in quarantine. Moreover, moderation analyses showed that this association was moderated by perseverance and social support. To be specific, for those reporting higher levels of social support, this linkage was not significantly positive; in contrast, for those reporting lower levels of social support, perseverance was a significant protective factor for depressive symptoms when young adults were exposed to a high infection risk of COVID-19. The current study suggests that greater social support is essential to helping young adults deal with possible negative emotions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, university-based counseling services should pay specific attention to those young adults with relatively insufficient social support resources and low levels of perseverance.","output":"COVID-19 Infection Risk and Depressive Symptoms Among Young Adults During Quarantine: The Moderating Role of Grit and Social Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent study reported that an aerosolized virus (COVID-19) can survive in the air for a few hours. It is highly possible that people get infected with the disease by breathing and contact with items contaminated by the aerosolized virus. However, the aerosolized virus transmission and trajectories in various meteorological environments remain unclear. This paper has investigated the movement of aerosolized viruses from a high concentration source across a dense urban area. The case study looks at the highly air polluted areas of London: University College Hospital (UCH) and King's Cross and St Pancras International Station (KCSPI). We explored the spread and decay of COVID-19 released from the hospital and railway stations with the prescribed meteorological conditions. The study has three key findings: the primary result is that the concentration of viruses decreases rapidly by a factor of 2-3 near the sources although the virus may travel from meters up to hundreds of meters from the source location for certain meteorological conditions. The secondary finding shows viruses released into the atmosphere from entry and exit points at KCSPI remain trapped within a small radial distance of &lt; 50 m. This strengthens the case for the use of face coverings to reduce the infection rate. The final finding shows that there are different levels of risk at various door locations for UCH;depending on which door is used there can be a higher concentration of COVID-19.

CASE REPORT: We describe a white male patient from a nursing home who was reinfected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with severe disease manifesting as dyspnea, fevers, and encephalopathy with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation, elevated inflammatory markers, and lung infiltrates on imaging, after initially testing positive with mild symptoms 2 months prior to presentation. Notably, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies were detected, which indicated this was a coronavirus disease 2019 reinfection. After treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, he was subsequently extubated and discharged home after 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: It is not clear whether an initial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and recovery provides prolonged immunity beyond 2 months. Furthermore, even if antibodies are present, it does not guarantee an attenuated course during reinfection. Therefore, vaccination plays an important role in prevention.

However, not all of which might prevent the virus from entering the cell, although their concentrations correlate with the titers of viral neutralization tests (NTs). Antibodies against the viral nucleocapsid (NC), e.g., can be classified as such. We aimed to prove the hypothesis that the apparent correlation between NC-antibody levels and NT-titers is mediated by simultaneously occurring antibodies against viral spike-protein components. Methods We included 64 individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (>14d after symptom onset). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the NC (Roche total antibody ECLIA, Abbott IgG CMIA) and spike-protein (Technozym RBD ELISA, DiaSorin S1/S2 CLIA) were measured, and neutralization tests were performed. The effect of spike-protein antibodies on the correlation between NC-antibodies and NT-titers was evaluated by partial correlation and mediation analyses. Results Both tested assays assessing antibodies against the NC correlated significantly with NT titers: Abbott {rho}=0.742, P<0.0001; Roche {rho}=0.365, P<0.01. However, when controlling the rank correlations for the presence of RBD or S1/S2 antibodies, correlation coefficients dropped to {rho}=0.318/{rho}=0.329 (P<0.05/P<0.01) , respectively for Abbott and vanished for Roche. As a result, only a maximum of 11% of NT titer variability could be explained by NC-antibody levels. Conclusions Our data suggest that the apparent correlation between NC antibodies and NT titers is strongly mediated by co-occurring RBD antibody concentrations. To avoid falsely implied causal relationships, all correlation analyses of non-spike-associated antibody assays and neutralization assays should include a partial correlation analysis to exclude a possible mediator effect of spike-associated antibodies.","output":"Spike protein antibodies mediate the apparent correlation between SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies and neutralization test results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For society to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the agri-food industry needs a substantial sustainability transition toward food systems capable of delivering greater volumes of nutritious food, while simultaneously lowering the environmental footprint.

Technical success was defined as the achievement of an ablative margin of at least 5 mm for each tumor. Technical success, complications, and local tumor progression were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The initial technical success rate was significantly higher with MPT-MWA (94.1%) than with MPT-RFA (76.4%; P = 0.003). The number of treatment sessions per nodule was significantly lower with MPT-MWA (1.1) than with MPT-RFA (1.3) (P = 0.004). The major complication rates were similar with MPT-RFA (5.8%) and MPT-MWA (2.7%) (P = 0.391). The one-year local tumor progression rate was similar between MPT-RFA (0%) and MPT-MWA (0%) (P = 0.73).

The evaluation of the mechanism of action suggested that both HIDROX and HT induced structural changes in SARS-CoV-2, which changed the molecular weight of the spike proteins. Even though the spike protein is highly glycosylated, this change was induced regardless of the glycosylation status. In addition, HIDROX or HT treatment disrupted the viral genome. Moreover, the HIDROX-containing cream applied on film showed time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities.

The purpose of this review is to provide important updates on cytokines and inflammatory mediators related to myositis. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past 5 years, multiple studies brought a fresh insight into the pathogenesis of myositis by introducing new factors or further characterizing the role of the well established mediators in myositis. Among the mediators reviewed in this article, special attention was paid to interferons, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, interleukin-18 and the IL23/Th17 axis. Some of the recent work has also focused on the nontraditional cytokines, such as adipokines, myokines, S100 proteins, High Mobility Group Box 1 or B-cell activating factor and on several anti-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, microRNAs and their potential to reflect the disease activity or to regulate the inflammatory processes in myositis have recently been subject of intensive investigation. Some of the above-mentioned mediators have been proposed as promising clinical biomarkers or therapeutic targets for myositis.

Music can contribute to enhancing wellbeing, but the extent of this effect may be modulated by both personal and context-related variables. This study aimed to analyze the impact of the two types of variables on the perceived efficacy of musical behaviors to fulfill adults' emotional wellbeing-related goals during the lockdown established in Spain. Personal variables included age, gender, musical training, personality, resilience, and perception of music's importance. Contextual variables referred to living in a region with a high COVID-19 impact, perception of belonging to a risk group, being alone, having caring responsibilities during confinement, and amount of time of music listening as compared to prior to the crisis. The study was conducted retrospectively during August-December 2020, when the strict lockdown was over in Spain. An online survey was disseminated among the general population and groups of musicians, and the answers of 507 adults (from 18 years on, 73.9% females, 51.3% musically trained adults) were analyzed. Only personal, but not COVID-19 context-related variables, showed an impact on music's efficacy. The youngest age group of adults and those with musical training reported the highest efficacy of music for wellbeing enhancement, and music's importance was found to be the main significant predictor of music's perceived efficacy. Our findings suggest that the people who have been reported to be emotionally more vulnerable during the lockdown, due to either a strong impact on their daily lives or their lower resilience, perceive a higher benefit from musical behaviors. Being musically trained, even for a small number of years, also leads to a perception of higher efficacy of music for the achievement of emotional wellbeing goals. However, this effect is explained by the musically trained individuals' higher perception of music's importance. Although musical behaviors can be generally considered as important for wellbeing enhancement, our study highlights who are the potential individuals who could benefit the most from music-related activities for obtaining better levels of wellbeing, at least within the current context of the COVID-19 crisis.","output":"The Efficacy of Music for Emotional Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain: An Analysis of Personal and Context-Related Variables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) pandemic has led to a stepwise scale\\\\down of transplant care with an observed increase in waitlist mortality for patients with end\\\\stage\\\\renal\\\\disease (ESRD).[1] Reports on coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) populations suggest that organ transplant recipients have an age\\\\adjusted hazard of more than four for COVID\\\\19 mortality but specific vulnerabilities and risk factors are missing.[2]","output":"Vulnerabilities in kidney transplant recipients with COVID\\\\19: a single center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic was reported in the Hubei province in China in December 2019 and then spread around the world reaching the pandemic stage at the beginning of March 2020.

This proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity. Thus, even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave, keeping a low value of R(e) is crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave (initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities.","output":"Impact of Lockdown on the Epidemic Dynamics of COVID-19 in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Clinical trial guidelines for assessing the safety of vaccines, including the FDA criteria, are primarily based on subjective, self-reported questionnaires. Despite the tremendous technological advances in recent years, objective, continuous assessment of physiological measures post-vaccination is rarely performed. Methods: To evaluate the short-term effects of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine on physiological measures, we conducted a prospective observational study during the mass vaccination campaign in Israel. 160 individuals >18 years who were not previously found to be COVID-19 positive and who received the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine between 1 January 2021, and 13 March 2021 were equipped with a chest-patch sensor and a dedicated mobile application. The chest-patch sensor continuously measured 13 physiological vitals one day before the inoculation (baseline), for four days: heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate variability, stroke volume, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and body temperature. The mobile application collected daily self-reported questionnaires starting one day before the inoculation, for 15 days on local and systemic reactions, sleep quality, stress levels, physical activity, and mood levels. Findings: Within the first 48 hours post-vaccination, we identified significant changes (p-value <0.05) in nearly all 13 chest-patch indicators compared to their baseline levels. 48.5% (n=78) reported no local or systemic reaction. Nevertheless, we identified considerable changes in chest-patch indicators during the first 48 hours post-vaccination also in this group of presumably asymptomatic participants. Within three days from vaccination, these measures returned to baseline levels in both groups, further supporting the safety of the vaccine. Interpretation: Our work underscores the importance of obtaining objective physiological data in addition to self-reported questionnaires when performing clinical trials, particularly in ones conducted in very short time frames.

In part, the issue has also become politicized, especially since the presidential election in November. Understanding vaccine hesitancy during this period in the context of social media, including Twitter, can provide valuable guidance both to computational social scientists and policy makers. Rather than studying a single Twitter corpus, this paper takes a novel view of the problem by comparatively studying two Twitter datasets collected between two different time periods (one before the election, and the other, a few months after) using the same, carefully controlled data collection and filtering methodology. Our results show that there was a significant shift in discussion from politics to COVID-19 vaccines from fall of 2020 to spring of 2021. By using clustering and machine learning-based methods in conjunction with sampling and qualitative analysis, we uncover several fine-grained reasons for vaccine hesitancy, some of which have become more (or less) important over time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The 3-month prospective analytical interventional study sampled 85 undergraduate students from the Department of Preventive Dental Sciences. A WhatsApp group was created, information was sent to the male and female groups, and a written assignment was used as a performance benchmark of knowledge acquisition and application. Perceptions of e-learning through WhatsApp were assessed using a previously validated and published questionnaire. Collected data underwent descriptive and bivariate analyses (unpaired t-test). RESULTS The average assignment scores of the 85 hybrid learners were statistically significantly higher than those of traditional learners from the previous academic year (34  1 vs 26  3; p < 0.05, respectively). Meanwhile, 57 hybrid learners completed the survey, and 73% agreed/strongly agreed that introducing a new method of teaching via WhatsApp was useful, 70% reported that a professional and comfortable learning environment was created, and 70% felt that group distractions were handled appropriately. The top advantages of learning through WhatsApp were availability/immediacy (94.7%) and being simple to operate (91.2%). Males (40.4%) were significantly more likely to report a sense of belonging to the group than females (33.3%, p = 0.01). Respondents agreed that high expectations of teacher availability (71.9%) and some students making no effort (52.6%) were challenges. Message flooding (45.6%) and time-consuming nature of WhatsApp (36.8%) were identified as technical challenges. CONCLUSION The findings showed significant improvements in student performance using the hybrid learning tool, as reflected in assignment scores. Positive perceptions of hybrid learning and improved academic performance indicate that WhatsApp is a convenient new teaching tool.

MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients are highly susceptible to infections. Our aim in this study was to uncover reasons why these patients were susceptible to infections. We analyzed various aspects of type I interferon system including HVJ-stimulated IFN- producing capacity and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) number in whole blood in MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients. Compared with healthy subjects, MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients showed impaired HVJ-stimulated IFN- producing capacity and lower pDC number with or without glucocorticoid treatment. Immuno-histological staining of MPO-ANCA-RPGN kidney samples revealed a few but apparent pDC in T cell infiltrating regions even in patients with low pDC number in their peripheral blood. Patients' low HVJ-stimulated IFN- producing capacity and pDC numbers persisted even after patients underwent several years of treatment. Former infection was determined using patients' serum BPI, Lamp-2 and Calprotectin, since they are reflective of a history of infection. These markers were higher in MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients than in healthy subjects. These results indicate that impaired HVJ-stimulated IFN- production as well as dysfunction of the IFN system might have resulted from a previous bout of infection and can be partially implicated in patients' long-term susceptibility and vulnerability to infection.","output":"Impaired HVJ-stimulated Interferon producing capacity in MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis lead to susceptibility to infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), also called nsp12, is considered a promising but challenging drug target for inhibiting replication and hence, the growth of various RNA-viruses. In this report, a computational study is performed to offer insights on the binding of Remdesivir and Galidesivir with SARS-CoV2 RdRp with natural substrate, ATP, as the control. It was observed that Remdesivir and Galidesivir exhibited similar binding energies for their best docked poses, ?6.6 kcal/mole and ?6.2 kcal/mole, respectively. ATP also displayed comparative and strong binding free energy of ?6.3 kcal/mole in the catalytic site of RdRp. However, their binding locations within the active site are distinct. Further, the interaction of catalytic site residues (Asp760, Asp761, and Asp618) with Remdesivir and Galidesivir is comprehensively examined. Conformational changes of RdRp and bound molecules are demonstrated using 100 ns explicit solvent simulation of the protein-ligand complex. Simulation suggests that Galidesivir binds at the non-catalytic location and its binding strength is relatively weaker than ATP and Remdesivir. Remdesivir also binds at the catalytic site and showed high potency to inhibit the function of RdRp. Binding of co-factor units nsp7 and nsp8 with RdRp (nsp12) complexed with Remdesivir and Galidesivir was also examined. MMPBSA binding energy for all three complexes has been computed across the 100 ns simulation trajectory. Overall, this study suggests, Remdesivir has anti-RdRp activity via binding at a catalytic site.

Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (CT) scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease.

Although medical education has adopted active learning as a core component of medical training, teachers have difficulties recognizing when and why their students engage or disengage, and how to teach in ways that optimize engagement. With a better understanding of the dynamics of student engagement in small-group active learning settings, teachers could be facilitated in effectively engaging their students. METHODS We conducted a Video-Stimulated Recall study to explore medical students' engagement during small-group learning activities. We recorded one teaching session of two different groups, and selected critical moments of apparent (dis)engagement. These moments served as prompts for the fifteen individual semi-structured interviews we held. Interview data were analysed using Template Analysis style of Thematic Analysis. To guide the analysis, we used a framework that describes student engagement as a dynamic and multidimensional concept, consisting of behavioural, cognitive and emotional components. RESULTS The analysis uncovered three main findings: 1) In-class student engagement followed a spiral-like pattern. Once students were engaged or disengaged on one dimension, other dimensions were likely to follow suit; 2) Students' willingness to engage in class was decided before class, depending on their perception of a number of personal, social, and educational antecedents of engagement; 3) Distinguishing engagement from disengagement appeared to be difficult for teachers, because the intention behind student behaviour was not always identifiable. DISCUSSION This study adds to the literature by illuminating the dynamic process of student engagement and explaining the difficulty of recognizing and influencing this process in practice. Based on the importance of discerning the intentions behind student behaviour, we advise teachers to use their observations of student (dis)engagement to initiate interaction with students with open and inviting prompts. This can help teachers to (re-)engage students in their classrooms.","output":"Medical student engagement in small-group active learning: a stimulated-recall study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDThe angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) D allele is more prevalent among African Americans compared with other races and ethnicities and has previously been associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis through excessive ACE1 activity.

Skeletal fragility secondary to diabetes increases the risk of fractures and is underestimated by currently available diagnostic tools like fracture risk assessment (FRAX) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In this narrative review we describe the relationship and pathophysiology of skeletal fragility and fractures in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), effect of glucose lowering medications on bone metabolism and the approach to diagnosing and managing osteoporosis and bone fragility in people with diabetes (PWD). METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed for articles in English that focused on T2DM and osteoporosis or bone/skeletal fragility. Articles considered to be of direct clinical relevance to physicians practicing diabetes were included. RESULTS: T2DM is associated with skeletal fragility secondary to compromised bone remodeling and bone turnover. Long duration, poor glycemic control, presence of chronic complications, impaired muscle function, and anti-diabetic medications like thiazolidinediones (TZD) are risk factors for fractures among PWD. Conventional diagnostic tools like DXA and FRAX tool underestimate fracture risk in diabetes. Presence of diabetes does not alter response to anti-osteoporotic treatment in post-menopausal women. CONCLUSION: Estimation of fragility fracture risk should be included in standard of care for T2DM along with screening for traditional complications. Physicians should proactively screen for and manage osteoporosis in people with diabetes.

The significance of the correlations between various parameters characterizing the transport infrastructure of Japan and selected EU countries was tested. Correlation analysis is not typical in transport-oriented research. Several studies have employed such analysis;however, the majority of them have focused on passenger transport and correlations concerning the behavior of the customers of this mode of transport. The aim of this study was to answer the following research question: is there any correlation between transport performance and infrastructure or investment in infrastructure in relation to the mentioned countries, and, if so, is there a connection between the selected countries where this correlation occurs? Greater investment can also be expected in the construction of high-speed railways, given the decisions of some EU Member States not to resume national air transport where there is good railway infrastructure, even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Research on the Relationship between Transport Infrastructure and Performance in Rail and Road Freight TransportA Case Study of Japan and Selected European Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of muscle mass and strength. Despite the seriousness of this disease, a single diagnostic criterion has not yet been established. Few studies have reported the prevalence of sarcopenia globally, and there is a high level of heterogeneity between studies, stemmed from the diagnostic criteria of sarcopenia and the target population. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were (i) to identify and summarize the diagnostic criteria used to define sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia and (ii) to estimate the global and region-specific prevalence of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia by sociodemographic factors. METHODS Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science Core Collections were searched using relevant MeSH terms. The inclusion criteria were cross-sectional or cohort studies in individuals aged 18 years, published in English, and with muscle mass measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, bioelectrical impedance, or computed tomography (CT) scan. For the meta-analysis, studies were stratified by diagnostic criteria (classifications), cut-off points, and instruments to assess muscle mass. If at least three studies reported the same classification, cut-off points, and instrument to measure muscle mass, they were considered suitable for meta-analysis. Following this approach, 6 classifications and 23 subgroups were created. Overall pooled estimates with inverse-variance weights obtained from a random-effects model were estimated using the metaprop command in Stata. RESULTS Out of 19 320 studies, 263 were eligible for the narrative synthesis and 151 for meta-analysis (total n = 692 056, mean age: 68.5 years). Using different classifications and cut-off points, the prevalence of sarcopenia varied between 10% and 27% in the studies included for meta-analysis. The highest and lowest prevalence were observed in Oceania and Europe using the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and EWGSOP2, respectively. The prevalence ranged from 8% to 36% in individuals <60 years and from 10% to 27% in 60 years. Men had a higher prevalence of sarcopenia using the EWGSOP2 (11% vs. 2%) while it was higher in women using the International Working Group on Sarcopenia (17% vs. 12%). Finally, the prevalence of severe sarcopenia ranged from 2% to 9%. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia varied considerably according to the classification and cut-off point used. Considering the lack of a single diagnostic for sarcopenia, future studies should adhere to current guidelines, which would facilitate the comparison of results between studies and populations across the globe.","output":"Global prevalence of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gathered data about SARS-CoV-2 have shown strong evidence in terms of neuroinvasive and neurotropic capacities of the virus to reach and cause eventual damage to the Central Nervous System The spread of the virus may occur through direct and indirect ways, leading to anosmia and/or ageusia These signs have been observed in many COVID-19 patients and are then included in the diagnostic criteria for Neuro-COVID-19 The invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the dorsal vagal complex of the brainstem has a harmful impact on the respiratory rhythm, with even respiratory failure There is evidence that immune response abnormalities including cytokine storm and neuro-inflammation influence not only the disease severity, but also the occurrence of neurological and neurodegenerative manifestations Many umbrella zones remain unclear about Neuro-COVID-19, which requires more consideration in its clinical, biological and therapeutic aspects and may open new research perspectives ? 2020 Fguirouche Abir, Louhab Nissrine, Chraa Mohamed, Kissani Najib and Admou Brahim","output":"Potential pathomechanism of neuro-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) have lower SARS-CoV-2 spike seroconversion than healthy subjects (HS) following vaccination. A breakthrough (BT) infection is defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a respiratory specimen after a person is 14 days after completing the recommended doses for a vaccine. We report a case of SARS-CoV-2 BT infection in a SOTR who was immunologically followed longitudinally following vaccination. Case Report A 44-year-old man with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) and end stage renal disease had undergone heart and kidney transplantation in December 2017 with thymoglobulin induction. His NICM was secondary to radiation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with autologous bone marrow transplant in 2001. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of sirolimus 2mg daily, tacrolimus 2mg twice daily (BID), and prednisone 5mg daily at his 1st Moderna vaccine in April 2021. In anticipation of surgery, sirolimus was stopped and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 500mg BID was started. He was on this regimen at the time of his 2nd Moderna vaccine. Sirolimus was restarted in July and increased to 1mg daily while continuing MMF 500mg BID, tacrolimus, and prednisone. At the end of July, the patient was exposed to several family members with COVID-19. He tested positive 89 days after his 2nd Moderna vaccine (cycle threshold of 33.5). He was asymptomatic at the time, but later developed fever, myalgias, headache, and loss of taste and smell and was treated with casirivimab and imdevimab monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusion. We assessed the patient's immunologic response 14 days post 2nd Moderna vaccination and at BT infection prior to mAb infusion and compared this to HS. The patient developed SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells at 14 days post 2nd mRNA vaccine at a frequency below the average frequency for HS. At BT infection, the patient did not have SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells, partly due to virus induced lymphopenia. The patient did not develop spike-specific CD8+ T cells, spike IgG or neutralizing antibodies at 14 days post 2nd Moderna vaccination or at BT infection. Summary The patient developed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells following vaccination. His uneventful recovery may be secondary to these SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ T cells post vaccination as well as receiving mAb therapy 8 days post infection.","output":"Immunologic Monitoring of a Breakthrough Infection in a Heart and Kidney Transplant Recipient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral pathogenesis in the infected cell is a balance between antiviral responses and subversion of host-cell processes. Many viral proteins specifically interact with host-cell proteins to promote virus biology. Understanding these interactions can lead to knowledge gains about infection and provide potential targets for antiviral therapy. One such virus is Ebola, which has profound consequences for human health and causes viral hemorrhagic fever where case fatality rates can approach 90%. The Ebola virus VP24 protein plays a critical role in the evasion of the host immune response and is likely to interact with multiple cellular proteins. To map these interactions and better understand the potential functions of VP24, label-free quantitative proteomics was used to identify cellular proteins that had a high probability of forming the VP24 cellular interactome. Several known interactions were confirmed, thus placing confidence in the technique, but new interactions were also discovered including one with ATP1A1, which is involved in osmoregulation and cell signaling. Disrupting the activity of ATP1A1 in Ebola-virus-infected cells with a small molecule inhibitor resulted in a decrease in progeny virus, thus illustrating how quantitative proteomics can be used to identify potential therapeutic targets.","output":"Elucidation of the Ebola virus VP24 cellular interactome and disruption of virus biology through targeted inhibition of host-cell protein function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the current century, each major coronavirus outbreak has triggered a quick and immediate surge of academic publications on its respective topic. The spike in research publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, however, has been like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised scientific efforts at an unprecedented scale. In less than 5 months, more than 12,000 research items and in less than seven months, more than 30,000 items were indexed, while it is projected that the number could exceed 80,000 by the end of 2020, should the current trend continues. With the health crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here, scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted with those of the two previous major coronavirus diseases, i.e., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Interesting recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct cohorts of studies: (i) studies linked to public health response and epidemic control, (ii) studies on chemical constitution of the virus; and (iii) studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies affiliated with category (i) seem to have been relatively earliest to emerge, they have overall received relatively smaller number of citations compared to publications the two other categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been disseminated across a broader variety of journals and across a more diverse range of subject areas. Clear links are observed between the geographical origins of each outbreak as well as the local geographical severity of each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19 studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of countries compared to SARS and MERS. Considering the speed at which the Covid-19-related literature is accumulating, an interesting dimension that warrants further exploration could be to assess if the quality and rigour of these publications have been affected.","output":"Covid-19 pandemic and the unprecedented mobilisation of scholarly efforts prompted by a health crisis: Scientometric comparisons across SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein tertiary structure prediction is an active research area and has attracted significant attention recently due to the success of AlphaFold from DeepMind. Methods capable of accurately evaluating the quality of predicted models are of great importance. In the past, although many model quality assessment (QA) methods have been developed, their accuracies are not consistently high across different QA performance metrics for diverse target proteins. In this paper, we propose MUfoldQA_G, a new multi-model QA method that aims at simultaneously optimizing Pearson correlation and average GDT-TS difference, two commonly used QA performance metrics. This method is based on two new algorithms MUfoldQA_Gp and MUfoldQA_Gr. MUfoldQA_Gp uses a new technique to combine information from protein templates and reference protein models to maximize the Pearson correlation QA metric. MUfoldQA_Gr employs a new machine learning technique that resamples training data and retrains adaptively to learn a consensus model that is better than na?ve consensus while minimizing average GDT-TS difference. MUfoldQA_G uses a new method to combine the results of MUfoldQA_Gr and MUfoldQA_Gp so that the final QA prediction results achieve low average GDT-TS difference that is close to the results from MUfoldQA_Gr, while maintaining high Pearson correlation that is the same as the results from MUfoldQA_Gp.

The lectin pathway of complement activation is a key contributor to innate immunity and inflammation. Concentrations of plasma lectin pathway proteins influence pathway activity and vary with ethnicity. We measured circulating lectin proteins in a multi-ethnic cohort of chronic kidney disease patients with and without COVID19 infection to determine if lectin pathway activation was contributing to COVID19 severity. We measured 11 lectin proteins in serial samples from a cohort of 33 patients with chronic kidney impairment and COVID19. Controls were single plasma samples from 32 patients on dialysis and 32 healthy individuals. We demonstrated multiple associations between recognition molecules and associated proteases of the lectin pathway and COVID-19, including COVID-19 severity. Some of these associations were unique to patients of Asian and White ethnicity. Our novel findings demonstrate that COVID19 infection alters the concentration of plasma lectin proteins and some of these changes were linked to ethnicity. This suggests a role for the lectin pathway in the host response to COVID-19 and suggest that variability within this pathway may contribute to ethnicity-associated differences in susceptibility to severe COVID-19.","output":"Plasma Lectin Pathway Complement Proteins in Patients With COVID-19 and Renal Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even though bronchiolitis is a disease that has been recognized for many years, there are still few therapeutic strategies beyond supportive therapies. Bronchiolitis is the most frequent cause of hospital admission in children less than 1 year of age. The incidence is estimated to be about 150 million cases a year worldwide, and 2C3% of these cases require hospitalization. It is acknowledged that viruses cause bronchiolitis, but most of the studies focus on RSV. The RSV causes a more severe form of bronchiolitis in children with risk factors including prematurity, cardiovascular disease and immunodeficiency. Other viruses involved in causing bronchiolitis include RV, hMPV, hBoV and co-infections. The RV seems to be associated with a less severe acute disease, but there is a correlation between the early infection and subsequent wheezing bronchitis and asthma in later childhood and adulthood. The supportive therapies used are intravenous fluids and oxygen supplement administered by nasal cannula or CPAP in most complicated patients. Additional pharmacological therapies include epinephrine, 3% hypertonic saline and corticosteroids. The Epinephrine seems to have the greatest short-term benefits and reduces the need of hospital admission, whereas hypertonic saline and corticosteroids seem to reduce the length of hospital stay. As bronchiolitis is such a prevalent disease in children and RV seems to play an important role, perhaps more studies should center around the RV's contribution to the initial disease and following pathology.","output":"Viral bronchiolitis in children: A common condition with few therapeutic options()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The future development of Africa hinges on the development of its human capital.

We present the evidence that eating disorders and obesity can be managed or prevented using the same interventions in the pediatric age. In the presence of obesity in the pediatric age, disordered eating behaviors are highly prevalent, increasing the risk of developing eating disorders. The most frequently observed in subjects with obesity are bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorders, both of which are characterized by abnormal eating or weight-control behaviors. Various are the mechanisms overlying the interaction including environmental and individual ones, and different are the approaches to reduce the consequences. Evidence-based treatments for obesity and eating disorders in childhood include as first line approaches weight loss with nutritional management and lifestyle modification via behavioral psychotherapy, as well as treatment of psychiatric comorbidities if those are not a consequence of the eating disorder. Drugs and bariatric surgery need to be used in extreme cases. Future research is necessary for early detection of risk factors for prevention, more precise elucidation of the mechanisms that underpin these problems and, finally, in the cases requiring therapeutic intervention, to provide tailored and timely treatment.

This study investigates the impact of the lockdown restrictions in India on atmospheric composition, using Sentinel-5Ps retrievals of tropospheric NO2 concentration and ground-station measurements of NO2 and PM2.5 between March-May in 2019 and 2020. Detailed analysis of the changes to atmospheric composition are carried out over six major urban areas (i.e. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad) by comparing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) measurements in the lockdown year 2020 and pre-lockdown (2015-2019). Satellite-based data showed that NO2 concentration reduced by 18% (Kolkata), 29% (Hyderabad), 32-34% (Chennai, Mumbai, and Bangalore), and 43% (Delhi). Surface-based concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, and AOD also substantially dropped by 32-74%, 10-42%, and 8-34%, respectively over these major cities during the lockdown period and co-located with the intensity of anthropogenic activity. Only a smaller fraction of the reduction of pollutants was associated with meteorological variability. A substantial negative anomaly was found for LST both in the day (-0.16 C to -1 C) and night (-0.63 C to -2.1 C) across select all cities, which was also consistent with air temperature measurements. The decreases in LST could be associated with a reduction in pollutants, greenhouse gases and water vapor content. Improvement in air quality with lower urban temperatures due to lockdown may be a temporary effect, but it provides a crucial connection among human activities, air pollution, aerosols, radiative flux, and temperature. The lockdown for a shorter-period showed a significant improvement in environmental quality and provides a strong evidence base for larger scale policy implementation to improve air quality.","output":"Improvement in air quality and its impact on land surface temperature in major urban areas across India during the first lockdown of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: YouTube&#8482; is the world's second most popular website after Google on the Internet.

In the present study, we targeted the S. mansoni lysine-specific demethylase 1 (SmLSD1), a transcriptional corepressor, using a novel and selective synthetic inhibitor, MC3935, which was used to treat schistosomula and adult worms in vitro. By using cell viability assays and optical and electron microscopy, we showed that treatment with MC3935 affected parasite motility, egg-laying, tegument, and cellular organelle structures, culminating in the death of schistosomula and adult worms. In silico molecular modeling and docking analysis suggested that MC3935 binds to the catalytic pocket of SmLSD1. Western blot analysis revealed that MC3935 inhibited SmLSD1 demethylation activity of H3K4me1/2. Knockdown of SmLSD1 by RNAi recapitulated MC3935 phenotypes in adult worms. RNA-Seq analysis of MC3935-treated parasites revealed significant differences in gene expression related to critical biological processes.

We demonstrate how information about the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions could narrow prediction intervals around hospitalizations over the next few weeks, while information about the prevalence of undetected cases could narrow prediction intervals around the timing and height of the peak of the epidemic.","output":"Defining high-value information for COVID-19 decision-making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has tested nurse staffing and other resources necessary for lifesaving treatment.

Recommendations for surgical emergency trauma care measures need to be adequately informed by available evidence and adapt to particular settings. To inform future recommendations, we set to summarize the effects of different personal protective equipment (PPE) on the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for trauma surgery patients. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review using Living Overview of Evidence platform for COVID-19, which performs regular automated searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and more than 30 other sources. Systematic reviews of experimental and observational studies assessing the efficacy of PPE were included. Indirect evidence from other health care settings was also considered. Risk of bias was assessed with the AMSTAR II tool (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews, Ottawa, ON, Canada), and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for grading the certainty of the evidence is reported (registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42020198267). RESULTS: Eighteen studies that fulfilled the selection criteria were included. There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks is associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 when compared with no mask use. In moderate- to high-risk environments, N95 respirators are associated with a further reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion in this setting. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit. CONCLUSION: The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in health care workers. N95 and equivalent respirators provide more protection than surgical masks. Decontamination and reuse appear feasible to overcome PPE shortages and enhance the allocation of limited resources. These effects are applicable to emergency trauma care and should inform future recommendations.

HIV self-testing (HIVST), a process where a person collects his/her own specimen, performs a test, and interprets the result, was introduced in 2019 as a new testing modality through the ATLAS project coordinated by the international partner organisation Solthis (IPO). We estimate the costs of implementing HIVST through 23 civil society organisations (CSO)-led models for KP in C?te d'Ivoire (N = 7), Senegal (N = 11), and Mali (N = 5). We modelled costs for programme transition (2021) and early scale-up (2022C2023). Between July 2019 and September 2020, a total of 51,028, 14,472, and 34,353 HIVST kits were distributed in C?te d'Ivoire, Senegal, and Mali, respectively. Across countries, 64C80% of HIVST kits were distributed to FSW, 20C31% to MSM, and 5C8% to PWUD. Average costs per HIVST kit distributed were $15 for FSW (C?te d'Ivoire: $13, Senegal: $17, Mali: $16), $23 for MSM (C?te d'Ivoire: $15, Senegal: $27, Mali: $28), and $80 for PWUD (C?te d'Ivoire: $16, Senegal: $144), driven by personnel costs (47C78% of total costs), and HIVST kits costs (2C20%). Average costs at scale-up were $11 for FSW (C?te d'Ivoire: $9, Senegal: $13, Mali: $10), $16 for MSM (C?te d'Ivoire: $9, Senegal: $23, Mali: $17), and $32 for PWUD (C?te d'Ivoire: $14, Senegal: $50). Cost reductions were mainly explained by the spreading of IPO costs over higher HIVST distribution volumes and progressive IPO withdrawal at scale-up. In all countries, CSO-led HIVST kit provision to KP showed relatively high costs during the study period related to the progressive integration of the programme to CSO activities and contextual challenges (COVID-19 pandemic, country safety concerns). In transition to scale-up and integration of the HIVST programme into CSO activities, this model shows large potential for substantial economies of scale. Further research will assess the overall cost-effectiveness of this model.","output":"Costs and Scale-Up Costs of Integrating HIV Self-Testing Into Civil Society Organisation-Led Programmes for Key Populations in C?te d'Ivoire, Senegal, and Mali"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A subset of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop profound respiratory failure and are treated via invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).

Objective We conducted a systematic review to identify curricular and educational interventions to build competency among psychiatry residents and fellows in addiction psychiatry. Methods We followed the PRISMA guidelines, searching five databases from inception to August 2020 for relevant evaluation-type studies exploring addiction psychiatry competency among psychiatry residents and fellows. We appraised study quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute's risk of bias tool for observational designs. Results From 1600 records, 17 studies met inclusion criteria. Addiction psychiatry competencies spanned themes involving core knowledge development; attitudinal, communication and leadership skills; screening, assessment, diagnosis; management; and special populations. Examples of effective educational interventions to enhance addiction competency include specific modules for substance use disorders and integrated clinical rotations that simultaneously combine multiple types of skills. Lived experience improved trainee attitudes towards addiction psychiatry. Conclusions While there is current evidence supporting strategies for developing competency in addiction psychiatry, the lack of studies measuring sustained competence over a longer-term follow-up period and the absence of randomized controlled trials limit the overall strength of evidence in this review. Current psychiatry entrustable professional activities (EPAs) involving addiction only partly overlap with curriculum training guidelines and studies identified in this review.

To identify the CAP-associated genetic risk loci, we performed a meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed CAP (3310 individuals) with 2655 healthy controls. The findings revealed CYP1A1 variants (rs2606345, rs4646903, rs1048943) associated with pneumonia. We observed rs2606345 [G vs T; OR=1.49(1.29-1.69); p=0.0001; I2= 15.5%], and rs1048943 [T vs G; OR= 1.31(0.90-1.71); p=0.002; I2=19.3%] as risk markers and rs4646903 [T vs C; OR= 0.79(0.62-0.96); p=0.03; I2=0%] as a protective marker for susceptibility to CAP, when compared with healthy controls. Our meta-analysis showed the presence of CYP1A1 SNP alleles contributing significant risk toward pneumonia susceptibility. Interestingly, we observed a striking difference of allele frequency for rs2606345 (CYP1A1) among Europeans, Africans and Asians which may provide a possible link for observed variations in death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral pneumonia. We report, for the first time, a significant positive correlation for the risk allele (T or A) of rs2606345, with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate worldwide and within a genetically heterogeneous nation like India. Mechanistically, the risk allele 'A' (rs2606345) is associated with lower expression of CYP1A1 and presumably leads to reduced capacity for xenobiotic detoxification. We note that ambient air pollution, a powerful inducer of CYP1A1 gene expression, is globally associated with lower, not higher mortality, as would normally be predicted. In conclusion, we find that CYP1A1 alleles are associated with CAP mortality, presumably via altered xenobiotic metabolism. We speculate that gene-environment interactions governing CYP1A1 expression may influence COVID-19 mortality.","output":"Human genetic factors associated with pneumonia susceptibility, a cue for COVID-19 mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An increasing incidence of rhinoorbitocerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) among patients with COVID-19 has recently been reported in India.

In particular, people aware of a disease in their proximity can take measures to reduce their susceptibility. Even if no centralized information is provided about the presence of a disease, such awareness can arise through first-hand observation and word of mouth. To understand the effects this can have on the spread of a disease, we formulate and analyze a mathematical model for the spread of awareness in a host population, and then link this to an epidemiological model by having more informed hosts reduce their susceptibility. We find that, in a well-mixed population, this can result in a lower size of the outbreak, but does not affect the epidemic threshold. If, however, the behavioral response is treated as a local effect arising in the proximity of an outbreak, it can completely stop a disease from spreading, although only if the infection rate is below a threshold. We show that the impact of locally spreading awareness is amplified if the social network of potential infection events and the network over which individuals communicate overlap, especially so if the networks have a high level of clustering.

METHODS A collaborative effort over the past several years among the professional stakeholders has culminated in this consensus statement on networked care designed to integrate and support a specialist and non-specialist, urban and rural, anesthesia, surgery, and maternity work force into high-functioning networks based on the best available evidence. REPORT Surgical and maternity triage needs to be embedded within networks to address the tensions between sustainable regional programs and local access to care. Safety and quality must be demonstrated to be equivalent across similar patients and procedures, regardless of network site. Triage of patients across multiple sites is a quality outcome metric requiring continuous iterative scrutiny. Clinical coaching between rural and regional centres can be helpful in building and sustaining high-functioning networks. Maintenance of quality and the provision of continuing professional development in low-volume settings represent a mutual value proposition. CONCLUSION The trusting relationships that are foundational to successful networks are built through clinical coaching, continuing professional development, and quality improvement. Currently, a collaborative effort in British Columbia is delivering a provincial program-Rural Surgical Obstetrical Networks-built on the principles and supporting evidence described in this consensus statement.","output":"Consensus statement on networks for high-quality rural anesthesia, surgery, and obstetric care in Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, various studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as the doorknob that can be bound by the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which conduces to its entrance to the host cells, and plays an important role in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This paper aims to collect and sorts out the existing drugs, which exert the ability to block the binding of S protein and ACE2 so as to provide directions for the later drug development. By reviewing the existing literature, we expound the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of S protein and ACE2 binding, and summarize the drugs and compounds that can interfere with the interaction of spike protein and ACE2 receptor from different ways. We summarized five kinds of substances, including peptide P6, griffithsin, hr2p analogs, EK1, vaccine, monoclonal antibody, cholesterol-depleting agents, and extracts from traditional Chinese medicine. They can fight SARS-CoV-2 by specifically binding to ACE2 receptor, S protein, or blocking membrane fusion between the host and virus. ACE2 is the key point for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cells, and it is also the focus of drug intervention. Our drug summary on this pathomechanism is expected to provide ideas for the drug research on SARS-CoV-2 and help to develop anti-coronavirus drugs of broad spectrum for future epidemics.","output":"Drug screening and development from the affinity of S protein of new coronavirus with ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted the educational system not only in regard to teaching and learning, but also in relation to the other services and supports (mental health services, meal and nutrition programs, and so on) provided to students and families.

We report three KD-like cases that occurred during the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a highly affected area of Northern Italy. The clinical presentation was characterized by the presence of unremitting fever, diarrhea and elevated inflammatory markers. Case #1 and Case #2 occurred one week apart and shared other clinical features: laboratory tests confirmed COVID-19 exposure and high inflammatory activation with myocardial involvement. Case #3 followed a more typical pattern for KD. Interestingly, this patient showed lower levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimers, and ferritin compared to the other two cases, whereas platelet count was higher. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 might act in children as a trigger, either inducing a classical KD phenotype or causing a systemic inflammatory response leading to a severe KD-like phenotype, eventually characterized by myocardial impairment. We think that bringing these cases and their differences to the attention of the rheumatology community during the COVID-19 pandemic will be beneficial in order to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and to increase awareness of this new phenomenon.","output":"Children with Kawasaki disease or Kawasaki-like syndrome (MIS-C/PIMS) at the time of COVID-19: are they all the same?

In the current work, the effect of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria from different genera on the structural and functional characteristics of cells and the development of adenoviral infection in vitro was studied. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxicity of six EPSs of lactic acid bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus was determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. The influence of the EPSs on the infectivity of human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) and on the cell cycle under a condition of adenovirus infection was studied using plaque reduction assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Results: It was shown that exopolysaccharides were non-toxic to Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBK) as they reduced their viability by 3C17%. A change in the distribution of the cell cycle phases in the non-infected cell population treated with EPSs was observed. The analysis demonstrated an increase in the number of cells in the S phase by 47% when using EPSs 15a and a decrease in the number of cells in the G1 phase by 20C27% when treated with the EPSs 15a, 33a, and 19s. The use of EPSs did not led to the normalization of the life cycle of HAdV-5 infected cells to the level of non-infected cells. The EPSs showed low virucidal activity and reduced the HAdV-5 infectivity to 85%. Among the studied exopolysaccharides, anti-adenovirus activity was found for EPS 26a that is produced by Lactobacillus spp. strain. The treatment of cells with the EPS following virus adsorption completely (100%) suppressed the formation and release of HAdV-5 infectious. Conclusions: EPS 26a possessed distinct anti-HAdV-5 activity and the obtained data demonstrate the potential of using exopolysaccharides as anti-adenoviral agents.","output":"Antiviral Activity of Exopolysaccharides Produced by Lactic Acid Bacteria of the Genera Pediococcus, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus against Human Adenovirus Type 5"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forecasting the spread of COVID-19 infection is an important aspect of public health management.

Flax textiles uniquely combine hydrophilicity and strength, with the technical know-how to produce precisely engineered two- and three-dimensional knitted or woven structures.

It was hypothesized that the albumin coating will abolish the effect of adherent endotoxins at the flax's surface. In vitro cell viability assays showed that the flax mesh  albumin is not cytotoxic. The albumin coating reduced (but not abolished) the effect of surface-exposed endotoxins (Limulus amebocyte lysate test).

We hypothesized, following prohibition: there would be a significant change in the relative search volumes (RSV) of alcohol-related queries; that temporal analysis of the trends would reflect a public response to policy changes; and that geospatial analysis of RSV would correlate with the prevalence of alcohol use. METHODS: Three different search periods were used to test the hypotheses. The search inputs were based on potential public response to alcohol prohibition, as evidenced by the literature, newspaper articles, and consensus. We used RSV as the unit of analysis. Mean RSV of search queries, pre-post implementation of prohibition, were compared. Smoothing of scatter plots examined the temporal association of trends with policy measures. Multiple linear regression tested the relationship of state-wise RSV and alcohol use prevalence. RESULTS: Post-implementation of prohibition, a significant increase in the RSV was observed for searches related to alcohol withdrawal (p<0.001), how to extract alcohol from sanitizer (p = 0.002), alcohol home delivery online (p<0.001), alcohol home delivery (p<0.001), and sleeping pills (p = 0.006).

The crocin treatment significantly lowered the levels of liver enzymes in serum and improved the liver CYP2E1 mRNA levels. The pathological changes in the liver were also lowered by crocin treatment. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-kappa B, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor  and fibrogenic factor, transforming growth factor , and -smooth muscle actin were elevated by the CCl4 in the liver tissue. However, crocin treatment at different doses significantly reduced the expression of these factors. The increased caspase 3/7 activity was also lowered by crocin. CCl4 administration decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR-) in liver tissue. The improved PPAR- expression in the liver by crocin treatment indicates its role in the therapeutic effect of crocin. CONCLUSIONS Crocin attenuated the various events in the progression of liver fibrosis via PPAR- mediated modulation of inflammatory and fibrogenic pathways.","output":"Crocin attenuates CCl4-induced liver fibrosis via PPAR- mediated modulation of inflammation and fibrogenesis in rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, some cases of atypical pneumonia, at that time of unknown origin, were reported in Wuhan, China.

The solid-state perovskites are liquefied and recrystallized from CH3NH2. However, the mechanism of this phase transformation is far from clear. Employing first principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the formation energy of primary defects in perovskites and the liquefaction process in CH3NH2 vapor.

Two primary defects were studied: one is the Frenkel pair defect (including both negatively charged interstitial iodide ion (Ii -) and iodide vacancy (VI +) at the PbI2-termination surface, and the other is the Schottky defects (methylammonium vacancy, VMA) at the MAI-termination surface. Moreover, the defect-induced disorder in the microstructure reduces the degeneration of energy levels, which leads to a blue shift and broader absorption band gap, as compared to the clean perovskite surface.

T-SPOT.COVID and anti-N IgG serology tests were performed on blood from 186 subjects with NAAT-confirmed-SARS-CoV-2 infections and 100 control subjects. Results In the 2-8 week-period after NAAT-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the T-SPOT.COVID test detected 98.4% (63/64) of infected subjects; in comparison, anti-N IgG serology detected fewer in this time period (82.8%, 53/64). In the first 2 weeks after diagnosis, during activation of the adaptive immune response, there were fewer reactive T-SPOT.COVID responses (75.7%, 28/37) and many fewer seropositive responses (32.4%, 12/37). Response numbers tapered somewhat after 8 weeks, although T-SPOT.COVID test continued to detect most of the confirmed-infection subjects (83.6%, 56/67) and continued to out-perform serology (52.2%, 35/67). The possibility of T-SPOT.COVID responses due to cross-reactive T cells was ruled out by demonstrating that, of 44 control subjects with T cells responsive to four human common cold coronavirus peptides, only 1 was T-SPOT.COVID reactive.

We defined low Ct at a cut-point approximating a viral load of 4.6  10(6) copies per ml. Logistic regression tested the association of household exposure and symptoms at diagnosis with a low Ct value. RESULTS: Of 77 HCWs with COVID-19, 20 were household exposures cases and 34 were symptomatic at testing (7 were both household-exposed and symptomatic at testing).

We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is the presence of another 'flu'-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19, that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be tested.

We use the simulation framework to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location-Based Testing policy (LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases. Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT, gives performance that is comparable with CT.

The human ACE2 ((h)ACE2) protein is the crucial target for the SARS-CoV's Spike protein that allows the virus to adhere to host epithelial cells. X-ray crystal structures and biophysical properties of protein-protein interactions reveal a large interaction surface with high binding-affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and (h)ACE2 (18 interactions), at least 15-fold stronger than between SARS-CoV-1 and (h)ACE2 (eight interactions). This suggests that antibodies against CoV-1 infection might not be very efficient against CoV-2. Furthermore, interspecies comparisons indicate that ACE2 proteins of man and cat are far closer than dog, ferret, mouse, and rat with significant differences in binding-affinity between Spike and ACE2 proteins.

Acre had a mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) of 90.9 and a lethality rate of 1.9%, with the highest mortality rate observed in the municipality of Rio Branco (121.3/100,000 inhabitants) and lethality in Rodrigues Alves (2.9%). The incidence of COVID-19 in Acre was 4,759.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, the municipalities of Assis Brasil and Xapuri had the highest incidences in the state with 10273.7 and 9330.8 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. CONCLUSION: although the accumulated numbers of cases are different for the same day, the behavior is very similar, that is, the curves vary in the same way over time, regardless of the municipality observed.","output":"Evolution of COVID-19 during the epidemiological week 16 to 53 of 2020 in the state of Acre Western Amazonia, Brazil/ Evolu??o da COVID-19 da semana epidemiolgica 16 a 53 em um Estado da Amaz?nia Ocidental-Acre/Brasil em 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Communication campaigns using social media can raise public awareness; however, they are difficult to sustain. A barrier is the need to generate and constantly post novel but on-topic messages, which creates a resource-intensive bottleneck. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to harness the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to build a pilot system that can generate many candidate messages, which could be used for a campaign to suggest novel, on-topic candidate messages. The issue of folic acid, a B-vitamin that helps prevent major birth defects, serves as an example; however, the system can work with other issues that could benefit from higher levels of public awareness. METHODS: We used the Generative Pretrained Transformer-2 architecture, a machine learning model trained on a large natural language corpus, and fine-tuned it using a data set of autodownloaded tweets about #folicacid. The fine-tuned model was then used as a message engine, that is, to create new messages about this topic. We conducted a web-based study to gauge how human raters evaluate AI-generated tweet messages compared with original, human-crafted messages. RESULTS: We found that the Folic Acid Message Engine can easily create several hundreds of new messages that appear natural to humans. Web-based raters evaluated the clarity and quality of a human-curated sample of AI-generated messages as on par with human-generated ones. Overall, these results showed that it is feasible to use such a message engine to suggest messages for web-based campaigns that focus on promoting awareness. CONCLUSIONS: The message engine can serve as a starting point for more sophisticated AI-guided message creation systems for health communication. Beyond the practical potential of such systems for campaigns in the age of social media, they also hold great scientific potential for the quantitative analysis of message characteristics that promote successful communication. We discuss future developments and obvious ethical challenges that need to be addressed as AI technologies for health persuasion enter the stage.","output":"Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Health Message Generation: The Folic Acid Message Engine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have conducted a study of star formation in the outer Galaxy from 65\\\\degr$<l<$265\\\\degr~in the region observed by the GLIMPSE360 program.

It is unknown if this negative influence relies on the increased risk of AR or the DGF itself. The different Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) values may also play a role in this interaction. METHODS Retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of DGF on graft function and graft survival in a subset of KT recipients (2004-2017). We also analyzed the relationship between KDPI and DGF. RESULTS The study includes601 KT,226of them (37%) developed DGF. Graft survival was lower in patients with DGF compared with non-DGF patients. Multivariable analysis revealed DGF as risk factor for graft loss, independently of the presence or not of acute rejection. Between DGF patients we observed poorer graft survival in patients with higher KDPI value (>85%).We observed a trend of a greater impact of KDPI in patients with DGF, although this interaction was not statistically significant. Additionally, we observed poorer 12-month graft function in DGF patients. CONCLUSION DGF is related to poorer graft survival independently of the developed of acute rejection. This negative impact might be influenced by high KDPI values.","output":"Relevance of KDPI value and acute rejection on kidney transplant outcomes in recipients with delayed graft function- A retrospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Hyperglycemic crises (ie, diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [HHS]) are life-threatening acute complications of diabetes. Efforts to prevent these events at the population level have been hindered by scarce granular data and difficulty in identifying individuals at highest risk. OBJECTIVE: To assess sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors associated with hyperglycemic crises in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in the US from 2014 to 2020. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed administrative claims and laboratory results for adults (aged 18 years) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of emergency department or hospital visits with a primary diagnosis of DKA or HHS (adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and region, and for year when calculating annualized rates) were calculated separately for patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. The associations of sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, and income), clinical factors (comorbidities), and treatment factors (glucose-lowering medications, hemoglobin A(1c)) with DKA or HHS in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were assessed using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Among 20 156 adults with type 1 diabetes (mean [SD] age, 46.6 [16.5] years; 51.2% male; 72.6% White race/ethnicity) and 796 382 with type 2 diabetes (mean [SD] age, 65.6 [11.8] years; 50.3% female; 54.4% White race/ethnicity), adjusted rates of hyperglycemic crises were 52.69 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 48.26-57.12 per 1000 person-years) for type 1 diabetes and 4.04 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 3.88-4.21 per 1000 person-years) for type 2 diabetes. In both groups, factors associated with the greatest hyperglycemic crisis risk were low income ($200 000 vs <$40 000: type 1 diabetes incidence risk ratio [IRR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.46-0.81]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.56-0.86]), Black race/ethnicity (vs White race/ethnicity: type 1 diabetes IRR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.01-1.74]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.09-1.27]), high hemoglobin A(1c) level (10% vs 6.5%-6.9%: type 1 diabetes IRR, 7.81 [95% CI, 5.78-10.54]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 7.06 [95% CI, 6.26-7.96]), history of hyperglycemic crises (type 1 diabetes IRR, 7.88 [95% CI, 6.06-9.99]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 17.51 [95% CI, 15.07-20.34]), severe hypoglycemia (type 1 diabetes IRR, 2.77 [95% CI, 2.15-3.56]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 4.18 [95% CI, 3.58-4.87]), depression (type 1 diabetes IRR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.37-1.92]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.34-1.59]), neuropathy (type 1 diabetes IRR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.39-1.93]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.17-1.34]), and nephropathy (type 1 diabetes IRR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.01-1.48]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.14-1.33]). Age had a U-shaped association with hyperglycemic crisis risk in patients with type 1 diabetes (compared with patients aged 18-44 years: 45-64 years IRR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59-0.87]; 65-74 years IRR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-0.80]; 75 years IRR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.66-1.38]). In type 2 diabetes, risk of hyperglycemic crises decreased progressively with age (45-64 years IRR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.51-0.63]; 65-74 years IRR, 0.44 [95% CI, .39-0.49]; 75 years IRR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.36-0.47]). In patients with type 2 diabetes, higher risk was associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor therapy (IRR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14-1.49) and insulin dependency (compared with regimens with bolus insulin: regimens with basal insulin only, IRR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.63-0.75]; and without any insulin, IRR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.33-0.40]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, younger age, Black race/ethnicity, low income, and poor glycemic control were associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemic crises. The findings suggest that multidisciplinary interventions focusing on groups at high risk for hyperglycemic crises are needed to prevent these dangerous events.","output":"Sociodemographic, Clinical, and Treatment-Related Factors Associated With Hyperglycemic Crises Among Adults With Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes in the US From 2014 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: young adults represent a critical target for mass-vaccination strategies of COVID-19 that aim to achieve herd immunity. Healthcare students, including dental students, are perceived as the upper echelon of health literacy; therefore, their health-related beliefs, attitudes and behaviors influence their peers and communities. The main aim of this study was to synthesize a data-driven model for the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine willingness among dental students. Methods: a secondary analysis of data extracted from a recently conducted multi-center and multi-national cross-sectional study of dental students attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination in 22 countries was carried out utilizing decision tree and regression analyses. Based on previous literature, a proposed conceptual model was developed and tested through a machine learning approach to elicit factors related to dental students willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: machine learning analysis suggested five important predictors of COVID-19 vaccination willingness among dental students globally, i.e., the economic level of the country where the student lives and studies, the individuals trust of the pharmaceutical industry, the individuals misconception of natural immunity, the individuals belief of vaccines risk-benefit-ratio, and the individuals attitudes toward novel vaccines. Conclusions: according to the socio-ecological theory, the countrys economic level was the only contextual predictor, while the rest were individual predictors. Future research is recommended to be designed in a longitudinal fashion to facilitate evaluating the proposed model. The interventions of controlling vaccine hesitancy among the youth population may benefit from improving their views of the risk-benefit ratio of COVID-19 vaccines.

We further show that ctDNA dynamics after a single infusion can aid in identification of patients who will achieve DCB. Integrating these determinants, we developed and validated an entirely noninvasive multiparameter assay (DIREct-On, Durable Immunotherapy Response Estimation by immune profiling and ctDNA-On-treatment) that robustly predicts which patients will achieve DCB with higher accuracy than any individual feature.

This has particularly been the case during COVID-19, when traditional methods of recruitment have not been able to be used. Despite this, there is limited evidence on the feasibility of social media for recruiting a national sample. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the use of social media as a tool for recruiting a national sample of adults to an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between August - October 2020, participants were recruited through Facebook via two advertisement campaigns into an online survey exploring the relationship between social determinants of health and wellbeing of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analysed using SPSS version 25 and Facebook metrics auto generated in the Facebook Ads Manager. Post stratification weights were calculated to match the Australian population on the basis of gender, age and state or territory based on 2016 Australian census data. RESULTS: In total, 9594 people were reached nationally with the paid option and potentially 902000 people through the no cost option resulting in 1211 online survey responses. The total cost of the advertisement campaign was $649.66, resulting in an overall cost per click of $0.25 AUD.

Numerous pharmacological strategies have attempted to prevent fibrosis but have attained limited efficacy with some detrimental side effects. While stem cell treatments have provided more encouraging results, they have exhibited high variability and have not always improved tissue function. To enhance stem cell efficacy, we evaluated whether mechanical memory could direct cell response. We hypothesized that mechanically pre-conditioning on a soft matrix (soft priming) will delay adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) transition to a pro-fibrotic phenotype, expanding their regenerative potential, and improving healing in a complex tissue environment. Primary ASCs isolated from rat and human subcutaneous fat exhibited mechanical memory, demonstrated by a delayed cell response to stiffness following two weeks of soft priming including decreased cell area, actin coherency, and extracellular matrix production compared to cells on stiff substrates. Soft primed ASCs injected into our rat model of post-traumatic elbow contracture decreased histological evidence of anterior capsule fibrosis and increased elbow range-of-motion when evaluated by joint mechanics. These findings suggest that exploiting mechanical memory by strategically controlling the culture environment during cell expansion may improve the efficacy of stem cell-based therapies targeting fibrosis.","output":"Adipose stem cells exhibit mechanical memory and reduce fibrotic contracture in a rat elbow injury model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the pandemic, the Government of Bangladesh decided to keep the banks open to a limited extent to keep the countrys economy afloat.

Nutrition was not a priority in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the beginning of the pandemic with the need for simplified protocols. We aimed to assess the impact of a simplified nutritional protocol for critically ill COVID-19 patients during the pandemic first wave. METHODS: We included all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, admitted to the ICU of the Geneva University Hospitals for at least 4 days from March 9 to May 19, 2020. Data on the route and solution of nutritional therapy, prescribed and received volume, calorie and protein intake, amount of insulin, propofol and glucose administered were collected daily during the entire ICU stay. We compared nutritional outcomes between patients admitted to the ICU before and after implementing the simplified nutritional protocol using unpaired t-test. RESULTS: Out of 119 patients, 48 were hospitalized in the ICU before, 47 across and 24 after the implementation of the nutritional protocol. The mean age was 63.2 (12.7) years and 76% were men without significant difference between before and after group. The nutritional protocol implementation led to an increase in caloric intake (1070 vs. 1357 kcal/day, p = 0.018) and in the percentage of days within 80C100% of the energy target (11 vs. 20%, p = 0.021).

Public transport design and services are closely related to the physical size of modern cities, the number of people living or working in them, and the distribution and organization of work and social activities. However, public transport has been restricted with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, since March 2020. Public transport demand collapsed, especially during the lockdown period (March-May 2020), and adverse effects were reported even in the subsequent periods. In fact, the social distancing restrictions have highlighted numerous problems with public transport systems worldwide, primarily due to two factors. The first is related to the spread of the virus via the respiratory route, which is more likely to infect in restricted areas, and the second is associated with a transport system that by definition has high occupancy rates and low spacing throughout the journey (e.g., the positioning of seats or standing places in a train or bus). Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted the travel choices of users. The pandemic has also negatively affected the psychological state, generating specific problems of anxiety, fear, or stress among all population groups, even when choosing the means of transport to travel with. Given the emerging pandemic challenges, the present study examines the public transport demand characteristics during the various phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sicily, one of the most affected regions in Italy. The study investigates the mental state of a population sample that frequently used the local urban or regional public transport to travel to work before and during the pandemic phases in the Sicilian territory. Through the administration of an online survey, it was possible to collect sociodemographic and psychological data to understand the propensity to use public transport. A series of inferential statistical tests were applied to assess the correlation of psychological aspects (i.e., fear, anxiety, and stress) with socio-demographic variables and modal choice habits (trip frequency). Results highlight and evaluate each psychological issue among population groups and their relative role in shaping public transport-related preferences. The study highlights some proposals and their implementation strategies to prevent negative emotions and encourage public transport use in Sicily and generally. ? 2021 Palacky University Olomouc.

In Slovenia, private forest owners have the opportunity to cooperate in machinery rings (an organised form of neighbourhood assistance as an association of farmers and private forest owners) to solve forest management related problems and more efficiently use of mechanization. The aim of this study is to determine the readiness of private forest owner to perform forest management services within machinery rings and to understand how property characteristics, forest management activities and owners socio-demographic characteristics influence their decisions. In 2020, a survey of machinery rings members (n = 438) was conducted in which 24 machinery rings participated, representing 64,9% of the total number of machinery rings currently operating in Slovenia. The results show that only 18,3% of the machinery ring member perform forest management services within the machinery ring. A random utility model results showed that the readiness of private forest owners to perform forest management services within a machinery ring is influenced by forest property size and owners age. To motivate private forest owners to perform a forest management activity within a machinery ring more frequently, it is important to identify the profile of owners ready to perform services and provide a mix of innovative and supportive policy instruments to achieve the desired forest policy outcomes.","output":"Factors Influencing Private Forest Owners Readiness to Perform Forest Management Services Within a Machinery Ring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Up to 75% of hip fracture patients never recover to their pre-fracture functional status. Supervised exercise that includes strength training can improve functional recovery after hip fracture. The role of testosterone replacement for augmenting the effects of exercise in older women after hip fracture is unknown. METHODS The Starting Testosterone and Exercise after Hip Injury (STEP-HI) Study is a 6-month Phase 3 multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to compare supervised exercise (EX) plus 1% testosterone topical gel, with EX plus placebo gel, and with enhanced usual care (EUC). Female hip fracture patients age  65 years are being recruited from clinical centers across the United States. Participants are community dwelling and enrolled within 24 weeks after surgical repair of the fracture. The EX intervention is a center-based program of progressive resistance training. The EUC group receives a home exercise program and health education. Participants receive dietary counseling, calcium and vitamin D. The primary outcome is the Six Minute Walk Distance. Secondary outcomes include physical performance measures, self-reported function and quality of life, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry measures of body composition and bone mineral density.

Fever is seen in most cases of COVID-19, at least at the initial stages of illness. Although fever is typically treated (with antipyretics or directly with ice or other mechanical means), increasing data suggest that fever is a protective adaptive response that facilitates recovery from infectious illness. OBJECTIVE: To describe a randomized controlled pilot study of core warming patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This prospective single-site randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 20 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care or to receive core warming via an esophageal heat exchanger commonly utilized in critical care and surgical patients. The primary outcome is patient viral load measured by lower respiratory tract sample. Secondary outcomes include severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio) 24, 48, and 72 hours after initiation of treatment, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Resulting data will provide effect size estimates to guide a definitive multi-center randomized clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT04426344.

Shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds required many patients to be treated outside the ICU despite severe gas exchange impairment. Helmet is an effective interface to provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) noninvasively. We report data about the usefulness of helmet CPAP during pandemic, either as treatment, a bridge to intubation or a rescue therapy for patients with care limitations (DNI). METHODS: In this observational study we collected data regarding patients failing standard oxygen therapy (i.e., non-rebreathing mask) due to COVID-19 pneumonia treated with a free flow helmet CPAP system. Patients data were recorded before, at initiation of CPAP treatment and once a day, thereafter. CPAP failure was defined as a composite outcome of intubation or death. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included; 42% were deemed as DNI. Helmet CPAP treatment was successful in 69% of the full treatment and 28% of the DNI patients (P < 0.001). With helmet CPAP, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio doubled from about 100 to 200 mmHg (P < 0.001); respiratory rate decreased from 28 [22C32] to 24 [20C29] breaths per minute, P < 0.001). C-reactive protein, time to oxygen mask failure, age, PaO(2)/FiO(2) during CPAP, number of comorbidities were independently associated with CPAP failure. Helmet CPAP was maintained for 6 [3C9] days, almost continuously during the first two days. None of the full treatment patients died before intubation in the wards. CONCLUSIONS: Helmet CPAP treatment is feasible for several days outside the ICU, despite persistent impairment in gas exchange. It was used, without escalating to intubation, in the majority of full treatment patients after standard oxygen therapy failed.

Telemedicine has the potential to allow the facilitation of providing the necessary medical care to patients without exposing them to contact with other patients or the general population. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the utilization of telemedicine by the Lebanese physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional online study was conducted using LimeSurvey? through an e-mail-based questionnaire sent to physicians currently enrolled in both Beirut and Tripoli Lebanese Order of Physicians. Results: Four hundred one physicians completed the survey resulting in a response rate of 5.85%. Most of the respondents (N = 401, 75.8%) reported using telemedicine to provide health care services to patients without in-person visits during the pandemic. Among those using telemedicine (N = 304), around 40% reported that they started using it during COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: Literature states that the average time of an in-person clinic consultation is more than 15 min. This implies that telemedicine can play a role in saving physicians' time; this conclusion is supported by other studies that consider telemedicine a time-saving method of providing health care services. Conclusions: Our study indicated that telemedicine is used by the majority of Lebanese physicians and that this use has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Current Centers for Disease Control statistics indicate that Black Americans die from COVID-19 at a disproportionately high rate, 13.6% of 449, 373 deaths but only account for 12.54% of the United States Population (CDC COVID Data Tracker accessed 5/5/2021). A voluntary clinical reported registry of COVID-19 infections in patients with SCD reported both high hospitalization rates (69%) and case fatality rates (7%) (Panepinto, 2020), but only reported data from March 20-May 21, 2020. A retrospective cohort review from England demonstrated a 4-fold increased risk of hospitalization and 2.6-fold increased risk of death due to COVID-19 for those patients with sickle cell disease compared to the general population (Hippisley-Cox, 2021). The unique constellation of SCD manifestations complicate both the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, particularly related to anticoagulation and transfusion practices. Understanding the impact of early exchange and anticoagulation would guide development of appropriate treatment guidelines and future understanding of pathophysiology. We report on the outcomes for all hospitalized inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 and SCD at institutions using Cerner electronic health record (EHR). Methods Exempted retrospective review approved by ChristianaCare IRB. We obtained deidentified data from the Cerner COVID Data Lab which includes information on all hospitalized inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 and sickle cell disease as documented by ICD 10 D57.XX from 12/10/2019-10/15/2020 at institutions that use the Cerner EHR. Those with sickle cell trait excluded. The data included 209 patients; 1 patient had separate 2 visits, only the first visit in the data. Evaluated anticoagulation use, not dose. Descriptive statistics are given: percentages for categorical variables and mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables. Comparisons between patients who died or went to hospice versus patients who recovered were done using unadjusted chi-squared tests or t-tests. Results: Admission: 124 (74.3%) were afebrile (temp <100) 52 (28.4%) were tachypneic (RR >22) 10 (6.2%) were hypoxic (<92%) 7 (3.3%) were intubated during hospitalization Many patients had comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, but it was not clear if patients had multiple co-morbidities. Treatment: 16 (7.7%) got transfused RBC between 1.77 and 589.18 hours into admission 5 (2.4%) got Remdesivir, none of these patients died/went to hospice. No exchange transfusions, but maybe wasn't captured in coding data 149 (71.3%) received anticoagulant, dosing unable to be obtained so not known if this was prophylactic or treatment dosing. Outcomes: 158 (80.2%) discharged home 18 (9.1%) discharged facility 8 (4.1%) died 2 (1.0%) discharged hospice 11 (5.6%) left against medical advice 12 (5.7%) missing disposition data Those who died/went to hospice had longer hospital stays, were more likely to be hypoxic and initially tachypneic. None of these patients received remdesivir. Study included small numbers but those who died more likely to have hypertension, diabetes w/ and w/out complications, CHF. Discussion This data only included hospitalized patients, doesn't account for patients who remained outpatient so case fatality rate likely lower. 10/209 patients died- 4.8% fatality rate, 12 patients missing final discharge disposition. 18 went to facility, may have died as outpatient. Only a small number of patients received remdesivir and there were overall low rates of anticoagulation, concerning given SCD is a hypercoagulable state. Study limitations include only hospitalized patients in the dataset and only draws from Cerner EMR institutions, a 26% market share. Based on our own SCD population, only a small percentage of patients with SCD and COVID-19 hospitalized. Additionally, there is likely significant variability between institutions' treatment protocols, particularly in the early months of the data set.

This substudy examined the differences in psychological well-being between rural and metropolitan health care workers (HCWs). DESIGN: A nationwide survey conducted between August and October 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Australian HCWs were recruited through multiple strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics, mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and burnout). RESULTS: Complete responses were included from 7846 participants, with 1473 (18.8%) in regional or remote ('rural') areas and 81.2% in metropolitan areas. Rural participants were older, more likely to work in allied health, nursing or in health administration, and had worked longer in their profession than metropolitan participants. Levels of resilience were similar (p = 0.132), but there was significantly higher prevalence of pre-COVID-19 pandemic mental illness in the rural workforce (p < 0.001). There were high levels of current mental health issues: moderate-severe PTSD (rural 38.0%; metropolitan 41.0% p = 0.031); high depersonalisation (rural 18.1%; metropolitan 20.7% p = 0.047); and high emotional exhaustion (rural 46.5%; metropolitan 43.3% p = 0.002). Among rural participants, mental health symptoms were associated with younger age, worry about being blamed if they contracted COVID-19, fear of transmitting COVID-19 to their family, experiencing worsening relationships and working in primary care or allied health. CONCLUSION: Despite having low COVID-19 case numbers in rural Australian health services compared with metropolitan counterparts over the course of 2020, there were widespread mental health impacts on the workforce.

METHODS The study included 22 pregnant women who were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group (GT) consisted of 11 participants and the control group (GC) also consisted of 11 participants. Participants were recruited from the Hospital Universitario Clnico San Cecilio in the province of Granada (Spain), where the weekly cognitive behavioral intervention was also carried out, which was implemented between January 22 and March 11, 2020. They used the assessment instruments: Pregnancy Distress Questionnaire (PDQ), Perceived Stress Scale (EEP-14), Inventory of Vulnerability to Stress (IVE) and Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). A mixed ANOVA of repeated measures 2*2 was performed, with the variable between groups having two levels (CG and GT), and the within-subject having two time periods (pre and post).

Therefore, this study seeks (1) to develop a conceptual framework that would be helpful in the given context, and (2) to test the feasibility of the proposed approach. The framework is conceptualized based on investigating critical dimensions and indicators for the successful design of a method for evaluating the performance of health systems. Subsequently, the taxonomic measure of development is used and a correlational analysis made in order to run a pilot test of the proposed concept. The finalized conceptual framework has five input dimensions (demographical burden, epidemiological burden, health-related quality of life, financial resources, and access) described by 18 indicators, and two output domains (outcomes, productivity) described by six indicators to monitor system performance under the COVID-19 pandemic. The pilot-test conducted in European Union countries and the United States proved the model to be useful and feasible. The proposed framework can be used to assess the performance of health systems fighting novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, worldwide. Our methodological approach can be used as a benchmark for international agencies such as the World Health Organization in developing their own frameworks. The paper presents the first research exploring the evaluation of a health system during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has the potential to help monitor a health systems performance during the pandemic by accounting for specific country-related circumstances.

Methods: A recently developed PBPK model was employed. Nine virtual patients (i.e. individualized PBPK models) were used to perform simulations of pharmacokinetics for different combinations of perfusion (0.001-0.1 mL/g/min) and receptor density (1-100 nmol/L). The TCP for each combination was determined for three different treatment strategies: 1) for a standard treatment (4 cycles of 7.4 GBq and 105 nmol), 2) maximizing the number of cycles based on BEDmax for red marrow and kidneys and 3) for 4 cycles with optimized ligand amount and activity. The red marrow and the kidneys (BEDmax of 2 Gy15 and 40 Gy2.5, respectively) were assumed to be OARs. Additionally, the influence of varying glomerular filtration rates, kidney somatostatin receptor densities, tumor volumes and release rates was investigated. Results: To achieve a TCP 99% in the standard treatment, a minimal tumor perfusion of 0.0360.023 mL/g/min and receptor density of 3420 nmol/L were determined for the nine virtual patients. With the optimization of the number of cycles, the minimum values of perfusion and receptor density were considerably lower with 0.0220.012 mL/g/min and 2111 nmol/L, respectively. However, even better results (perfusion = 0.0180.009 mL/g/min and receptor density = 1810 nmol/L) were obtained for strategy 3. The release rate of 177Lu (or labelled metabolites) from the cells had the strongest effect on the minimal perfusion and receptor density for standard and optimized treatments. Conclusion: PBPK modeling and simulations represent an elegant approach to individually determine the minimal tumor perfusion and minimal receptor density required to achieve an adequate TCP. This computational method can be employed in the radiopharmaceutical development process for ligand and target selection for specific types of tumors. In addition, this method could be used to optimize clinical trials.","output":"Effect of tumor perfusion and receptor density on tumor control probability in 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy: An in silico analysis for standard and optimized treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Introduction.

Lack of adequate treatment and preventive measures against LASV resulted in a high mortality rate in its endemic regions. In this study, a multi-epitope vaccine was designed using immunoinformatics as a prophylactic agent against the virus. Following a rigorous assessment, the vaccine was built using T-cell (N(CTL) = 8 and N(HTL) = 6) and B-cell (N(LBL) = 4) epitopes from each LASV-derived protein in addition with suitable linkers and adjuvant. The physicochemistry, immunogenic potency and safeness of the designed vaccine (~ 68 kDa) were assessed. In addition, chosen CTL and HTL epitopes of our vaccine showed 97.37% worldwide population coverage. Besides, disulphide engineering also improved the stability of the chimeric vaccine. Molecular docking of our vaccine protein with toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) showed binding efficiency followed by dynamics simulation for stable interaction. Furthermore, higher levels of cell-mediated immunity and rapid antigen clearance were suggested by immune simulation and repeated-exposure simulation, respectively. Finally, the optimized codons were used in in silico cloning to ensure higher expression within E. coli K12 bacterium.

To avoid bit errors in data transmission, low density parity check (LDPC) codes are widely recognized as efficient ways for navigation communication. Conventionally, the LDPC decoding is applied for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and degrades severely while facing the impulsive noise. However, navigation communication often suffers from impulsive interference due to the occurrence of high amplitude spikes. At this time, the conventional Gaussian noise assumption is inadequate. The impulsive component of interference has been found to be significant which influences the reliability of transmitted information. Therefore the LDPC decoding algorithms for AWGN channel are not suitable for impulsive noise environments. Consider that LDPC codes over GF(q) perform better than binary LDPC in resisting burst errors for current navigation system, it is necessary to conduct research on LDPC codes over GF(q). In this paper, an optimized initialization by calculating posterior probabilities of received symbols is proposed for non-binary LDPC decoding on additive white Class A noise (AWAN) channel. To verify the performance of the proposed initialization, extensive experiments are performed in terms of convergence, validity, and robustness. Preliminary results demonstrate that the decoding algorithm with the optimized initialization for non-binary LDPC codes performs better than the competing methods and that of binary LDPC codes on AWAN channel.","output":"An optimized initialization for LDPC decoding over GF(q) in impulsive noise environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The CMO of a large rural health care system reflects on Covid-19s impact in her region, including delayed preventive care and lost hospital revenues, and the urgency of finding sensible solutions to living with a long-lasting pandemic.","output":"Letter from South Dakota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study surveyed 227 returned labor migrants in four districts of western Odisha to comprehensively analyze the socio-economic vulnerabilities faced by internal returnee labor migrants caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in India.

Objective To characterize the risk and degree of QT prolongation in patients with COVID-19 in association with their use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a cohort study performed at an academic tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients hospitalized with at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine from March 1, 2020, through April 7, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Change in QT interval after receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; occurrence of other potential adverse drug events. Results Among 90 patients given hydroxychloroquine, 53 received concomitant azithromycin; 44 (48.9%) were female, and the mean (SD) body mass index was 31.5 (6.6). Hypertension (in 48 patients [53.3%]) and diabetes mellitus (in 26 patients [28.9%]) were the most common comorbid conditions. The overall median (interquartile range) baseline QTc was 455 (430-474) milliseconds (hydroxychloroquine, 473 [454-487] milliseconds vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 442 [427-461] milliseconds; P < .001). Those receiving concomitant azithromycin had a greater median (interquartile range) change in QT interval (23 [10-40] milliseconds) compared with those receiving hydroxychloroquine alone (5.5 [-15.5 to 34.25] milliseconds; P = .03). Seven patients (19%) who received hydroxychloroquine monotherapy developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients (3%) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13 %) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03-11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75-28.87]). Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc. Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.","output":"Risk of QT Interval Prolongation Associated With Use of Hydroxychloroquine With or Without Concomitant Azithromycin Among Hospitalized Patients Testing Positive for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with leukopenia and uncontrolled inflammatory response in critically ill patients.

Our brief critical discussion is focused on the multiple roles of the NO signaling pathways in the maintenance of basal physiological states of readiness in diverse cell types mediating innate immunological functions and in the facilitation of proinflammatory-mediated adaptive immunological responses associated with viral infections. Prior studies have reinforced the critical importance of constitutive NO signaling pathways in the homeostatic maintenance of the vascular endothelium, and state-dependent changes in innate immunological responses have been associated with a functional override of NO-mediated inhibitory tone. Accordingly, convergent lines of evidence suggest that dysregulation of NO signaling pathways, as well as canonical oxidative effects of inducible NO, may provide a permissive cellular environment for viral entry and replication. In immunologically compromised individuals, functional override and chronic rundown of inhibitory NO signaling systems promote aberrant expression of unregulated proinflammatory pathways resulting in widespread metabolic insufficiencies and structural damage to autonomous cellular and organ structures. We contend that restoration of normative NO tone via combined pharmaceutical, dietary, or complex behavioral interventions may partially reverse deleterious physiological conditions brought about by viral infection linked to unregulated adaptive immune responses.","output":"Potential Immunoregulatory and Antiviral/SARS-CoV-2 Activities of Nitric Oxide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, patients of atypical pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Subsequently, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen which was named SARS-CoV-2. As of 12 February 2020, more than 44 000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in China and continue to expand. Provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China have launched first-level response to major public health emergencies one after another from 23 January 2020, which means restricting movement of people among provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between the migration scale index and the number of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and to depict the effect of restricting population movement. In this study, Excel 2010 was used to demonstrate the temporal distribution at the day level and SPSS 23.0 was used to analyse the correlation between the migration scale index and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. We found that since 23 January 2020, Wuhan migration scale index has dropped significantly and since 26 January 2020, Hubei province migration scale index has dropped significantly. New confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Wuhan gradually increased since 24 January 2020, and showed a downward trend from 6 February 2020. New confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Hubei province gradually increased since 24 January 2020, and maintained at a high level from 24 January 2020 to 4 February 2020, then showed a downward trend. Wuhan migration scale index from 9 January to 22 January, 10 January to 23 January and 11 January to 24 January was correlated with the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Wuhan from 22 January to 4 February. Hubei province migration scale index from 10 January to 23 January and 11 January to 24 January was correlated with the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Hubei province from 22 January to 4 February. Our findings suggested that people who left Wuhan from 9 January to 22 January, and those who left Hubei province from 10 January to 24 January, led to the outbreak in the rest of China.

Existing resilience metrics require detailed knowledge of the system and potential disruptions, which is not available in the early design stage. The lack of quantitative tools to guide the early stages of design for resilience, forces engineers to rely on heuristics (use physical redundancy, localized capacity, etc.). This research asserts that the required quantitative guidelines can be developed using the architecting principles of biological ecosystems, which maintain a unique balance between pathway redundancy and efficiency, enabling them to be both productive under normal circumstances and survive disruptions. Ecologists quantify this network characteristic using the ecological fitness function. This paper presents the required reformulation required to enable the use of this metric in the design and analysis of resource and infrastructure networks with multiple distinct, but interdependent, interactions.

Quantifying which studies have a greatest impact can help researchers and policymakers in controlling the epidemic. The aim of this study is to describe the early scientific production in response to the COVID-19 epidemic through a scientometric analysis. METHODS: The study consisted of: 1) review of the scientific literature produced in the 30 days since the first paper related to COVID-19 has been published on Pubmed; 2) Identification of papers' Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and analysis of related metrics with the construction of a 'Computed Impact Score' (CIS) that represents a unifying score over heterogeneous bibliometric indicators. The CIS takes into account all the bibliometric indicators both traditional (i.e. counting of citations) and alternative (i.e. altmetrics). In this study we use the altmetrics provided by Plum Analytics (PlumX). All bibliometric indicators for the selected papers have been collected by using their corresponding DOIs as the key for querying Scopus API, which integrates PlumX. On top of those indicators we compute the CIS. The papers with higher CIS are discussed and presented. RESULTS: 239 papers have been included in the study. A threshold for CIS of t = 1.04 (i.e.95% quantile) allowed us to record 8 papers as potentially impactful. The 8 papers are: 6 case reports, 1 methodological study, 1 editorial. First authors come from China (n = 6), USA (n = 1) and Germany (n = 1). The main topics are: case/s description (n = 5), outbreak investigation (n = 2) and 1 genomic study. CONCLUSIONS: The early response of the scientific literature during an epidemic does not follow a pre-established pattern. Tracing the traditional and non-traditional metrics measures of papers can help to understand and evaluate the impact of literature on the scientific community and general population.

Given the potential higher COVID-19 severity in lung recipients, the Agence de la biomedecine has limited the transplant program to patients with high-urgency status during the first epidemic wave. The program has been fully restored where possible during the second epidemic wave. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on lung recipient mortality in France. Methods All lung recipients with COVID-19 reported in the French national registry CRISTAL between February 1st and September 30th 2020 were included in the study. Patient characteristics were extracted from CRISTAL. Cumulative number of cases by month since February (Figure 1) and case fatality rate (CFR) were calculated. Mortality rates from February to September in the whole 2019 and 2020 recipient cohorts were compared. Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Results Of the 46 patients (median age (IQR) 51 years (39-60), 54% female, median time from transplantation 3.5 years (0.8-7.1)) 88% required hospitalization including 21% in ICU.

Here, we explore in detail the electrostatic interaction between the surface of a single charged electret fibre and a model of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics coupled to a detailed spike protein charge regulation model, we show how pH and salt concentration drastically change both the scale and the sign of the interaction. Furthermore, the configuration of the few spike proteins closest to the electret fibre turns out to be as important for the strength of the interaction as their total number on the virus, a direct consequence of spike protein charge regulation.

Blood of these animals is collected at the slaughterhouse, treated with an anticoagulant, chilled and transported to industrial facilities in which blood is centrifuged to separate the red blood cells from the plasma fraction. Plasma is then concentrated, and spray dried at high temperatures (80 C throughout its substance) to convert it in a powder. Such method preserves the biological activity of its proteins, mainly albumins and globulins. SDP is mainly used in pig feed diets to significantly improve daily gain, feed intake, production efficiency, and to reduce post-weaning lag caused by the appearance of post-weaning diarrhea. Although SDP is considered a safe product and its manufacturing process consists of several biosafety steps, the security of the SDP is often questioned due to its nature as raw blood by-product, especially when emergent or re-emergent pathogens appear. This review provides an evaluation and validation of the different safety steps present in the manufacturing process of SDP, with special focus on a new redundant pathogen inactivation step, the UV-C irradiation, that may be implemented in the manufacturing process of the SDP. Overall results showed that the manufacturing process of SDP is safe and the UV-C radiation was effective in inactivating a wide range of bacteria and viruses spiked and naturally present in commercially collected liquid animal plasma and it can be implemented as a redundant biosafety step in the manufacturing process of the SDP.","output":"Biosafety steps in the manufacturing process of spray-dried plasma: a review with emphasis on the use of ultraviolet irradiation as a redundant biosafety procedure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to describe the spatial distribution of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Rio de Janeiro METHODS: this was an ecological study of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths between March 6thand April 10th, 2020 Incidence, mortality, lethality, excess risk and global and local Moran rates were calculated RESULTS: 1,808 confirmed cases and 92 confirmed deaths were recorded The COVID-19 incidence rate was 26 8/100,000 inhab , the mortality rate was 1 36/100,000 inhab and lethality rate 5% The incidence rate in eight neighborhoods was 4-12 times higher than the overall rate for the municipality: Jo, in the city's Western Zone;Cosme Velho, Gvea, Ipanema, Jardim Botanico, Lagoa, Leblon and S?o Conrado, in its Southern Zone CONCLUSION: high risk of COVID-19 infection and deaths was found in neighborhoods in the Southern Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro Neighborhoods in the Northern Zone of the city also stand out in relation to high risk of death","output":"COVID-19 in the city of Rio de Janeiro: spatial analysis of first confirmed cases and deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is spreading worldwide, and has been declared as an international public health concern.

COVID-19 specific EMS telephone triage tools have been introduced to help manage demand. There has been no previous evaluation of the accuracy of EMS telephone triage in identifying patients with suspected COVID-19 at risk of serious adverse outcome. We aimed to assess accuracy of EMS telephone triage in identifying patients who need an EMS response and identify factors which affect triage accuracy. MethodPatients who made an emergency call to Yorkshire Ambulance Service between 2nd April and 29th June 2020 and were assessed using an AMPDS pandemic pathway for suspected COVID-19 were linked to Office for National Statistics death registration data, hospital and general practice electronic health care data collected by NHS Digital. Accuracy of decision to dispatch an ambulance was assessed in terms of death or need for organ support at 30 days from the first 999 call. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with false negative and false positive triage. ResultsOf 12, 653 callers included in the study population, 11.1% experienced the primary composite adverse outcome. Using the triage pathway, 16% of callers did not receive an emergency response and they had a lower risk (3.5%) of the primary outcome. Ambulances were dispatched to 4, 230 callers (33.4%) who were not subsequently conveyed to hospital and did not experience the primary outcome (false positive triage). Multivariable modelling found older age and presence of pre-existing respiratory disease were significant predictors of false positive triage. ConclusionEMS telephone triage avoided 16% of calls receiving an emergency ambulance, of whom 3.5% died or needed organ support by 30 days. Telephone triage can therefore reduce the burden of EMS responses but with the cost of a small proportion of patients who do not receive an initial emergency response deteriorating.

DESIGN: Participants (N = 174;Mage = 21.94, SD = 3.24; 62% Hispanic, 79% women) were recruited from a large public university in Southern California and completed measures at two timepoints over a three-month period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants self-reported COVID-19 risk, fear, preventive behaviors, and perceived effectiveness. RESULTS: Asymptotic moderated mediation indicated that COVID-19 fear fully mediated the association between perceived risk and preventive behaviors. Greater COVID-19 perceived risk was associated with more fear and, in turn, the engagement in more COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Furthermore, in partial support of the EPPM, participants' perceived effectiveness of preventive behaviors moderated the relationship between fear and preventive behaviors where a significant conditional effect was found among only participants endorsing low levels of perceived effectiveness of preventive behaviors. CONCLUSION: This study offers important implications for future health communication strategies by providing a network of associations that either attenuate or promote the engagement in risk-reducing preventive behaviors among young adult undergraduates.

Recent research suggests that there is a direction relationship between diet and sleep and sleep quality and risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. Specific nutrients have been associated with promoting or obstructing sleep quality. Tryptophan (TRP) has been researched and proposed to positively influence sleep quality because of its metabolic pathway to create melatonin. In the U.K, almost three quarters (74%) of adults sleep less than seven hours a night, which is under the optimal sleep recommendations. We are not aware of any studies exploring a combination of online educational dietary intake intervention focused on TRP and its effect on sleep quality. Furthermore, because of current government restrictions for COVID-19, the intervention was delivered online. Volunteers were recruited via Facebook and Instagram social media. Dietary intake was measured using FFQ-EPIC Norfolk, and sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A questionnaire was used to collect information on demographics and self-reported anthropometric data. The intervention comprised of a 5-minute PowerPoint presentation video on the relationship between nutrition, lifestyle and sleep. Nutrition education was based on the Eatwell Guide, emphasising encouraging intake of foods high in tryptophan intake and decreasing alcohol and caffeine intake. Additionally, the participant received information on basic lifestyle tips on how to incorporate sleep hygiene. The FFQ-EPIC and PSQI were re-administered one month after the educational intervention. The FFQ was analysed using Nutritics to obtain estimated habitual daily dietary intakes. A paired sample t-test (SPSS v. 24) was used to assess changes before and after the intervention. The participants (n = 23) were adults aged between 18-25 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 22.5 kg/m2. Sleep quality improved after intervention from PSQI = 6 to PSQI score = 5 but did not reach significance (p = 0.06). Energy and nutrient intake did not significantly change before and after the intervention. Mean TRP intake, alcohol intake or caffeine intake did not significantly change. However, the study observed changes in individual subjective sleep quality in components such as improved sleep efficiency, longer sleep duration and less daytime dysfunction.

PURPOSE: The present article aims to review theoretical models and concepts underlying current empirical research on pandemic influenza risk perception. METHOD: A review was conducted based on 28 empirical studies from 30 articles which were published between 2003 and 2007. RESULTS: Concepts of risk perception mostly seemed more pragmatic than theory-based and were highly heterogeneous, for instance, in terms of conceptualizing risk perception as an exclusively cognitive or as a cognitive and emotional phenomenon or whether the concept was dominated by expectancy or expectancy and value components. Similarly, the majority of studies investigating risk perceptions and protective behaviors were not model-based. CONCLUSIONS: The current body of knowledge can only provide preliminary insights.

METHODS/DESIGN We will perform a randomised, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study. The study population consists of 240 COPD patients aged 40 years and older with vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration < 50 nmol/L). Participants will be recruited after an exacerbation and will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive vitamin D3 16800 IU or placebo orally once a week during 1 year. Participants will receive a diary card to register the incidence of exacerbations and changes in medication during the study period. Visits will be performed at baseline, at 6 months and at 12 months after randomisation. Participants will undergo spirometry, measurement of total lung capacity and assessment of maximal respiratory mouth pressure. Several physical performance and hand grip strength tests will be performed, questionnaires on quality of life and physical activity will be filled in, a nasal secretion sample and swab will be obtained and blood samples will be taken. The primary outcome will be exacerbation rate. DISCUSSION This study will be the first RCT aimed at the effects of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbation rate in vitamin D deficient COPD patients. Also, in contrast to earlier studies that used infrequent dosing regimens, our trial will study effects of a weekly dose of vitamin D supplementation. Secondly, the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D on host immune response of COPD patients and underlying mechanisms will be studied. Finally, the effects on physical functioning will be examined.

Methodology Individuals aged five and above were recruited from 274 wards of the state (population approximately 19.6 million) from January 11 to January 22, 2021. A total of 100 participants each were included from all wards for a net sample size of approximately 28,000. A multistage sampling technique was employed to select participants for the household serosurvey. Anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies were detected by using the VITROS? (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ, USA) assay (90% sensitivity, 100% specificity). Results Antibody positivity was observed in 14,298 (50.76%) of 28,169 samples. The age, sex, and district population-weighted seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 50.52% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 49.94-51.10), and after adjustment for assay characteristics, it was 56.13% (95% CI = 55.49-56.77). On adjusted analysis, participants aged 50 years, of female gender, housewives, having ever lived in containment zones, urban slum dwellers, and diabetes or hypertensive patients had significantly higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity. The peak infection rate and the test-positivity rate since October 2020 were initially observed in mid-November 2020, with a subsequent steep declining trend, followed by a period of persistently low case burden lasting until the first week of March 2021. This was followed by a steady increase followed by an exponential surge in infections from April 2021 onward culminating in the second wave of the pandemic. Conclusions The presence of infection-induced immunity from SARS-CoV-2 even in more than one in two people can be ineffective in protecting the population. Despite such high seroprevalence, population susceptibility to COVID-19 can be accentuated by variants of concern having the ability for rapid transmission and depletion of antibody levels with the threat of recurrent infections, signifying the need for mass vaccination.","output":"Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Delhi, India: High Seroprevalence Not a Deterrent?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To present the clinical features of a rare case of atypical acute retinal necrosis in a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive immunosuppressed patient. METHODS Retrospective observational case report. RESULTS A 75-year-old lady presented with a left eye pan uveitis picture with vitritis and extensive peripheral and mid-peripheral necrotising retinitis. In the right eye, she had a very mild superior peripheral retinitis with minimal anterior or vitreous inflammation. Two months prior to her diagnosis she completed a course of rituximab and chlorambucil chemotherapy for a relapse of diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient's nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive for COVID-19 in a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The vitreous sample PCR tested positive for Varicella Zoster Virus and was negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE To the best of our knowledge this is the first description of a case that has undergone vitreous PCR testing for COVID-19. It is interesting to note the high level of vitreous inflammation which would not be expected in an immunosuppressed state. We present a number of possible links between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the unusual ocular presentation of bilateral VZV viral retinitis in this patient.While extra ocular VZV outbreaks have been reported with rituximab treated patients, this report should also raise the awareness of VZV related viral retinitis in DLBCL patients on rituximab chemotherapy which is a very rare occurrence.This case may provide some evidence to healthcare policy makers who are making decisions regarding the re-introduction of routine Ophthalmic surgery.","output":"Atypical bilateral acute retinal necrosis in a coronavirus disease 2019 positive immunosuppressed patient."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most recent ST3 Anaesthetic recruitment for posts commencing in August 2021 saw larger numbers of applicants (n = 1,056) compared to previous years, with approximately 700 applicants failing to secure an ST3 post. We surveyed 536 anaesthetic junior doctors who applied for ST3 posts during this application round with the aim of investigating their experience of the recruitment process this year (response rate 536/1,056 = 51%). Approximately 61% were not offered ST3 posts (n = 326), a similar proportion to that previously reported. We asked all respondents what their potential career plans were for the next 12 to 24 months. The majority expressed intentions to take up either CT3 top-up posts or non-training fellow posts from August 2021 (79%). Other options considered by respondents included: pursuing work abroad (17%), embarking on a career break (16%), taking up an ST3 post in intensive care medicine instead of anaesthetics (15%) and permanently leaving the medical profession (9%). A number of respondents expressed a desire to pursue training in a different medical specialty (9%). Some respondents expressed an intention to pursue further education or research (10%). A large proportion of respondents (42%) expressed a lack of confidence in being able to achieve the necessary training requirements to later apply for ST4 in August 2023. The majority of respondents reported not feeling confident in achieving GMC Specialty Registration in Anaesthesia in the future without a training number (75%), and that their wider life plans have been disrupted due to the impending time out of training (78%). We received a total of 384 free-text responses to a question asking about general concerns regarding the ST3 applications process. Sentiment analysis of these free-text responses indicated that respondents felt generally negatively about the ST3 recruitment process. Some themes that were elicited from the responses included: respondents feeling the recruitment process lacked fairness, respondents suffering burnout and negative impacts on their wellbeing, difficulties in making plans for their personal lives, and feeling undervalued and abandoned despite having made personal sacrifices to support the health service during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results suggest that junior anaesthetic doctors in the UK currently have a negative perception towards postgraduate training structures, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to the postgraduate training curriculum and difficulties in securing higher training posts.","output":"Anaesthetic Higher Specialty Training Recruitment in the United Kingdom During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter examines the ways in which EU member states dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic by setting information about the spread of the virus and the mitigation strategies adopted by governments at international, national and local levels in the context of their policy environments and the policymaking process.

There are studies in the literature conducted on the importance of serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE-2 enzymes in ARDS pathogenesis. Serum ACE levels are higher in children and adolescents than in adults, and COVID-19 has a milder progression. All these reasons suggest that there may be a relationship between serum ACE levels and COVID-19 prognosis. METHODS: The serum ACE levels were determined at the time of hospitalization due to COVID-19 diagnosis in this single-centered, prospective study. According to discharge status, patients were divided into three groups as \\"Discharge with Healing\\", \\"Intensive Care Need\\" and \\"Mortality\\", and the effect of serum ACE levels on disease prognosis was investigated. RESULTS: The present study comprised a total of 103 patients, of whom 42.7% (n = 44) were female, and 57.3% (n = 59) were male.

However, few studies have determined predictors of mortality with respect to the timing of death in infectious patients. This cohort study aimed to identify the factors associated with early and late death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. From 14 May to 31 July 2021, this study consecutively recruited laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Taipei City Hospital. All patients with COVID-19 were followed up until death or discharge from the hospital or till 13 August 2021. Mortality in such patients was categorized as early death (death within the first two weeks of hospitalization) or late death (mortality later than two weeks after hospitalization), based on the timing of death. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with early and late death among such patients. Of 831 recruited patients, the overall mean age was 59.3 years, and 12.2% died during hospitalization. Of the 101 deceased, 66 (65.3%) and 35 (34.7%) died early and late, respectively. After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, independent predictors for early death included age  65 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 5.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.88C9.65), heart failure (AOR = 10.32; 95% CI: 2.28C46.65), and end-stage renal disease (AOR = 11.97; 95% CI: 3.53C40.55).

We have seen the proliferation of statements of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and commitments to fight racism and health inequities from academia, nonprofit organizations, governmental agencies, and private corporations. Actions must now arise from these promises. As public health and EHS scientists, we must examine the systems that produce and perpetuate inequities in exposure to environmental pollutants and associated health effects. OBJECTIVES: We outline five recommendations the EHS research community can implement to confront racism and move our science forward for eliminating racial inequities in environmental health. DISCUSSION: Race is best considered a political label that promotes inequality. Thus, we should be wary of equating race with biology. Further, EHS researchers should seriously consider racism as a plausible explanation of racial disparities in health and consider structural racism as a factor in environmental health risk/impact assessments, as well as multiple explanations for racial differences in environmental exposures and health outcomes. Last, the EHS research community should develop metrics to measure racism and a set of guidelines on the use and interpretation of race and ethnicity within the environmental sciences. Numerous guidelines exist in other disciplines that can serve as models. By taking action on each of these recommendations, we can make significant progress toward eliminating racial disparities. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8186","output":"Confronting Racism in Environmental Health Sciences: Moving the Science Forward for Eliminating Racial Inequities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Clinical evidence suggests increased oxidative stress in COVID-19 patients and this worsened redox status could potentially contribute to the progression of the disease.Objectives: To investigate the oxidative stress we have measured oxidative stress parameters, namely, PAT (total antioxidant power, iron reducing) and d-ROMs (plasma peroxides). Additionally we have investigated their correlation with the most frequently used clinical parameters CRP, LDH, and NLR in serum from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary hospital.Methods: PAT and d-ROMs were determined by analytical photometric metric method in serum from 50 hospitalized patients. For each of them, two samples were collected and analyzed immediately after collection seven days apart.Results: All patients at admission had a much higher value for plasma peroxides and a significant correlation between oxidative stress parameters and CRP, LDH, and NLR.

Traditional protocols are often not sufficient to protect patients susceptible to serious and life-threatening infections, therefore new strategies for decontaminating hospital environments are crucial to reducing microbial transmission and the spread the nosocomial infections. The adoption of modern technologies is indicated to supplement traditional methods and to improve desired levels of surface disinfection. AIM: This work aims to report the development, implementation, and validation of cleansing and sanitizing procedure for critical clinical settings through the innovative use of disposable cloths pre-impregnated with solutions containing different active formulations and biocidal agents, relating to the areas to be treated (low, moderate, high-risk). METHODS: The implementation and validation of the sanitizing system were conducted in different wards of two healthcare structures. The protocol for the study involved a structured selection of representative surfaces, such as the floor, bathroom, desk, and beds. Microbiological analyses were performed according to ISO 4833-1:2013. FINDINGS: The efficiency of the proposed system was measured through the estimation of total microbial count values on the different surfaces before and after the sanitization operations by traditional methods and by the system described here. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the microbial count that always fell below the threshold value. For the analyzed surfaces such as shower tray, bathroom floor, toilet edge, the traditional system had an effectiveness of less than 10%, whereas pre-impregnated cloths succeed to eliminate about 90% of the bacteria present. As an example, on the floor we observed a microbial count reduction from >42 to 10 CFU/11 cm(2) with the new method (76% of colonies were destroyed), while with the traditional one we have a reduction from >42 to 28 CFU/11 cm(2) (33% of microbial colonies). Moreover, the advantages of using this sanitization system are not limited to disinfecting surfaces and limiting cross-contamination but involve all activities related to the cleaning and disinfection operations, including the training and education of the operators and traceability of the operations. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative disinfection and cleaning protocol used in the present study proved to be a highly valuable alternative to the traditional cleaning procedures in healthcare settings for the sanitizing process of all kinds of surfaces. All tools were specifically designed to improve disinfection efficiency and to reduce the problems associated with traditional methods, such as preventing cross-contamination events, limiting the physical efforts of operators, and avoiding incorrect practices. Our findings add support to the knowledge that an effective sanitization procedure is critical in minimizing microorganisms' transmission and cross-contamination.","output":"An alternative approach for the decontamination of hospital settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breast milk provides optimal nourishment for all infants and has special advantages in preterm infants.

Vaccine hesitancy, a phenomenon of doubt over the vaccines claimed efficacy and/or safety amidst access to vaccination, emerged as a major challenge for global health, despite approval and regular post-marketing surveillance by major regulatory bodies. METHODS: We reviewed the literature related to vaccine hesitancy in India published until November 14, 2021 using relevant keywords in various databases and examined it from a bioethical perspective. RESULTS: Factors driving hesitancy either intensified skepticism towards vaccination in general or exacerbated reluctance towards specific vaccines. In India, hesitancy towards indigenously developed vaccines was aggravated by the lack of peer-reviewed phase III trial data before the start of vaccination, lack of public transparency of regulatory bodies, and presence of public perception of inappropriately expedited processes. This perspective piece discusses the state of mass immunization in India as a case of how vaccination and its hesitancy thereof gave rise to unique bioethical challenges in global health. In early 2021, vaccination in India was subject to difficulties in adhering to the principles of equity and justice, while a compromise of the principles of informed consent, beneficence, and non-maleficence also perhaps did occur.

Data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days) of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, -lactam/-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and ?uoroquinolones were analysed. RESULTS The trend of total consumption of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, -lactam/-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones significantly increased between 2000 and 2003 and remained stable between 2004 and 2009. The decreasing use of gentamicin and amikacin in recent years was associated with increasing susceptibility of E. coli, E. cloacae, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa to gentamicin, as well as increasing susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to amikacin. The use of piperacillin/tazobactam was positively correlated with the prevalence of piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant E. coli and S. maltophilia.

This has led to an ever-growing need for caregiving. Previous literature has shown that caregivers face problems of isolation and loneliness. However, many health organizations mainly focus their efforts on in-person community groups that require participants to meet physically. This is not always convenient or accessible for caregivers who are often juggling caring for their care recipient with family and work responsibilities. OBJECTIVE: With medical advancements such as the proliferation of mobile phones and internet technology, caregivers may have opportunities for easier access to resources and support. Technological innovations could help empower the caregiving community to seek assistance for improving their quality of life at their convenience. A community network app called Caregivers Circle was conceptualized in response to the needs of the caregivers on a day-to-day caregiving journey. This paper traces the predevelopment inquiry and technical details of this app to provide a clear understanding of its implementation along with a usability study to gauge user opinion of the app within Singapore. METHODS: A predevelopment survey was conducted to identify specific needs of caregivers and gaps in the currently available web-based community networks. The survey consisted of questions on demographical data, health-related issues of the care recipient, mental and physical healthCrelated issues of the caregiver, digital media use, information seeking, and support. This preCapp development survey was completed by 103 caregivers. Qualitative enquiries were also conducted with caregivers within Singapore to identify issues related to caregiving, support provided, and what caregivers would want from a caregiving mobile app. RESULTS: From the feedback garnered from the caregivers, the developers were able to identify several caregivers needs and gaps within the current support networks. This feedback was integrated into the mobile app called Caregivers Circle upon development. The features of this app include a public forum for community discussions, a marketplace to buy and sell items, care groups to hold private discussions with friends or other users of the app, and a friends feature to search and add new caregiving friends. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the caregivers liked the Caregivers Circle app and were confident that this app could help them have a better quality of life. The Caregivers Circle app is unique in its integrated approach. The integration of many features that caregivers need on a daily basis into an easy app can save their time as well as help them navigate their life smoothly.","output":"A Digital Mobile Community App for Caregivers in Singapore: Predevelopment and Usability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: IL-22 may have a role in the alleviation of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) via protection of pancreatic beta and endothelial cells from oxidative and lipid-induced damage.

Results: The median (IQR) IL-22% changes from pre- to post-intervention in the MICT, 4HIIT, and 1HIIT groups were -17% (-43.0% to 31.3%), +16.5% (-18.9% to 154.9%), and +15.9% (-28.7% to 46.1%), respectively. Although there were no significant between-group differences in IL-22 concentration change, there was a medium-to-large group  time interaction effect [F(2,35)=2.08, p=0.14, ?2=0.14]. Conclusion: Although there was no statistically significant between-group difference in IL-22 change, the study suggests that different exercise intensities may have opposing effects on IL-22 concentration in individuals with MetS.","output":"Effect of Different Volumes of Interval Training and Continuous Exercise on Interleukin-22 in Adults with Metabolic Syndrome: A Randomized Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Essential steps in the provision of health care for women exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) are screening and referral for specialized services, as might occur in primary care settings. Prior to participating in a cross-disciplinary IPV training program, medical care (N = 223) and social/behavioral practitioners (N = 197) completed a survey that ascertained current practices, provisions, and perceived barriers related to IPV screening and referral. Roughly half of the study participants did not routinely screen their patients/clients for IPV, with no differences for the professional groupings. Utilization of referral resources was significantly lower for medical care providers, 78.5% of whom did not use any. Perceived barriers to screening and referral were examined as practitioner-based and organization-based, and we identified tangible provisions (protocols and practice materials) as a relevant variable. As we conjectured, organization-based barriers were more strongly associated with lower rates of screening and referral than were practitioner-based barriers, regardless of professional grouping. Moreover, tangible provisions, controlling for perceived barriers, significantly added to routine screening and frequency of referral resources usage, particularly for medical care providers. Results are discussed in the context of a systems-level approach to improving IPV services in health care with organizational practice enhancements.","output":"Organization-Based Factors Bearing on Provider Screening and Referral Practices for Women Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 33-year-old female presented with a history of high-grade fever, cough, dyspnea, joint pain and myalgia.

METHODS: 5299 voluntary health workers were enrolled from 28 April 2020 to 28 July 2020 to assess immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout IgM, IgG and IgA serum levels titration by four laboratory tests. Association of antibody titre with several demographic variables, swab tests and performance tests (sensitivity, specificity, and agreement) were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence was 6%, considering either IgG and IgM, and 4.8% considering IgG. Working in COVID-19 Units was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of infected workers. Cohen's kappa of agreement between MaglumiTM and VivaDiagTM was quite good when considering IgG only (Cohen's kappa = 78.1%, 95% CI 74.0-82.0%), but was lower considering IgM (Cohen's kappa = 13.3%, 95% CI 7.8-18.7%). CONCLUSION: The large sample size with high participation (84.7%), the biobank and the longitudinal design were significant achievements, offering a baseline dataset as the benchmark for risk assessment, health surveillance and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection for the hospital workforce, especially considering the ongoing vaccination campaign.

Currently, it has been reported that some comorbidities are linked with an increased rate of severity and mortality among COVID-19 patients. To assess the role of comorbidity in COVID-19 progression, we performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis on the relationship of COVID-19 severity with 8 different underlying diseases. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched for articles investigating the prevalence of comorbidities in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. A total of 41 studies comprising 12,526 patients were included. RESULTS: Prevalence of some commodities was lower than that in general population such as hypertension (19% vs 23.2%), diabetes (9% vs 10.9%), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (2% vs 9.5%), chronic liver diseases (CLD) (3% vs 24.8%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (3% vs 8.6%), while some others including cancer (1% vs 0.6%), cardiovascular disease (6% vs 1.8%) and cerebrovascular disease (2% vs 0.9%) exhibited greater percentage in COVID-19. Cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.70, 95%CI 2.51C5.45) was found to be the strongest risk factor in disease exacerbation, followed by CKD (OR = 3.60, 95%CI 2.18C5.94), COPD (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 2.35C4.19), cardiovascular disease (OR = 2.76, 95% CI 2.18C3.49), malignancy (OR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.75C3.95), diabetes (OR = 2.49, 95% CI 2.10C2.96) and hypertension (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.81C2.51). We found no correlation between CLD and increased disease severity (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 0.96C1.82). CONCLUSION: The impact of all eight underlying diseases on COVID-19 deterioration seemed to be higher in patients outside Hubei. Based on different comorbidities, COVID-19 patients tend to be at risk of developing poor outcomes to a varying degree. Thus, tailored infection prevention and monitoring and treatment strategies targeting these high-risk subgroups might improve prognosis during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Whereas, skepticism regarding their safety and efficacy remains prevalent. We aimed in this study to assess attitudes and beliefs regarding current vaccines among cancer patients in a national Tunisian center for cancer care. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted, during the month of February 2021, among hospitalized patients in the oncology unit of the Salah Azaiez Institute of cancer. We included patients who were aged 18 years and over and who were able to respond to the questionnaire. A standardized questionnaire was administered to patients to assess their attitudes and beliefs regarding current vaccines. Chi square test was used for comparing percentages and a p value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were included with a mean age of 54.412.7 years. The willingness to receive influenza and COVID-19 vaccine were respectively of 39.0% and 35.0%. A higher proportion of 69.0% was observed for the willingness to receive vaccines against other infectious diseases. Among surveyed patients, the high majority (81.0%) agreed with the fact that there is no need to be vaccinated because native immunity exits and or because vaccines are unsafe. This belief was significantly associated to patients' unacceptance of COVID-19 (91.3% vs 63.8%, p < 0.001), influenza (86.8% vs 72.7%, p = 0.013) and other infectious diseases vaccines (93.5% vs 75.9%, p = 0.003).

The necessity of caspase-3 in neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity has been summarized in pathological pain. Leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein 1 (LRRTM1) mediates synaptic delivery of AMPA receptor and synaptogenesis. This study evaluated whether caspase-3 and LRRTM1 are required for fracture-associated postoperative allodynia. METHODS: A model of tibial fracture with intramedullary pinning in mice was established for the induction of postoperative pain, verified by measurement of mechanical paw withdrawal threshold and cold scores response to acetone. The caspase-3 specific inhibitor, recombinant caspase-3 and LRRTM1 knockdown by shRNA were utilized for the investigation of pathogenesis as well as the prevention of allodynia. Also, the activity of caspase-3 and the expression of LRRTM1 in the spinal dorsal horn were examined by Western blot and RT-qPCR. RESULTS: This study reported that tibial fracture and orthopedic surgery produced long-lasting mechanical allodynia and cold allodynia, along with the up-modulation of spinal caspase-3 activity (but not caspase-3 expression) and LRRTM1 expression. Spinal caspase-3 inhibition prevented fracture-associated behavioral allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. Caspase-3 inhibitor also reduced the spinal increased LRRTM1 level after tibial fracture with pinning. Spinal LRRTM1 deficiency impaired fracture-caused postoperative pain. Intrathecal recombinant caspase-3 facilitated acute pain hypersensitivity and spinal LRRTM1 expression in na?ve mice, reversing by LRRTM1 knockdown. CONCLUSION: Our current results demonstrate the spinal up-regulation of LRRTM1 by caspase-3 activation in the development of tibial fracture-associated postoperative pain in mice.","output":"Spinal caspase-3 contributes to tibial fracture-associated postoperative allodynia via up-regulation of LRRTM1 expression in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The major epidemics and pandemic diseases that have bothered humans since the Neolithic Age and Bronze Age are surveyed.

Eight subjects performed 20 s contractions [15 s at 50% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) followed by 5 s MVC] separated by a 10 s rest period until task failure. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electrical femoral nerve stimulation (PNS) were delivered  2 s apart during 50% MVC, during MVC and after MVC in relaxed muscle. Voluntary activation was assessed by TMS (VATMS) immediately before and after exercise and then three times over a 6 min recovery period. During exercise, MVC and twitch force evoked by PNS in relaxed muscle decreased progressively to 48  8 and 36  16% of control values, respectively (both P < 0.01). Significant changes in voluntary activation assessed by PNS and twitch evoked by TMS during MVC were observed during the last quarter of exercise only (from 96.4  1.7 to 86  13%, P = 0.03 and from 0.76  0.8 to 4.9  4.7% MVC, P = 0.02, from baseline to task failure, respectively). The TMS-induced silent period increased linearly during both MVC (by  79 ms) and 50% MVC (by  63 ms; both P < 0.01). Motor-evoked potential amplitude did not change during the protocol at any force levels. Both silent period and VATMS recovered within 2 min postexercise, whereas MVC and twitch force evoked by PNS in relaxed muscle recovered to only 84  9 and 73  17% of control values 6 min after exercise, respectively. In conclusion, high-intensity single-joint quadriceps exercise induces supraspinal fatigue near task failure, with increased intracortical inhibition and, in contrast to previous upper-limb results, unchanged corticospinal excitability. These changes recover rapidly after task failure, emphasizing the need to measure corticospinal adaptations immediately at task failure to avoid underestimation of exercise-induced corticospinal changes.","output":"Dynamics of corticospinal changes during and after high-intensity quadriceps exercise."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The encapsulation of active ingredients into solid capsules from biodegradable materials has received significant attention over the last decades.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study used a retrospective approach to evaluate the bacterial culture, antibiotic use, comorbidities, imaging, and laboratory discoveries of patients with COVID-19 (hospitalized) confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between May and December 2020. We have selected 906 COVID-19 positive patients using a consecutive sampling technique and analyzed data using IBM SPSS-22 statistical software. Statistical analysis included univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. It was carried out using multivariable logistic regression analysis to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 410 patients, which involved 247 males with a mean age of 53.9 years were evaluated. Based on the results, the positive bacterial culture was detected in 18.3% of all patients who sent the culture sample test, representing bacterial infections. The Acinetobacter baumannii was the most commonly identified organism, while the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics was 83.4%. Furthermore, azithromycin was prescribed in the highest number of patients with approximately 44.3% of all antibiotics. The total mortality rate was 39.8% and its ratio was higher in COVID-19 patients with bacterial infections (65.3%, X(2) = 25.1, P<0.001). Patients mortality who used antibiotics were also higher compared to those who did not (89% vs 11%, P<0.014). Age, length of hospitalization, bacterial infection, shortness of breath, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and diabetes mellitus were also associated predictors to increased hospital mortality (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.382, P<0.013; aOR 4.265, P<0.001; aOR 3.720, P<0.001; aOR 3.889, P<0.001; aOR 6.839, P<0.003; aOR 1.844, P<0.030), respectively.

We present case volume data from our community hospital to demonstrate how this shutdown affected surgical care. METHODS: Between March 16 and June 14, 2020, all elective surgeries were canceled at our institution. All procedures performed during this operating room shutdown (ORS) were logged, as well as those 4 weeks before (PRE) and 4 weeks after (POST) for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2,475 cases were included in our analysis, with 754 occurring during shutdown. Overall case numbers dropped significantly during ORS and increased during recovery (mean 245.028.4 PRE vs. 58.030.9 ORS vs. 186.019.4 POST cases/week, p <0.001).

Such technologies could help disrupt transmission, sustain economies and preserve health and lives during widespread infection. In contrast, conventional nucleic acid diagnostic procedures require trained personnel, complex laboratories, expensive equipment, and protracted processing times. In this work, lyophilized cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) and toehold switch riboregulators are employed to develop a promising paper-based nucleic acid diagnostic platform activated simply by the addition of saliva. First, to facilitate distribution and deployment, an economical paper support matrix is identified and a mass-producible test cassette designed with integral saliva sample receptacles. Next, CFPS is optimized in the presence of saliva using murine RNase inhibitor. Finally, original toehold switch riboregulators are engineered to express the bioluminescent reporter NanoLuc in response to SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences present in saliva samples. The biosensor generates a visible signal in as few as seven minutes following administration of 15 L saliva enriched with high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences. The estimated cost of this test is less than 0.50 USD, which could make this platform readily accessible to both the developed and developing world. While additional research is needed to decrease the limit of detection, this work represents important progress toward developing a diagnostic technology that is rapid, low-cost, distributable and deployable at the point-of-care by a layperson.","output":"Towards Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Human Saliva: A Paper-based Cell-free Toehold Switch Biosensor with a Visual Bioluminescent Output"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral cause of congenital infection, occurring in approximately 1-2% of live births worldwide. Given our increasing knowledge of risk, advances in the identification of maternal infection, and the extremely limited options for the treatment of fetal infection, the prevention is a promising direction for research efforts. Recently, there have been several exciting studies assessing different ways of preventing congenital infection in the fetus and one in particular has focused on the use of valaciclovir. RECENT FINDINGS A recent study reported a 71% reduction in vertical transmission of CMV with the use of oral valaciclovir following maternal primary CMV infection early in pregnancy. The clinical impact of this study could be enormous and it has particular implications for considerations around maternal serological screening in the first trimester of pregnancy. Further research assessing behaviour modifications during early pregnancy could also provide evidence for an effective primary prevention technique. SUMMARY Prevention of congenital CMV infection, whether primary, secondary or tertiary, is possible, however, there are barriers to its utilisation in a clinical setting. The main limitation is the requirement for early, effective and large-scale serological screening of mothers to detect asymptomatic primary infection.","output":"Prevention strategies for congenital cytomegalovirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for strategies that mitigate the risk of aerosol disease transmission in indoor environments with different ventilation strategies. It is necessary for building operators to be able to estimate and compare the relative impacts of different mitigation strategies to determine suitable strategies for a particular situation. Using a validated CFD model, this study simulates the dispersion of exhaled contaminants in a thermally stratified conference room with overhead heating. The impacts of portable air-cleaners (PACs) on the room airflow and contaminant distribution were evaluated for different PAC locations and flow rates, as well as for different room setups (socially distanced or fully occupied). To obtain a holistic view of a strategys impacts under different release scenarios, we simultaneously model the steady-state distribution of aerosolized virus contaminants from eight distinct sources in 18 cases for a total of 144 release scenarios. The simulations show that the location of the source, the PAC settings, and the room set-up can impact the average exposure and PAC effectiveness. For this studied case, the PACs reduced the room average exposure by 31%C66% relative to the baseline case. Some occupant locations were shown to have a higher-than-average exposure, particularly those seated near the airflow outlet, and occupants closest to sources tended to see the highest exposure from said source. We found that these PACs were effective at reducing the stratification caused by overhead heating, and also identified at least one sub-optimal location for placing a PAC in this space.","output":"Assessing the use of portable air cleaners for reducing exposure to airborne diseases in a conference room with thermal stratification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Membrane-spanning -helices represent major sites of protein-protein interaction in membrane protein oligomerization and folding.

The aim of this scoping review was to identify the prevalence, types, and clustering of symptoms in midlife climacteric women with metabolic syndrome and to compare them to symptoms of midlife climacteric women without metabolic syndrome. METHODS A three-step search method was used according to Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Eligibility criteria of participants, concept, context, and types of evidence were selected in alignment with the review questions. Seven databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertation & Theses, OpenGrey) were searched using search terms with no language or date restrictions. Title and abstract screening, full-text review, data charting, and data synthesis were conducted by two independent researchers based on the eligibility criteria. RESULTS The search yielded 3813 studies after removing duplicates with 48 full-text papers assessed for eligibility. A total of eight studies were reviewed and analyzed which reported the prevalence and types of symptoms individually or grouped based on each body system. Midlife climacteric women with metabolic syndrome experience a wide prevalence of individual and grouped urogenital, vasomotor, psychological, sleep, and somatic symptoms. Mental exhaustion had the highest prevalence (84.4%) among the individual symptoms, and urogenital symptoms had the highest prevalence (81.3%) among the grouped symptoms. There were mixed findings on symptoms between midlife climacteric women with metabolic syndrome and without metabolic syndrome. No studies focused on symptom clusters. CONCLUSION Our findings will serve as a knowledge basis for understanding symptoms experienced by midlife climacteric women with metabolic syndrome.

TNF is a versatile cytokine with different impacts at the cellular level depending on the action form (transmembrane or soluble) and the receptor to which it is associated. In that sense, the triggered mechanisms can be diversified. Furthermore, there is the possibility of the joint action provided by synergism between one or more cytokines with TNF, where the detonation of combined cellular processes has been suggested.

In some cases, this may be a life-saving transfer to a higher level of care. US Central Command (CENTCOM) has provided valuable guidance for COVID-19 management in the operational environment,1 and has proposed the National Early Warning System 2 (NEWS2) scoring tool as a useful adjunct to gauging illness severity. NEWS2, however, does not consider co-morbidities, such as diabetes or chronic cardiac disease, which could worsen the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thus, NEWS2 fails to address such factors during the risk stratification of patients to a higher level of care. To address this concern, June 2020, 3rd Medical Brigade, Operation Spartan Shield (OSS) developed the COVID-19 Army Rapid Assessment Tool (CARAT) with inputs from clinicians and researchers (The Team). The CARAT is a clinical scoring system, modified from the NEWS2, which combines the effects of co-morbid disease with the current physiological condition of a COVID-19 patient. The Team obtained clinical data for 105 patients from the CENTCOM area of responsibility (AOR), who presented to a military treatment facility (MTF) symptomatic for, and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, during the time period of June to mid-August 2020. Each patient was retrospectively assigned a CARAT score based on his or her initial presentation. Preliminary review of data suggested a CARAT value of 4 or greater was an indicator for risk of further deterioration. Patients were then grouped into two categories: patients who received transfer to a higher level of care, versus \\"stay-in-place\\" supportive care. Results showed that 100% of patients with a score 4 had been transferred to a higher echelon of care, compared to 2% of patients with scores less than 4. A Fisher's exact test demonstrated a statistically significant difference between these two groups (p is less than 0.001). Interestingly, when compared with the NEWS2 score, the CARAT identified 9 individuals for transfer to a higher level of care, of whom only one patient was identified by the NEWS2, clearly underscoring the significance of CARAT despite small sample size. We therefore recommend that CARAT be further validated in predicting disease severity and need for emergent evacuation in larger patient settings.","output":"The COVID-19 Army Rapid Assessment Tool (CARAT) for Management of COVID-19 in the Deployed Setting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE A retrospective single-center review of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases was performed.

The aim of the study was to identify the potential of the Place Standard tool for the development of strategies in a municipal context as well as to identify facilitators and barriers when designing these. METHODS: Within a qualitative study design, nine guided interviews were conducted with international experts who have applied the tool at a municipal level in Europe. The interviews were recorded, subsequently transcribed and analysed using MAXQDA software. The analysis was based on a qualitative content analysis according to Mayring, using a deductively developed category system. RESULTS: A total of 355 statements were analysed.

Using years of life as a welfare metric yields a single parameter that captures the underlying trade-off between lives and livelihoods: how many PYs have the same welfare cost as one LY. Taking an agnostic view of this parameter, we compare estimates of LYs and PYs across countries for different scenarios. Three main findings arise. First, we estimate that, as of early June 2020, the pandemic (and the observed private and policy responses) had generated at least 68 million additional poverty years and 4.3 million years of life lost across 150 countries. The ratio of PYs to LYs is very large in most countries, suggesting that the poverty consequences of the crisis are of paramount importance. Second, this ratio declines systematically with GDP per capita: poverty accounts for a much greater share of the welfare costs in poorer countries.

The positive deviation of the model often occurred for photoresistant viruses with low kexp, infectivity less than 0.20 cm2 mJ-1 (e.g., Adenovirus, Papovaviridae and Retroviridae). We also applied this model to predict the UV254 inactivation rate of SARS-CoV-2 (kpred, genome = 3.168 cm2 mJ-1) and a UV dose of 3 mJ cm-2 seemed to be able to achieve a 2-log removal by conservative calculation using 1/2kpred, genome value. This prediction method can be used as a prescreening tool to assess the effectiveness of UV254 irradiation for emerging/unculturable viruses in water or wastewater treatment.","output":"Prediction of Photolysis Kinetics of Viral Genomes under UV254 Irradiation to Estimate Virus Infectivity Loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, a global pandemic led to lockdowns, and subsequent social and business restrictions.

Moreover, most otolaryngological procedures, including oropharyngoscopy, generate droplets or aerosols from high viral shedding areas [1]. Thus, only non-deferrable consultations were performed in the outbreak's acute phase. Along with the re-opening of elective clinical services and the impending second wave of the outbreak, a reorganization is necessary to minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission [1]. METHODS: This video (Video 1) shows how to safely conduct an outpatient Otorhinolaryngological consultation, focusing on complete ear, nose and throat examination, according to evidences from the published literature and Otolaryngological societies guidelines [2,3]. RESULTS: After telephonic screening, patients reporting Covid-19 symptoms or closecontact with a Covid-19 case within the last 14 days are referred to telehealth services [1-3]. To avoid crowding, the patient is admitted alone, after body temperature control, except for underage or disabled people [1]. The waiting room assessment must guarantee a social distance of 6 ft [1-3]. The consultation room is reorganized into two separate areas (Fig. 1): 1) a clean desk area, where an assistant wearing a surgical mask and gloves, handles the patient's documentation and writes the medical report, keeping proper distance from the patient, and 2) a separate consultation area, where the examiner, equipped with proper personal protective equipment (Fig. 2) [3,4], carries out the medical interview and physical examination. Endoscopic-assisted ear, nose and throat inspection using a dedicated monitor allows the examiner to maintain an adequate distance from the patient throughout the procedure while providing an optimal view (Figs. 3-6) [3]. Recent evidence shows that nasal endoscopy does not increase droplet production compared to traditional otolaryngological examination [5]. When necessary, nasal topic decongestion and anesthesia must be performed using cottonoids rather than sprays [3]. The patient keeps the nose and mouth covered throughout the consultation, lowering the surgical mask on the mouth for nasal endoscopy and removing it only for oropharyngoscopy. After the consultation, the doffing procedure must be carried out carefully to avoid contamination [4]. All the equipment and surfaces must undergo high-level disinfection with 70% alcohol or 0.1% bleach solutions [3]. Proper room ventilation must precede the next consultation [3].

Intestinal enteroids, which partially recreate the structure and function of intestinal villi-crypts, have many physiological similarities to the intestinal tissues in vivo. Enteroids exhibit advantages in studying the interactions between intestines and enteric pathogens. To create a novel infection model for PDCoV, we developed an in vitro system to generate porcine intestinal enteroids from crypts of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of pigs. Enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, stem cells, proliferating cells, and goblet cells were found in the differentiated enteroids. Replication of PDCoV was detected in the cultured enteroids by immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. Double immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated that PDCoV was present in Sox9-positive intestinal cells and Villin1-positive enterocytes. There were multiple cellular responses shown as changes of transcription of genes related to mucosal immunity, antiviral genes, and marker genes of stem cells and other cells in the enteroids infected with PDCoV.

However, due to advances in medical technology and changes in clinical practice, the knowledge and skills obtained from basic education and training may rapidly become out of date. There is no mandated, structured and ongoing mechanism to assess all doctors competence in Hong Kong. This paper assessed doctors perceived needs for continuous professional development, and to identify facilitators and barriers that are likely to influence the implementation of compulsory continuous professional development for maintaining professional competence and ensuring patient safety. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed method design with two distinct interactive phases was adopted comprising a postal self-administered questionnaire survey among a random sample of 2,459 of doctors (Phase 1), followed by individual interviews of a stratified sample of 30 questionnaire respondents for the subsequent qualitative analysis (Phase 2). RESULTS: The majority of doctors (over 90%) agreed the importance of continuous professional development to update knowledge and skills. However, just 30.7% of non-specialists compared with 65.4% of specialists agreed it would be desirable for continuous professional development to be a requirement for renewal of licenses. A relatively higher percentage of non-specialists compared with specialists reported barriers to participation such as accessibility, availability and relevance of the content of the programmes. Facilitators for uptake included more convenient schedule and location, relevant content, and incentives for participation such as making this a pre-condition for enrolling in government-funded services. CONCLUSIONS: To address the needs of individual doctors, the spheres of practice, personal preferences and learning styles should be considered in deciding the content and processes of continuous professional development. Flexibility is also an important principle. A learning model, incentives for participation and a compliance strategy (instead of deterrence) could be effective strategy for continuous professional development.","output":"What helps and hinders doctors in engaging in continuous professional development?

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this studywas to investigate racial/ethnic differences in allegations ofworkplace discrimination by Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic/Latinx American individuals with MS. METHODS: The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Integrated Mission System (IMS) databasewas used to describe and compare the frequency and characteristics of discrimination allegations filed by people with MS in the three race/ethnicity groups. Quantitative analyses, including a one-way analysis of variance and Chi-square tests, were used to examine 2009-2016 Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA) Title I complaints. These complaints were received by the EEOC from people with MS who identified themselves as Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic/Latinx American (N=3,770). RESULTS: Both African Americans and Hispanic/Latinx Americans tended to encounter discrimination at a younger age than Caucasian Americans. African American and Hispanic/Latinx American charging parties were more likely to be women than were Caucasian charging parties. The size and location of employers against whom allegations were filed varied significantly among the three racial/ethnic groups.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-four patients with COVID-19 were prospectively followed for longitudinal assessment of somatic symptom burden and sleep quality. We used the 8-item Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS-8) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale for somatic symptom burden and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality investigation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent factors associated with somatic symptom burden and sleep quality. RESULTS Although the degree of physical discomfort and sleep quality issues tended to decline during self-quarantine, patients still experienced these problems to a certain degree. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that SSS-8 scores at admission (relative risk [RR] 1.234, 95% CI 1.075-1.417, P=0.003) and mMRC scores at discharge (RR 2.420, 95% CI 1.251-4.682, P=0.009) were 2 independent prognostic indicators of somatic symptom burden.

Nine cases of pituitary adenomas have presented with urgent manifestations. The endoscopic endonasal approach was performed in eight patients, while a craniotomy was selected for a recurrent pituitary adenoma. Pre- and postoperative thorough clinical evaluations with chest CT scans were performed. Other strict infection control measures have been applied. RESULTS: In 8 weeks duration starting from the past days of February 2020, we have operated on four females and five males of pituitary adenomas. Visual deterioration was the main presenting symptom. The driving factor for surgery was saving vision in eight patients. Fortunately, the postoperative course was uneventful for all patients. No suspected COVID-19 infection has been reported in any patient or health-care team except one patient. In our city, PCR test was routinely not available.

The barriers for older adults in the United States to learn a new technology to go online during the pandemic remain to be studied. METHODS: Using data from the 2019C2020 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a nationally representative survey of older Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older in the United States, we used multivariable logistic regression models to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with learning a new technology to go online during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. RESULTS: Our sample represented 23,547,688 older adults nationally, of which the majority (60.2%) increased ICT use during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. However, most older adults (71.8%) did not report learning a new technology to go online. Those who did not learn a new technology to go online had less of an increase in ICT use than those who learned either with help or by themselves (50.7% vs. 78.4% or 89.2% respectively, p < 0.01). The odds of learning a new technology decreased with increasing age (aOR [95%CI] = 0.96 [0.94C0.98]), being male (aOR [95%CI] = 0.56 [0.45C0.72]), having lower than high school educational attainment (aOR [95%CI] = 0.38 [0.29C0.50]), decreasing income levels (aORs ranged from 0.28 to 0.54), and self\\\\reported fair or poor general health (aOR [95%CI] = 0.65 [0.47C0.90]).

SIMULATED INTERVENTIONS: Making available drug formulations with increased tamper-resistance, prescriber education programs, and programs that reduce rates of medical user-related abuse and addiction. SIMULATED OUTCOME MEASURE: Number of overdose deaths of medical users of pharmaceutical opioid analgesics, including those who abuse or have become addicted. METHODS A demonstration system dynamics model is developed, tested, and used to evaluate the impact of candidate mitigation strategies on the outcome measures. RESULTS Tamper-resistant drug products will likely reduce overdose death rates but may not reduce overall deaths if there is increased prescribing. Prescriber education would likely reduce deaths through a reduction in patient access to pharmaceutical opioid analgesics. CONCLUSIONS The system dynamics approach may have potential for opioid-related policy evaluation. However, metrics must be carefully selected, and trade-offs may be involved. For example, it may be difficult to limit negative outcomes associated with pharmaceutical opioids without adversely affecting chronic pain patients' access to pharmaceutical treatment. Ultimately, a combination of metrics and value judgments will be needed to properly evaluate mitigation strategies.","output":"System dynamics modeling as a potentially useful tool in analyzing mitigation strategies to reduce overdose deaths associated with pharmaceutical opioid treatment of chronic pain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs), including those in long-term recovery, and their loved ones are facing rapid changes to treatment and support services due to COVID-19.

They are named as such due to their ability to interfere with the viral cell production.There are three forms of interferons-Type I, Type II and Type III. Type I interferons consist of IFN-, IFN-?, IFN-, IFN-, IFN- that are induced by cytokines and act/bind on the IFNAR receptor. Type II interferon consists only of IFN-? and is mostly produced by NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and B cells. In addition to the antiviral property, they also have antiproliferative effects on tumours. Type III interferon has four types of IFN- that act through an FNGR receptor. Interferon has wide activity as an antiviral, antiangiogenic, antiproliferative agent-effectively preventing cancers, chronic viral infections and threatening diseases. Interferon can be applied as systemic or topical based on the treatment to be rendered to the patient-although topical had slight to no side effects.

They invade plants, which in turn may develop symptoms. Since their discovery about 50 years ago, more than thirty viroids have been reported and classified using as species demarcation less than 90 per cent sequence identity on the overall genome and evidence of biological divergence with respect to the closest related viroids. In the last few years, new viroids have been identified that infect latently their (frequently) woody hosts and have a narrow experimental hosts range, complicating and slowing down studies on their biology. As a consequence, several viroids are still waiting for classification. Moreover, the number of new viroids is expected to increase in the next years due to the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies with diagnostics purposes. Therefore, establishment of reliable species demarcation criteria mainly based on molecular features of viroids is needed. Here, viroid classification is reassessed and a scheme based on pairwise sequence identity matrices is developed. After identifying a threshold pairwise identity score (PWIS) for each viroid genus, to be used as a species demarcation criterion, we show that most of those yet unclassified viroids can be assigned to a known or to a new species, thus limiting the need for additional biological evidence to only a few more complex situations. The advantages of this PWIS-based method are that the proposed identity thresholds for species demarcations are not arbitrarily established and evidence for biological divergence is not mandatory. Importantly, the current classification is not essentially modified. A protocol for a tentative fast classification of new viroids according to the proposed approach is also provided.","output":"Reassessing species demarcation criteria in viroid taxonomy by pairwise identity matrices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 vaccines are widely available in the United States, yet our Covid-19 vaccination rates have remained far below 100%.

Surprisingly this is true even when the mega-influencer only reaches individuals who are already somewhat inclined to agree with them, and under the conservative assumption that individuals give no more weight to the mega-influencer than they would give to a single one of their friends or neighbors.

Along this line, novel tetrandrine analogues were synthesized and biologically evaluated for their hepatotoxicity, as well as their antiproliferative and chemoresistance reversing activity on cancer cells. Previous studies suggesting CYP-mediated toxification of tetrandrine prompted us to amend/replace the suspected metabolically instable 12-methoxy group. Of note, employing several in vitro models showed that the proposed CYP3A4-driven metabolism of tetrandrine and analogues is not the major cause of hepatotoxicity. Biological characterization revealed that some of the novel tetrandrine analogues sensitized drug-resistant leukemia cells by inhibition of the P-glycoprotein. Interestingly, direct anticancer effects improved in comparison to tetrandrine, as several compounds displayed a markedly enhanced ability to reduce proliferation of drug-resistant leukemia cells and to induce cell death of liver cancer cells. Those enhanced anticancer properties were linked to influences on activation of the kinase Akt and mitochondrial events.

The cognitive and motivational approaches to attitude theory in wildlife management guided, under the phenomenology method, the collection of qualitative data on the importance of the seasonal closure of hunting and its implementation challenges. This inquiry was deemed crucial to improving the disjointed relationship between park management and local communities that often make wildlife conservation and tourism difficult at the Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary. Forty-five key wildlife stakeholders, including park officers, traditional authorities, elderly residents, and bushmeat traders, were purposively selected with some interviewed personally and others engaged in focus group discussions. Despite a more significant number of stakeholders admitting the importance of the seasonal closure of hunting, some challenges impeded its implementation. These included the absence of alternative arrangements to support hunters during the period for the annual closure of hunting; lack of proper sensitisation and education on the hunting ban; absence of transparency in the equitable sharing of proceeds from wildlife tourism at the Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary among park officers (Government) and the traditional authorities; the booming bushmeat business and the fear of losing customers after the fallow period; and purported corruption on the part of park officers, threatening the observation of the seasonal closure of hunting. The study has offered proactive suggestions to the Wildlife Division of the Forestry Commission and mainly to park management at the Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary on how to address these challenges and improve wildlife management and sustainable wildlife tourism potentials in Ghana. Paramount among them is the tactful provision of alternative sources of livelihood and the establishment of enterprises in non-timber forest products as sources of income for hunters during the seasonal hunting ban.","output":"Local attitudes toward the seasonal hunting bans in Ghana's Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary: Implications for sustainable wildlife management and tourism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Concussion, a type of mild traumatic brain injury, is a common injury encountered by providers caring for pediatric patients in the emergency department (ED) setting.

At present, no specialized treatments evolved to cure COVID-19. Treatment is symptomatic. Though huge effects are being made to produce potential therapies to scuffle this COVID-19, no drug has been discovered so far. OBJECTIVE Natural products playing a significant role in disease control since ancient days. These products are serving as templates for designing new anti-microbial agents with a different mechanism of action and also open a door for investigation of effective anti-viral drugs to combat COVID-19. By focusing on this, the authors have narrated the basic structure, infection, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 virus in humans and also reported various natural products or plantbased extracts/bioactive compounds tested against coronaviruses like SARS and MERS as these viruses are structurally similar to SARS-CoV2 and can be used in designing novel drug against this virus. CONCLUSIONS The natural products are shown activity against SARS, MERS, and other viruses reviewed in this review article might be having anti-viral activities against the SARS-CoV2 virus and can be used directly for further preclinical studies.

With the use of a new technique called representational difference analysis both these diseases have recently been associated with new lymphotropic herpesviruses, i.e. human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 8. HHV-6 is a ubiquitous virus and the etiological agent of exanthema subitum. Viral neuroinvasion occurs frequently in primary HHV-6 infection, and meningitis, encephalitis and demyelination have been described as rare complications. A relation with MS has been suggested for HHV-6, as the virus has been detected in MS plaques in the brain. Data from different studies are, however, conflicting and a definitive role for HHV-6 in MS pathogenesis has not been established. HHV-8 is believed to be the causative agent of KS, and is also associated with some rare hematological malignancies. The viral genome contains several potential oncogenes that are believed to have been picked up from the human genome during evolution. The role of HHV-8 in healthy, immunocompetent individuals is however uncertain. In conclusion, the full spectrum of human diseases associated with these new viruses is not yet understood, and rapid developments in molecular biology will continue to shed new light on the interactions between herpesviruses and their hosts.","output":"Multiple sclerosis and Kaposi's sarcoma--chronic diseases associated with new human herpesviruses?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is leading to a worldwide pandemic. Except representative manifestation of pneumonia and acute respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 patients have also shown different levels of liver injury or liver dysfunction. The aim of our study was to explore the probable clinical severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients and their liver dysfunction. METHOD: A combination of computer and manual retrieval was used to search in Medline through PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science. Review Manager 5.3 software was used to examine the heterogeneity among the studies and to calculate the combined effect value (OR, 95CI). Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias test were also performed. RESULTS: We found a significant connection between liver dysfunction and mortality of COVID-19 patients with a pooled OR of 1.98 (95% CI 1.39-2.82; P = 0.0002). There was a significant association between AST and severity of COVID-19 with a pooled OR of 4.48 (95% CI 3.24-7.21; P < 0.001), and a pooled WMD of 3.35 (95% CI, 2.07 to 4.64; P < 0.001).

It is estimated that trocar port hernias occur more often in obese patients due to their obesity and because the ports are not closed routinely. The aim of the present study was to analyze the incidence, risk factors, and management of patients with trocar port hernias after laparoscopic bariatric surgery. METHODS All patients who were operated between 2006 and 2013 were included. During the study period, the trocar ports were not closed routinely. All patients who had any symptomatic abdominal wall hernia during follow-up were included. RESULTS Overall, 1524 laparoscopic bariatric procedures were performed. There were 1249 female (82 %) and 275 male (18 %) patients. The mean age was 44 years, and median body mass index was 43 kg/m(2). Patients underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) (n = 859), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) (n = 364), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) (n = 68), revisional surgery (n = 226), and other procedures (n = 7). Three hundred and one patients (20 %) had one or more postoperative complications and the overall mortality was 0.3 % (four patients). There were 14 patients (0.9 %) with an abdominal wall hernia, of which eight (0.5 %) had a trocar port hernia, three (0.2 %) an incisional hernia from other previous surgery, and three (0.2 %) an umbilical hernia. Gender, age, BMI, smoking, type II diabetes, procedure type, complications, and weight loss were not associated with the occurrence of abdominal wall hernias.

However, no treatment studies in COVID-19 focussing on neurological complications have been published to date. Objective: Does treatment with either remdesivir, dexamethasone or both reduce the risk of neurological complications in adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19? Design and setting: COVID-19 neurological complications, and remdesivir and dexamethasone use, were studied in adults admitted to hospitals in the UK with COVID-19, using data from the International Severe Acute and emerging Respiratory Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK, study registration ISRCTN66726260). Treatment allocation was non-blinded and performed by reporting clinicians. A propensity scoring methodology was used to correct for confounding between treatment groups. Participants: 89,297 patients aged 18 years and older with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for inclusion. Patients requiring supplemental oxygen at any point during admission (n=64,088) were defined as having severe COVID-19, as per WHO criteria. Patients were excluded if they received a dose of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or contracted COVID-19 in hospital. Exposures: Treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone or both was assessed against standard of care. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): A neurological complication (stroke, seizure, meningitis/encephalitis or any other neurological complication) occurring at the point of death, discharge, or resolution of the COVID-19 clinical episode. Results: The median age of patients was 71 (IQR, 56 to 82). 56% were identified as male and 71% were of white ethnicity. 4,408 patients (4.7%) developed neurological complications. In patients with severe COVID-19, neurological complications were associated with increased mortality (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.47), intensive care admission (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.6), likelihood of worse self-care on discharge (OR 3.79, 95% CI 3.36 to 4.26) and an increased time to recovery (9.65 days, 95% CI 7.12 to 12.17 days). Treatment with dexamethasone (n=21,129), remdesivir (n=1,428) and both treatments combined (n=10,846) in severe COVID-19 were associated with a reduced incidence of neurological complications;OR 0.76 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.83);OR 0.68 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.90);OR 0.54, (95% CI 0.47 to 0.61) respectively. Conclusions and relevance: Treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir or both in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 was associated with reduced neurological complications in an additive manner, such that the greatest benefit was observed in patients who received both drugs together. The potential of these treatments to reduce neurological disability is of urgent importance to patients, healthcare systems and public health bodies.","output":"Impact of Dexamethasone and Remdesivir on Neurological Complications during COVID-19 (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its discovery in the Hubei province of China, the global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of COVID-19 cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The spread throughout Asia, Europe, and the Americas has presented one of the greatest infectious disease threats in recent history and has tested the capacity of global health infrastructures. Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we suggest that this application can be adapted to other states, small countries, or regions within a country to provide decision makers with critical information necessary to best protect human health.","output":"Development of an interactive, agent-based local stochastic model of COVID-19 transmission and evaluation of mitigation strategies illustrated for the state of Massachusetts, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the coronavirus pandemic has been the defining global health crisis of our time, public health officials have been sounding the alarm of another ominous threat for years: an impending antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis.

Here, we assessed the impact of airway epithelial cellular composition on infection in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of differentiated primary human tracheal (PTEC) and bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC). We first compared SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics, related antiviral and inflammatory responses, and viral entry factors in PTEC and PBEC. Next, the contribution of differentiation time was investigated by differentiating ALI-PTEC/PBEC for 3-5 weeks and comparing dynamics of viral replication/spread, cellular composition and epithelial responses. We observed a gradual increase in viral load with prolonged culture duration. Ciliated and goblet cells were predominantly infected in both PTEC and PBEC. Immunofluorescence analysis and RT-qPCR showed that compared to other cell types mainly ciliated and goblet cell numbers were affected by increased culture duration. An increased proportion of these two target cell types was associated with increased viral load. Furthermore, modulation of cellular composition using IL-13 and the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT, underlined the importance of both ciliated and goblet cells for infection. DAPT treatment resulted in a lower viral load and a relative increase in ciliated cells at the expense of goblet cells, compared to IL-13 treated cultures in which both cell types were present and viral load was higher. In conclusion, our results identify cellular composition as a contributing factor to airway epithelial susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCEIn this study, we determined an effect of culture duration and airway cellular composition of ALI-PBEC and ALI-PTEC cultures on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was increased with prolonged cell culture time and the total percentage and proportion of ciliated and goblet cells played an important role in infection level, suggesting that airway epithelial differentiation/maturation levels may in part determine susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The development of effective therapies either targeting virus replication or pathogenesis against SARS-CoV-2 requires robust cell culture-based infection models to test small molecules and biologicals. Therefore, it is important to identify factors that are essential for reliably modeling SARS-CoV-2-airway epithelial cell interactions. This study sheds light on virus-airway epithelial cell interactions and adds to the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism in the airways. In addition, the effect of IL-13 on viral infection hints at a causal connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and (allergic) asthma.","output":"Impact of human airway epithelial cellular composition on SARS-CoV-2 infection biology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been reported worldwide that the Zika virus (ZIKV) could be transmitted through placentas and sexual contact.

A total of 25 professional drivers from the WYDOT and trucking industry were recruited to participate in the driving simulator experiment. Participants' instantaneous speeds at various locations were collected to reveal the effects of CV TIMs on their speed selection. The results showed that average speed profiles under CV scenarios were generally lower than under baseline scenarios, particularly for winter conditions (snowy and severe weather). The variance of speed under CV scenarios was found to be significantly lower than the baseline scenarios, indicating that CV TIMs have the potential to harmonize the variations in speed. In addition, for the work zone driving simulator experiment, this research revealed that the mean time-to-collision (TTC) under baseline scenario is approximately 40 % lower than CV scenario, and the mean deceleration to avoid a crash (DRAC) under baseline scenario is approximately 19.3 % higher than CV scenario. These findings suggest that CV TIMs can reduce the risk of crashes.

The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up, and secondary outcomes will be intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and functional outcomes. All relevant studies will be identified through database searches. All study selection and data extraction will be conducted by two independent reviewers. We will conduct a random-effects meta-analysis to synthesise evidence for all outcomes. In addition, we will perform a subgroup analysis by disease process.

METHODS: 37 cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU of Huangshi Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital from February 1st to March 20th, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. 5 patients whose clinical data met the specific criteria were finally cataloged into death group (2 patients) and survival group (3 patients). The patient-specific three-dimensional airways were reconstructed from the central airways down to the 4th-5th bifurcation of the tracheobronchial tree. The volume changes of bronchi were calculated during the disease progression according to the comparison of two CT scans. Additionally, the changes of air flow resistance were analyzed using numerical simulation of CFD. RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that there was negative correlation between the change of volume (V) and the change of resistance (R) for all COVID-19 patients (r=-0.7025). For total airway volume, an average decrease of -11.41 15.71% was observed in death group compared to an average increase of 1.86 10.80% in survival group (p=0.0232). For air flow through airways in lower lobe, the resistance increases for death group by 10.97 77.66% and decreases for survival group by -45.49 42.04% (p=0.0246). CONCLUSION: The variation of flow resistance in the airway could be used as a non-invasive functional evaluation for the prognosis and outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19. The virtual pulmonary function test by integrating follow-up CT scans with patient-derived CFD analysis could be a potentially powerful way in improving the efficiency of treatment for critically ill patients with COVID-19.","output":"Airway resistance variation correlates with prognosis of critically ill COVID-19 patients: a computational fluid dynamics study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer stem cells (CSC) have been identified in several types of solid tumors.

This study aimed to investigate the association between changes in physical exercise behavior and subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed in Brazil and included a total of 595 individuals recruited through social media platforms, personal and professional contacts. Each participant responded to self-completed questionnaire via an online survey between March 29 and May 7, 2020. The characteristics of physical exercise (frequency, intensity, and duration) were collected before and during the pandemic. The subjective state of mood was measured through the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire during the pandemic. A generalized linear model was employed for the analysis. RESULTS: Exercising during the pandemic only promoted protective effects on the subjective mood. An exercise frequency of 3-5 days/week was associated with improved vigor and between 6-7 days/week with improved vigor and total mood when compared to not exercising at all (p < .005). A moderate intensity was associated with improved vigor, and a high intensity with improved vigor, total mood, and less fatigue in comparison to low-intensity exercise programs (p < 0.05). Maintaining the same duration of exercise sessions during the pandemic was associated with lower scores of depression/anxiety, fatigue and irritability, and improved vigor and total mood, while performing longer sessions with improved vigor when compared to short exercise sessions (p < .005).

The sensitivity and specificity of ULD CT for viral pneumonia detection were 98.9% and 99.0%, respectively. GGO, consolidation and fibrous stripes were equally visible in STD and ULD in 100% (n=97), 36% (n=35) and 23% (n=22) of compatible viral pneumonia-CT patients, respectively. Air bronchogram sign detection was equivalent, concerning 23% (n=22) of patients in STD and 22% (n=21) in ULD. Crazy paving was visible in 24% (n=23) of patients in STD and only 8% (n=8) in ULD (P=0.003). Conclusions In comparison to STD dose chest CT, ULD chest CT, with a mean reduction dose of 88.0%, has comparable diagnostic performance for detecting viral pneumonia on CT.","output":"Ultra-low-dose chest CT performance for the detection of viral pneumonia patterns during the COVID-19 outbreak period: a monocentric experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about COVID-19 outside Hubei. The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020. FINDINGS: A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein. On chest computed tomography (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later. INTERPRETATION: Most patients presented with a mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset. Nevetheless, some patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for COVID-19.

SETTING: The study was performed in a Jianghan module hospital constructed at the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan, China. This is 1 of the first 3 module hospitals. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: One thousand eight hundred forty-eight patients were admitted to the Jianghan module hospital, and 1327 cases (71.81% of the total number) were cured and discharged. Pharmacists have successfully completed the tasks of purchase, storage, and free distribution of drugs worth 1.03 million (approximately $146,000), reviewed about 20,000 electronic orders, provided one-on-one online medication consultation for 484 patients, and held 5 lectures on rational drug use knowledge, which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved. PRACTICE INNOVATION: The new COVID-19 module pharmaceutical care model is equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group, organizational structure for pharmacy administration, electronic control of drug prescription, and zero contact pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform WeChat. This platform provides relevant pharmaceutical care for patients, such as ensuring drug supply, setting up critical care drug trolleys, designing specific drug packaging bags, creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients, and other aspects. EVALUATION: With the continuous improvement of the module hospital and the progress in in-depth knowledge about COVID-19, some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation. RESULTS: The pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild COVID-19 disease. They not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug-induced risks through medication review and guidance, thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease. CONCLUSION: The new COVID-19 module pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China and thus can be implemented on a broader scale.","output":"Pharmacy administration and pharmaceutical care practice in a module hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study was conducted in nonintensive care unit COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care center, to assess the clinical profile and find surrogate markers to predict the severity of COVID-19 at the time of admission Methodology: It is a cross-sectional observational study Clinical and laboratory data were compiled of patients admitted in COVID wards in a tertiary care center Patients were stratified clinically according to the severity of COVID pneumonia The admission clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between the severe and nonsevere COVID patients Results: The study included 63 patients of which 46 were males, with a mean age of 47 years Patients were classified into mild (32%), moderate (19%), and severe (49%) categories according to national guidelines Fever (81%), cough (67%), and dyspnea (67%) were the most commonly observed symptoms In comparative analysis, mean C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and neutrophilClymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 patients and the admission PaCO2 significantly lower compared to nonsevere patients Conclusion: The study shows that raised NLR, CRP, serum ferritin, and low PaCO2 levels at the time of admission are important predictors of disease severity","output":"Clinical and laboratory profile of COVID-19 patients admitted at a tertiary care center in New Delhi and assessment of factors predicting disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To control the latent social risk of disease, the government usually spreads accurate information and attempts to improve the publics attitude toward adopting prevention. However, these methods with the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) model do not always work. Therefore, we used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to understand dog owners behavior and distinguished the knowledge effect as objective knowledge (OK) and subjective knowledge (SK). A total of 310 dog owners completed a questionnaire based on our model. We employed structural equation modeling to verify the structural relationships and found three main results. First, our model was fit, and each path was significant. People with better attitudes, stronger subjective norms, and more perceptive behavioral control have stronger behavioral intention. Second, perceived behavioral control, not attitude, was the best predictive index in this model. Finally, on perceived behavioral control, subjective knowledge showed more influence than objective knowledge. We successfully extended TPB to explain the behavioral intention of dog owners and presented more workable recommendations. To reduce the latent social risk of disease, the government should not only address dog owners attitudes, but also their subjective norms and perceptive behavioral control. Indeed, perceptive behavioral control and SK showed the most influence in this model. It is implied that the self-efficacy of dog owners is the most important factor in such a behavior. Therefore, the government should focus on enhancing dog owners self-efficacy first while devoted to prevention activities.","output":"How to Reduce the Latent Social Risk of Disease: The Determinants of Vaccination against Rabies in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study DesignRetrospective study Objective:Following SARS-CoV-2 pandemic break-out a lockdown period for the population and a reorganization of the Health System were needed Hub-function Centers for time-dependent diseases were identified and Niguarda Hospital (Milan) was selected as main Regional Trauma Center The purpose of our study is to report the experience of Niguarda Maxillofacial Trauma Team during this period, pointing out epidemiological changes in the presentation of trauma in comparison to the previous 3 years Methods:Two hundred and sixteen patients were admitted to the Emergency Department from 8th March 2020 to 8th May 2020 One hundred and eighty-one had a diagnosis of Major Trauma and 36 had also facial fractures;35 patients had isolated facial fractures Data were compared to the activity during the same period in 2017-2019 and statistical analysis was carried out concerning demographic and clinical characteristics, trauma dynamics and positivity to COVID-19 Results:Cumulative curves of patients admitted because of Major Trauma describe a superimposable linear trend in years 2017-2019, while 2020 shows an increase from April 16th Average age and number of more severe patients were higher than previous years Epidemiological changes concerned road accidents, accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists, interpersonal violence, suicide attempts and domestic accidents The incidence of facial fractures was confirmed through years and, according to its measured severity, 75% of patients required management COVID-19 positivity without systemic symptoms didn?t influence the type of treatment Conclusion:The COVID-19 lockdown offers a unique opportunity to study the reversal epidemiological effects on trauma","output":"Epidemiology of Maxillo-Facial Trauma During COVID-19 Lockdown: Reports From the Hub Trauma Center in Milan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The covid-19 virus has been linked to an acute outbreak of the disease that has passed for years.

Prior results showed that prevalence dropped during the first half of lockdown, with greater reductions in higher-prevalence northern regions. Methods REACT-1 is a series of community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab-positivity in England, designed to monitor the spread of the epidemic and thus increase situational awareness. Round 7 of REACT-1 commenced swab-collection on 13th November 2020. A prior interim report included data from 13th to 24th November 2020 for 105,122 participants. Here, we report data for the entire round with swab results obtained up to 3rd December 2020. Results Between 13th November and 3rd December (round 7) there were 1,299 positive swabs out of 168,181 giving a weighted prevalence of 0.94% (95% CI 0.87%, 1.01%) or 94 per 10,000 people infected in the community in England. This compares with a prevalence of 1.30% (1.21%, 1.39%) from 16th October to 2nd November 2020 (round 6), a decline of 28%. Prevalence during the latter half of round 7 was 0.91% (95% CI, 0.81%, 1.03%) compared with 0.96% (0.87%, 1.05%) in the first half. The national R number in round 7 was estimated at 0.96 (0.88, 1.03) with a decline in prevalence observed during the first half of this period no longer apparent during the second half at the end of lockdown. During round 7 there was a marked fall in prevalence in West Midlands, a levelling off in some regions and a rise in London. R numbers at regional level ranged from 0.60 (0.41, 0.80) in West Midlands up to 1.27 (1.04, 1.54) in London, where prevalence was highest in the east and south-east of the city. Nationally, between 13th November and 3rd December, the highest prevalence was in school-aged children especially at ages 13-17 years at 2.04% (1.69%, 2.46%), or approximately 1 in 50. Conclusion Between the previous round and round 7 (during lockdown), there was a fall in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity nationally, but it did not fall uniformly over time or by geography. Continued vigilance is required to reduce rates of infection until effective immunity at the population level can be achieved through the vaccination programme.","output":"REACT-1 round 7 updated report: regional heterogeneity in changes in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second national COVID-19 lockdown in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new coronavirus infectionin children in most cases is easier than in adult patients, however, some cases are characterized by a protracted course and duration of the release of SARS-CoV-2 virus The article presents own data monitoring of children with novel coronavirus infection with clinical case COVID-19- pneumonia, which appeared to slow reverse the development of infiltrative changes in the lungs according by the type of &gt; on computed tomography on the background of the relief of clinical symptoms of pneumonia negative results of smears from the oropharynx and nasopharynx on the determining of RNA of SARS - Cov-2 by PCR and a positive serological response in the form of increase of IgG-antibodies to COVID-19 with negative IgM-antibodies","output":"The course of coronavirus pneumonia in a teenager from the focus of infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM Infected necrotizing pancreatitis is a highly morbid disease managed by minimally invasive surgical (MIS) or endoscopy-based interventions. This meta-analysis compared the clinical outcomes of patients treated using either approach. METHODS MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to identify all randomized trials that compared MIS and endoscopy-based interventions for treatment of infected necrotizing pancreatitis. Main outcome measure was to compare rates of complications or death during 6-month follow-up. RESULTS Three studies involving 184 patients met inclusion criteria. While there was no significant difference in mortality (14.5 vs. 16.1%, risk ratio (RR) 1.02, p=0.963), new onset multiple organ failure (5.2 vs. 19.7%, RR=0.34, p=0.045), enterocutaneous fistula/perforation (3.6 vs. 17.9%, RR=0.34, p=0.034) and pancreatic fistula (4.2 vs. 38.2%, RR=0.13, p<0.001) were significantly lower for endoscopic interventions compared to MIS. There was no significant difference in intraabdominal bleeding, endocrine or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency between cohorts. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter for endoscopy (standardized mean difference, -0.41, p=0.010).

The developing prenatal brain is a highly dynamic tissue, but our understanding of key drivers of epigenetic variability across development is limited. We therefore assessed genomic methylation at over 39 million sites in the prenatal cortex using whole genome bisulfite sequencing and found loci and regions in which methylation levels are dynamic across development. We saw that DNAm at these loci was associated with nearby gene expression and enriched for enhancer chromatin states in prenatal brain tissue. Additionally, these loci were enriched for genes associated with psychiatric disorders and genes involved with neurogenesis. We also found autosomal differences in DNAm between the sexes during prenatal development, though these have less clear functional consequences. We lastly confirmed that the dynamic methylation at this critical period is specifically CpG methylation, with very low levels of CpH methylation.

Our study sought to identify the potential impact of the BioFire? FilmArray? Pneumonia Panel (FP Panel) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods Respiratory samples obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or tracheal aspiration (TA) from ICU patients with a diagnosis of HAP were tested by the FP panel in addition to routine bacterial cultures. In addition, the electronic health records of these patients were reviewed to determine what potential changes in antimicrobial therapy could have been implemented if the panel results were known to the treatment team in real-time. A cost analysis was also performed incorporating the cost of the pneumonia panel and the savings associated with the potential decrease of antibiotic use and avoidance of the rapid viral diagnostic panel. Results Fifty-six patients met the study criteria. The FP panel results could have prompted a change in therapy in 36 (64.3%) patients, with an anticipated mean reduction in time to optimized therapy of approximately 51 hours. In addition, the panel identified three cases where antimicrobials should have been altered because patients were not receiving empiric therapy with activity against the causative pathogen and 34 opportunities for antibiotic de-escalation. The cost analysis calculated an additional cost of $10 per patient associated with using the FP panel. Conclusions The FP panel could have prompted a change in therapy in about two-thirds of patients studied. Its potential benefits include a more rapid time to optimized therapy, reduced exposure to and cost of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and reduced cost of other rapid diagnostic tests.","output":"Evaluation of the Potential Impact of a Multiplex Rapid Diagnostic Panel in Critically Ill Patients With Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the roles of human rhinoviruses (HRVs) in acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in Chinese adults and determine the association between species of HRV and clinical presentations.

Iran, as one of those countries with the highest number of infected people, has officially reported 1812 deaths from a total number of 23049 confirmed infected cases that we used in the analysis. Materials and Methods: Geographic distribution by the map of calculated incidence rates for COVID -19 in Iran within the period was prepared by GIS 10.6 Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's I) and hot spot analysis were used to assess COVID -19 spatial patterns. The ordinary least square method was used to estimate the relationship between COVID -19 and the risk factors. The next step was to explore Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models that might better explain the variation in COVID -19 cases based on the environmental and socio-demographic factors. Results: The spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's I) result showed that COVID-19 cases in the studied area were in clustered patterns. For statistically significant positive z-scores, the larger the z-score is, the more intense the clustering of high values (hot spot), such as Semnan, Qom, Isfahan, Mazandaran, Alborz, and Tehran. Hot spot analysis detected clustering of a hot spot with confidence level 99% for Semnan, Qom, Isfahan, Mazandaran, Alborz, and Tehran, as well. The risk factors were removed from the model step by step. Finally, just the distance from the epicenter was adopted in the model. GWR efforts increased the explanatory value of risk factor with better special precision (adjusted R-squared = 0.44) Conclusion: The highest CIR was concentrated around Qom. Also, the greater the distance from the center of prevalence (Qom), the fewer the patients. Hot spot analysis also implies that the neighboring provinces of prevalence centers exhibited hot spots with a 99% confidence level. Furthermore, the results of OLS analysis showed the significant correlation of CIR is with the distance from epicenter (Qom). The GWR can result in the spatial granularity providing an opportunity to well understand the relationship between environmental spatial heterogeneity and COVID-19 risk as entailed by the infection of CIR with COVID-19, which would make it possible to better plan managerial policies for public health.
