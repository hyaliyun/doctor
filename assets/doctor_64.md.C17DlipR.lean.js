The diagnosis is usually made on various clinical findings. However, a missed case of acute appendicitis is a catastrophe as it later presents with life-threatening complications and results in medicolegal issues. Raised total leukocyte count (TLC) is a frequent finding in patients with acute appendicitis. As a convention, a normal leukocyte count usually rules out the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Recent studies claimed that a substantial proportion of patients with normal TLC also had acute appendicitis and warranted a careful evaluation of such cases before sending them home. However, the reported frequency of acute appendicitis among TLC normal patients varied greatly among studies which necessitated the present study. Aim Our aim was to determine the frequency of acute appendicitis in patients of normal TLC. Materials and methods This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Surgery, KRL Hospital Islamabad. This study was carried out from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2019. This study involved 238 patients of both genders aged between 12 and 70 years suspected of acute appendicitis on physical and ultrasound findings but with a normal TLC (4,500-11,000 WBCs/L). The outcome variable was the frequency of acute appendicitis among such patients which was diagnosed upon surgery (inflamed appendix with free fluid) and histopathology of excised tissue (mucosal inflammation, neutrophil infiltrates, wall necrosis). Frequency of acute appendicitis was compared across various age and gender groups. Written informed consent was obtained from every patient. Results The mean age of the patients was 27.415.5 years. Majority (n = 167, 70.2%) of the patients were aged 25 years, followed by 40 (16.8%) patients aged 46 years and 31 (13.0%) patients aged between 26 and 45 years. There were 135 (56.7%) male and 103 (43.3%) female patients with a male to female ratio of 1.3:1. All of the patients (100.0%) had pain in the right iliac fossa (RIF) while rebound tenderness, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, fever and dysuria were noted in 83.6%, 79.0%, 73.9%, 63.9% and 15.1% patients, respectively. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made in 198 (83.2%) patients with normal TLC and suspicion of acute appendicitis on physical findings and ultrasound. When stratified, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of acute appendicitis across various age (p-value = 0.988) and gender (p-value = 0.913) groups. Conclusion In the present study, contrary to the routine impression that normal TLC rules out the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis, a substantial proportion of patients with clinical and ultrasound suspicion of acute appendicitis but normal TLC had acute appendicitis which is worrisome as a missed case may later present with complications. The present study thus warrants cautious evaluation of clinically suspected cases with normal TLC count to avoid a missed appendicitis and improve the outcome in future surgical practice.","output":"Total Leukocyte Count Depicting the Degree of Inflammation in Acute Appendicitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ImportanceWith the emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), there is an urgent need for evidence about disease severity and the health care impacts of VOC in North America, particularly since a substantial proportion of the population have declined vaccination thus far. ObjectiveTo examine 30-day outcomes in Canadians infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of the pandemic and to compare event rates in those with VOC versus wild-type infection. DesignRetrospective cohort study using linked healthcare administrative datasets. SettingAlberta and Ontario, the two Canadian provinces that experienced the largest third wave in the spring of 2021. ParticipantsAll individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction swab from March 1, 2020 until March 31, 2021, with genomic confirmation of VOC screen-positive tests during February and March 2021 (wave 3). Exposure of InterestVOC versus wild type SARS-CoV-2 Main Outcomes and MeasuresAll-cause hospitalizations or death within 30 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab. ResultsCompared to the 372,741 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and January 2021 (waves 1 and 2 in Canada), there was a shift in transmission towards younger patients in the 104,232 COVID-19 cases identified in wave 3. As a result, although third wave patients were more likely to be hospitalized (aOR 1.34 [1.29-1.39] in Ontario and aOR 1.53 [95%CI 1.41-1.65] in Alberta), they had shorter lengths of stay (median 5 vs. 7 days, p<0.001) and were less likely to die within 30 days (aOR 0.66 [0.60-0.71] in Ontario and aOR 0.74 [0.62-0.89] in Alberta). However, within the third wave, patients infected with VOC (91% Alpha) exhibited higher risks of death (aOR 1.52 [1.27-1.81] in Ontario and aOR 1.67 [1.13-2.48] in Alberta) and hospitalization (aOR 1.57 [1.47-1.69] in Ontario and aOR 1.88 [1.74-2.02] in Alberta) than those with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infections during the same timeframe. Conclusions and RelevanceOn a population basis, the shift towards younger age groups as the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved translates into more hospitalizations but shorter lengths of stay and lower mortality risk than seen in the first 10 months of the pandemic in Canada. However, on an individual basis, infection with a VOC is associated with a higher risk of hospitalization or death than the original wild-type SARS-CoV-2 - this is important information to address vaccine hesitancy given the increasing frequency of VOC infections now.","output":"Lessons from the Covid-19 Third Wave in Canada: the Impact of Variants of Concern and Shifting Demographics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate clinical characteristics and long-term effects of SARS.

On short timescales, superspreading events lead to burstiness and overdispersion, whereas long-term persistent heterogeneity in susceptibility is expected to lead to a reduction in both the infection peak and the herd immunity threshold (HIT). Here, we develop a general approach to encompass both timescales, including time variations in individual social activity, and demonstrate how to incorporate them phenomenologically into a wide class of epidemiological models through reparameterization. We derive a nonlinear dependence of the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] on the susceptible population fraction S. We show that a state of transient collective immunity (TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the epidemic. However, this is a fragile state that wanes over time due to changing levels of social activity, and so the infection peak is not an indication of long-lasting herd immunity: Subsequent waves may emerge due to behavioral changes in the population, driven by, for example, seasonal factors. Transient and long-term levels of heterogeneity are estimated using empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic and from real-life face-to-face contact networks. These results suggest that the hardest hit areas, such as New York City, have achieved TCI following the first wave of the epidemic, but likely remain below the long-term HIT. Thus, in contrast to some previous claims, these regions can still experience subsequent waves.","output":"Time-dependent heterogeneity leads to transient suppression of the COVID-19 epidemic, not herd immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atmospheric components that can influence climate change can be classified as long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), according to their lifetimes in the atmosphere.

Some staff use NIV as the rescue therapy which might lead to the adverse outcomes. This study was to identify early factors associated with intubation to help the medical staff select appropriate patients for receiving NIV treatment. Methods: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were treated with NIV in emergency department or ICU of the Third People's Hospital (the only designated hospital for treating COVID-19 in Shenzhen) between January 1 and August 31, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Thirty-nine patients with COVID-19 treated with NIV were included; of them, 16 (41%) received endotracheal intubation and 3 (8%) died. Significant differences were observed between intubated and non-intubated patients in PaO(2)/FiO(2) before NIV initiation, hospitalization duration, NIV as the rescue therapy, and PaO(2)/FiO(2) of 200 mmHg after 1C2 h of NIV initiation. Notably, 1C2 h after NIV initiation, a PaO(2)/FiO(2) of 200 mmHg (odds ratio [OR], 9.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.84C47.62; P = 0.007) and NIV as the rescue therapy (OR, 5.43; 95% CI, 1.09C27.12; P = 0.039) were the risk factors for intubation. Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure receiving NIV, close attention should be paid to PaO(2)/FiO(2) after 1C2 h of NIV initiation.

Identification of a reliable risk-stratification tool for COVID-19 patients is necessary for appropriate resource allocation, selection of clinical management pathways, and guidance of goals of care conversations with families and caregivers in the critical care setting. The Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scoring system is one of several predictive models used to classify illness severity and estimate mortality risk on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Our retrospective study sought to evaluate the prognostic ability of the APACHE II score in COVID-19 patients according to endpoints of mortality and length of stay (LOS) as well as unfavorable clinical outcomes, including development of acute renal failure (ARF) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) and acute venous thromboembolic events (VTE). Methods This multicenter retrospective cohort study evaluated a randomized sample of 3,102 patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease admitted to the ICU from January 2020 to May 2020. A total of 395 patients with complete data points for appropriate APACHE II score calculation, absence of the preexisting comorbidities end-stage renal disease, and history of VTE were included. Linear and logistic regression models were employed to evaluate primary outcomes of mortality and LOS as well as secondary outcomes of VTE and ARF requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or hemodialysis (HD). Key results Among the 395 patients enrolled, total percent mortality and mean LOS were 37.0% and 12.92 days, respectively. Primary outcome analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in odds of mortality as well as in mean LOS with every additional point increase in APACHE II score from a baseline of zero. Specifically, for every point increase in the APACHE II score, odds of mortality increased by 12% (p value < 0.001), and average LOS increased by 0.2 days (p value < 0.001). In our secondary outcome analysis, 14.43% and 62.2% of the total sample population developed ARF requiring RRT and VTE, respectively. For every additional point increase in APACHE II score from a baseline of zero, odds of requiring CRRT or HD increased by 10% on average (95% CI (1.06, 1.15); p value < 0.001). Similarly, for every additional point increase in the APACHE II score from a baseline of zero, there was a corresponding increase in odds of VTE by 19% (95% CI (1.14, 1.24); p value < 0.001). Conclusions The APACHE II score is an effective predictive model of in-hospital mortality and unfavorable clinical outcomes, including prolonged LOS, ARF requiring CRRT or HD, and development of VTE.

Determinants of COVID-19 outcomes among patients with psoriasis are yet to be established. OBJECTIVE: Th objective of this study was to characterize a large cohort of patients with psoriasis with COVID-19 and to identify predictors of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: A population-based nested case-control study was performed using the computerized database of Clalit Health Services, Israel. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence (CIs) of predictors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: The study population included 3151 patients with psoriasis who tested positive for COVID-19. Subclinical COVID-19 infection occurred in 2818 (89.4%) of the patients while 122 (3.9%), 71 (2.3%), 123 (3.9%), and 16 (0.5%) of the patients experienced a mild, moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Overall, 332 (10.5%) patients were hospitalized and 50 (1.6%) patients died because of COVID-19 complications. Intake of methotrexate independently predicted COVID-19-associated hospitalization (adjusted OR 2.30; 95% CI 1.11C4.78; p = 0.025). Use of biologic agents was not associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalization (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.32C1.73; p = 0.491) or mortality (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.12C6.21; p = 0.870). Older age, the presence of comorbid cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal failure independently predicted both COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality.

Improved characterization of specific respiratory pathogens by identifying frequent signs, symptoms and demographic characteristics, along with improving our understanding of coinfection rates and seasonality, may improve treatment and prevention measures. METHODS: Febrile respiratory illness (FRI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance was conducted from October 2011 through March 2013 among three US populations: civilians near the USCMexico border, Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries, and military recruits. Clinical and demographic questionnaire data and respiratory swabs were collected from participants, tested by PCR for nine different respiratory pathogens and summarized. Age stratified characteristics of civilians positive for influenza and recruits positive for rhinovirus were compared to other and no/unknown pathogen. Seasonality and coinfection rates were also described. RESULTS: A total of 1444 patients met the FRI or SARI case definition and were enrolled in this study. Influenza signs and symptoms varied across age groups of civilians. Recruits with rhinovirus had higher percentages of pneumonia, cough, shortness of breath, congestion, cough, less fever and longer time to seeking care and were more likely to be male compared to those in the no/unknown pathogen group. Coinfections were found in 6% of all FRI/SARI cases tested and were most frequently seen among children and with rhinovirus infections. Clear seasonal trends were identified for influenza, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. CONCLUSIONS: The age-stratified clinical characteristics associated with influenza suggest that age-specific case definitions may improve influenza surveillance and identification. Improving identification of rhinoviruses, the most frequent respiratory infection among recruits, may be useful for separating out contagious individuals, especially when larger outbreaks occur.

It appears likely that most of these are not caused by viral brain invasion but by systemic accompaniments of critical illness such as coagulopathy, deleteriously upregulated immune response, autoimmune mechanisms, hypoxia or multiorgan failure. Anosmia or hyposmia is present in a majority of COVID-19 patients, and there is early and severe involvement of the nasopharyngeal mucosa and olfactory epithelium. Preliminary studies by our group have found massive gene expression changes in olfactory bulb, but the magnitude of these changes are not different between subjects with detectable versus non-detectable olfactory bulb SARS-CoV-2 RNA. As spontaneous discharge of olfactory epithelial afferents dictates intra-olfactory bulb neurophysiological activity and connectivity, we hypothesized that olfactory bulb deafferentation during COVID-19 is responsible for a large fraction of our observed olfactory bulb transcriptional changes. As the olfactory marker protein (OMP-1) is a specific marker of olfactory epithelial afferents to the olfactory bulb and is severely depleted in animal model lesions of olfactory epithelium, we quantified OMP-1-immunoreactivity in the olfactory bulb of subjects dying with or without COVID-19. Additionally, we quantified olfactory bulb tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which is often also reduced after olfactory epithelium lesions, and SNAP-25, a pan-synaptic marker. COVID-19 cases (n = 18) were generally elderly and were not significantly different in age or gender distribution from the non-COVID-19 cases (n = 28). Both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases had a wide range of neuropathological diagnoses. The area occupied by OMP-1 immunoreactivity in COVID-19 cases was significantly less, about 60% of that in control cases but amongst subjects with COVID-19, there was no significant difference between OBT-SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive and negative cases. There were no significant group differences for TH or SNAP-25, supporting a selective effect for OMP-1. We suggest that olfactory dysfunction, and some of the COVID-19-associated transcriptional changes that we have reported for the olfactory bulb and amygdala, may be due to olfactory bulb deafferentation and subsequent transsynaptic effects. Additionally, animal models of olfactory bulb deafferentation or bulbectomy indicate a possibility for widespread changes in interconnected brain regions, providing a possible substrate for diverse post-acute COVID-19 neurological sequelae.","output":"Deafferentation of Olfactory Bulb in Subjects Dying with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019 the worlds population was tested by the presence of the COVID-19 virus which in a short time was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

In the severe NCP, the sys-temic manifestations of the disease were also demonstrated, and one of the rare complications, first described in Wuhan (China), is pneumothorax. Case report. A 65-year-old female was admitted to the Clinic for Pulmonology with a high fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, and general weakness that started five days before. Laboratory findings revealed lympho-penia, elevated values of inflammatory markers, and liver le-sion. A chest X-ray (CXR) demonstrated diffusely accentuated interstitial pattern and reduced parenchymal transparency, left perihilar. Positive SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab sam-ple was detected in the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), confirming the diagnosis of NCP. Immediately, nasal oxygen therapy with a flow rate of 8 L/min, with chloroquine phosphate, antibiotics, and symp-tomatic treatment, was initiated.

The patient was released from the hospital in good general condition with normal arterial blood gases. Conclusion. Pneumothorax may develop as a complication in patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, without previous pulmonary comorbidities, due to alveolar damage. Acute deterioration with rapid oxygen desaturation in these patients should raise the suspicion of pneumothorax. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are nec-essary to reduce mortality.","output":"Pneumothorax in a patient with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, residential lockdowns were implemented in numerous cities in China to contain the rapid spread of the disease. Although these stringent regulations effectively slowed the spread of COVID-19, they may have posed challenges to the well-being of residents. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the effects of residential lockdown on the subjective well-being (SWB) of individuals in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1790 Sina Weibo users who were residents of cities that imposed residential lockdowns, of which 1310 users (73.18%) were female, and 3580 users who were residents of cities that were not locked down (gender-matched with the 1790 lockdown residents). In both the lockdown and nonlockdown groups, we calculated SWB indicators during the 2 weeks before and after the enforcement date of the residential lockdown using individuals original posts on Sina Weibo. SWB was calculated via online ecological recognition, which is based on established machine learning predictive models. RESULTS: The interactions of time (before the residential lockdown or after the residential lockdown)  area (lockdown or nonlockdown) in the integral analysis (N=5370) showed that after the residential lockdown, compared with the nonlockdown group, the lockdown group scored lower in some negative SWB indicators, including somatization (F(1,5368)=13.593, P<.001) and paranoid ideation (F(1,5368)=14.333, P<.001). The interactions of time (before the residential lockdown or after the residential lockdown)  area (developed or underdeveloped) in the comparison of residential lockdown areas with different levels of economic development (N=1790) indicated that the SWB of residents in underdeveloped areas showed no significant change after the residential lockdown (P>.05), while that of residents in developed areas changed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings increase our understanding of the psychological impact and cost of residential lockdown during an epidemic. The more negative changes in the SWB of residents in developed areas imply a greater need for psychological intervention under residential lockdown in such areas.","output":"Subjective Well-Being of Chinese Sina Weibo Users in Residential Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Machine Learning Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We show that the acceleration index, a novel indicator that measures acceleration and deceleration of viral spread (Baunez et al. 2020a,b), is essentially a test-controlled version of the reproduction number. As such it is a more accurate indicator to track the dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak in real time. We indicate a discrepancy between the acceleration index and the reproduction number, based on the infectivity and test rates and we provide a formal decomposition of this difference. When applied to French data for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our decomposition shows that the reproduction number consistently underestimates the resurgence of the pandemic since the summer of 2020, compared to the acceleration index which accounts for the time-varying volume of tests. From the comparison that we present here follows that the acceleration index is a sufficient statistic to track the pandemic's propagation, as it captures in real time the sizeable time variation featured by viral circulation.","output":"The Acceleration Index as a Test-Controlled Reproduction Number: Application to COVID-19 in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It remains uncertain whether Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a true neoplasm, in that it regresses after removal of the stimulus to growth (as HHV8) when immunosuppression is reduced. We aimed to summarize the available evidence on somatic mutations and clonality within KS to assess whether KS is a neoplasm or not. METHODS: Medline and Web of Science were searched until September 2020 for articles on clonality or mutation in KS. Search strings were supervised by expert librarians, and two researchers independently performed study selection and data extraction. An adapted version of the QUADAS2 tool was used for methodological quality appraisal. RESULTS: Of 3077 identified records, 20 publications reported on relevant outcomes and were eligible for qualitative synthesis. Five studies reported on clonality, 10 studies reported on various mutations, and 5 studies reported on chromosomal aberrations in KS. All studies were descriptive and were judged to have a high risk of bias. There was considerable heterogeneity of results with respect to clonality, mutation and cytogenetic abnormalities as well as in terms of types of lesions and patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: While KS certainly produces tumours, the knowledge is currently insufficient to determine whether KS is a clonal neoplasm (sarcoma), or simply an aggressive reactive virus-driven lesion.","output":"Clonality, Mutation and Kaposi Sarcoma: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic and its related restrictions have affected attendance to and delivery of UK sexual healthcare services (SHS). We surveyed the impact on sexual behaviour of men having sex with men (MSM) to inform future SHS provision. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional, anonymous, web-based survey among HIV-negative MSM at high risk of HIV infection who attended 56 Dean Street, a sexual health and HIV clinic. The survey was conducted over a 7-day period in August 2020. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour and related mental well-being experienced during lockdown (defined as 23 March-30 June 2020) were extracted. Categorical and non-categorical variables were compared according to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use. RESULTS 814 MSM completed the questionnaire: 75% were PrEP users; 76% reported they have been sexually active, of which 76% reported sex outside their household. 75% reported fewer partners than prior to lockdown. Isolation/loneliness (48%) and anxiety/stress (27%) triggered sexual activity, and 73% had discussed COVID-19 transmission risks with their sexual partners. While 46% reported no change to emotions ordinarily experienced following sex, 20% reported guilt for breaching COVID-19 restrictions. 76% implemented one or more changes to their sexual behaviour, while 58% applied one or more steps to reduce COVID-19 transmission during sex. 36% accessed SHS and 30% reported difficulties in accessing testing/treatment. Of those who accessed SHS, 28% reported an STI diagnosis. PrEP users reported higher partner number, engagement in 'chemsex' and use of SHS than non-PrEP users. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 restrictions had a considerable impact on sexual behaviour and mental well-being in our survey respondents. High rates of sexual activity and STI diagnoses were reported during lockdown. Changes to SHS provision for MSM must respond to high rates of psychological and STI-related morbidity and the challenges faced by this population in accessing services.","output":"COVID-19 restrictions and changing sexual behaviours in HIV-negative MSM at high risk of HIV infection in London, UK."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hypothalamicCpituitaryCadrenal axis is a tightly regulated system that represents one of the bodys mechanisms for responding to acute and chronic stress.

Coagulation standard parameters were also evaluated. Forty patients were enrolled into the study. The ICU and the hospital mortality were 10% and 12.5%, respectively. On ICU admission, prothrombin time was slightly reduced and it increased significantly at T10 (T0 = 65.1  9.8 vs T10 = 85.7  1.5, p = 0.002), while activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen values were higher at T0 than T10 (32.2  2.9 vs 27.2  2.1, p = 0.017 and 895.1  110 vs 332.5  50, p = 0.002, respectively); moreover, whole blood thromboelastometry profiles were consistent with hypercoagulability characterized by an acceleration of the propagation phase of blood clot formation [i.e., CFT below the lower limit in INTEM 16/40 patients (40%) and EXTEM 20/40 patients (50%)] and significant higher clot strength [MCF above the upper limit in INTEM 20/40 patients (50%), in EXTEM 28/40 patients (70%) and in FIBTEM 29/40 patients (72.5%)]; however, this hypercoagulable state persists in the first five days, but it decreases ten day after, without returning to normal values.

Second, we compare and contrast these two behaviours, and identify individual anomalous cryptocurrencies. Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD) are consistent outliers with respect to their returns, while Holo (HOT), NEXO (NEXO), Maker (MKR) and NEM (XEM) are frequently observed as anomalous with respect to both behaviours and time.

Some cardiac defects may be associated with a poor COVID-19 outcome. Risk estimation in ACHD is currently based on expert opinion. The aim of this study was to collect clinical outcome data and to identify risk factors for a complicated course of COVID-19 in patients with ACHD. METHODS: Twenty-five ACHD centres in nine European countries participated in the study. Consecutive patients with ACHD diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting to one of the participating centres between 27 March and 6 June 2020 were included. A complicated disease course was defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation and/or inotropic support, or a fatal outcome. RESULTS: Of 105 patients with a mean age of 3813 years (58% women), 13 had a complicated disease course, of whom 5 died. In univariable analysis, age (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, per 5 years), &#8805;2 comorbidities (OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 24.5), body mass index of >25 kg/m2 (OR 7.2, 95% CI 1.9 to 28.3) and cyanotic heart disease (OR 13.2, 95% CI 2.5 to 68.4) were associated with a complicated disease course. In a multivariable logistic regression model, cyanotic heart disease was the most important predictor (OR 60.0, 95% CI 7.6 to 474.0). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ACHD, general risk factors (age, obesity and multiple comorbidities) are associated with an increased risk of complicated COVID-19 course.

We therefore investigated whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 in the UK Biobank. Method 502,640 participants aged 40C69 years at baseline (54C79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK 2006C10. A modified assessment of frailty using Frieds classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available 16/03/2020C01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Results 4,510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive = 1,326, negative = 3,184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR = 1.4 [95%CI = 1.1, 1.8]), report slow walking speed (OR = 1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid (4 comorbidity groupings vs 0C1: OR = 1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Furthermore, frailty and multimorbidity were not associated with COVID-19 diagnoses, when comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. Conclusions Frailty and multimorbidity do not appear to aid risk stratification, in terms of a positive versus negative results of COVID-19 testing.

We recruited primary care physicians (PCPs) and measured PIM use in a sample of their patients (65 years or older). Educational workshops for PCPs were organized with the involvement of clinician champions. Practical deprescribing algorithms were designed based on Beers criteria. Automatic email alerts based on specific PIMs recorded in each patient's electronic health record were used as a reminder tool. PCPs were responsible for deprescribing decisions. We randomly sampled 879 patients taking PIMs from eight of the most commonly used drug classes at our institution and compared basal (6 months prior to the intervention) and final (12 months after) prevalence of PIM use using a test of proportions.

We investigated the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and maternal deaths in Brazil and their association with social determinants of health. METHODS: This was a population-based ecological study with a spatial analysis of all cases and deaths of COVID-19 in the obstetric population. Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in the obstetric population, social vulnerability, health inequities, and health system capacity at the municipal level were obtained from several publicly sources in Brazil. A Bayesian empirical local model was used to identify fluctuations of the indicators. Spatial statistic tests were used to identity the spatial clusters and measure the municipalities risk of COVID-19 in the obstetric population. Beta regression was used to characterise the association between socio-economic indicators and the burden of COVID-19. FINDINGS: A total of 13,858 cases and 1,396 deaths due to COVID-19 were recorded in Brazil from March 2020 to June 2021. There was a variation in the number of cases per municipality, with 105 municipalities with rates from 2,210 to 3,884 cases and 45 municipalities with rates from 3,884 to 7,418 cases per 100,000 live births. The maternal mortality ratio also varied widely across municipalities. There was a spatial dependence on smoothed maternal mortality rates (I Moran 0?10; P = 0?010), and 15 municipalities had higher risk of maternal deaths. Municipalities characterized by lower health resources and higher socioeconomic inequalities presented the highest rates of incidence and maternal mortality by COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: In Brazil, COVID-19 cases and deaths in the obstetric population had a heterogeneous geographical distribution, with well-defined spatial clusters mostly located in the countryside. Municipalities with a high degree of socioeconomic dissimilarities showed higher maternal mortality rates than areas with better social and infrastructure indicators.

To enlarge the datasets for developing machine learning methods, it is essentially helpful to aggregate the cases from different medical systems for learning robust and generalizable models.

We build a powerful backbone by redesigning the recently proposed COVID-Net in aspects of network architecture and learning strategy to improve the prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. On top of our improved backbone, we further explicitly tackle the cross-site domain shift by conducting separate feature normalization in latent space. Moreover, we propose to use a contrastive training objective to enhance the domain invariance of semantic embeddings for boosting the classification performance on each dataset.

The results of the component dynamic analyses in the different development stages showed that the percentages of protein, fat, and chitin were the highest in the larval stage, pupal stage, and adult stage, respectively. The results of amino acid composition dynamic analysis also indicated comparatively higher essential amino acids in the earlier instar (e.g., before the 9th instar) larvae. Therefore, we found that the earlier instar is better than the final instar as the insect farming harvest time. Furthermore, the larvae in the earlier instar consumed dramatically less feed and could effectively reduce the farming costs of insect farmers.

METHODOLOGY: We collected, at the time of admission, routine clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters of hypoxia, lung damage, inflammation, and organ dysfunction in a consecutive series of 50 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Respiratory Disease and Infectious Disease Units of the University Hospital of Sassari (North-Sardinia, Italy) and alive on discharge. RESULTS: Prolonged HS (PHS, >21 days) patients had significantly lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio and lymphocytes, and significantly higher Chest CT severity score, C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) when compared to non-PHS patients. In univariate logistic regression, Chest CT severity score (OR = 1.1891, p = 0.007), intensity of care (OR = 2.1350, p = 0.022), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (OR = 0.9802, p = 0.007), CRP (OR = 1.0952, p = 0.042) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (OR = 1.0039, p = 0.036) were significantly associated with PHS.

Eighty-one anatomists, from 29 countries responded to the survey; 80% indicated that they required medical/health-care students to dissect human cadavers (60% females-86% males, p=0.02). Most teachers recorded that dissection was an instrument for training undergraduate students, an instrument for the development of professional skills, and an instrument to help to control emotions in the future doctor rather than being only a means of teaching/learning anatomy facts. Males were more receptive to the concept that dissection helps to control emotions in the future doctor (p=0.02). Most teachers (75%) said they were willing to donate their bodies, 41% saying they would donate body organs only, 9% would donate their entire bodies only, 25% would separately donate organs and also the entire body. The willingness to donate increased significantly with the years of teaching experience (p=0.04).

Empirical research data were collected through a survey of 535 tourists to Nanjing's Confucian Temple, China, which is known for its tremendous travel volume. The results show that both crowding perception and popular perception significantly affect loyalty, but with opposite signs. Moreover, if tourists have been vaccinated, the positive effect of destination attractiveness on loyalty will intensify, meaning that the rarely investigated variable vaccination status indeed plays a moderating role.","output":"Crowding and vaccination: Tourist's two-sided perception on crowding and the moderating effect of vaccination status during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions in providing diabetes services, we have developed an innovative pump training program, which consisted of technical session, pump training, one in-person practical session, and four consecutive online sessions (Skype Meet Now).

An allograft kidney biopsy demonstrated thrombotic microangiopathy, without clinical or laboratory features of systemic involvement. Based on the timing of drug initiation preceding thrombotic microangiopathy, complete recovery after drug withdrawal, and the absence of other etiologies, it was concluded that pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was the likely cause of kidney-limited thrombotic microangiopathy. When pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was resumed, the patient developed hypertension and kidney allograft dysfunction. A new kidney biopsy was not performed because of the overall risk benefit. The case highlights the importance of recognizing novel etiologies of thrombotic microangiopathy in kidney transplant patients with malignancy. Although Kaposi sarcoma has not been linked to thrombotic microangiopathy, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has been increasingly associated with drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy.

Its subsequent evolution has led to emergence of multiple sublineages, many of which are well-mixed between countries. AIM: Here, we aim to study the emergence and spread of the Delta lineage in Russia. METHODS: We use a phylogeographic approach to infer imports of Delta sublineages into Russia, and phylodynamic models to assess the rate of their spread. RESULTS: We show that nearly the entire Delta epidemic in Russia has probably descended from a single import event despite genetic evidence of multiple Delta imports. Indeed, over 90% of Delta samples in Russia are characterized by the nsp2:K81N+ORF7a:P45L pair of mutations which is rare outside Russia, putting them in the AY.122 sublineage. The AY.122 lineage was frequent in Russia among Delta samples from the start, and has not increased in frequency in other countries where it has been observed, suggesting that its high prevalence in Russia has probably resulted from a random founder effect.

The purpose of this study was to describe birth experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic centering the birthing person's perspective. METHODS: A survey was e-mailed to users of the Ovia Pregnancy app reaching a national convenience sample who gave birth between March 1, 2020, and June 11, 2020. Survey topics included birth location, the Mothers on Respect index, and open-ended questions capturing patient perspectives on the pandemic's effect on their birth experiences. Differences were assessed based on state-level COVID rate and by race. Content analysis was performed to analyze open-ended responses. RESULTS: Respondents from highly impacted COVID-19 states more frequently changed or considered changing their birth location. Racial differences were also found with Black respondents reporting significantly more preterm births and lower respect scores when compared to White respondents. Six themes emerged from the content analysis: Institutional Policies, Changes in Care, Hospital Staff Interactions, Sub-par Care, Issues of Support, and Mental Health.

Moreover, protecting human security in the borders of Indonesia and PNG is vitally important in times of COVID-19. The two countries have ensured the closing of the border areas in January 2020 as well as the deployment of security forces along the borders. Both nations have also successfully implemented repatriation of their citizens from PNG to Indonesia and vice versa through PLBN (Cross-Border Post) in Skouw Jayapura. The case study demonstrates how the high number of recorded cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia has not resulted in transfers of the virus over the PNG border.

All attendees were required to provide documentation of either a positive serologic test result* within the past 3 months or a negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests result for SARS-CoV-2 7 days before travel, to self-quarantine within their households for 7 days before travel, and to wear masks during travel. On 15 July, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services began an investigation after being notified that two students at the retreat had received positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results. WDHS offered RT-PCR testing to attendees on 28 July and serologic testing on August 5 and 6. Seventy-eight attendees received positive RT-PCR results, and 38 met clinical criteria for COVID-19 without a positive RT-PCR result. By the end of the retreat, 118 persons had received a positive serologic test result. Among 24 attendees with a documented positive serologic test result before the retreat, all received negative RT-PCR results. After RT-PCR testing on 28 July, WDHS recommended that remaining susceptible persons (asymptomatic and with negative RT-PCR test results) quarantine from other students and staff members at the retreat. Recommended end dates for isolation or quarantine were based on established guidance and determined in coordination with CDC.

RESULTS: Higher BMI categories were associated with higher risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test compared with the normal weight category (class 3 obesity adjusted relative risk: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.28-1.42). Among 25,952 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, class 3 obesity was associated with higher risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted HR [aHR]: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.35-2.32) and mortality (aHR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.12-1.78) compared with normal weight individuals.

Therefore, understanding the process of this change at the molecular level facilitates the design of therapeutic agents. With the help of coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations, we provide evidence showing that the conformational dynamics of the S protein are globally cooperative. Importantly, an allosteric path was discovered that correlates the motion of the RBD with the motion of the junction between the subdomain 1 (SD1) and the subdomain 2 (SD2) of the S protein. Building on this finding, we designed non-RBD binding modulators to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by prohibiting the conformational change of the S protein. Their inhibition effect and function stages at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated experimentally.

MATERIAL 120 survivors from patients admitted with COVID 19 were prospectively followed up for 6 weeks after their discharge from the hospital. The cohort included 50 patients requiring Intensive care unit (ICU) care and 70 ward patients. The follow-up was conducted on the second and sixth week after discharge with a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was filled by the patient/ bystanders during their visit to the hospital for follow-up at 2 weeks and through telephone follow up at 6 weeks.

To date, there are few empirical estimates of IFR published due to challenges in measuring infection rates. Outside of closed, closely surveilled populations where infection rates can be monitored through viral surveillance, we must rely on indirect measures of infection, like specific antibodies. Representative seroprevalence studies provide an important avenue for estimating the number of infections in a community, and when combined with death counts can lead to robust estimates of the IFR. We estimated overall and age-specific IFR for the canton of Geneva, Switzerland using age-stratified daily case and death incidence reports combined with five weekly population-based seroprevalence estimates. From February 24th to June 2nd there were 5'039 confirmed cases and 286 reported deaths within Geneva (population of 506'765). We inferred age-stratified (5-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-65 and 65+) IFRs by linking the observed number of deaths to the estimated number of infected individuals from each serosurvey. We account for the delays between infection and seroconversion as well as between infection and death. Inference is drawn in a Bayesian framework that incorporates uncertainty in seroprevalence estimates (supplement). Of the 286 reported deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, the youngest person to die was 31 years old. Infected individuals younger than 50 years experienced statistically similar IFRs (range 0.00032-0.0016%), which increases to 0.14% (95% CrI 0.096-0.19) for those 50-64 years old to 5.6% (95% CrI 4.3-7.4) for those 65 years and older (supplement). After accounting for demography and age-specific seroprevalence, we estimate a population-wide IFR of 0.64% (95% CrI 0.38-0.98). Our results are subject to two notable limitations. Among the 65+ age group that died of COVID-19 within Geneva, 50% were reported among residents of assisted care facilities, where around 0.8% of the Geneva population resides. While the serosurvey protocol did not explicitly exclude these individuals, they are likely to have been under-represented. This would lead to an overestimation of the IFR in the 65+ age group if seroprevalence in this institutionalized population was higher than in the general population (supplement). Further, our IFR estimates are based on current evidence regarding post-infection antibody kinetics, which may differ between severe and mild infections. If mild infections have significantly lower and short-lived antibody responses, our estimates of IFR may be biased upwards. Estimates of IFR are key for understanding the true pandemic burden and for weighing different risk reduction strategies. The IFR is not solely determined by host and pathogen biology, but also by the capacity of health systems to treat severe cases. Despite having among the highest per capita incidence in Switzerland, Geneva's health system accommodated the influx of cases needing intensive care (peak of 80/110 ICU-beds including surge capacity) while maintaining care quality standards. As such, our IFR estimates can be seen as a best-case scenario with respect to health system capacity. Our results reveal that population-wide estimates of IFR mask great heterogeneity by age and point towards the importance of age-targeted interventions to reduce exposures among those at highest risk of death.","output":"Serology-informed estimates of SARS-COV-2 infection fatality risk in Geneva, Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As of 30 April 2020, 203.715 SARS-CoV-2 infections had been reported in Spain, 54.486 in Madrid, 21.4% were health care workers.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the potential spread of infectious diseases for a broad selection of oxygen and respiratory support methods by revealing the therapy-induced aerodynamics and respiratory droplet dispersion. METHODS: The exhaled air-smoke plume from a 3D-printed upper airway geometry was visualized by recording light reflection during simulated spontaneous breathing, standard oxygen mask application, nasal high-flow therapy (NHFT), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The dispersion of 100 m particles was estimated from the initial velocity of exhaled air and the theoretical terminal velocity. RESULTS: Estimated droplet dispersion was 16 cm for unassisted breathing, 10 cm for Venturi masks, 13 cm for the nebulizer, and 14 cm for the nonrebreathing mask. Estimated droplet spread increased up to 34 cm in NHFT, 57 cm in BiPAP, and 69 cm in CPAP. A nonsurgical face mask over the NHFT interface reduced estimated droplet dispersion. CONCLUSIONS: During NHFT and CPAP/BiPAP with vented masks, extensive jets with relatively high jet velocities were observed, indicating increased droplet spread and an increased risk of droplet-driven virus transmission. For the Venturi masks, a nonrebreathing mask, and a nebulizer, estimated jet velocities are comparable to unassisted breathing. Aerosols are transported unboundedly in all these unfiltered therapies.

The modulation of host-virus interactions is a promising strategy to combat the virus; however, the interactions between the host and avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV) are unclear. Using genome-wide transcriptome studies in combination with a bioinformatic analysis, we identified proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) to be an important modulator of ILTV infection. Src controls the virulence of ILTV and is phosphorylated upon ILTV infection. Functional studies revealed that Src prolongs the survival of host cells by increasing the threshold of virus-induced cell death. Therefore, Src is essential for viral replication in vitro and in ovo but is not required for ILTV-induced cell death. Furthermore, our results identify a positive-feedback loop between Src and the tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is necessary for the phosphorylation of either Src or FAK and is required for Src to modulate ILTV infection. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify a key host regulator controlling host-ILTV interactions. We believe that our findings have revealed a new potential therapeutic target for ILT control and therapy. IMPORTANCE Despite the extensive administration of live attenuated vaccines starting from the mid-20th century and the administration of recombinant vaccines in recent years, infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) outbreaks due to avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV) occur worldwide annually.

An NLR cut-off was identified, and stratified analyses were performed by age and sex. Also, another biomarker was tested as an exposure (the systemic immune-inflammation index CSII). Results: 55.3% of the patients were men, with a mean age of 66.8 years. Roughly 13% of the patients had delirium during hospitalization.

Comparison of RSV and influenza infection in hospitalized older adults may increase awareness of adult RSV disease burden. METHODS: Hospitalized adults aged 60 years who tested positive for RSV or influenza between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2015 were identified from Kaiser Permanente Southern California electronic medical records. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, utilization, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: The study included 645 RSV- and 1878 influenza-infected hospitalized adults. Patients with RSV were older than those with influenza (mean, 78.5 vs 77.4 years; P = .035) and more likely to have congestive heart failure (35.3% vs 24.5%; P < .001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (29.8% vs 24.3%; P = .006) at baseline. In adjusted analyses, RSV infection was associated with greater odds of length of stay 7 days (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2C1.8; P < .001); pneumonia (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.2C3.2; P < .001); intensive care unit admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0C1.7; P = .023); exacerbation of COPD (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3C2.4; P = .001); and greater mortality within 1 year of admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0C1.6; P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection may result in greater morbidity and mortality among older hospitalized adults than influenza. Increased recognition of adult RSV disease burden will be important in the evaluation and use of new RSV vaccines and antivirals.","output":"Severe Morbidity and Mortality Associated With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Versus Influenza Infection in Hospitalized Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a worldwide effort of the research community to explore the medical, economic and sociologic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cognitive boundaries are thought to segment experience and structure memory, but how this process is implemented remains unclear. We recorded the activity of single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) during the formation and retrieval of memories with complex narratives. Here, we show that neurons responded to abstract cognitive boundaries between different episodes. Boundary-induced neural state changes during encoding predicted subsequent recognition accuracy but impaired event order memory, mirroring a fundamental behavioral tradeoff between content and time memory. Furthermore, the neural state following boundaries was reinstated during both successful retrieval and false memories. These findings reveal a neuronal substrate for detecting cognitive boundaries that transform experience into mnemonic episodes and structure mental time travel during retrieval.","output":"Neurons detect cognitive boundaries to structure episodic memories in humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein Nsp14 is a highly conserved enzyme necessary for viral replication. Nsp14 forms a stable complex with non-structural protein Nsp10 and exhibits exoribonuclease and N7-methyltransferase activities. Protein-interactome studies identified human sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) as a putative binding partner of Nsp14. SIRT5 is an NAD-dependent protein deacylase critical for cellular metabolism that removes succinyl and malonyl groups from lysine residues. Here we investigated the nature of this interaction and the role of SIRT5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed that SIRT5 stably interacts with Nsp14, but not with Nsp10, suggesting that SIRT5 and Nsp10 are parts of separate complexes. We found that SIRT5 catalytic domain is necessary for the interaction with Nsp14, but that Nsp14 does not appear to be directly deacylated by SIRT5. Furthermore, knock-out of SIRT5 or treatment with specific SIRT5 inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in cell-culture experiments. SIRT5 knock-out cells expressed higher basal levels of innate immunity markers and mounted a stronger antiviral response. Our results indicate that SIRT5 is a proviral factor necessary for efficient viral replication, which opens novel avenues for therapeutic interventions.","output":"SIRT5 is a proviral factor that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization has declared SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak a worldwide pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated underlying gender disparities, placing additional burdens on many female global health professionals. APPROACH The authors describe the development of a novel, low-cost pilot program-the Female Global Scholars Program (Weill Cornell Medicine)-established in April 2018 to promote the advancement of female global health research professionals and prepare them for leadership positions in this field. Using a logic model, the program was informed by discussion with peers at scientific symposia, qualitative research examining the barriers women experience in global health, discussions with experts in the fields of global health and medical education, and a literature review of other initiatives focused on fostering female advancement. The program provides opportunities to learn leadership skills and peer mentoring to female junior investigators in global health research over the course of 2 years through attendance of a symposium and skill-building workshop, skill-building webinars, and the building of a peer mentor group. OUTCOMES The inaugural cohort of the Female Global Scholars Program (April 2018-March 2020) included 10 female global health researchers from 6 countries (Haiti, India, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the United States) across 3 continents. By the end of year 1, 6 participants received academic promotions. Additionally, the inaugural 10 scholars collectively presented at 11 international conferences and submitted 22 abstracts and 19 manuscripts. NEXT STEPS The authors hope to provide additional support and guidance to scholars as they become leaders of their own versions of this program at their home sites and plan to expand the faculty group to further lessen the time burden, while enabling the program to provide additional research mentorship to scholars.","output":"Novel, Low-Cost Intervention to Promote Women's Advancement in Global Health Research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: neonates appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults.

This study aims to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare leaders (HeLs), along with the leadership skills and coping strategies needed for successful leadership. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy) between October and November 2020. We assessed the presence of depressive symptoms (DS), anxiety symptoms (AS), perceived stress (PS) and insomnia using internationally validated tools. Coping strategies and skills needed to overcome the crisis were examined, along with the most challenging phases. RESULTS: A total of 48 HeLs participated. The prevalence of DS and AS was 14.6% and 12.5%, respectively. Moderate and severe insomnia was found in 12.5% and 6.3% of them, respectively. Leaders showed moderate (45.8%) and high 4,2%) level of PS. The two most challenging phases were recognised in early recognition (45.2%) and peak phase (31.0%). Concerning healthcare leaders skills required to manage with pandemic, the most reported were communication (35.1%) and decision-making (25.5%). CONCLUSION: The high level of PS, insomnia, DS and AS experienced by healthcare leaders shows the COVID-19 pandemics psychological impact.

The Delta variant has been associated with greater transmissibility and higher viral RNA loads in both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals. Data is lacking regarding the infectious virus load in Delta infected individuals and how that compares to individuals infected with other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing of 2,785 clinical isolates was used to characterize the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the National Capital Region between January and July 2021. Clinical chart reviews were performed for the Delta, Alpha, and B.1.2 (a control predominant lineage prior to both VOCs) variants to evaluate disease severity and outcome and Cycle threshold values (Cts) were compared. The presence of infectious virus was determined using Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were determined from upper respiratory specimen. An analysis of infection in unvaccinated and fully vaccinated populations was performed. RESULTS: The Delta variant displaced the Alpha variant to constitute 88.2% of the circulating lineages in the National Capital Region by July, 2021. The Delta variant associated with increased breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals that were mostly symptomatic when compared to the Alpha breakthrough infections, though it is important to note there was a significantly longer period of time between vaccination and infection with Delta infections. The recovery of infectious virus on cell culture was significantly higher with the Delta variant compared to Alpha in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The impact of vaccination on reducing the recovery of infectious virus from clinical samples was only observed with Alpha variant infections but was strongly associated with low localized SARS-CoV-2 IgG for both variants. A comparison of Ct values showed a significant decrease in the Delta compared to Alpha with no significant differences between unvaccinated and vaccinated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the Delta variant is associated with increased infectious virus loads when compared to the Alpha variant and decreased upper respiratory antiviral IgG levels.

In this study, we estimated causes of pneumonia in young African and Asian children, using novel analytical methods applied to clinical and microbiological findings. METHODS: We did a multi-site, international case-control study in nine study sites in seven countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. All sites enrolled in the study for 24 months. Cases were children aged 1C59 months admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia. Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data. FINDINGS: Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls. The primary analysis group was comprised of 1769 (418% of 4232) cases without HIV infection and with positive chest x-rays and 5102 (997% of 5119) community controls without HIV infection. Wheezing was present in 555 (317%) of 1752 cases (range by site 106C973%). 30-day case-fatality ratio was 64% (114 of 1769 cases). Blood cultures were positive in 56 (32%) of 1749 cases, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria isolated (19 [339%] of 56). Almost all cases (989%) and controls (980%) had at least one pathogen detected by PCR in the NP-OP specimen. The detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), H influenzae non-type b, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in NP-OP specimens was associated with case status. The aetiology analysis estimated that viruses accounted for 614% (95% credible interval [CrI] 573C656) of causes, whereas bacteria accounted for 273% (233C316) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 59% (39C83). Viruses were less common (545%, 95% CrI 474C615 vs 680%, 627C727) and bacteria more common (337%, 272C408 vs 228%, 183C276) in very severe pneumonia cases than in severe cases. RSV had the greatest aetiological fraction (311%, 95% CrI 284C342) of all pathogens. Human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A or B, human parainfluenza virus, S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae each accounted for 5% or more of the aetiological distribution. We observed differences in aetiological fraction by age for Bordetella pertussis, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, parechovirusCenterovirus, P jirovecii, RSV, rhinovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S pneumoniae, and differences by severity for RSV, S aureus, S pneumoniae, and parainfluenza type 3. The leading ten pathogens of each site accounted for 79% or more of the site's aetiological fraction.

We report that a cytosolic DNA sensor IFI16 is essential for the activation of programmed cell death pathways in IAV infected cells. We have identified that IFI16 functions as an RNA sensor for the influenza A virus by interacting with genomic RNA. The activation of IFI16 triggers the production of type I, III interferons, and also pro-inflammatory cytokines via the STING-TBK1 and Pro-caspase-1 signaling axis, thereby promoting cell death (apoptosis and pyroptosis in IAV infected cells). On the contrary, IFI16 knockdown cells showed reduced inflammatory responses and also prevented cell mortality during IAV infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate the pivotal role of IFI16-mediated IAV sensing and its essential role in activating programmed cell death pathways.","output":"Innate immune sensing of influenza A viral RNA through IFI16 promotes pyroptotic cell death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the low mortality and morbidity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) compared with other public health scourges, is the attention devoted to it misdirected?

Even with the best supportive care, the mortality rate in the most severe cases is 40C50%, and the only pharmacological agent shown to be of possible benefit has been steroids. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been tested in several pre-clinical models of lung injury and been found to have significant therapeutic benefit related to: (a) potent immunomodulation; (b) secretion of epithelial and endothelial growth factors; and (c) augmentation of host defense to infection. Initial translational efforts have shown signs of promise, but the results have not yielded the anticipated outcomes. One potential reason is the relatively low survival of MSCs in inflammatory conditions as shown in several studies. Therefore, strategies to boost the survival of MSCs are needed to enhance their therapeutic effect. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) may represent one such possibility as they are G-protein coupled receptors expressed by MSCs and control several facets of cell behavior.

We aimed to compare clinical manifestations and outcomes for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with typical vs. atypical presentations and identify risk factors for atypical COVID-19 presentations. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort of all patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections during 3/13- 5/13/2020 at UW Health, a network of 3 acute-care hospitals in Midwest. We defined atypical cases as patients hospitalized for COVID-19 related reasons presenting without fever and cough and compared them in univariate analysis with patients manifesting both symptoms (controls). We identified independent risk factors for atypical COVID-19 presentations by logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 163 patients hospitalized during the 60-day study frame, 39 (24%) had atypical presentations. Table 1 shows demographic, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of atypical vs. typical cases. On univariate analysis, atypical cases were more likely to be older, reside in a long-term-care facility (LTCF), have underlying diabetes mellitus, stroke, cardiac disease, and deny myalgias or dyspnea, despite having no significant difference in the prevalence of hypoxia or radiological lung infiltrates. Atypical cases also had a significantly higher Beta-Natriuretic-Peptide and lower C-Reactive-Protein, although other inflammatory markers were not significantly different. They were less likely to be admitted to the ICU, and more likely to die within 30 days, as older patients with respiratory failure and multiple comorbidities opted for comfort measures and less aggressive care. On multivariate analysis, LTCF residence was the only independent predictor for atypical status (Table 2).

However, recent studies suggest that exclusive breastfeeding rates in China remain low and are well below the recommended target. There has been evidence that a lack of awareness of, or exposure to, breastfeeding information is associated with poor breastfeeding practices. WeChat, the most widely used social networking platform in China, has shown some potential to promote health behaviours. We thus hypothesised that a breastfeeding intervention program delivered via WeChat would achieve at least a 10% increase in exclusive breastfeeding prevalence at 6 months compared to the control group. METHODS: A two-arm, parallel, multicentre randomised controlled trial of 1000 pregnant women will be conducted at four maternity hospitals of Chengdu, China. Eligible women who consent to participate in the trial will be recruited at 28C30 weeks of gestation, and randomly allocated to either the intervention group (participants receive breastfeeding-related information from WeChat) or the control group (participants receive non-breastfeeding information from WeChat) using a central randomisation system on a 1:1 ratio at each participating site. The primary outcomes are exclusive breastfeeding rate and full breastfeeding rate at 6 months postpartum. All randomised participants will be included in the outcome analyses with missing data being imputed based on the best-case and worst-case scenarios. Multilevel mixed regression models will be used in the primary analyses to assess the effectiveness of intervention program on the breastfeeding rates. DISCUSSION: This trial uses the most widely used social media program as a means of delivering messages to mothers to increase exclusive breastfeeding in China. Increasing exclusive breastfeeding will contribute to meeting the health and environmental goals of the Sustainable Development Guidelines. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04499404.

OBJECTIVES 1. To describe the characteristics of participants from past games and their motivation for attending and 2. to determine whether there was an interest in participating in goal-based, pre-games exercise training programs. METHODS A web-based questionnaire was sent to adult SOT recipients who were members of the Canadian Transplant Association. The survey included questions about why participants attended, their PA levels, and their interest in a pre-games training program. RESULTS Of the 157 participants, more were male than female; the 35-54-year-old age group was the most common; and 62% of respondents received a liver or kidney transplant. The most common reasons for participating in the games were to showcase health post-transplant, promote awareness of organ donation, sports competition, and social reasons. Sixty-five percent of respondents reported that they would be interested in an exercise program to be more physically prepared for the competition.

Indeed, semen requires the intervention of ROS to accomplish different stages of its maturation. However, ROS overproduction is a well-documented phenomenon occurring in the semen of infertile males, potentially causing permanent oxidative damages to a vast number of biological molecules (proteins, nucleic acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids of biological membrane lipids), negatively affecting the functionality and vitality of spermatozoa. ROS overproduction may concomitantly occur to the excess generation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), leading to oxidative/nitrosative stress and frequently encountered in various human pathologies. Under different conditions of male infertility, very frequently accompanied by morpho-functional anomalies in the sperm analysis, several studies have provided evidence for clear biochemical signs of damages to biomolecules caused by oxidative/nitrosative stress. In the last decades, various studies aimed to verify whether antioxidant-based therapies may be beneficial to treat male infertility have been carried out. This review analyzed the results of the studies published during the last ten years on the administration of low-molecular-weight antioxidants to treat male infertility in order to establish whether there is a sufficient number of data to justify antioxidant administration to infertile males. An analysis of the literature showed that only 30 clinical studies tested the effects of the administration of low-molecular-weight antioxidants (administered as a single antioxidant or as a combination of different antioxidants with the addition of vitamins and/or micronutrients) to infertile males. Of these studies, only 33.3% included pregnancy and/or live birth rates as an outcome measure to determine the effects of the therapy. Of these studies, only 4 were caseCcontrol studies, and only 2 of them found improvement of the pregnancy rate in the group of antioxidant-treated patients. Additionally, of the 30 studies considered in this review, only 43.3% were caseCcontrol studies, 66.7% enrolled a number of patients higher than 40, and 40% carried out the administration of a single antioxidant. Therefore, it appears that further studies are needed to clearly define the usefulness of antioxidant-based therapies to treat male infertility.","output":"Antioxidant-Based Therapies in Male Infertility: Do We Have Sufficient Evidence Supporting Their Effectiveness?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of specific immunotherapy (SIT) with standardized house dust mite (HDM) vaccine on allergic asthmatic patients.

The active group received SIT with a standardized depot Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) extract absorbed to aluminium hydroxide (Alutard SQ, ALK-Abell, Denmark), while the control group received a placebo containing histamine dihydrochloride by subcutaneous injections for 1 year. Treatment of each group was started from the initial concentration. Updosing was performed with weekly injections from four 10-fold dose-increase vials (active group: 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 SQ-U/ml, control group: 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10 microg/ml. 100,000 SQ-U/ml of Der p extract contains 9.8 microg/ml of the majoy allergen Der p1). The single-dose was injected weekly with 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 ml of each concentration in turn from the preceding 3 vials, totally for 9 weeks. Subsequently, the dose with 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 ml of the highest concentration was injected weekly from the 10th-14th week and a maintenance dose with 1 ml was reached at the 15th week. The dosing interval was then gradually increased to 2, 4, 6 weeks until the end of the first 26-weeks updosing phase (phase I, H(1)). Thereafter, the dosing continued at 6-week intervals for maintenance phase (phase II, H(2)) till the end of the complete treatment. The patient was observed for at least 30 minutes in the clinic after each injection. RESULTS A total of 132 subjects were randomized and 129 subjects (64 in the active group, 65 in the control group) completed the whole study. Dropouts included three females because of poor compliance, being afraid of the epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and emigration respectively. Both groups were comparable at baseline in all clinical and laboratory parameters. The mean daily symptom scores in 4-weekly began to diverge at the 29th-32nd week with the active group showing a significant lower scores (0.17 +/- 0.33) than the control group (0.39 +/- 0.74, Z = 2.031, P < 0.05) till the end of the study. Significant difference was found in average daily symptom scores between H(1) (0.29 +/- 0.39) and H(2) (0.19 +/- 0.27) in the active group (Z = 2.923, P < 0.01), while no significant difference was found between H(1) (0.45 +/- 0.62) and H(2) (0.40 +/- 0.68) in the placebo group (Z = 1.885, P > 0.05). There were significant differences in subjective judgement of the improvement about overall asthmatic symptoms, exacerbation severity and exacerbation frequency between the active group (96.9%, 95.3%, 95.4%) and the control group (80.0%, 75.4%, 83.1%) with the self-evaluation questionnaire (chi(2) = 13.246, 11.576, 16.204, all P < 0.01). The trend line of daily medication scores in weekly intervals showed a significant decline. The mean daily medication score of phase II (0.20 +/- 0.36) was significant lower than that of phase I (0.33 +/- 0.67, Z = 3.344, P < 0.01), whereas the control group did not show a significant difference between phase II (0.35 +/- 0.96) and phase I (0.32 +/- 0.95, Z = 0.744, P > 0.05). After 1-year treatment, no significant differences were found in morning and evening peak expiratory flow of predicted value (PEF%), forced expiratory volume in one second of predicted value (FEV(1)/FVC), forced vital capacity of predicted value (FVC%), forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV(1)/FVC), provoking dose decreasing FEV(1) by 20% (PD(20)-FEV(1)) between the active group [(97 +/- 17)%, (98 +/- 18)%, (91 +/- 11)%, (98 +/- 9)%, (82 +/- 10)%, 2.35 (7.9) micromol] and the control group [(99 +/- 19)%, (100 +/- 19)%, (90 +/- 14)%, (99 +/- 13)%, (82 +/- 9)%, 1.80 (7.8) micromol] (t = 0.170 - 0.630, Z = 0.264, all P > 0.05). Skin index (SI) to Der p in the active group (1.2 +/- 0.5) was significantly lower than that of the control group (1.5 +/- 0.6) after treatment (t = 2.395, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the level of serum sIgE against Der p between groups, which was 76.80 (97.0) kU/L in active group and 66.50 (99.3) kU/L in the control group (Z = 0.232, P > 0.05). The frequency of systemic adverse reactions graded by guidelines based on the position paper of European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), was 5.7% and 1.8% of the total injections in the active group and the control group, respectively. Although significant difference was found in adverse reactions between groups (chi(2) = 4.705, P < 0.05), all were mild or moderate. The majority occurred within 30 minute after injection and were controlled well with symptomatic therapy. No any severe systemic adverse reaction was shown in the study. CONCLUSION One year specific immunotherapy with standardized house dust mite (HDM) vaccine significantly improved symptoms and reduced medication use in mild to moderate allergic asthmatic patients.

DZNep treatment resulted in reduced synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins without affecting other steps of viral life cycle. We demonstrated that deposition of N6-methyl adenosine (m6A) in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the infected cells recruits heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1), an RNA binding protein which serves as a m6A reader. DZNep inhibited the recruitment of hnRNPA1 at m6A-modified SARS-CoV-2 RNA which eventually suppressed the synthesis of the viral genome. In addition, m6A-marked RNA and hnRNPA1 interaction was also shown to regulate early translation to replication switch of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Furthermore, abrogation of methylation by DZNep also resulted in defective synthesis of the 5 cap of viral RNA, thereby resulting in its failure to interact with eIF4E (a cap-binding protein), eventually leading to a decreased synthesis of viral proteins. Most importantly, DZNep-resistant mutants could not be observed upon long-term sequential passage of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture.

The findings from these studies demonstrate that RT-LAMP testing of swabs and saliva is potentially applicable to a variety of use-cases, including frequent, interval-based testing of saliva from asymptomatic individuals via Direct RT-LAMP that may be missed using symptomatic testing alone.","output":"RT-LAMP has high accuracy for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and naso/oropharyngeal swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent infectious disease outbreaks highlight the importance of competent professionals with expertise on public health preparedness and response at airports. The availability of a competency profile for this workforce supports efficient education and training. Although competency profiles for infectious disease control professionals are available, none addresses the complex airport environment. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to develop a competency profile for professionals involved in infectious disease preparedness and response at airports in order to stimulate and direct further education and training. METHODS: We developed the competency profile through the following steps: 1) extraction of competencies from relevant literature, 2) assessment of the profile in a national RAND modified Delphi study with an interdisciplinary expert group (n = 9) and 3) assessment of the profile in an international RAND modified Delphi study with an airport infectious disease management panel of ten European countries (n = 10). RESULTS: We systematically studied two competency profiles on infectious disease control and three air transport guidelines on event management, and extracted 61 relevant competencies for airports. The two RAND modified Delphi procedures further refined the profile, mainly by specifying a competencys target group, the organizational level it should be present on, and the exact actions that should be mastered. The final profile, consisting of 59 competencies, covers the whole process from infectious disease preparedness, through the response phase and the recovery at airports. CONCLUSION: We designed a profile to support training and exercising the multidisciplinary group of professionals in infectious disease management in the airport setting, and which is ready for use in practice. The many adaptations and adjustments that were needed to develop this profile out of existing profiles and air transport guidelines suggest that other setting-specific profiles in infectious disease control are desirable.","output":"Development of a competency profile for professionals involved in infectious disease preparedness and response in the air transport public health sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To compile recommendations and evidence on the practical management of pregnant women with COVIC-19 in order to clarify standards of obstetric care in the face of this new disease.

METHODS: A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted at 20 hospitals that admitted patients with avian influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia patients admission from 9 provinces in China between October 1, 2016, and March 1, 2017. Data from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China, including general conditions, outcomes and ECMO management, were analysed. Then, successfully weaned and unsuccessfully weaned groups were compared. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients, aged 57  1 years, were analysed; 65.7% of patients were male with 63% mortality. All patients underwent invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), and rescue ventilation strategies were implemented for 23 cases (65.7%) with an average IPPV duration of 5  1 d, PaO(2)/FiO(2) of 78  23 mmHg, tidal volume (VT) of 439  61 ml and plateau pressure (P(plat)) of 29  8 cmH(2)O pre-ECMO. After 48 h on ECMO, PaO(2) improved from 56  21 mmHg to 90  24 mmHg and PaCO(2) declined from 52  24 mmHg to 38  24 mmHg. Haemorrhage, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma occurred in 45.7%, 60% and 8.6% of patients, respectively. Compared with successfully weaned patients (n = 14), the 21 unsuccessfully weaned patients had a longer duration of IPPV pre-ECMO (6  4 d vs. 2  1 d, P < 0.01) as well as a higher P(plat) (25  5 cmH(2)O vs. 21  3 cmH(2)O, P < 0.05) and VT (343  96 ml vs. 246  93 ml, P < 0.05) after 48 h on ECMO support.

They may be caused by various factors or combinations of factors. Frequently, endothelial dysfunction is involved in either development of the disorder or results from it. On the other hand, the endothelium may be disordered for other reasons, e.g., due to infection, such as COVID-19. The understanding of the role and significance of the endothelium in the body has changed significantly over time-from a simple physical barrier to a complex system encompassing local and systemic regulation of numerous processes in the body. Endothelium disorders may arise from impairment of one or more signaling pathways affecting dilator or constrictor activity, including nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate activation, prostacyclin-cyclic adenosine monophosphate activation, phosphodiesterase inhibition, and potassium channel activation or intracellular calcium level inhibition. In this review, plants are summarized as sources of biologically active substances affecting the endothelium.

During the outbreak, the urgency for developing candidate vaccines has brought distinct challenges to clinical development. An efficacy trial, which measures whether the vaccine reduces the incidence of disease, is ordinarily required to fully evaluate vaccine efficacy. However, emergency use may be possible if promising immunogenicity results are observed. A ring vaccination trial, which recruits subjects connected to a known case either socially or geographically, is a solution to evaluate vaccine efficacy and control the spread of the disease simultaneously although its conduct is challenging. Nevertheless, when COVID-19 becomes a recurrent epidemic, an 'individual-level' efficacy trial is preferred. Innovative statistical designs, including seamless design, platform trial, master protocol design, are helpful to accelerate clinical development. A seamless Phase I/II design has been applied in multiple COVID-19 vaccine studies to date. However, Phase II/III design should be done very carefully. The control of type I error, maintaining trial blinding and statistical methods leading to unbiased estimates should be pre-specified in the clinical protocol.

Of 437 Americans and their travel companions on the ship, 114 (26%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We interviewed 229 American passengers and crew after disembarkation following a ship-based quarantine to identify risk factors for infection and characterize transmission onboard the ship. RESULTS: The attack rate for passengers in single-person cabins or without infected cabinmates was 18% (58/329), compared with 63% (27/43) for those sharing a cabin with an asymptomatic infected cabinmate, and 81% (25/31) for those with a symptomatic infected cabinmate. Whole genome sequences from specimens from passengers who shared cabins clustered together. Of 66 SARS-CoV-2-positive American travelers with complete symptom information, 14 (21%) were asymptomatic while on the ship. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive Americans, 10 (9%) required intensive care, of whom 7 were &#8805;70 years. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on cruise ships. High rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in cabinmates of individuals with asymptomatic infections suggest that triage by symptom status in shared quarters is insufficient to halt transmission. A high rate of intensive care unit admission among older individuals complicates the prospect of future cruise travel during the pandemic, given typical cruise passenger demographics.

Herein, we aimed to describe the differences in demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, clinical presentations, and outcomes between COVID-19 pediatric patients admitting to ICU and non-ICU settings. Methods: : This multicenter study involved 15 general and pediatrics hospitals on confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between March 19 and May 31, 2020, during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. Results: : Overall, 166 patients were included, of which 61 (36.7%) required ICU admission, especially in <5 years old age group. Malignancy and heart diseases were the most frequent underlying condition. There was significant decrease in platelet counts, PH, HCO3 and base excess as well as increases in creatinine, creatine phosphokinase and potassium levels between ICU-admitted and non-ICU patients. Dyspnea was the major symptom for ICU group patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock and acute cardiac injury were the most common features among ICU-admitted patients. The mortality rate was substantially higher in the ICU than in non-ICU patients (45.9% vs. 1.9%, respectively;P <0.001). Conclusions: : Underlying diseases were the major contributing factors in COVID-19 pediatric patients for the increased ICU admissions and mortality rates. There are few paraclinical parameters for differentiating pediatrics in terms of prognosis and serious outcomes of COVID-19.

As daily infection rates rise alarmingly, the number of severe cases has increased dramatically. The country has encountered health infrastructure inadequacy and excessive demand for hospital beds, drugs, vaccines, and oxygen. Adding more burden to such a challenging situation, mucormycosis, an invasive fungal infection, has seen a sudden surge in patients with COVID-19. The rhino-orbital-cerebral form is the most common type observed. In particular, approximately three-fourths of them had diabetes as predisposing comorbidity and received corticosteroids to treat COVID-19. Possible mechanisms may involve immune and inflammatory processes. Diabetes, when coupled with COVID-19Cinduced systemic immune change, tends to cause decreased immunity and an increased risk of secondary infections. Since comprehensive data on this fatal opportunistic infection are evolving against the backdrop of a major pandemic, prevention strategies primarily involve managing comorbid conditions in high-risk groups. The recommended treatment strategies primarily included surgical debridement and antifungal therapy using Amphotericin B and selected azoles. Several India-centric clinical guidelines have emerged to rightly diagnose the infection, characterise the clinical presentation, understand the pathogenesis involved, and track the disease course.

This study aimed to characterize the influence of polymer material on mesh behavior at the hiatus. METHODS 24 pigs in three groups of eight underwent implantation of either polypropylene (PP), polyester (PET) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) mesh placed circularly at the esophageal hiatus. After 8 weeks, necropsy and measurements were performed evaluating mesh deformation, adhesion formation, fixation of the esophagogastric junction and mesh position. Foreign body reaction was assessed by mononuclear cell count and immunostaining of Ki-67. Tissue integration was evaluated by immunostaining of type I and type III collagen fibers. RESULTS Mesh shrinkage was the highest for PTFE, lower for PP and the lowest for PET (34.9 vs. 19.8 vs. 12.1 %; p = 0.002). Mesh aperture for the esophagus showed an enlargement within all groups, which was highest for PTFE compared to PP and PET (100.8 vs. 47.0 vs. 35.9 %; p = 0.001). The adhesion score was highest for PP, lower for PTFE and the lowest for PET (11.0 vs. 9.5 vs. 5.0; p = 0.001) and correlated positively with the score of esophagogastric fixation (r s = 0.784, p < 0.001). No mesh migration, erosion or stenosis of the esophagus occurred. Evaluation of foreign body reaction and tissue integration showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS In this experimental setting, PP-meshes showed the most appropriate characteristics for augmentation at the hiatus. Due to solid fixation of the esophagogastric junction and low shrinkage tendency, PP-meshes may be effective in preventing hiatal hernia recurrence. The use of PTFE-mesh at the hiatus may be disadvantageous due to high shrinkage rates and correlating enlargement of the aperture for the esophagus.","output":"Polypropylene, polyester or polytetrafluoroethylene-is there an ideal material for mesh augmentation at the esophageal hiatus?

Acknowledging the importance of increasing access to the Bootcamp, we launched an online (ONL) version of the ARC Bootcamp in November 2019. We evaluated the ONL course's impact on participants' knowledge acquisition, contouring skills, and self-confidence by comparing it to the face-to-face (F2F) course. MATERIALS/METHODS The F2F Bootcamp was adapted into an ONL version using the Teachable platform (teachable.com). The ONL course was structured in a linear progression of locked modules to offer similar content to the F2F comparator. Participants from the 2019 F2F and the 2019-2020 ONL Bootcamp provided consent for the study and completed pre-and post-intervention evaluations, which assessed anatomy/radiology knowledge, contouring skills, anatomy/radiology knowledge and contouring self-confidence, and course satisfaction. RESULTS Fifty-seven (F2F: n = 30; ONL: n = 27) participants completed both evaluations. The ONL course had a substantially wider geographic participation, with participants from 19 countries (vs. 4 countries in the F2F course) completing the pre-evaluation.

CD13 participates in several functions such as proteolytic regulation of bioactive peptides, viral receptor, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. CD13 has also been proposed to participate in cell adhesion, as crosslinking of CD13 by certain CD13-specific antibodies induces homotypic aggregation of monocytes and heterotypic adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. We generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs C and E) that block homotypic aggregation of U-937 monocytic cells induced by CD13-specific mAb 452. Moreover, the mAbs cause detachment of cells whose aggregation was induced by CD13 crosslinking. Both mAbs also inhibit heterotypic adhesion of U-937 monocytes to endothelial cells. mAbs C and E recognize membrane CD13 but bind to epitopes different from that recognized by mAb 452. Crosslinking of CD13 by mAb C or E is required to inhibit adhesion, as monovalent Fab fragments are not sufficient. Thus, C and E antibodies recognize a distinct epitope on CD13, and binding to this epitope interferes with both CD13-mediated cell adhesion and enzymatic activity. These antibodies may represent important tools to study cell-cell interactions mediated by CD13 in physiological and pathological conditions.","output":"Distinct Epitopes on CD13 Mediate Opposite Consequences for Cell Adhesion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a paper recently published in Nature Medicine , Fukumoto et al. tried to assess the government-led school closure policy during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.

However, the effective sample size (ESS) of their dataset had been substantially reduced in the process of matching due to imbalanced covariates between the treatment (i.e. with closure) and control (without) municipalities, which led to the wide uncertainty in the estimates.

Compared with other MCDM methods, the fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) method and fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM) have demonstrated their solidity in solving different MCDM challenges. However, the fuzzy sets used in these methods have neglected the refusal concept and limited the restrictions on their constants. To end this, considering the advantage of the T-spherical fuzzy sets (T-SFSs) in handling the uncertainty in the data and obtaining information with more degree of freedom, this study has extended FWZIC and FDOSM methods into the T-SFSs environment (called T-SFWZIC and T-SFDOSM) to be used in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. The methodology was formulated on the basis of decision matrix adoption and development phases. The first phase described the adopted decision matrix used in the COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The second phase presented the sequential formulation steps of T-SFWZIC used for weighting the distribution criteria followed by T-SFDOSM utilised for prioritising the vaccine recipients. Results revealed the following: (1) T-SFWZIC effectively weighted the vaccine distribution criteria based on several parameters including T = 2, T = 4, T = 6, T = 8, and T = 10. Amongst all parameters, the age criterion received the highest weight, whereas the geographic locations severity criterion has the lowest weight. (2) According to the T parameters, a considerable variance has occurred on the vaccine recipient orders, indicating that the existence of T values affected the vaccine distribution. (3) In the individual context of T-SFDOSM, no unique prioritisation was observed based on the obtained opinions of each expert. (4) The group context of T-SFDOSM used in the prioritisation of vaccine recipients was considered the final distribution result as it unified the differences found in an individual context. The evaluation was performed based on systematic ranking assessment and sensitivity analysis. This evaluation showed that the prioritisation results based on each T parameter were subject to a systematic ranking that is supported by high correlation results over all discussed scenarios of changing criteria weights values.","output":"Based on T-spherical Fuzzy Environment: A Combination of FWZIC and FDOSM for Prioritising COVID-19 Vaccine Dose Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate several rank-based change-point procedures for the covariance operator in a sequence of observed functions, called FKWC change-point procedures. Our methods allow the user to test for one change-point, to test for an epidemic period, or to detect an unknown amount of change-points in the data. Our methodology combines functional data depth values with the traditional Kruskal Wallis test statistic. By taking this approach we have no need to estimate the covariance operator, which makes our methods computationally cheap. For example, our procedure can identify multiple change-points in $O(n\\\\log n)$ time. Our procedure is fully non-parametric and is robust to outliers through the use of data depth ranks. We show that when $n$ is large, our methods have simple behaviour under the null hypothesis.We also show that the FKWC change-point procedures are $n^{-1/2}$-consistent. In addition to asymptotic results, we provide a finite sample accuracy result for our at-most-one change-point estimator. In simulation, we compare our methods against several others.

To meet this increased patient demand for diagnostic testing, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) authorized licensed pharmacists to order and administer FDA authorized COVID-19 tests. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to update the previous national benching report and examine both the number of pharmacies in the United States with CLIA Certificates of Waiver before and after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the state-by-state differences in the percentage of pharmacies with CLIA Certificates of Waiver. METHODS: Data were collected from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CLIA Laboratory Search website May 3rd, 2015, August 4th, 2019 and November 26th, 2020. The website allows for exportation of demographic data on all CLIA-waived facilities by state. RESULTS: Pharmacies exhibited the largest growth both in number (4865 new locations) and by percent (45%) of CLIA-waived facilities between 2015 and 2020. The total number of pharmacies with a CLIA-waiver grew from 10,626 (17.94%) locations in 2015 to 12,157 (21.43%) locations in 2019, to 15,671 (27.63%) locations in 2020. States demonstrated considerable variability in the percentage of pharmacies with a CLIA-waiver, with a range of 2.92%C56.52%. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacies have become an increasingly important location for patients to access CLIA-waived tests in the United States, now serving as the second largest provider of CLIA-waived tests by the total number of locations.

Despite having an overlapping mechanism in the etiology of Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), the exact mechanism and signaling molecules behind them are still unknown. Further, the acetylation mechanism and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes provide a positive direction toward studying the shared phenomenon between AD and PD pathogenesis. For instance, increased expression of HDACs causes a decrease in protein acetylation status, resulting in decreased cognitive and memory function. Herein, we employed an integrative approach to analyze the transcriptomics data that established a potential relationship between AD and PD. Data preprocessing and analysis of four publicly available microarray datasets revealed 10 HUB proteins, namely, CDC42, CD44, FGFR1, MYO5A, NUMA1, TUBB4B, ARHGEF9, USP5, INPP5D, and NUP93, that may be involved in the shared mechanism of AD and PD pathogenesis. Further, we identified the relationship between the HUB proteins and transcription factors that could be involved in the overlapping mechanism of AD and PD. CREB1 and HINFP were the crucial regulatory transcription factors that were involved in the AD and PD crosstalk. Further, lysine acetylation sites and HDAC enzyme prediction revealed the involvement of 15 and 27 potential lysine residues of CREB1 and HINFP, respectively.

When an HIV vector without vpr was used, pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses produced in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) were able to infect only engineered hACE2-overexpressing cell lines, whereas viruses produced under serum-free conditions were able to infect a broader range of cells, including cells without hACE2 overexpression. When an HIV vector containing vpr was used, pseudotyped viruses were able to infect a broad spectrum of cell types regardless of whether viruses were produced in the presence or absence of FBS. Infection sensitivities of various cell types did not correlate with mRNA abundance of hACE2, TMPRSS2, or TMPRSS4. Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus were equally sensitive to neutralization by an anti-spike RBD antibody in cells with high abundance of hACE2.

Compared to the United Kingdom (UK) study, there were more children under the age of five (37% vs. 10%;p=0.004), and there was a higher frequency of obesity (29.5% vs. 10%;p=0.008). With regard to the US study, there was more lymphadenopathy (23% vs. 13%;p=0.02), diarrhea (70.5% vs. 53%;p=0.001), lymphopenia (64% vs. 35%;p=0.001), shock (87% vs. 35%;p=0.001), elevated troponin (51% vs. 31%;p=0.006) and elevated proBNP (82% vs 43%;p=0.001), as well as greater mortality (9% vs 1.8%;p=0.001). The group that did not survive had a longer duration of the disease until admission to the PICU (6 days vs. 5 days;p = 0.003), more frequency of ferritin above 500 ngr/mL (100% vs. 45%;p = 0.012) and more cardiovascular complications (100% vs. 54%;p = 0.019) compared to the group that survived.

METHODS: A retrospective multicentre ecological analysis was undertaken evaluating all blood cultures taken from adults from 01 April 2017 to 30 April 2020 across five acute hospitals in London. Linear trend analysis and ARIMA models allowing for seasonality were used to look for significant variation. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen thousand five hundred eighty-four blood cultures were included. At the height of the UK SARS-CoV-2 first wave in April 2020, Enterobacterales bacteraemias were at an historic low across two London trusts (63/3814, 1.65%), whilst all CoNS BSI were at an historic high (173/3814, 4.25%). This differed significantly for both Enterobacterales (p = 0.013), CoNS central line associated BSIs (CLABSI) (p < 0.01) and CoNS non-CLABSI (p < 0.01), when compared with prior periods, even allowing for seasonal variation. S. pneumoniae (p = 0.631) and S. aureus (p = 0.617) BSI did not vary significant throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly fewer than expected Enterobacterales BSI occurred during the UK peak of the COVID-19 pandemic; identifying potential causes, including potential unintended consequences of national self-isolation public health messaging, is essential. High rates of CoNS BSI, with evidence of increased CLABSI, but also likely contamination associated with increased use of personal protective equipment, may result in inappropriate antimicrobial use and indicates a clear area for intervention during further waves.

TRIAL DESIGN: Adaptive (group-sequential), parallel group, pragmatic, superiority randomised controlled, open-label, multi-centre, effectiveness trial. PARTICIPANTS: The trial is being conducted across approximately 60 hospitals across England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Inpatients at participating hospitals are eligible to participate if they have respiratory failure with suspected or proven COVID-19, and meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: 1) Adults  18 years; 2) Admitted to hospital with suspected or proven COVID-19; 3) Receiving oxygen with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) 0.4 and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) 94%; and 4) Plan for escalation to tracheal intubation if needed. Exclusion criteria: 1) Planned tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation imminent within 1 hour; 2) Known or clinically apparent pregnancy; 3) Any absolute contraindication to CPAP or HFNO; 4) Decision not to intubate due to ceiling of treatment or withdrawal of treatment anticipated; and 5) Equipment for both CPAP and HFNO not available. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention one: Continuous positive airway pressure delivered by any device. Set-up and therapy titration is not protocolised and is delivered in accordance with clinical discretion. Intervention two: High-flow nasal oxygen delivered by any device. Set-up and therapy titration is not protocolised and is delivered in accordance with clinical discretion. Comparator group: Standard care- oxygen delivered by face mask or nasal cannula (excluding the use of continuous positive airway pressure or high-flow nasal oxygen). Set-up and therapy titration is not protocolised and is delivered in accordance with clinical discretion. Intervention delivery continues up to the point of death, tracheal intubation, or clinical determination that there is no ongoing need (palliation or improvement). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is a composite outcome comprising tracheal intubation or mortality within 30 days following randomisation. Secondary outcomes include tracheal intubation rate, time to tracheal intubation, duration of invasive ventilation, mortality rate, time to mortality, length of hospital stay, and length of critical care stay. RANDOMISATION: Participants are randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either continuous positive airway pressure, high-flow nasal oxygen or standard care. Due to the challenging environment of study delivery, a specific intervention may not always be available at the hospital site. The study uses two integrated randomisation systems to allow, where required, the site to randomise between all three interventions, between CPAP and standard care, and between HFNO and standard care. System integration ensures maintenance of balance between interventions. Randomisation is performed using a telephone-based interactive voice response system to maintain allocation concealment. The randomisation sequence was computer-generated using the minimisation method. Participant randomisation is stratified by site, gender (M/F), and age (<50, >=50 years). BLINDING (MASKING): The nature of the trial interventions precludes blinding of the researcher, patient and clinical team. Primary and secondary outcomes are all objective outcomes, thereby minimising the risk of detection bias.

METHODS: Review of pertinent literature. RESULTS: There is at least 1 precedent for an antibody response against a viral pathogen that fails to provide host protection in the absence of immune-competent CD4(+) T cells. PML is an infection of the CNS caused by JC virus (JCV), which commonly occurs during treatment with the therapeutic monoclonal antibody natalizumab. In this context, the humoral immune response fails to prevent JCV reactivation, and elevated anti-JCV serum indices are associated with a higher PML incidence. The more relevant immune-competent cells in host defense against JCV appear to be T cells. T cellCmediated responses are also detectable in convalescing patients with SARS-COV-2 irrespective of the humoral immune response. CONCLUSION: Based on pathogenic lessons learned from PML under natalizumab therapy, we suggest the incorporation of functional assays that determine neutralizing properties of SARS-CoV-2Cspecific antibodies. In addition, we outline the potential role of T-cell detection assays in determining herd immunity in a given population or in studying therapeutic responses to vaccines.","output":"Biological Significance of AntiCSARS-CoV-2 Antibodies: Lessons Learned From Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the COVID-19 outbreak, studies across diverse countries have strongly pointed towards the emergence of a mental health crisis, with a dramatic increase in the prevalence of depressive psychopathology and suicidal tendencies Nutritional factors such as vitamin D have been associated with an increased risk of mental health problems as well as individual responses to stress Studies have discussed the relationship between low serum vitamin D concentrations and depression, suggesting that maintaining adequate concentrations of serum vitamin D seems to have a protective effect against depression The optimal vitamin D status was found to contribute to improved serotonergic neurotransmission deficits in an experimental depression model by regulating serotonin synthesis The signaling of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the active form of vitamin D, through VDR induces the expression of the gene TPH2, influences the expression of serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) as well as the levels of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), the enzyme responsible for serotonin catabolism Vitamin D also presents a relevant link with chronobiological interplay Evidence suggests a mediatory role of vitamin D in the sleep-wake cycle since the lower concentrations of vitamin D were correlated with impaired sleep quality and abbreviated sleep duration, point to its influence on melatonin metabolism, which is synthesized from the metabolism of serotonin In this Perspective, we discussed the significant role of vitamin D in the elevation of stress-related depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Vitamin D, Depressive Symptoms, and Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initially described for allergic diseases, the hygiene hypothesis was extended to autoimmune diseases in the early 2000s. A historical overview allows appreciation of the development of this concept over the last two decades and its discussion in the context of evolution. While the epidemiological data are convergent, with a few exceptions, the underlying mechanisms are multiple and complex. A major question is to determine what is the respective role of pathogens, bacteria, viruses, and parasites, versus commensals. The role of the intestinal microbiota has elicited much interest, but is it a cause or a consequence of autoimmune-mediated inflammation? Our hypothesis is that both pathogens and commensals intervene. Another question is to dissect what are the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. The role of immunoregulatory cytokines, in particular interleukin-10 and TGF beta is probably essential. An important place should also be given to ligands of innate immunity receptors present in bacteria, viruses or parasites acting independently of their immunogenicity.

Many of these molecules comprise regions with varying structural properties including disorder, flexibility, and partial occupancy. These traits make computational 3D reconstruction from 2D images challenging. Detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs, used to keep membrane proteins in solution, are common examples of locally disordered structures that can negatively affect existing iterative refinement algorithms which assume rigidity (or spatial uniformity). We introduce a cross-validation approach to derive non-uniform refinement, an algorithm that automatically regularizes 3D density maps during iterative refinement to account for spatial variability, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality. We find that in common iterative refinement methods, regularization using spatially uniform filtering operations can simultaneously over- and under-regularize local regions of a 3D map. In contrast, non-uniform refinement removes noise in disordered regions while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images. Our results include state-of-the-art resolution 3D reconstructions of multiple membrane proteins with molecular weight as low as 90kDa. These results demonstrate that higher resolutions and improved 3D density map quality can be achieved even for small membrane proteins, an important use case for single particle cryo-EM, both in structural biology and drug discovery.

This paper describes the design and methods of a cluster randomized trial of H(2)GO!, a youth empowerment intervention to prevent childhood obesity through reducing SSB consumption among a low-income, ethnically diverse sample of youth. METHODS: This cluster randomized controlled trial is an academic-community partnership with the Massachusetts Alliance of Boys and Girls Clubs (BGC). Ten BGC sites will be randomly assigned to the H(2)GO! intervention or a wait-list, usual care control. Eligible study participants will be N = 450 parent-child pairs (youth ages 9C12 years and their parents/caregivers) recruited from participating BGCs. The 6-week in-person H(2)GO! intervention consists of 12 group-based sessions delivered by BGC staff and youth-led activities. An innovative feature of the intervention is the development of youth-produced narratives as a strategy to facilitate youth empowerment and parental engagement. Child outcomes include measured body mass index z scores (zBMI), beverage intake, and youth empowerment. Parent outcomes include beverage intake and availability of SSBs at home. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 2, 6, and 12 months. With a 75% retention rate, the study is powered to detect a minimum group difference of 0.1 zBMI units over 12 months. DISCUSSION: Empowering youth may be a promising intervention approach to prevent childhood obesity through reducing SSB consumption. This intervention was designed to be delivered through BGCs and is hypothesized to be efficacious, relevant, and acceptable for the target population of low-income and ethnically diverse youth.

With emergence of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR), and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), larger access sheaths (up to 18Fr-24Fr) are required, which further increases the potential for access site complications. The true incidence of access site complications arising from non-coronary interventions is unknown; hence it is likely that the total incidence of vascular access site complications is greatly underestimated. Vascular closure devices (VCDs), radial artery access, fluoroscopic guidance, and ultrasound guidance have all been used with a hope to minimize these complications.

To date, more than 15,000 patients have been enrolled and approximately 10% of enrolled patients have been escalated to hospital care for timely treatment. Our objective is to describe our COVID-19 Home Monitoring program and present early results. Methods: We conducted an observational retrospective study of all patients enrolled in the COVID-19 Home Monitoring program between April 13, 2020 through February 12, 2021. Data analysis conducted includes patient demographics, enrollment, entry points, length of stay, mortality, additional treatment, utilization, adherence, satisfaction, and alert triggers. Results: A total of 12,461 of 13,055 patients (95.5%) recovered and completed the program, 1387 patients (10.6%) were admitted to the hospital, and 20 patients (0.2%) died while they were being monitored at home. The mortality rate at 30 days from enrollment was 1.6%. Hospital length of stay for ambulatory patients receiving oxygen only was 5.4 days compared to 3.1 days for those ambulatory patients receiving oxygen, dexamethasone, and remdesivir. Conclusion: COVID-19 home monitoring appears to be safe and effective.

Similar to other medical specialities and general practice (1), to continue providing a service for our service users, we employed other means of communication including telephone and video consultations (although face-to-face consultations were available for high clinical concern and/or identified risk). We set out to explore the acceptability of remote consultation for service users of an older adult (>65 years) Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). Reference: BMJ 2020;371:m3945 Method A total of 34 service users were selected randomly from the CMHT caseload (9% of total 372 caseload). 4 clinicians were involved in collecting data between July and October 2020. We used our trust's (East London Foundation Trust) standard questionnaire on patient satisfaction and contacted individuals by telephone to complete the survey. Result For both questions of I felt listened to by the team and I feel I have been given enough information regarding my care 17 (50%) responders agreed with this statement and an additional 13 (38%) strongly agreed (total of 88%). For the statement I feel involved in decisions about my care 16 (47%) responders agreed and a further 11 (32%) responders strongly agreed with this statement. The statement The professionals involved in my care talk to each other and we all work as a team had 15 (44%) responders agree and 13 (38%) responders strongly agree.

Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a panel of HIV-1 strains with broad and potent resistance against a large number of bnAbs, particularly those targeting the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that several key epitope mutations facilitate resistance and are located in the inner domain, loop D, and 23/loop V5/24 of HIV-1 gp120. The resistance is largely correlated with binding affinity of antibodies to the envelope trimers expressed on the cell surface. Our results therefore demonstrate the existence of broadly resistant HIV-1 strains against CD4bs neutralizing antibodies.

Consistent with this proposal, several studies have shown that spoken word recognition is slowed when speech is produced by multiple talkers compared with when all speech is produced by one talker (a multitalker processing cost). Nusbaum and colleagues have argued that talker normalization is modulated by attention (e.g., Nusbaum & Morin, 1992, Speech Perception, Production and Linguistic Structure, pp. 113C134). Some of the strongest evidence for this claim is from a speeded monitoring study where a group of participants who expected to hear two talkers showed a multitalker processing cost, but a separate group who expected one talker did not (Magnuson & Nusbaum, 2007, Journal of Experimental Psychology, 33[2], 391C409). In that study, however, the sample size was small and the crucial interaction was not significant. In this registered report, we present the results of a well-powered attempt to replicate those findings. In contrast to the previous study, we did not observe multitalker processing costs in either of our groups. To rule out the possibility that the null result was due to task constraints, we conducted a second experiment using a speeded classification task. As in Experiment 1, we found no influence of expectations on talker normalization, with no multitalker processing cost observed in either group. Our data suggest that the previous findings of Magnuson and Nusbaum (2007) be regarded with skepticism and that talker normalization may not be permeable to high-level expectations.","output":"Listener expectations and the perceptual accommodation of talker variability: A pre-registered replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Seasonal Hyperacute Panuveitis (SHAPU), is a mysterious blinding disease seen only in Nepal with a higher prevalence among children usually seen in autumn every alternate odd year since 1975.

WhatsApp and similar apps are also widely used to facilitate clinical communication between physicians. Moreover, WhatsApp is used by emergency department (ED) physicians and consulting physicians to exchange medical information during ED consultations. This platform is regarded as a useful app in the consultation of dermatological and orthopedic cases. Preventing overcrowding in the ED is key to reducing the risk of disease transmission, and teleconsulting practice is thought to be effective in the diagnosis, treatment, and reduction of transmission risk of disease, most notably during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video consultation is highly recommended in some countries on the grounds that it is likely to reduce the risk of transmission. WhatsApp-like apps are among the video consultation platforms that are assumed to reduce the risk of contamination by minimizing patient-physician contact. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of WhatsApp video consultation on patient admission and discharge times in comparison to bedside consultation in the evaluation of potential patients with COVID-19 visiting a COVID-19 outpatient clinic during the pandemic. METHODS: Patients who presented to the ED COVID-19 outpatient clinic between March 11 and May 31, 2020, and for whom an infectious disease specialist was consulted (via WhatsApp or at bedside) were included in the study in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eventually, 54 patients whose consultations were performed via WhatsApp and 90 patients whose consultations were performed at bedside were included in our study. RESULTS: The median length of stay in the ED of discharged patients amounted to 103 minutes (IQR 85-147.75) in the WhatsApp group and 196 minutes (IQR 141-215) in the bedside group. In this regard, the length of stay in the ED was found to be significantly shorter in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P<.001). Among the consulted and discharged patients, 1 patient in each group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction test and thus was readmitted and hospitalized (P=.62). The median length of stay of the inpatients in the ED was found to be 116.5 minutes (IQR 85.5-145.5) in the WhatsApp group and 132 minutes (IQR 102-168) in the bedside group. The statistical analysis of this time difference revealed that the length of stay in the ED was significantly shorter for patients in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Consultation via WhatsApp reduces both contact time with patients with COVID-19 and the number of medical staff contacting the patients, which contributes greatly to reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. WhatsApp consultation may prove useful in clinical decision making as well as in shortening process times. Moreover, it does not result in a decreased accuracy rate. The shortened discharge and hospitalization timespans also decreased the length of stay in the ED, which can have an impact on minimizing ED crowding.

We review current knowledge on the pandemics effects on long-term economic development, spanning economic and historical debates. We show that all economic inputs are potentially affected. Pandemics reduce the workforce and human capital, have mixed effects on investment and savings, but potentially positive consequences for innovation and knowledge development, depending on accompanying institutional change. In the absence of an innovative response supporting income redistribution, pandemics tend to increase income inequalities, worsening poverty traps and highlighting the distributional issues built into insurance-based health insurance systems. We find that the effects of pandemics are asymmetric over time, in space, and among sectors and households. Therefore, we suggest that the research focus on the theoretical plausibility and empirical significance of specific mechanisms should be complemented by meta-analytic efforts aimed at reconstructing the resulting complexity. Finally, we suggest that policymakers prioritize the development of organizational learning and innovative capabilities, focusing on the ability to adapt to emergencies rather than developing rigid protocols or mimicking solutions developed and implemented in different contexts.","output":"A Literature Review of Pandemics and Development: the Long-Term Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2).

School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted children's access to school meals. Two policy approaches were activated to replace missed meals for children from low-income families. The Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program provided the cash value of missed meals directly to families on debit-like cards to use for making food purchases. The grab-and-go meals program offered prepared meals from school kitchens at community distribution points. The effectiveness of these programs at reaching those who needed them and their costs were unknown. Objective: To determine how many eligible children were reached by P-EBT and grab-and-go meals, how many meals or benefits were received, and how much each program cost to implement. Design: Cross-sectional study, Spring 2020. Setting: National. Participants: All children <19 years old and children age 6-18 eligible to receive free or reduced price meals (FRPM). Exposure(s): Receipt of P-EBT or grab-and-go school meals. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Percentage of children reached by P-EBT and grab-and-go school meals; average benefit received per recipient; and average cost, including implementation costs and time costs to families, per meal distributed. Results: Grab-and-go school meals reached about 10.5 million children (17% of all US children), most of whom were FRPM-eligible students. Among FRPM-eligible students only, grab-and-go meals reached 27%, compared to 89% reached by P-EBT. Among those receiving benefits, the average monthly benefit was larger for grab-and-go school meals ($148) relative to P-EBT ($110). P-EBT had lower costs per meal delivered - $6.51 - compared to $8.20 for grab-and-go school meals. P-EBT had lower public sector implementation costs but higher uncompensated time costs to families (e.g., preparation time for meals) compared to grab-and-go school meals. Conclusions and Relevance: Both programs supported children's access to food when schools were closed and in complementary ways. P-EBT is an efficient and effective policy option to support food access for eligible children when school is out.","output":"Pandemic-EBT and grab-and-go school Meals: Costs, reach, and benefits of two approaches to keep children fed during school closures due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are being developed;however, none have been studied during breastfeeding The first two vaccines to become available in the US are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines They are not live vaccines and are not be expected to be appreciably excreted into breastmilk or absorbed by the infant No non-live vaccines have ever been reported to cause infant adverse effects via breastfeeding [1] Professional organizations have recommended that these COVID-19 vaccines be offered to those who are breastfeeding because the potential benefits of maternal vaccination during lactation outweigh any theoretical risks [2-4] Given the current absence of direct evidence of vaccine safety during breastfeeding, clinicians are encouraged to undertake shared decision making with their patients, based on local community risk and the patient's risk factors [5]","output":"COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first human H5N1 case was diagnosed in Hong Kong in 1997.

Methods: We used data from government reports, clinical guidelines and other publications to estimate the main cost components of COVID-19 during 1 January-31 March 2020. These components were: identification and diagnosis of close contacts; suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19; treatment of COVID-19 cases; compulsory quarantine of close contacts and suspected cases; and productivity losses for all affected residents. Primary outcomes were total health-care and societal costs. Findings: The total estimated health-care and societal costs associated with COVID-19 were 4.26 billion Chinese yuan (; 0.62 billion United States dollars, US$) and  2646.70 billion (US$ 383.02 billion), respectively. Inpatient care accounted for 44.2% ( 0.95 billion/ 2.15 billion) of routine health-care costs followed by medicines, accounting for 32.5% ( 0.70 billion/ 2.15 billion). Productivity losses accounted for 99.8% ( 2641.61 billion/ 2646.70 billion) of societal costs, which were mostly attributable to the effect of movement-restriction policies on people who did not have COVID-19. Societal costs were most sensitive to salary costs and number of working days lost due to movement-restriction policies. Hubei province had the highest health-care cost while Guangdong province had the highest societal cost. Conclusion: Our results highlight the high economic burden of the COVID-19 outbreak in China.

Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. METHODS: During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: ?2.79 to ?0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: ?2.50 to ?0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: ?4.44 to ?0.42).

In mammalian cells, ceramide is newly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and converted to sphingomyelin in the trans-Golgi regions. The ceramide transport protein CERT, a typical LTP, mediates the ER-to-Golgi transport of ceramide at an ER-distal Golgi membrane contact zone. About 20 years ago, a potent inhibitor of CERT, named (1R,3S)-HPA-12, was found by coincidence among ceramide analogs. Since then, various ceramide-resembling compounds have been found to act as CERT inhibitors. Nevertheless, the inevitable issue remains that natural ligand-mimetic compounds might directly bind both to the desired target and to various undesired targets that share the same natural ligand. To resolve this issue, a ceramide-unrelated compound named E16A, or (1S,2R)-HPCB-5, that potently inhibits the function of CERT has recently been developed, employing a series of in silico docking simulations, efficient chemical synthesis, quantitative affinity analysis, proteinCligand co-crystallography, and various in vivo assays.

METHODS This study is a retrospective review of the patients operated between 11.03.2020 and 31.05.2020 in a center with a high incidence of COVID-19 infection during the pandemic. The numbers of emergency, elective and oncological surgeries as well as the increasing or decreasing trends of these interventions between March 11 and May 31 of previous years were compared with the corresponding period of 2020 or in other words the pandemic period. RESULTS From March 11 to May 31, 2020 there was a progressive reduction in surgical activity, with only 195 operations: 61(31,28%) on a scheduled basis for tumor pathology, 59(30,25%) for benign pathology and 75(38,46%) for emergency indications. When the surgical trends of previous years are considered, all types of oncological surgeries decreased significantly in pandemic period March 11 to May 31, 2020. CONCLUSION One of the most striking changes in medical care settings during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed in surgical management strategies. The most significant among these were the limitation of elective surgical procedures and the prioritization of emergency or non-delayed oncological operations. One may speculate that the standstill of elective surgeries including the oncological surgeries might have long term impacts on the clinical outcomes of patients as well as the healthcare workers and organizations.

In threshold-tracking SICI (T-SICI), stimulus intensity is instead adjusted repeatedly to maintain a constant MEP and inhibition is measured as the relative threshold increase. T-SICI is emerging as a useful diagnostic test, but its relationship to conventional amplitude SICI (A-SICI) is unclear. OBJECTIVE To compare T-SICI and its reliability with conventional A-SICI measurements. METHODS In twelve healthy volunteers (6 men, median age 30 years), conventional and T-SICI were recorded at conditioning stimuli (CS) of 50-80% resting motor threshold (RMT) and interstimulus interval of 2.5 ms. Measurements were repeated on the same day and at least a week later by a single operator. RESULTS Across the CS range, mean group T-SICI showed a strong linear relationship to the mean group values measured by conventional technique (y = 29.7-0.3x, R2 = 0.99), but there was considerable interindividual variability. At CS 60-80% RMT, T-SICI had excellent intraday (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC, 0.81-0.92) and adequate-to-excellent interday (ICC 0.61-0.88) reproducibility. Conventional SICI took longer to complete (median of 5.8 vs 3.8 min, p < 0.001) and tended to have poorer reproducibility (ICC 0.17-0.42 intraday, 0.37-0.51 interday). With T-SICI, smaller sample sizes were calculated for equally powered interventional studies. CONCLUSION The close relationship between conventional and T-SICI suggests that both techniques reflect similar cortical inhibitory mechanisms. Threshold-tracking measurements of SICI may be able to improve reproducibility, to shorten acquisition time and to reduce sample sizes for interventional studies compared with the conventional technique.","output":"Short-interval intracortical inhibition: Comparison between conventional and threshold-tracking techniques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disorders of perfusion in newborn infants are frequently observed in neonatal intensive care units.

Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of lung function anomalies, exercise function impairment, and psychological sequelae among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 4 months after discharge. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study at an academic hospital in Northern Italy was conducted among a consecutive series of patients aged 18 years and older (or their caregivers) who had received a confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection severe enough to require hospital admission from March 1 to June 29, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, bronchial swab, serological testing, or suggestive computed tomography results. Exposure: Severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of the study was to describe the proportion of patients with a diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco) less than 80% of expected value. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients with severe lung function impairment (defined as Dlco <60% expected value); proportion of patients with posttraumatic stress symptoms (measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised total score); proportion of patients with functional impairment (assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] score and 2-minute walking test); and identification of factors associated with Dlco reduction and psychological or functional sequelae. Results: Among 767 patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 494 (64.4%) refused to participate, and 35 (4.6%) died during follow-up. A total of 238 patients (31.0%) (median [interquartile range] age, 61 [50-71] years; 142 [59.7%] men; median [interquartile range] comorbidities, 2 [1-3]) consented to participate to the study. Of these, 219 patients were able to complete both pulmonary function tests and Dlco measurement. Dlco was reduced to less than 80% of the estimated value in 113 patients (51.6%) and less than 60% in 34 patients (15.5%). The SPPB score was suggested limited mobility (score <11) in 53 patients (22.3%). Patients with SPPB scores within reference range underwent a 2-minute walk test, which was outside reference ranges of expected performance for age and sex in 75 patients (40.5%); thus, a total of 128 patients (53.8%) had functional impairment. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were reported in a total of 41 patients (17.2%). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that at 4 months after discharge, respiratory, physical, and psychological sequelae were common among patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19.","output":"Respiratory and Psychophysical Sequelae Among Patients With COVID-19 Four Months After Hospital Discharge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article employed a content analysis method utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Clear Communication Index to evaluate the quality and reliability of 15 patient organization websites designed for patients to access information about COVID-19.

Experience with influenza shows that infection primes CD8(+) T cell memory to peptides presented by common HLA types like HLA-A2, which enhances recovery and diminishes clinical severity upon reinfection. Stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients with overlapping peptides from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to the clonal expansion of SARS-CoV-2?specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in vitro, with CD4(+) T cells being robust. We identified two HLA-A*02:01-restricted SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8(+) T cell epitopes, A2/S(269C277) and A2/Orf1ab(3183C3191). Using peptide?HLA tetramer enrichment, direct ex vivo assessment of A2/S(269)(+)CD8(+) and A2/Orf1ab(3183)(+)CD8(+) populations indicated that A2/S(269)(+)CD8(+) T cells were detected at comparable frequencies (1.3  10(?5)) in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01(+) patients. These frequencies were higher than those found in uninfected HLA-A*02:01(+) donors (2.5  10(?6)), but low when compared to frequencies for influenza-specific (A2/M1(58)) and EpsteinCBarr virus (EBV)-specific (A2/BMLF(1280)) (1.38  10(?4)) populations. Phenotyping A2/S(269)(+)CD8(+) T cells from COVID-19 convalescents ex vivo showed that A2/S(269)(+)CD8(+) T cells were predominantly negative for CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1, and CD71 activation markers, although the majority of total CD8(+) T cells expressed granzymes and/or perforin. Furthermore, the bias toward na?ve, stem cell memory and central memory A2/S(269)(+)CD8(+) T cells rather than effector memory populations suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be compromising CD8(+) T cell activation.

It is unclear if people with depressive symptoms understand or apply COVID-19 information differently to the general population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine associations between depression, health beliefs, and face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Hong Kong. This study gathered data from 11,072 Hong Kong adults via an online survey. Respondents self-reported their demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), face mask use, and health beliefs about COVID-19. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent variables associated with depression. The point-prevalence of probable depression was 46.5% (n = 5,150). Respondents reporting higher mask reuse (OR = 1.24, 95%CI 1.17C1.34), wearing masks for self-protection (OR = 1.03 95%CI 1.01C1.06), perceived high susceptibility (OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.09C1.23), and high severity (OR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.28C1.37) were more likely to report depression. Depression was less likely in those with higher scores for cues to action (OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.80C0.84), knowledge of COVID-19 (OR = 0.95, 95%CI 0.91C0.99), and self-efficacy to wear mask properly (OR = 0.90 95%CI 0.83C0.98). We identified a high point-prevalence of probable major depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, but this should be viewed with caution due to the convenience sampling method employed. Future studies should recruit a representative probability sample in order to draw more reliable conclusions. The findings highlight that COVID-19 health information may be a protective factor of probable depression and suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Accurate and up-to-date health information should be disseminated to distressed and vulnerable subpopulations, perhaps using digital health technology, and social media platforms to prompt professional help-seeking behavior.","output":"Association Between Depression, Health Beliefs, and Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter is written for the welfare of the society, to question and enlighten on effects of the increment or decrement in the percentage of quality of air causing pollution due to the rise in the traffic post-lockdown due to Covid-19 in metro cities, specifically in Delhi. In this chapter, we address the question about peoples preference of moving in the shared taxis to their workplaces or their reluctance travelling in shared vehicle because of the fear of getting infected. The sensitivity of the situation will compel the people to move in a single-occupied vehicle (SOV). The rise in the number of vehicles on the roads will result in traffic jams, and different kinds of pollutions where people battling with the pandemic will inevitably get exposed to other health-related issues. We use a Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) model to combat this issue endangering the environment and public health. We exploit the BPR function to relate average travel time to the estimated number of commuters travelling by car. We collect mode share data from the NITI Ayog, the State Resource Centre and other authentic sources, which gives unique figures of the impact of shared mobility in India and how, in its absence, various sectors will get affected. Using the given data and the BPR, we evaluate increased vehicle volumes on the road if different portions of transit and carpool users switch to single-occupancy vehicles and its effect on multiple other factors. Based on the study of densely populated city, Delhi, we predict that cities with significant transit ridership are at risk for extreme traffic and pollution unless transit systems can resume safe with effective protocols. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"A Transition of Shared Mobility in Metro CitiesA Challenge Post-Lockdown Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of Geriatric Depression-15 Scale (GDS-15) in Turkish older adults and to compare the results with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fifth edition (DSM-5) depression criteria. METHODS A total of 329 outpatients were enrolled. In the first step, the patients underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination. After assessing whether the patients meet the diagnosis of depression based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, another researcher applied the long form of GDS. After sorting the items of short form out of the long form, two separate scores were obtained. The scores of GDS-30 and GDS-15 scales were compared with the scores of DSM-5. RESULTS The correlation of GDS-30 with GDS-15 was r=0.966 (p<0.001). The analysis performed considering DSM-5 criteria revealed that the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of GDS-15 in determining depression were 92%, 91%, 76%, and 97%, respectively, when the cutoff value was taken as 5. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 0.97 (95% CI=0.947-0.996) for GDS-15 (p<0.001). The Cronbach alpha coefficient for the total scale was 0.920. CONCLUSION GDS-15, just as GDS-30, is a beneficial scale in determining depression in older adults.

Findings from this study show that the use of art therapy as a coping strategy during the confinement period has clear benefits as it promotes emotional well-being and helps to reduce the mobility limitations caused by disability. The article concludes that art therapy can be used as an alternative way to cope with disability. It aims to positively impact parents and caregivers through highlighting new spots of action. Points of interest The article looks in detail at the real-life experiences of a disabled person during the period of home-confinement. Disabled people experience isolation from society and the home-confinement policies put more restrictions to their social interaction.

The risk is significantly increased with certain types of cancer, such as lung cancer. Partly due to difficulties in managing haemorrhage in outpatient settings, anticoagulant prophylaxis is only recommended for ambulatory patients at high risk of VTE. This requires a precise VTE risk assessment in individual patients. Although VTE risk assessment models have been developed and updated in recent years, there are conflicting reports on the effectiveness of such risk prediction models in patient management. The aim of this systematic review is to gain a better understanding of the available VTE risk assessment tools for ambulatory patients with lung cancer and compare their predictive performance. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review will be conducted using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science databases from inception to 30 September 2021, to identify all reports published in English describing VTE risk prediction models which have included adult ambulatory patients with primary lung cancer for model development and/or validation. Two independent reviewers will conduct article screening, study selection, data extraction and quality assessment of the primary studies. Any disagreements will be referred to a third researcher to resolve. The included studies will be assessed for risk of bias and applicability. The Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies will be used for data extraction and appraisal. Data from similar studies will be used for meta-analysis to determine the incidence of VTE and the performance of the risk models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required.

It is a multidomain protein that integrates readout of different histone modification states and DNA methylation with enzymatic histone ubiquitylation activity. Emerging evidence indicates that the chromatin-binding and enzymatic modules of UHRF1 do not act in isolation but interplay in a coordinated and regulated manner. Here, we compared two splicing variants (V1, V2) of murine UHRF1 (mUHRF1) with human UHRF1 (hUHRF1). We show that insertion of nine amino acids in a linker region connecting the different TTD and PHD histone modification-binding domains causes distinct H3K9me3-binding behaviour of mUHRF1 V1. Structural analysis suggests that in mUHRF1 V1, in contrast to V2 and hUHRF1, the linker is anchored in a surface groove of the TTD domain, resulting in creation of a coupled TTD-PHD module. This establishes multivalent, synergistic H3-tail binding causing distinct cellular localization and enhanced H3K9me3-nucleosome ubiquitylation activity. In contrast to hUHRF1, H3K9me3-binding of the murine proteins is not allosterically regulated by phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate that interacts with a separate less-conserved polybasic linker region of the protein.

METHODS: OSA diagnosis and COVID-19 infection were extracted from the hospital discharge, causes of death and infectious diseases registries in individuals who participated in the FinnGen study (n=260 405). Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine association.

In this condition, passive leg raising (PLR) could be used, but it requires a measurement of cardiac output. The tidal volume (Vt) challenge (PPV changes induced by a 1-min increase in Vt from 6 to 8 mL/kg) is another alternative, but it requires an arterial line. We tested whether, in case of Vt = 6 mL/kg, the effects of PLR could be assessed through changes in PPV (PPV(PLR)) or in IVCDV (IVCDV(PLR)) rather than changes in cardiac output, and whether the effects of the Vt challenge could be assessed by changes in IVCDV (IVCDV(Vt)) rather than changes in PPV (PPV(Vt)). METHODS: In 30 critically ill patients without spontaneous breathing and cardiac arrhythmias, ventilated with Vt = 6 mL/kg, we measured cardiac index (CI) (PiCCO2), IVCDV and PPV before/during a PLR test and before/during a Vt challenge. A PLR-induced increase in CI  10% defined preload responsiveness. RESULTS: At baseline, IVCDV was not different between preload responders (n = 15) and non-responders. Compared to non-responders, PPV and IVCDV decreased more during PLR (by ? 38  16% and ? 26  28%, respectively) and increased more during the Vt challenge (by 64  42% and 91  72%, respectively) in responders. ?PPV(PLR), expressed either as absolute or as percent relative changes, detected preload responsiveness (area under the receiver operating curve, AUROC: 0.98  0.02 for both). ?IVCDV(PLR) detected preload responsiveness only when expressed in absolute changes (AUROC: 0.76  0.10), not in relative changes. ?PPV(Vt), expressed as absolute or percent relative changes, detected preload responsiveness (AUROC: 0.98  0.02 and 0.94  0.04, respectively). This was also the case for ?IVCDV(Vt), but the diagnostic threshold (1 point or 4%) was below the least significant change of IVCDV (9[3C18]%). CONCLUSIONS: During mechanical ventilation with Vt = 6 mL/kg, the effects of PLR can be assessed by changes in PPV. If IVCDV is used, it should be expressed in percent and not absolute changes.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have shown the advantage of non-invasive over prompt invasive approaches in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. The dramatic situation of the pandemic raised the legitimacy of using high-flow oxygen therapy (HFO) outside the intensive care unit (ICU). The authors investigated ways of its best practice. METHOD: They retrospectively analysed documentation of patients receiving HFO in the first three waves of the pandemic on the Infectious Diseases' Ward (n = 193), to record oxygen saturation levels before and during HFO, number of treatment days. Discharge at home, transfer to intensive care unit and death were chosen as the three possible endpoints. The period of the third wave (standard therapy established) was analysed separately. RESULTS: As the pandemic progressed, the usage of MET (Medical Emergency Team) grew to 811%, the number of HFO devices grew by 567%. With concomitant standard COVID-19 therapy, 18.7% of the patients requiring HFO could be discharged home, avoiding invasive solutions. With optimal workload and experience, this ratio reached 36%. Among patients later discharged home, the median oxygen saturation before HFO was 78%, the total time with HFO was 8,5 days. The occurrence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum was 1%. The difference in oxygen saturation before HFO between the patients later discharged home and those transferred to ICU was not significant. CONCLUSION: The results support the assumption that low oxygen saturation at admission does not inevitably require invasive intervention in COVID-19 patients, high-flow oxygen therapy can also be performed by non-ICU professionals as ante-room to the ICU, under regular supervision by ICU experts, so that the deterioriation of the patients' condition is discovered appropriately.

In a context where specific vaccines are not yet available, the containment of the pandemic would be facilitated with efficient prophylaxis. Methods We screened several clinical trials repositories and platforms in search of the prophylactic strategies that are investigated against COVID-19 in late April 2020. Results Up to April 27, 2020, we found 68 clinical trials targeting medical workers (n=43, 63%), patients relatives (n=16, 24%) or individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 (n=5, 7%). (Hydroxy)chloroquine was the most frequently evaluated treatment (n=46, 68%), before BCG vaccine (n=5, 7%). Sixty-one (90%) clinical trials were randomized with a median of planned inclusions of 600 (IQR 255-1515).

Because higher learning and interactions with students during the initial stages of the pandemic resided predominantly in virtual space, the study design considered website content analysis as appropriate in addressing risk communications chosen by universities. Markedly, website content analysis was conducted among 43 IHEs accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges and part of a Texas University System. This sampling replicates previous IHE research in the state. The conceptual model entitled Conceptual Model for Evaluating Emergency Risk Communication (EERC) developed in public health was used to ground focused risk communication dimensions to (a) review whether or to what degree messaging from IHEs aligned with the components used by experts;(b) record the types of patterns that are found in messaging as well as characteristics that foster a Disaster Resilient University (DRU);and (c) provide insights on areas that may need more focus to ensure greater efficacy in the future. The ERC model yielded the following dimensions used for analysis: (a) accurate/reliable;(b) open/transparent;(c) clear;(d) tailored messages;(e) consistent/timely;(f) sufficient;and (g) actionable. In addition to ERC, content regarding technological solutions was assessed from websites of chosen universities to gauge how universities have responded to tools needed during the pandemic to make informed judgments for the campus and to share information openly for the community.

Meanwhile, cephalosporin-resistant mosaic penA alleles have been reported worldwide. Therefore, it is urgent to monitor the expansion of cephalosporin-resistant mosaic penA alleles. OBJECTIVES To develop a comprehensive high-throughput method to efficiently screen AMR determinants. METHODS We developed a method based on multiplex PCR with MALDI-TOF MS, which can simultaneously screen for 24 mutations associated with multiple antimicrobial agents in 19 gonococcal AMR loci (NG-AMR-MS). The performance of the NG-AMR-MS method was assessed by testing 454 N. gonorrhoeae isolates with known MICs of six antibiotics, eight non-gonococcal Neisseria strains, 214 clinical samples and three plasmids with a confirmed mosaic penA allele. RESULTS The results show that NG-AMR-MS had a specificity of 100% with a sensitivity as low as 10 copies per reaction (except for PorB A121D/N/G, 100 copies per reaction). For clinical samples with gonococcal load >5 copies/L, the method can accurately identify 20 AMR mutations. In addition, the method successfully detected specific cephalosporin-resistant strains with the A311V mutation in the penA allele. CONCLUSIONS Our high-throughput method can provide comprehensive AMR profiles within a multiplex format. Furthermore, the method can be directly applied to screening for AMR among clinical samples, serving as an effective tool for overall monitoring of N. gonorrhoeae AMR and also provides a powerful means to comprehensively improve the level of monitoring.","output":"A multiplex assay for characterization of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae using multi-PCR coupled with mass spectrometry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is a water-soluble polymer obtained by polymerization of monomer N-vinylpyrrolidone.

AIMS: To present a polycarbonate box (EndoBox) designed for use in upper GI endoscopy and evaluate its impact on the contamination of endoscopy staff during simulated procedures. METHODS: Simulated gastroscopies were performed using an upper body simulator placed in left lateral decubitus (LLD) and supine positions. The endoscopist and assistant wore personal protective equipment. Droplet exposure was measured using fluorescent abiotic surrogate particles. Two blinded observers independently viewed images from each scenario to qualitatively evaluate contamination levels. The primary outcome was the level of HCW contamination by droplets generated from a simulated cough with and without the EndoBox on the upper body simulator. The endoscopists ergonomic behaviour was also assessed using the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) tool. RESULTS: Without the EndoBox, there was a higher level of contamination on the endoscopist when the upper body simulator is in the LLD position. A higher level of contamination was observed on the assistant when the simulator is in supine position. With the EndoBox, the contamination levels on the endoscopy staff were lower in both LLD and supine scenarios. The endoscopists ergonomics were rated 2 to 3 on the RULA tool when using the EndoBox. CONCLUSIONS: The EndoBox reduces macroscopic droplet contamination during simulated gastroscopy. The endoscopists risk of musculoskeletal injury remained in the low risk categories as assessed by the RULA tool. Another advantage of the EndoBox design is the arch extending from the bottom that allows for removal of the box without withdrawing the endoscope. This enables rapid access to the patients airway if they experience respiratory distress. This study was limited by an inability to assess microscopic contamination and contamination at the level of the port or buttons when suction is applied.

MATERIALS AND METHODS HFD fed rats were orally dosed with HC-EA (100, 200, or 300 mg/kg) once daily for 8 weeks and the lipid profiles and protein expressions in hepatocytes were evaluated. RESULTS HFD rats showed an increase (p < 0.05) in the plasma lipid levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), free fatty acids (FFAs), and reduced the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Treatment with HC-EA extract (300 mg/kg) restored the changes in plasma lipid levels of TC, TG, LDL, FFA, and HDL in HFD-fed rats by 34.8, 31.1, 51.4, 32.4, and 56.3%, respectively, compared with control rats (p < 0.01).

The secondary objective was to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infections in the non-COVID intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS This was a retrospective descriptive study of data from the newly established mobile COVID-19 PCR laboratory database and the non-COVID ICU database during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (20 May - 8 August 2020) at a tertiary hospital in SA. RESULTS The mobile laboratory received 1 113 emergency COVID-19 PCR test requests for patients with non-COVID clinical presentations. The median (interquartile range) turnaround time was 152 (123 - 184) minutes (n=36). Primary outcome (20 May - 19 June, n=315): The sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 97%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values 82.4% and 99.2%, respectively. Secondary outcomes (9 June - 8 August): The prevalence of COVID-19 infections among patients admitted to the multidisciplinary adult and paediatric non-COVID ICU was 2.4% (n=4/168). The mean (standard deviation) COVID-19 positive rate for the mobile laboratory during this period was 18.1% (6%). The prevalence of COVID-19 infections among medical staff in the non-COVID ICU was 3.1% (n=1/32). CONCLUSIONS The establishment of a mobile PCR laboratory staffed by non-laboratory healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic provided a rapid, accurate and clinically effective solution for emergency hospital admissions with non-COVID-19 presentations.","output":"The impact of a mobile COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction laboratory at a large tertiary hospital during the first wave of the pandemic: A retrospective analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coffee berry borer (CBB) is one of the main coffee pests in the world including Colombia. This pest is difficult to manage because of its cryptic habits and the continuous availability of coffee fruits. Among the new management strategies being tested is the use of volatile compounds as insect repellents. In this work, the behavioral response of female adult CBBs to terpenes previously identified in the CBB-repellent plant species Lantana camara was evaluated. &#945;-Terpinene, (R)-limonene, farnesene and ?-caryophyllene terpenes were tested via a Y-tube olfactometer in which ripe coffee fruits were accompanied by terpenes at concentrations between 25 and 200 ppm. Only ?-caryophyllene induced a significant and consistent CBB repellent effect at all tested doses. The protective effect of microencapsulated ?-caryophyllene was then determined under laboratory conditions by incorporating the terpene in a colloidosome-gel system at 2.8  105 ng/h in the middle of coffee fruits with adult CBBs. The coffee fruits in turn presented a decrease in fruit infestation. Furthermore, the protection of coffee fruits when ?-caryophyllene gels were hung in coffee trees was evaluated in the field; infestations were artificially induced by the use of raisins (CBB-infested old coffee fruits) placed on the ground. Compared with unprotected trees, the trees treated with caryophyllene gels exhibited a 33 to 45% lower degree of infestation. Taken together, the results show that ?-caryophyllene is a promising compound for an integrated pest management (IPM) program in commercial coffee plantations.","output":"Evaluation of Terpene-Volatile Compounds Repellent to the Coffee Berry Borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair has been confirmed as an effective procedure in several studies but is considered technically demanding. Separating the hernial sac and spermatic cord is difficult when a large sac inguinal hernia is encountered. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a combined open and laparoscopic TEP repair of large sac inguinal hernias. METHODS From June 2012 to May 2015, laparoscopic TEP (112 cases) and combined open and laparoscopic TEP (COL-TEP) (44 cases) were performed in patients with large sac hernia. There was no clear definition of large sac inguinal hernia; therefore, we defined a large sac as one with the sac base cranial to or over outer ring that could not be easily resected laparoscopically. Using this definition, the laparoscopic TEP group was divided into a small sac TEP (SS-TEP) group (68 cases) and a large sac TEP (LS-TEP) group (44 cases). Direct hernias were included in the SS-TEP group because the hernial sac was easily dissected laparoscopically. The patient demographics, perioperative parameters, complications, and recurrence were compared between the three groups. RESULTS No significant differences were found between the groups in mean age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, number of previous laparotomies, or recurrence rate. Compared with the LS-TEP group, both the SS-TEP and COL-TEP groups had a significantly lower surgical duration (51.4  10.9 vs. 32.8  13.1 and 36.2  11.2 min, respectively), conversion rate (13.6 vs. 0 and 0 %, respectively), and total complication rate (27.3 vs. 13.2 and 11.3 %, respectively). CONCLUSION The combined technique was safe and effective for repair of large sac inguinal hernias. The combined technique was associated with decreased technical difficulty, surgical duration, and conversion and total complication rates.","output":"Combined open and laparoscopic technique for extraperitoneal mesh repair of large sac inguinal hernias."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A strategic approach to behavioral change communication streamlines communication processes of a health institution in a crisis setting like COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we examined suicide rates among welfare support workers and compared them to other occupations in Australia. METHODS: We used data from the National Coroners Information System to obtain suicide deaths between the years 2001 and 2016. Using the Australian standard population from 2001 and Census data from 2006, 2011 and 2016, we calculated age-standardised suicide rates and rate ratios to compare suicide rates across different occupational groups. RESULTS: Overall, the age-standardised suicide rate of welfare support workers was 8.6 per 100 000 people. The gender-stratified results show that male welfare support workers have a high suicide rate (23.8 per 100 000 people) which is similar to male social workers and nurses (25.4 per 100 000). After adjusting for age and year of death, both males (rate ratio 1.48, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.78) and female welfare support workers (rate ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.86) have higher suicide rate ratios compared with the reference group (excluding occupations from the comparison groups). CONCLUSION: The age-standardised suicide rates of male welfare support workers are comparable to occupations which have been identified as high-risk occupations for suicide. Both female and male welfare support workers are at elevated risk of suicide compared with other occupations.

MAIN TEXT: SARS-CoV-2 mainly targets the lungs and blood, leading to ARDS, and systemic thrombosis or bleeding. Angiotensin II-induced coagulopathy, SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperfibrin(ogen)olysis, and pulmonary and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation due to immunothrombosis contribute to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Type H ARDS is associated with hypoxemia due to diffuse alveolar damage-induced high right-to-left shunts. Immunothrombosis occurs at the site of infection due to innate immune inflammatory and coagulofibrinolytic responses to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in microvascular occlusion with hypoperfusion of the lungs. Lung immunothrombosis in type L ARDS results from neutrophil extracellular traps containing platelets and fibrin in the lung microvasculature, leading to hypoxemia due to impaired blood flow and a high ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) ratio. COVID-19-associated ARDS is more vascular centric than the other types of ARDS. D-dimer levels have been monitored for the progression of microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Early anticoagulation therapy in critical patients with high D-dimer levels may improve prognosis, including the prevention and/or alleviation of ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Right-to-left shunts and high VA/Q ratios caused by lung microvascular thrombosis contribute to hypoxemia in type H and L ARDS, respectively. D-dimer monitoring-based anticoagulation therapy may prevent the progression to and/or worsening of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Pathomechanisms Underlying Hypoxemia in Two COVID-19-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Phenotypes: Insights From Thrombosis and Hemostasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a block preconditioner, based on the algebraic multigrid method, for solving systems of linear equations, that arise in incompressible flow simulations performed by the stabilized finite element method.

These range from genetic defects that affect lipid metabolism in the leukodystrophies, cytopathic effects of viral infection in SSPE to the action of immunological effector mechanisms in MS and the viral encephalopathies. Irrespective of the initial cause of myelin degradation, many of these disorders are associated with some degree of CNS inflammation, as indicated by the local activation of microglia, recruitment of macrophages or the intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin. Many of these phenomena are now being duplicated in animal models, providing not only new insights into the pathogenesis of human demyelinating diseases, but also unexpected interrelationships between the immune response in the CNS and the pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimers disease and HIV encephalopathy.

Both direct and indirect consequences from COVID-19 infection are recognized to give rise to cardio- and cerebrovascular complications. Despite current limited knowledge on COVID-19 pathogenesis, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulopathy appear to play critical roles in COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular disease (CVD). One of the major subtypes of CVD is cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) which represents a spectrum of pathological processes of various etiologies affecting the brain microcirculation that can trigger subsequent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Prevalent with aging, CSVD is a recognized risk factor for stroke, vascular dementia, and Alzheimers disease. In the background of COVID-19 infection, the heightened cellular activations from inflammations and oxidative stress may result in elevated levels of microthrombogenic extracellular-derived circulating microparticles (MPs). Consequently, MPs could act as pro-coagulant risk factor that may serve as microthrombi for the vulnerable microcirculation in the brain leading to CSVD manifestations. This review aims to appraise the accumulating body of evidence on the plausible impact of COVID-19 infection on the formation of microthrombogenic MPs that could lead to microthrombosis in CSVD manifestations, including occult CSVD which may last well beyond the pandemic era.","output":"COVID-19 Infection and Circulating MicroparticlesReviewing Evidence as Microthrombogenic Risk Factor for Cerebral Small Vessel Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lim and Rosenhaft introduce mnemonic solidarity as a scholarly and political program, situating it in the context of the wider project and publication series Entangled Memories in the Global South.

There is, however, a limited understanding of virome diversity in Antarctic species, the extent of in situ virus evolution, or how it relates to that in other geographic regions. To assess whether penguins have limited microbial diversity we determined the RNA viromes of three species of penguins and their ticks sampled on the Antarctic peninsula. Using total RNA sequencing we identified 107 viral species, comprising likely penguin associated viruses (n = 13), penguin diet and microbiome associated viruses (n = 82), and tick viruses (n = 8), two of which may have the potential to infect penguins. Notably, the level of virome diversity revealed in penguins is comparable to that seen in Australian waterbirds, including many of the same viral families. These data run counter to the idea that penguins are subject to lower pathogen pressure. The repeated detection of specific viruses in Antarctic penguins also suggests that rather than being simply spill-over hosts, these animals may act as key virus reservoirs.","output":"Sustained RNA virome diversity in Antarctic penguins and their ticks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection has currently expanded the testing capacity for COVID-19, which yet relies on the SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR amplification. Objectives: To report on a COVID-19 testing algorithm from a tertiary care hospital emergency department (ED) that combines both antigen (performed on the ED) and RT-PCR (performed outside the ED) testing. Methods: Between December 2020 and January 2021, in a priori designated, spatially separated COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 ED areas, respectively, symptomatic or asymptomatic patients received SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing on nasopharyngeal swab samples. Antigen results were promptly accessible to guide subsequent, outside performed confirmatory (RT-PCR) testing. Results: Overall, 1083 (100%) of 1083 samples in the COVID-19 area and 1815 (49.4%) of 3670 samples in the non-COVID-19 area had antigen results that required confirmation by RT-PCR. Antigen positivity rates were 12.4% (134/1083) and 3.7% (66/1815), respectively.

Severe COVID-19 disease most often presents with pneumonia and complications in acutely ill patients often stem from the lungs. The associations of lung disease, smoking and e-cigarette use with the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are unclear on a population level. METHODS Data on 1761 patients from the Icelandic outpatient Landspitali COVID-19 Clinic were used. The prevalence of smoking, e-cigarette use and underlying lung diseases was calculated in the cohort, with stratification based on age groups and a clinical classification of symptom severity. It was tested whether these prevalences differed between age groups and classes of symptom severity. RESULTS Most patients were in the age group between 35-54 years of age and a large majority had mild symptoms at diagnosis. The prevalence of smoking was 6% with the highest prevalence among 35-54 year olds. The prevalence of e-cigarette use was 4%. It was most prevalent in the age group between 18-34 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of smoking or e-cigarette use between classes of symptom severity. The prevalence of lung disease was 9%. It was higher among older patients and patients with more severe symptoms. CONCLUSION The age distribution and prevalence of lung disease and their risk factors are described in the context of COVID-19 incidence and symptom severity in a whole-nation cohort of Icelanders. The cohort is younger and had less severe symptoms than in many previosly published studies of COVID-19. Interestingly, the prevalences of smoking and e-cigarette use were lower than in the Icelandic general population and they were not associated with symptom severity at diagnosis. To conclude, the results presented here indicate that underlying lung diseases are prevalent among people with severe COVID-19 symptoms but fail to demonstrate an association between cigarette smoking or e-cigarette smoking with COVID-19 severity.","output":"[The impact of lung diseases, smoking and e-cigarette use on the severity of COVID-19 illness at diagnosis]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has raised global health concerns. RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the prime component of viral replication/proliferation machinery and is considered to be a potential drug target against SARS-CoV-2. Present study investigated the anti-RdRp activity of phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Virtual ligand screening was carried out to determine the potent compounds against RdRp. Molecular docking and MD Simulation study was employed to evaluate the spatial affinity of selected phytochemicals for the active sites of RdRp. Structural stability of target compounds was determined using RMSD computational analysis and drug like abilities were investigated using ADMET. Bond distance between ligand and receptor were marked to predict the strength of interaction. Aloe, azadirachtin, columbin, cirsilineol, nimbiol, nimbocinol and sage exhibited highest binding affinity and interacted with active sites of RdRp surpassing the ability of chloroquine, lamivudine, favipiravir and remdesivir to target the same. All the natural metabolites exhibited stable conformation during MD Simulation of 101ns at 310K. Kinetic, potential and electrostatic energy were observed to be least in case of natural metabolites in comparison to synthetic analogs. Deviation and fluctuations were observed to be structurally least in target phytochemicals. Physiochemical and biological properties of these compounds further validated their drug like properties.

Therefore, it is becoming essential to develop fake news detection technologies. While substantial work has been done in this direction, one of the limitations of the current approaches is that these models are focused only on one language and do not use multilingual information. In this work, we propose a new technique based on cross-lingual evidence (CE) that can be used for fake news detection and improve existing approaches. The hypothesis of the usage of cross-lingual evidence as a feature for fake news detection is confirmed, firstly, by manual experiment based on a set of known true and fake news. Besides, we compared our fake news classification system based on the proposed feature with several strong baselines on two multi-domain datasets of general-topic news and one newly fake COVID-19 news dataset showing that combining cross-lingual evidence with strong baselines such as RoBERTa yields significant improvements in fake news detection. ? 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.","output":"Cross-lingual evidence improves monolingual fake news detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This investigation aimed to determine if there was a relationship between the production of eggs with poor internal quality, as measured by poor Haugh units, by Australian layer flocks and the detection of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in the hens. Other risk factors including flock size, flock type, flock age, chicken breed and vaccination frequency were also assessed. METHODS: The study group comprised 17 flocks from 14 farms. Data relating to the factors investigated were requested on a regular basis. The Haugh unit data were used to grade eggs as good or poor based on the age and flock at the time of data collection. Cloacal swabs were collected from 20 chickens in each flock approximately every 6 weeks. RESULTS: IBV was detected from a majority of the flocks and in 68% of cases the IBV strain detected was an A\\\\vaccine\\\\related field strain. Three variant strains were detected. Detection of IBV in a flock, the farm type and flock size were identified as potential risk factors for the production of eggs with poor Haugh units. CONCLUSION: IBV is prevalent in Australian layer flocks, but infection was primarily subclinical.

At the same time, most individuals are routinely subjected to standard clinical laboratory examinations, which create large health datasets over a lifetime. Computer processing has been used to search for health anomalies and predict diseases using clinical examinations. This work studied machine learning models to support the screening of diabetes through routine laboratory tests using data from laboratory tests of 62,496 patients. The classification and regression models used were the K-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, Bayes na?ve, random forest models, and artificial neural networks. Glycated hemoglobin, a test used for diabetes diagnosis, was used as the target. Regression models calculated glycated hemoglobin directly and were later classified. The performance of classification computer models has been studied under various subdataset partitions and combinations (e.g., healthy, prediabetic, and diabetes, as well as no healthy and no diabetes). The best single performance was achieved with the artificial neural network model when detecting prediabetes or diabetes. The artificial neural network classification model scored 78.1%, 78.7%, and 78.4% for sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores, respectively, when identifying no healthy group. Other models also had good results, depending on what is desired.

Yet, limited data, if any, are currently available on the role of ECMO in critically ill patients with COVID-19. We aimed at providing a snapshot analysis of ECMO for COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS Freely available data on ECMO in COVID-19 patients reported by the European Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (EuroELSO) were extracted and analyzed after conversion into long format. The primary outcome was the incidence of death during ECMO. Bootstrapping and logistic regression was used for inferential estimates. RESULTS Details from a total of 333 patients treated in 90 institutions spanning 17 countries were obtained, with 22% women and mean age of 52 years. Death rate was 17.1% (95% confidence interval: 13.1% to 21.1%), even if significant between-center differences were found, with some institutions reporting 100% case fatality. Exploratory inferential analysis showed no nominally statistically significant association between death and gender (p=0.788), but a significant association was found with age, mainly due to increased case fatality in subjects >60 years (odds ratio: 4.80 [95% confidence interval 1.64 to 14.04], p=0.004).

To limit viral transmission of infection, by March 10th, 2020, the Italian Government has ordered a national lockdown, which established home confinement, home (smart) working, and temporary closure of non-essential businesses and schools. The present study investigated how these restrictive measures impacted mothers and their pre-school childrens behavioral habits (i.e., sleep timing and quality, subjective time experience) and psychological well-being (i.e., emotion regulation, self-regulation capacity). An online survey was administered to 245 mothers with pre-school children (from 2 to 5 years). Mothers were asked to fill the survey thinking both on their habits, behaviors, and emotions and on those of their children during the quarantine, and retrospectively, before the national lockdown (i.e., in late February). A general worsening of sleep quality and distortion of time experience in both mothers and children, as well as increasing emotional symptoms and self-regulation difficulties in children, was observed. Moreover, even when the interplay between the behavioral and psychological factors was investigated, the factor that seems to mostly impact both mothers' and children's psychological well-being was their sleep quality.

Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities-Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan.

METHODS: We conducted this retrospective study using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2015. Joinpoint regression was used to estimate and describe temporal changes in the rates of all and acute appendicitis during the 14-year study period. We also estimated the risk of cardiac arrest, maternal, and fetal mortality among mothers of various racial/ethnic groups with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Within each group, patients without acute appendicitis were the referent category. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Out of the 58 million pregnancy hospitalizations during the study period, 63,145 cases (10.74 per 10,000 hospitalizations) were for acute appendicitis. There was a 5% decline (95% CI: ? 5.1, ? 5.0) in the rate of appendicitis hospitalizations over the period of the study. After adjusting for covariates, pregnant mothers with acute appendicitis had increased likelihood when compared to those without acute appendicitis to suffer fetal loss (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.85C2.28) and nearly fivefold increase for inpatient maternal death.

Two mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) are available. Mass vaccination remains the most critical way to halt the spread of the COVID pandemic. The most common adverse effects of the COVID vaccines are headache, muscular soreness, weariness, redness, swelling, and tenderness at the injection site. The dermatological adverse effects of mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, are little understood. We present a case of bullous fixed medication eruption following delivery of the second dose of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccination. CASE PRESENTATION: We discuss the case of a 78-year-old man who went to the Emergency Department at King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with numerous bullae throughout his extremities one day after receiving the second dosage of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. The bullae began three days before his presentation, and they were preceded by intense pruritus and urticated plaques. A skin biopsy was performed which revealed IgG (+1), IgM (+1), and C3 (+1) staining of the basement membrane. Another punch skin biopsy taken from an intact bulla was suboptimal compressing of dermal tissue only, revealing modest perivascular lymphocytic infiltrative and scattered eosinophils. This pathological picture with superficial perivascular inflammatory dermatitis, and the presence of eosinophils suggests drug-induced bullous pemphigoid. The patient was treated with topical and systemic corticosteroids, fusidic acid cream, and emollients after a confirmed diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid was obtained. He was hospitalized for 3 weeks as a case of severe sepsis due to a skin infection, and he was started initially on empiric antibiotics with piperacillin-tazobactam plus vancomycin that was later upgraded to meropenem and vancomycin based on the results of the blood and wound cultures. The patient suffered a pulmonary embolism on the second day of hospitalization and was placed on a heparin infusion that could potentially contribute to his death one month after discharge from our hospital. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Bullous pemphigoid is the most frequent autoimmune bullous disease. It occurs in the elderly. The cause of this disease is unknown, although it sometimes can be triggered by taking certain medications. Two case reports have also revealed bullous pemphigoid eruption following immunization. One case report reported a 78-year-old lady with diabetes and Alzheimer's disease who developed tense bullae on her face and torso after getting the second dosage of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Another case study described a 77-year-old male patient who developed generalized pruritis and bullae on erythematous bases one day after receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination. This new-onset bullous pemphigoid phenomenon has also been observed with other vaccinations such as rabies and swine flu. CONCLUSION: Although uncommon, several dermatological side reactions like bullous eruptions have been reported following the mRNA Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination.

The analysis of LV rotational deformation is challenging and requires standardization of image acquisition as well as postprocessing analysis. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility to analyse LV rotational deformation using 2DSTE by introducing a novel algorithm for the detection of artefacts. The study was performed in 20 healthy subjects serving as a control group and in 53 competitive sportsmen. Circumferential, radial strain (CS, RS) and LV rotation were analysed by 2DSTE in parasternal short axis views. The stepwise algorithm to exclude potential artefacts starts with the visual estimation of the image quality with respect to complete visualization of all myocardial segments during the entire cardiac cycle followed by the exclusion of data sets in participants with conduction abnormalities. The next step is the optimization of tracking areas and a cross-check of implausible strain waveforms in multiple acquired comparable cineloops. The last step is the exclusion of strain curves with persisting implausible waveforms if standardization failures and incorrect LV wall tracking are fixed. Plausible physiological strain curves were observed in 89% (n = 65/73) of all subjects. In controls all implausible waveforms could be verified as artefacts. The algorithm was applied in 53 professional athletes to test and confirm its feasibility. Abnormal CS waveforms were documented in 25 athletes, verified as artefacts due to tracking failures in 22 athletes and due to incorrect image acquisition in 3 athletes. CS artefacts were mostly located in the basal posterior and lateral LV segments. (endocardial: 6%, n = 4/70; p < 0.05) and basal posterior (endocardial: 8%, n = 5/70; p < 0.05) segments were highly susceptible to artefacts. 2DSTE of parasternal short axis views to analyse circumferential and radial deformation as well as LV rotation is feasible in athletes. The proposed algorithm helps to avoid artefacts and might contribute to standardization of this technique. 2DSTE might provide an interesting diagnostic tool for the detection of viral myocarditis, e.g. in athletes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of CD13 (also known as aminopeptidase N, APN) in the chondrocyte response to 14-3-3. After identifying CD13 in chondrocytes, we knocked down CD13 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) and blocking antibodies in articular chondrocytes. 14-3-3-induced MMP-3 and MMP-13 was significantly reduced with CD13 knockdown, which suggests that it has a crucial role in 14-3-3 signal transduction. Aminopeptidase N activity was identified in chondrocytes, but the activity was unchanged after stimulation with 14-3-3. Direct interaction between CD13 and 14-3-3 was then demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance. Using labeled 14-3-3, we also found that 14-3-3 binds to the surface of chondrocytes in a manner that is dependent on CD13. Taken together, these results suggest that 14-3-3 might directly bind to CD13, which transmits its signal in chondrocytes to induce a catabolic phenotype similar to that observed in osteoarthritis.

Current external validation studies often suffer from small sample sizes and consequently imprecise predictive performance estimates. To address this, we propose how to determine the minimum sample size needed for a new external validation study of a prediction model for a binary outcome. Our calculations aim to precisely estimate calibration (Observed/Expected and calibration slope), discrimination (C-statistic), and clinical utility (net benefit). For each measure, we propose closed-form and iterative solutions for calculating the minimum sample size required. These require specifying: (i) target SEs (confidence interval widths) for each estimate of interest, (ii) the anticipated outcome event proportion in the validation population, (iii) the prediction model's anticipated (mis)calibration and variance of linear predictor values in the validation population, and (iv) potential risk thresholds for clinical decision-making. The calculations can also be used to inform whether the sample size of an existing (already collected) dataset is adequate for external validation. We illustrate our proposal for external validation of a prediction model for mechanical heart valve failure with an expected outcome event proportion of 0.018. Calculations suggest at least 9835 participants (177 events) are required to precisely estimate the calibration and discrimination measures, with this number driven by the calibration slope criterion, which we anticipate will often be the case.

Engaging providers early in the implementation process offers an opportunity to explore their needs and behaviors, integrate interventions into workflows, and better understand provider setting capabilities. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed providers views on the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app in multiple care settings. METHODS: Participating providers included BH and physical health (PH) providers from a womens health center, an outpatient BH clinic, and both rural/urban primary care settings. All participating providers cocreated workflows through facilitated workshops, including establishing feedback loops between the project team and providers and identifying clinical champions at each site. Over a 12-week period, the providers referred adult patients experiencing anxiety or depression to a mobile app-based dCBI, RxWell, and provided other indicated treatments as part of usual care. Referrals were completed by the providers through the electronic medical record. To better understand facilitators of and challenges in integrating RxWell into routine practice and perceptions of sustainability, a series of qualitative interviews was conducted. Interview data were analyzed to identify major themes using an inductive content analysis approach. RESULTS: A total of 19 provider interviews were conducted to discover motivators and barriers for referring RxWell. The providers benefited from a focused discussion on how to incorporate the referral process into their workflow, and knowing the app content was rooted in evidence. Although the providers believed engaging in experiential learning was important, they indicated that more education on the digital health coach role and how to monitor patient progress is needed. The providers thought patient engagement may be impacted by motivation, a lack of comfort using a smartphone, or preference for in-person therapy. The providers also expressed enthusiasm in continuing to refer the app. They liked the ability to provide patients with support between sessions, to have an extra treatment option that teaches BH exercises, and to have a CBT treatment option that overcomes barriers (eg, wait times, copays, travel) to traditional therapy modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Digital intervention success in health care settings relies heavily on engagement of key stakeholders, such as providers, in both design and implementation of the intervention and focused evaluation within intended care setting(s). Scaling digital interventions to meet the mental health needs of patients in usual care settings leans on thoughtfully constructed and streamlined workflows to enable seamless referral of patients by providers. Our findings strongly suggest that providers are supportive of digital tool integration to support the mental health of patients and endorse its use within their routine workflow.","output":"Health Care Provider Perspectives on the Use of a Digital Behavioral Health App to Support Patients: Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The energy products of oil and gas majors have contributed significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and planetary warming over the past century. Decarbonizing the global economy by mid-century to avoid dangerous climate change thus cannot occur without a profound transformation of their fossil fuel-based business models. Recently, several majors are increasingly discussing clean energy and climate change, pledging decarbonization strategies, and investing in alternative energies. Some even claim to be transforming into clean energy companies. Given a history of obstructive climate actions and greenwashing, there is a need to objectively evaluate current and historical decarbonization efforts and investment behavior. This study focuses on two American (Chevron, ExxonMobil) and two European majors (BP, Shell). Using data collected over 2009C2020, we comparatively examine the extent of decarbonization and clean energy transition activity from three perspectives: (1) keyword use in annual reports (discourse); (2) business strategies (pledges and actions); and (3) production, expenditures and earnings for fossil fuels along with investments in clean energy (investments). We found a strong increase in discourse related to climate, low-carbon and transition, especially by BP and Shell. Similarly, we observed increasing tendencies toward strategies related to decarbonization and clean energy. But these are dominated by pledges rather than concrete actions. Moreover, the financial analysis reveals a continuing business model dependence on fossil fuels along with insignificant and opaque spending on clean energy. We thus conclude that the transition to clean energy business models is not occurring, since the magnitude of investments and actions does not match discourse. Until actions and investment behavior are brought into alignment with discourse, accusations of greenwashing appear well-founded.","output":"The clean energy claims of BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell: A mismatch between discourse, actions and investments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As previous pandemics, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has direct and indirect effects on mental health and well-being. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether meaning in life mediated the association between coronavirus suffering and satisfaction with life and whether stress-related growth moderated the mediating effect of meaning in life on the association between these variables. Stress-Related Growth Measure (SGM) was also conducted for the purpose of this study. The participants were 402 (66% women) young adults who completed the Suffering Measure During COVID-19, Meaningful Living Measure, Satisfaction With Life Scale, and SGM. The results indicated that the SGM has adequate psychometric properties with unidimensional structure of stress-related growth in the face of adversity. Moderated mediation analysis revealed that coronavirus suffering directly influenced satisfaction with life as well as indirectly by its effect on meaning in life. Additionally, stress-related growth was found as a moderator in the relationship between coronavirus sufferingCmeaning in life and coronavirus sufferingCsatisfaction with life. These results suggest that meaning in life mitigates the effect of coronavirus suffering on satisfaction with life, and this mediating effect is moderated by stress-related growth in young adults. While meaning in life helps explain the relationship between coronavirus suffering and satisfaction with life, the stress-related growth functions as a protective factor against the adverse effect of coronavirus experiences.","output":"A Moderated Mediation Effect of Stress-Related Growth and Meaning in Life in the Association Between Coronavirus Suffering and Satisfaction With Life: Development of the Stress-Related Growth Measure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging is a physiological process mediated by numerous biological and genetic pathways, which are directly linked to lifespan and are a driving force for all age-related diseases. Human life expectancy has greatly increased in the past few decades, but this has not been accompanied by a similar increase in their healthspan. At present, research on aging biology has focused on elucidating the biochemical and genetic pathways that contribute to aging over time. Several aging mechanisms have been identified, primarily including genomic instability, telomere shortening, and cellular senescence. Aging is a driving factor of various age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immune system disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders. Efforts to find drugs that improve the healthspan by targeting the pathogenesis of aging have now become a hot topic in this field. In the present review, the status of aging research and the development of potential drugs for aging-related diseases, such as metformin, rapamycin, resveratrol, senolytics, as well as caloric restriction, are summarized. The feasibility, side effects, and future potential of these treatments are also discussed, which will provide a basis to develop novel anti-aging therapeutics for improving the healthspan and preventing aging-related diseases.","output":"Aging and age\\\\related diseases: from mechanisms to therapeutic strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics can bring a range of devastating consequences to public health and the world economy.

We express the pandemic control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas. We then develop an iterative approach for synthesizing the optimal control strategies with MTL specifications. We provide simulation results in two different scenarios for robust control of the COVID-19 pandemic: one for vaccination control, and another for shield immunity control, with the model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy.

The study population included physicians, nurses, social workers, and other health professions [n = 288]. Data were collected from April 21stCJune 24th 2020. We used content analysis of free text responses among providers reporting increased stress, anxiety or depression. RESULTS: Two-thirds (184) of providers reported increased stress and one-third (96) reported increased anxiety or depression related to care provision during the COVID-19 epidemic. The major sources of stress, anxiety and depression were due to patient care, worry about becoming infected or infecting family members, work- and home-related concerns, experiencing provider burnout, and fear of the unknown. Concerns about quality of patient care, providers changing responsibilities, lack of personal protective equipment, and difficulty coping with co-worker illness and absence all contributed to provider stress and anxiety.

As part of the COVID-19 pandemic, we carried out in situ simulation for anaesthesiologists and operating room (OR) nurses. Simulation was focused on the recommendations on the use of specific personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as on airway management and intubation. We hypothesised that in situ procedural simulation should increase their perceived self-efficacy. Methods: Between 16 March and 20 March 2020, 208 healthcare workers took part in in situ procedural simulation. A questionnaire was sent to participants on 21 April 2020. Six self-efficacy items related to PPE and airway manoeuvres were assessed before and after training on a Numeric Rating Scale from 0 to 10. Results: Sixty-seven participants (32%) replied to the questionnaire. The before-after comparison of the six items revealed an increase in perceived self-efficacy for each of them. A before training difference was observed between nurses, board-certified anaesthetists and trainees in anaesthesia in perceived self-efficacy for putting on (6 (3-8) vs 4.5 (2.25-6) vs 2 (0-6), p=0.007) and remove PPE (8 (5-8) vs 4.5 (3.25-6) vs 4 (1-6), p=0.009).

People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID-19 because their early exposure to oxygen (hyperoxia) at birth increases the severity of respiratory viral infections. Hyperoxia at birth increases the severity of influenza A virus infections in adult mice by reducing the number of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. Since AT2 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), their expression should decline as AT2 cells are depleted by hyperoxia. Instead, ACE2 was detected in airway Club cells and endothelial cells at birth, and then AT2 cells at one year of age. Neonatal hyperoxia stimulated expression of ACE2 in Club cells and in AT2 cells by 2 months of age. It also stimulated expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung. Increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was blocked by mitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial superoxide scavenger that reduced oxidative stress and DNA damage seen in oxygen-exposed mice.

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING A representative sample of US ED visits using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). PARTICIPANTS Paediatric (age 18 years) ED visits in the 2017 NHAMCS data set. DATA ANALYSIS Each visit was coded as pain-related or non-pain-related using the 'reason for visit' variable. Weighted proportions were calculated with 95% CIs. Logistic regression was used to compare odds of pain-related visits. OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence of pain-related visits among paediatric ED visits. RESULTS There were an estimated 35 million paediatric ED visits in the USA in 2017, 55.6% (CI 53.3% to 57.8%) were pain related, which equates to 19.7 million annual visits. The prevalence of pain-related visits reached more than 50% of visits at age 6-7 and plateaued at relatively high proportions. Children of races other than white or black had lower odds of having a pain-related visit (OR 0.48, CI 0.29 to 0.81) than white children, as did children who were black, though the difference was not statistically significant (OR 0.88, CI 0.73 to 1.06). Relative to children covered by private insurance, children with Medicaid or CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) coverage had lower odds of a pain-related visit (OR 0.75, CI 0.60 to 0.93). Injuries represented 46.5% (CI 42.0% to 51.0%) of pain-related visits. Pain scores were reported in less than 50% of pain-related visits. CONCLUSION Pain is the reason for visit in 55.6% of paediatric ED visits across the USA. The prevalence of pain-related visits peak before adolescence and it continues relatively high until the age 18.

FINDINGS: There was a high prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the COVID-neurological (73.3%) and non-neurological COVID-hospitalised controls (76.6%) in contrast to the COVID-non-hospitalised controls (48.2%). aPS/PT IgG titres were significantly higher in the COVID-neurological group compared to both control groups (p < 0.001). Moderate-high titre of aPS/PT IgG was found in 2 out of 3 (67%) patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [ADEM]. aPS/PT IgG titres negatively correlated with oxygen requirement (FiO(2)R=-0.15 p = 0.040) and was associated with venous thromboembolism (p = 0.043). In contrast, aCL IgA (p < 0.001) and IgG (p < 0.001) was associated with non-neurological COVID-hospitalised controls compared to the other groups and correlated positively with d-dimer and creatinine but negatively with FiO(2). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that aPS/PT IgG is associated with COVID-19-associated ADEM. In contrast, aCL IgA and IgG are seen much more frequently in non-neurological hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Characterisation of antiphospholipid antibody persistence and potential longitudinal clinical impact are required to guide appropriate management.","output":"Antiphospholipid antibodies and neurological manifestations in acute COVID-19: A single-centre cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Intrinsic capacity (IC) and frailty are complementary in advancing disability prevention through maintaining functionality. OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationship between IC and frailty status at baseline and 1-year, and evaluated if IC decline predicts frailty onset among robust older adults. The secondary objectives investigated associations between IC, physical fitness and health-related outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Community-based assessments. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults aged>55 years, who were independent in ambulation (walking aids permitted). MEASUREMENTS: 5 domains of IC were assessed at baseline: locomotion (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6-minute walk test), vitality (nutritional status, muscle mass), sensory (self-reported hearing and vision), cognition (self-reported memory, age- and education adjusted cognitive performance), psychological (Geriatric Depression Scale-15, self-reported anxiety/depression). Composite IC (0C10) was calculated, with higher scores representing greater IC. Frailty status was based on modified Fried criteria, with frailty progression defined as incremental Fried score at 1-year. RESULTS: 809 participants (67.6+6.8 years) had complete data for all 5 IC domains. 489 (60.4%) participants were robust but only 213 (26.3%) had no decline in any IC domain. Pre-frail and frail participants were more likely to exhibit decline in all 5 IC domains (p<0.05), with decremental composite IC [9 (8C9), 8 (6C9), 5.5 (4C7.5), p<0.001] across robust, prefrail and frail. IC was significantly associated with fitness performance, independent of age and gender. Higher composite IC reduced risk for frailty progression (OR=0.62, 95% CI 0.48C0.80), and reduced frailty onset among robust older adults (OR=0.53, 95% CI 0.37C0.77), independent of age, comorbidities and social vulnerability. Participants with higher IC were less likely to experience health deterioration (OR=0.70, 95% CI 0.58C0.83), falls (OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.65C0.90) and functional decline (OR=0.64, 95% CI 0.50C0.83) at 1-year. CONCLUSION: Declining IC may present before frailty becomes clinically manifest, increasing risk for poor outcomes. Monitoring of IC domains potentially facilitates personalized interventions to avoid progressive frailty.

The purpose of this study is to investigate nurses experiences through analyzing the main themes shared on Instagram by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast with highly structured research, the current paper highlights nurses natural language use in describing their experiences during the first months of the outbreak in their workplace. Instagram captions were utilized as a data source. Leximancer was utilized for the content analysis of nurses narratives towards their coronavirus experience. We sought to accomplish three research objectives: the first was to identify the main themes in the descriptions of nurses experiences shared via their social media, specifically Instagram; then, to determine the relationships among concepts, and finally, to give useful implications based on the findings. The current study uses a qualitative (i.e., narratives) approach to analyze the main components of the nurses experiences during the pandemic. The Leximancer software analysis revealed nine major textual themes and the relationships among these themes.

However, most of the studies that have established this largely emanate from outside sub-Saharan Africa. The pandemic nature of the infection makes it instructive to evaluate its pattern among children across different climes, including ours. This study was set out to describe the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 in Bauchi State, North-East Nigeria. METHODS: this was a cross sectional study that involved 53 children between the ages of 0 and 18 years, who had RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection between March and June 2020 in Bauchi State, Nigeria. Data on epidemiological and clinical characteristics was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics V 21.? Relationship between categorical variables was established using the chi square test. The level of statistical significance was set at < 0.05, at a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. RESULTS: the mean age was 12.63  4.31 years with a slight preponderance of males (1.1: 1). Majority were asymptomatic (60.4%), while 32.1% and 7.5% had mild and moderate diseases respectively. The most common symptoms were cough (20.8%), fever (17%), and sneezing (15.1%). Five children (9.4%) complained of loss of taste while anosmia was documented in one child (1.9%). We observed a significant relationship between age category and the presence of symptoms. In fact, children younger than 10 years (pre-adolescents) were five times more likely to be symptomatic when compared to those above this age (p = 0.029, C I 1.08-21.56). CONCLUSION: our findings have shown a mild pattern of disease and good outcome among infected children.

Despite increasing knowledge on the effect of DCPs on asthma, the burden of work-related asthma caused by DCPs has not decreased in the past decade, emphasizing the need to strengthen prevention efforts. Novel data suggest an association between occupational exposure to DCPs and other chronic airway diseases, such as rhinitis, COPD, and poor lung function.

Kids Helpline, Australia's national youth helpline, provides children and young people with free 24/7 information and counseling through telephone, WebChat, and e-mail. We aimed to examine the use of Kids Helpline during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed monthly and weekly time trends of demand for and response by the Kids Helpline. The frequency of counseling contacts by common concern types, age, and gender were also examined. We used Joinpoint regression. RESULTS: Analyses of weekly demand for Kids Helpline showed an increase when the pandemic was declared, followed by a gradual decline. A second rise from 12 July 2020 when parts of Australia experienced a second wave of infections, followed by another decline, occurred more recently. Increased demand was almost entirely in the WebChat modality. Most answered counseling contacts were from girls and those aged 13-18 years. The number of contacts about mental health, suicide/self-harm, and family relationships increased, with mental health contacts also increasing as a proportion of total contacts.

Treatment with CURCPS-NPs effectively attenuated the interaction of ACE2 and CoV2-SP. The effects of CUR-PS-NPs were linked to reduced NF-B/MAPK signaling which in turn decreased CoV2-SP-mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, and p65/NF-B as well as nuclear p65/NF-B expression.

We conducted a scoping review to determine the extent of ICU PR interventions and how they were reported and measured. Methods We searched five databases from inception to December 2016 for prospective studies evaluating adult ICU PR interventions. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts for inclusion. We assessed completeness of reporting using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, or Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence guidelines, as appropriate. For planned PR interventions, we evaluated reporting with the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT) and assessed intervention and control groups separately. We calculated completeness of reporting scores for each study; scores represented the proportion of reported items. We compared reporting between groups using Kruskal-Wallis with Bonferroni corrections and t tests,  = 0.05.

In this contribution, we assess Greeces use of soft regulation in its regulatory response to COVID-19. Using acts of legislative content, which can be broadly conceptualised as softly adopted hard law, the Greek government largely achieved flexibility and simplified adoption procedures without having to resort to soft law per se. The role of soft law was limited - it complemented hard law rather than constituting the primary basis of COVID-19 restrictions - but not completely negligible. Soft law instruments regulated the processing of personal data, and was also pivotal in clarifying the criminal sanctioning of COVID-related rule violations. Greeces success in handling the first wave of the pandemic, while effective, was arguably unfair to asylum seekers who saw their right to apply for asylum curtailed, and their right to freedom of movement restricted when limitations on the rest of the population were lifted. With a second wave of infections currently in full swing, it is imperative to keep scrutinising regulatory responses to ensure that they place the health and dignity of every individual (whoever they might be) at their core and fully respect their fundamental rights.","output":"Killing me Softly?

METHODS: We report findings on abdominal imaging in 7 critically ill children admitted with MIS-C to a tertiary, urban intensive care unit. All children had clinical and laboratory criteria of MIS-C including positive antibody testing to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 23 children diagnosed with MIS-C, 7 children (30%) had abdominal imaging, including ultrasound (all 7) and CT (3/7). Indications for abdominal imaging included concern for acute abdomen, gall bladder inflammation and intestinal obstruction. Hepatomegaly was the most common finding, while nephromegaly, gall bladder wall edema, ascites, intestinal inflammation and mesenteric lymphadenopathy were also seen on ultrasound. Two children had incidental finding of bilateral lower lobe consolidations on CT abdomen. One child had a thickened, enlarged appendix with diffuse inflammation of intestinal wall of descending colon and ileum on CT. Another patient with severe MIS-C had fluidfilled small bowel loops, terminal ileal inflammation, diffuse lymphadenopathy and moderate ascites on abdominal CT.

As the data underlying infodemiology are fundamentally huge graphs and statistical in nature, there are computational challenges to the design of graph algorithms and algorithmic speedup. A framework that leverages cloud computing is key to designing scalable data analytics for infodemic control. This paper proposes the MEGA framework, which is a novel joint hierarchical clustering and parallel computing technique that can be used to process a variety of computational tasks in large graphs. Its unique feature lies in using statistical machine learning to exploit the inherent statistics of data to accelerate computation. Our MEGA framework consists of first pruning, followed by hierarchical clustering based on geodesic distance and then parallel computing, lending itself readily to parallel computing software, e.g., MapReduce or Hadoop. In particular, we illustrate how our MEGA framework computes two representative graph problems for infodemic control, namely network motif counting for community detection and network centrality computation for rumor source detection. Interesting special cases of optimal tuning in the MEGA framework are identified based on geodesic distance characterization and random graph model analysis. Finally, we evaluate its performance using cloud software implementation and real-world graph datasets to demonstrate its computational efficiency over existing state of the art.","output":"MEGA: Machine Learning-Enhanced Graph Analytics for COVID-19 Infodemic Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are increasing due to industrialisation of work processes.

The objectives of this study were to investigate, first, the influence of task variation on electromyographic (EMG) manifestations of shoulder muscle fatigue and discomfort; second, noticeable postural shoulder changes over time; third, if the association between task variation and EMG might be biased by postural changes. Outcome parameters were recorded using multichannel EMG, Optotrak and the Borg scale. Fourteen participants performed a one-hour repetitive Pegboard task in one continuous and two interrupted conditions with rest and a pick-and-place task, respectively. Manifestations of shoulder muscle fatigue and discomfort feelings were observed throughout the conditions but these were not significantly influenced by task variation. After correction for joint angles, the relation between task variation and EMG was significantly biased but significant effects of task variation remained absent.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that controlled decompression (CDC) surgery attenuates brain injury and reduces the rate of complications after TBI. Here, we investigated the potential molecular mechanisms of CDC in experimental models. The in vitro experiments were performed in a traumatic neuronal injury (TNI) model following compression treatment in primary cultured cortical neurons. We found that compression aggravates TNI-induced neuronal injury, which was significantly attenuated by CDC for 2 h or 3 h. The results of immunocytochemistry showed that CDC reduced neuronal necroptosis and activation of RIP3 induced by TNI and compression, with no effect on RIP1 activity. These protective effects were associated with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and preserved intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. In addition, the expression of the two-pore domain K(+) channel TREK-1 and its activity was increased by compression and prolonged by CDC. Treatment with the TREK-1 blockers, spadin or SID1900, could partially prevent the effects of CDC on intracellular Ca(2+) metabolism, necroptosis, and neuronal injury following TNI and compression. Using a traumatic intracranial hypertension model in rats, we found that CDC for 20 min or 30 min was effective in alleviating brain edema and locomotor impairment in vivo. CDC significantly inhibited neuronal necroptosis and neuroinflammation and increased TREK-1 activation, and the CDC-induced protection in vivo was attenuated by spadin and SID1900. In summary, CDC is effective in alleviating compressive neuronal injury both in vitro and in vivo, which is associated with the TREK-1-mediated attenuation of intracellular Ca(2+) overload, neuronal necroptosis, and neuroinflammation.","output":"Controlled Decompression Attenuates Compressive Injury following Traumatic Brain Injury via TREK-1-Mediated Inhibition of Necroptosis and Neuroinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article considers some of the theories and ways in which some modern scientists and economists have claimed that a \\"new economy\\" could emerge;the shift from manufacturing to services, technological transformation and flexible labour markets or telework.

So far, no study has evaluated whether ECG-based machine learning models have added value to predict in-hospital mortality specifically in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Using data from the CAPACITY-COVID registry, we studied 882 patients admitted with COVID-19 across seven hospitals in the Netherlands. Raw format 12-lead ECGs recorded within 72 h of admission were studied. With data from five hospitals (n = 634), three models were developed: (a) a logistic regression baseline model using age and sex, (b) a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model using age, sex and human annotated ECG features, and (c) a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) using age, sex and the raw ECG waveforms. Data from two hospitals (n = 248) was used for external validation. RESULTS: Performances for models a, b and c were comparable with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65C0.79), 0.76 (95% CI 0.68C0.82) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.70C0.83) respectively. Predictors of mortality in the LASSO model were age, low QRS voltage, ST depression, premature atrial complexes, sex, increased ventricular rate, and right bundle branch block. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the ECG-based prediction models could be helpful for the initial risk stratification of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and that several ECG abnormalities are associated with in-hospital all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, this proof-of-principle study shows that the use of pre-trained DNNs for ECG analysis does not underperform compared with time-consuming manual annotation of ECG features.

Little is known about COVID-19 effect on pregnant women; however, the emerging evidence suggests they may be at high risk of asymptomatic disease. In light of projected shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), there is an aggressive attempt at conservation. In obstetrics, the guidelines on PPE use are controversial and differ among hospitals, globally, as well as nationally. The centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommend using N95 respirators, which are respirators that offer a higher level of protection instead of a facemask for when performing or present for an aerosol-generating procedures (AGP). However, the second stage of labor is not considered an AGP. The second stage of labor can last up to 4 hours. During that time, labor and delivery personnel is in close contact to patients, who are exerting extreme effort during and frequently blow out their breath, cough, shout, and vomit, all of which put the health care team at risk, considering that COVID-19 transmission occurs through aerosol generated by coughing and sneezing. The CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not provide clarification on the use of N95 during the second stage. We recommend that labor and delivery personnel have the utmost caution and be granted the protection they need to protect themselves and other patients. This includes providing labor and delivery personnel full PPE including N95 for the second stage of labor. This is critical to ensure the adequate protection for health care workers and to prevent spread to other health care workers and patients.

The effects of this maneuver on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation are not well documented. OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of different PEEP on the left ventricular output (LVO), superior vena cava (SVC) flow, LVO/SVC flow ratio, cerebral oxygenation (CrSO2) and gas exchange in mechanically ventilated preterm infants with PDA. METHODS Sixteen mechanically ventilated infants of 23-30 weeks' gestational age with L-R shunting through the PDA were studied. Ultrasound measurements of LVO and SVC flow, CrSO2, arterial oxygen saturation and transcutaneous CO2 tension (TcPCO2) obtained at PEEP of 2 and 8 cm H2O were compared with baseline values at 5 cm H2O. RESULTS There was a small but significant reduction in LVO and the LVO/SVC flow ratio at PEEP of 8 compared to 5 cm H2O. SVC flow and CrSO2 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS Increasing PEEP to 8 cm H2O in ventilated preterm infants with a PDA produced a modest decrease in L-R ductal shunting as indicated by a lower LVO/SVC flow ratio.

The SARS-CoV2 virus leads to a severe respiratory illness which in the first place causes the simulation of the acute respiratory syndrome.

However, many seabirds are migratory, and it is difficult to understand the timing and location of their Hg accumulation. Seabirds may obtain Hg thousands of kilometers away, during their non-breeding period, and deposit that Hg into their terrestrial breeding colonies. We predicted that Hg concentration in rectrices reflects exposure during the previous breeding season, in body feathers reflects non-breeding exposure, and in blood collected during breeding reflects exposure during current breeding. To test this hypothesis, we measured total Hg concentration in these three tissues, which reflect different timepoints during the annual cycle of rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) breeding on both sides of the North Pacific (Middleton Island in Alaska and Teuri Island in Hokkaido), and tracked their wintering movement patterns with biologging devices. We (i) identify the wintering patterns of both populations, (ii) examine Hg levels in different tissues representing exposure at different time periods, (iii) test how environmental Hg exposure during the non-breeding season affects bird contamination, and (iv) assess whether variation in Hg levels during the non-breeding season influences levels accumulated in terrestrial plants. Individuals from both populations followed a figure-eight looping migration pattern. We confirm the existence of a pathway from environmental Hg to plant roots via avian tissues, as Hg concentrations were higher in plants within the auklet colonies than at control sites. Hg concentrations of breast feathers were higher in Alaskan than in Japanese auklets, but Hg concentrations in rectrices and blood were similar. Moreover, we found evidence that tissues with different turnover rates could record local anthropogenic Hg emission rates of areas visited during winter.

Five QTL hotspots identified clustered within genomic regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6 and 11. Specific QTLs such as qRDW1.1 and qFLSL5.1 were detected under low and high seeding densities, respectively. Detailed analysis the QTL regions identified under specific seeding densities revealed several candidate genes involved in phytohormones signals and abiotic stress responses. Whole-genome additive effects showed that '9311' contributed more loci enhancing trait performances than 'Nipponbare', indicating '9311' was more sensitive to the seeding density than 'Nipponbare'. The prevalence of negative epistasis effects indicated that the complementary two-locus homozygotes may not have marginal advantages over the means of the two parental genotypes. CONCLUSIONS Our results revealed the differences between indica rice and japonica rice seedling traits in response to seeding density. Several QTL hotspots involved in different traits and specific QTLs (such as qRDW1.1 and qFLSL5.1) in diverse seeding densities had been detected. Genome-wide additive and two-locus epistasis suggested a dynamic of the genetic control underlying different seeding densities. It was concluded that novel QTLs, additive and epistasis effects under specific seeding density would provide adequate information for rice seedling improvement during machine transplanting.","output":"Genetic analysis of rice seedling traits related to machine transplanting under different seeding densities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has had a significant global impact.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia in elderly COVID-19 patients with the R-MAPP (Remote-Malnutrition APP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 337 consecutive outpatients 65 years who attended the Central Emergency COVID-19 Hospital of Castilla y Leon was conducted. In all patients, the protocol of R-MAPP (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool [MUST] and Simple Questionnaire to Rapidly Diagnose Sarcopenia [SARC-F]) was realized. RESULTS: The mean age was 86.1  8.7 years, with a sex distribution of 167 males (49.5%) and 170 females (51.5%). According to the MUST test, patients with 0 points have a low nutritional risk (n = 50, 14.8%), 1 point a medium nutritional risk (n = 19, 5.6%), and 2 or more points a high nutritional risk (n = 268, 79.6%). The SARC-F questionnaire generates patients with 4 or more points as predictive of sarcopenia (n = 304, 80.2%) and <4 points without prediction of sarcopenia (n = 33, 9.8%). Global mortality was 24.03% (n = 81). The mortality rate was related to the pathological SARC-F score 4 (27.1% vs. 3.1%; p = 0.01) and MUST score 2 (26.7% vs. 16.4%; p = 0.04). In the logistic regression analysis, only the SARC-F score 4 remained as an independent variable related to mortality; odds ratio was 8.34 (95% CI: 1.1-63.8; p = 0.04), adjusted for age, sex, albumin levels, and MUST test.

Results For 15,518 older residents, VE declined from 50.7% (15.5, 71.3) to 17.2% (-23.9, 44.6) against infection; from 85.4% (60.7, 94.6) to 54.3% (26.2, 71.7) against hospitalisation; and from 94.4% (76.4, 98.7) to 62.8% (32.9, 79.4) against death, when comparing 2-12 weeks and []12 weeks after two doses. For 19,515 staff, VE against infection declined slightly from 50.3% (32.7, 63.3) to 42.1% 29.5, 52.4). High VE was restored following a third dose, with VE of 71.6% (53.5, 82.7) and 78.3% (70.1, 84.3) against infection and 89.9% (80.0, 94.6) and 95.8% (50.4, 99.6) against hospitalisation, for residents and staff respectively; and 97.5% (88.1, 99.5) against death for residents. Interpretation Substantial waning of VE is observed against all outcomes in residents from 12 weeks after a primary course of AstraZeneca or mRNA vaccines.

The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, mechanical ventilation, and time to discharge. RESULTS: Nine studies (with 6490 patients) were included in the analysis. In total, 3358 patients received tocilizumab, and 3132 received standard care/placebo. Pooled analysis showed a significantly decreased risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98, p = 0.02) and progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.89, p < 0.0001) in the tocilizumab arm compared to standard therapy or placebo.

Although the overall HIV testing rates before and during COVID\\\\19 measures were comparable, more MSM self\\\\tested for HIV during COVID\\\\19 measures (52.1%) compared to before COVID\\\\19 measures (41.6%, p = 0.038). Fewer MSM used facility\\\\based HIV testing during COVID\\\\19 measures (42.9%) compared to before COVID\\\\19 measures (54.1%, p = 0.038). Among 138 facility\\\\based testers before COVID\\\\19 measures, 59.4% stopped facility\\\\based testing during COVID\\\\19 measures. Among 136 self\\\\testers during COVID\\\\19 measures, 58.1% had no HIV self\\\\testing before COVID\\\\19 measures. Multivariable logistic regression showed that having sex with other men in the last three months (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.38 to 3.03), self\\\\identifying as gay (aOR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.31 to 3.13), ever disclosing their sexual orientation (aOR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.50) and tested for HIV in three months before COVID\\\\19 measures (aOR = 4.74, 95% CI: 3.35 to 6.70) were associated with HIV testing during COVID\\\\19 measures.

The Kenyan government embarked to fill capacity gaps in essential and advanced critical care needed for the management of severe and critical COVID-19. However, given scarce resources, gaps in both essential and advanced critical care persist. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of investments in essential and advanced critical care to inform the prioritization of investment decisions. MethodsWe employed a decision tree model to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of investment in essential care (EC) and investment in both essential and advanced critical care (EC+ACC) compared to current health care provision capacity (status quo) for COVID-19 patients in Kenya. We used a health system perspective, and an inpatient care episode time horizon. Cost data was obtained from primary empirical analysis while outcomes data was obtained from epidemiological model estimates. We used univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to assess the robustness of the results. ResultsThe status quo option is more costly and less effective compared to investment in essential care and is thus dominated by the later. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Investment in essential and advanced critical care (EC+ACC) was US $1,378.21 per DALY averted and hence not a cost-effective strategy when compared to Kenyas cost-effectiveness threshold (USD 908). ConclusionWhen the criterion of cost-effectiveness is considered, and within the context of resource scarcity, Kenya will achieve better value for money if it prioritizes investments in essential care before investments in advanced critical care. This information on cost-effectiveness will however need to be considered as part of a multi-criteria decision-making framework that uses a range of criteria that reflect societal values of the Kenyan society.

Therefore, measures to ensure that medical waste is managed safely and in an environmentally sound manner will avoid negative health and environmental effects from such waste, thus protecting the health of patients, health workers and the public in general. Despite that infectious medical waste generation rate is important for management planning and policy development, there is a limitation on national data availability and its accuracy, particularly in developing economies. This study analyses the infectious healthcare waste generation rates and management patterns in Lebanon before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated average of COVID-19-related infectious healthcare waste generation in this study is 39,035 kg per month or 1.3 tonnes per day, which constitute between 5% and 20% of total infectious healthcare waste in Lebanon. This study illuminates on the impact of COVID-19 on the existing challenges of waste management in Lebanon. It highlights the need for proper management and disposal of the amounts of medical waste generated to reduce contamination risks or related environmental threats, particularly during the pandemic. It also shows that Lebanon has a defective system for monitoring of waste from healthcare institutions and gaps in waste statistics.

Considering the high transmissibility of COVID-19, ED may be a concerning consequence for a large segment of the population. AIMS: To (1) summarize existing published evidence for the impact of COVID-19 on the prevalence, severity, treatment, and management of ED; and (2) identify health-related trends in the emerging literature and identify gaps in the existing research literature and make recommendations for future research needs in the area. METHODS: A scoping literature search was conducted on April 27, 2021. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was followed. The literature search was performed in PubMed using the terms: COVID-19, erectile, sexual, and dysfunction. A total of 693 publications were screened for relevance. Studies were appraised for their level of evidence based on study design and the rigor of methodology. RESULTS: The evidence that COVID-19 infection causes or impacts ED is compelling. Four topics emerged regarding the nature of the association between COVID-19 and ED: (1) the biological impact of COVID-19 infection on ED; (2) the mental health impact of COVID-19 on ED; (3) the impact of COVID-19 on the management of ED and access to ED treatment; and (4) health disparities and the impact of COVID-19 on ED. Long-term and well-designed studies are needed to clarify the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on ED. The pandemic exposed several vulnerabilities within worldwide healthcare and social systems. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has a uniquely harmful impact on men's health and erectile function through biological, mental health, and healthcare access mechanisms. As the pandemic wanes, strategies to identify long-term effects and additional health care support may be needed to adequately mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on men's health.","output":"The Epidemic of COVID-19-Related Erectile Dysfunction: A Scoping Review and Health Care Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The fallout from COVID-19 will reveal the depth and range of social, economic, and political disparities faced by U.S. families and children.

We then consider two alternative sets of intervals constructed with test inversion. The first set of intervals are approximate, using either asymptotic or bootstrap approximation to the finite-sample distribution of a chosen test statistic. We consider several choices of test statistic, including maximum likelihood estimators and generalized likelihood ratio statistics. We show with simulation that, at empirically relevant parameter values and sample sizes, the coverage probabilities for these intervals are close to their nominal level and are approximately equi-tailed.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the distance between the pylorus and the end of the left vagus nerve in order to determine whether it could be used as a constant anatomical landmark to start gastric transection. METHODS This was a prospective, non-randomized study of 120 patients undergoing SG from January to October 2018. The distance measurement between pylorus and vagus nerve was performed at the beginning of the SG. The primary endpoint was the distance between the beginning of the pylorus and the end of the 2nd branch of the vagus nerve on the upper edge of the antrum. The secondary endpoints was the correlation factors between the preoperative data and the position of the end of the vagus nerve. RESULTS A total of 120 patients, with a mean BMI of 42.2 kg/m2 , underwent primary SG. The mean distance between pylorus and the end of the vagus nerve was 50.4 mm (35-64) on the upper part of the antrum. When considering the inferior part of the antrum, the minimum distance was 50 mm. No correlations were found between pre-operative data and distance measurements. CONCLUSION The vagus nerve can be considered as a constant and reliable anatomical landmark for performing SG with antral preservation.

Difficulties with intubation commonly arise, and alternative laryngoscopes that use digital and/or fibreoptic technology have been designed to improve visibility when airway difficulty is predicted or encountered. Among these devices, a rigid videolaryngoscope (VLS) uses a blade to retract the soft tissues and transmits a lighted video image to a screen. OBJECTIVES Our primary objective was to assess whether use of videolaryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in adults requiring general anaesthesia reduces risks of complications and failure compared with direct laryngoscopy. Our secondary aim was to assess the benefits and risks of these devices in selected population groups, such as adults with obesity and those with a known or predicted difficult airway. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase on 10 February 2015. Our search terms were relevant to the review question and were not limited by outcomes. We carried out clinical trials register searches and forward and backward citation tracking. We reran the search on 12 January 2016; we added potential new studies of interest from the 2016 search to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification', and we will incorporate these studies into the formal review during the review update. SELECTION CRITERIA We considered all randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized studies with adult patients undergoing laryngoscopy performed with a VLS or a Macintosh laryngoscope in a clinical, emergency or out-of-hospital setting. We included parallel and cross-over study designs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, consulting a third review author to resolve disagreements. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, including assessment of risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS We included 64 studies identified during the 2015 search that enrolled 7044 adult participants and compared a VLS of one or more designs with a Macintosh laryngoscope. We identified 38 studies awaiting classification and seven ongoing studies. Of the 64 included studies, 61 included elective surgical patients, and three were conducted in an emergency setting. Among 48 studies that included participants without a predicted difficult airway, 15 used techniques to simulate a difficult airway. Seven recruited participants with a known or predicted difficult airway, and the remaining studies did not specify or included both predicted and not predicted difficult airways. Only two studies specifically recruited obese participants. It was not possible to blind the intubator to the device, and we noted a high level of inevitable heterogeneity, given the large number of studies.Statistically significantly fewer failed intubations were reported when a VLS was used (Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) odds ratio (OR), random-effects 0.35, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.65; 38 studies; 4127 participants), and fewer failed intubations occurred when a VLS was used in participants with an anticipated difficult airway (M-H OR, random-effects 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.55; six studies; 830 participants). We graded the quality of this evidence as moderate on the basis of the GRADE system. Failed intubations were fewer when a VLS was used in participants with a simulated difficult airway (M-H OR, random-effects 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.77; nine studies; 810 participants), but groups with no predicted difficult airway provided no significant results (M-H OR, random-effects 0.61, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.67; 19 studies; 1743 participants).Eight studies reported on hypoxia, and only three of these described any events; results showed no differences between devices for this outcome (M-H OR, random-effects 0.39, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.44; 1319 participants). Similarly, few studies reported on mortality, noting no differences between devices (M-H OR, fixed-effect 1.09, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.82; two studies; 663 participants), and only one study reporting on the occurrence of respiratory complications (78 participants); we graded these three outcomes as very low quality owing to lack of data. We found no statistically significant differences between devices in the proportion of successful first attempts (M-H OR, random-effects 1.27, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.09; 36 studies; 4731 participants) nor in those needing more than one attempt. We graded the quality of this evidence as moderate. Studies reported no statistically significant differences in the incidence of sore throat in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) (M-H OR, random-effects 1.00 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.38); 10 studies; 1548 participants) nor at 24 hours postoperatively (M-H OR random-effects 0.54, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.07; eight studies; 844 participants); we graded the quality of this evidence as moderate. Data combined to include studies of cross-over design revealed statistically significantly fewer laryngeal or airway traumas (M-H OR, random-effects 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.96; 29 studies; 3110 participants) and fewer incidences of postoperative hoarseness (M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.88; six studies; 527 participants) when a VLS was used. A greater number of laryngoscopies performed with a VLS achieved a view of most of the glottis (M-H OR, random-effects 6.77, 95% CI 4.17 to 10.98; 22 studies; 2240 participants), fewer laryngoscopies performed with a VLS achieved no view of the glottis (M-H OR, random-effects 0.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27; 22 studies; 2240 participants) and the VLS was easier to use (M-H OR, random-effects 7.13, 95% CI 3.12 to 16.31; seven studies; 568 participants).Although a large number of studies reported time required for tracheal intubation (55 studies; 6249 participants), we did not present an effects estimate for this outcome owing to the extremely high level of statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 96%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Videolaryngoscopes may reduce the number of failed intubations, particularly among patients presenting with a difficult airway. They improve the glottic view and may reduce laryngeal/airway trauma. Currently, no evidence indicates that use of a VLS reduces the number of intubation attempts or the incidence of hypoxia or respiratory complications, and no evidence indicates that use of a VLS affects time required for intubation.","output":"Videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for adult patients requiring tracheal intubation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study aimed to evaluate optic nerve head parameters and inner retinal layer thicknesses in obese children and adolescents. METHODS Forty-one eyes of 41 pediatric obese participants and 41 eyes of 41 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in this study. Body mass index was calculated, based on sex and age, using body weight and height measurements. Blood lipid values (i.e., cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride) were measured in obese participants. Optical coherence tomography was used to examine optic nerve head parameters, including rim area, disc area, cup-to-disc ratio, and cup volume, as well as the thicknesses of retinal nerve fiber layers and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layers. RESULTS Optic disc parameters were similar in obese and healthy children (p>0.05). The percentage of binocular retinal nerve fiber layer thickness symmetry was significantly different between obese and control groups (p=0.003). Compared to the control group, participants in the obese group exhibited thinner retinal nerve fiber layers in the superior quadrants (p=0.04) and thinner ganglion cell-inner plexiform layers in the superior-temporal sectors (p=0.04). There were no statistically significant correlations between the ocular parameters and lipid blood test values assessed in this study (p>0.05).

In simulations, we obtain estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. Given a noiseless measurement of the recovered population, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 101 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. With low noise added to the recovered population, accurate state estimates require a lengthening of the temporal baseline of measurements. Estimates of all parameters are sensitive to the contamination, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. The aim of this paper is to exemplify the power of SDA to determine what properties of measurements will yield estimates of unknown parameters to a desired precision, in a model with the complexity required to capture important features of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Identifying the measurements required to estimate rates of COVID-19 transmission, infection, and detection, using variational data assimilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers caring for sick patients are exposed to biological aerosols or droplets generated from sneezing, coughing, breathing, and speaking that may include normal oral, nasopharyngeal, or skin bacteria along with infectious ones such as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) It therefore follows that one of the main aspects of personal protective equipment against COVID-19 is the mask It has now been conclusively shown that use of surgical masks by general public and health care personnel have helped to prevent the spread of infection, particularly COVID-19 In this brief technical note, we address the urgency in meeting the increasing demands of masks as the first line of defense in the ongoing pandemic ? 2020 by ASTM International","output":"Demand and supply of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 57-year-old woman underwent treatment of a left internal carotid artery aneurysm with a Pipeline embolization device.

The current and predicted development trends in applied technologies affecting industry worldwide as formulated in the Industry 4.0 initiative have clearly emphasized the needs for constantly adapting curricula. The sensible socioeconomic changes generated by the COVID-19 pandemic have induced significant challenges to society in general and industry. Higher education, specifically when dealing with Industry 4.0, must take these new challenges rapidly into account. Modernization of the industrial engineering curriculum combined with its migration to a blended teaching landscape must be updated in real-time with real-world cases. The COVID-19 crisis provides, paradoxically, an opportunity for dealing with the challenges of training industrial engineers to confront a virtual dematerialized work model which has accelerated during and will remain for the foreseeable future after the pandemic. The paper describes the methodology used for adapting, enhancing, and evaluating the learning and teaching experience under the urgent and unexpected challenges to move from face-to-face university courses distant and online teaching. The methodology we describe is built on a process that started before the onset of the pandemic, hence in the paper we start by describing the pre-COVID-19 status in comparison to published initiatives followed by the real time modifications we introduced in the faculty to adapt to the post-COVID-19 teaching/learning era.

METHODS AND MATERIALS Between February 2010 and April 2015, 326 prostate carcinoma patients underwent combination high-dose-rate brachytherapy of 16 Gy (average dose 15.5 Gy; standard deviation [SD] = 1.6 Gy) and external beam radiotherapy of 59.4 Gy (average dose 60.2 Gy; SD = 2.9 Gy). In conjunction with the radiation therapy regimen, each patient was injected with 10 mL of a PEG hydrogel in the anterior perirectal fat space. The injectable spacer (rectal spacer) creates a gap between the prostate and the rectum. The rectum is displaced from the radiation field, and rectal dose is substantially reduced. The goal is a reduction in rectal radiation toxicity. Clinical efficacy was determined by measuring acute and chronic rectal toxicity using the National Cancer Center Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 grading scheme. RESULTS Median followup was 16 months. The mean anterior-posterior separation achieved was 1.6 cm (SD = 0.4 cm). Rates of acute Grade 1 and 2 rectal toxicity were 37.4% and 2.8%, respectively. There were no acute Grade 3/4 toxicities. Rates of late Grade 1, 2, and 3 rectal toxicity were 12.7%, 1.4%, and 0.7%, respectively. There were no late Grade 4 toxicities.

This quarantine-like intervention measure is especially feasible in countries and areas approaching malaria elimination. Motivated by mathematical models with quarantine for directly transmitted diseases, we develop a mosquito-borne disease model where imperfect quarantine is considered to mitigate the disease transmission from infected humans to susceptible mosquitoes. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is computed and the model equilibria and their stabilities are analyzed when the incidence rate is standard or bilinear. In particular, the model system may undergo a subcritical (backward) bifurcation at [Formula: see text] when standard incidence is adopted, whereas the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable as [Formula: see text] and the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable as [Formula: see text] when the infection incidence is bilinear.

As demonstrated by the explosive outbreaks of COVID-19 seen in congregate settings, the need for effective outbreak prevention and mitigation strategies for these settings is critical. Here we consider how interventions that decrease the size of the susceptible populations, such as vaccination or depopulation, impact the expected number of infections due to outbreaks. Introduction of disease into the resident population from the community is modeled as a branching process, while spread between residents is modeled via a compartmental model. Control is modeled as a proportional decrease in both the number of susceptible residents and the reproduction number. We find that vaccination or depopulation can have a greater than linear effect on anticipated infections. For example, assuming a reproduction number of 3.0 for density-dependent COVID-19 transmission, we find that reducing the size of the susceptible population by 20% reduced overall disease burden by 47%. We highlight the California state prison system as an example for how these findings provide a quantitative framework for implementing infection control in congregate settings. Additional applications of our modeling framework include optimizing the distribution of residents into independent residential units, and comparison of preemptive versus reactive vaccination strategies.","output":"Mitigating outbreaks in congregate settings by decreasing the size of the susceptible population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new virus in January 2020 following reports of pneumonia of unknown aetiology from China.

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly. Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The present article discusses this concept. ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels. As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs. Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans. Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects. In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.","output":"Renin-Angiotensin System Blockers and the COVID-19 Pandemic: At Present There Is No Evidence to Abandon Renin-Angiotensin System Blockers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of risk factors for a poor outcome have been identified. Thereby, cardiovascular comorbidity has a major impact on mortality. We investigated whether coronary calcification as a marker for coronary artery disease (CAD) is appropriate for risk prediction in COVID-19. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 109) were analyzed regarding clinical outcome after native computed tomography (CT) imaging for COVID-19 screening. CAC (coronary calcium score) and clinical outcome (need for intensive care treatment or death) data were calculated following a standardized protocol. We defined three endpoints: critical COVID-19 and transfer to ICU, fatal COVID-19 and death, composite endpoint critical and fatal COVID-19, a composite of ICU treatment and death. We evaluated the association of clinical outcome with the CAC. Patients were dichotomized by the median of CAC. Hazard ratios and odds ratios were calculated for the events death or ICU or a composite of death and ICU. RESULTS: We observed significantly more events for patients with CAC above the group's median of 31 for critical outcome (HR: 1.97[1.09,3.57], p = 0.026), for fatal outcome (HR: 4.95[1.07,22.9], p = 0.041) and the composite endpoint (HR: 2.31[1.28,4.17], p = 0.0056.

In 2020, we provided a comprehensive service to homeless facilities, which included workshops on HCV for personnel, a hepatitis ambassador at each facility, a rapid, onsite HCV RNA fingerstick test service, and assistance with linkage to care. Risk factors for HCV RNA-positive status were examined using Bayesian logistic regression. Of the 152 participants enrolled, 150 (87% men; median age: 47 years) accepted rapid HCV testing. Seven tested HCV RNA positive (4.7%, 95%CrI = 1.31C8.09; 7/150). Of these, five (71%) were linked to care, of whom four (57%, 4/7) initiated treatment and one (14%, 1/7) delayed treatment due to a drugCdrug interaction. Of these four people, two completed treatment (50%), of whom one (25%) achieved sustained virologic response after 12 weeks.

Intra-aneurysmal flow reduction induces progressive aneurysm thrombosis in most patients. Understanding the degree of flow modification necessary to induce complete aneurysm occlusion among patients with considerable hemodynamics variability may be important for treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with incidental intracranial saccular aneurysms who underwent FDS endovascular procedures were included and studied for a 12 months' follow-up period. We used computational fluid dynamics on patient-specific geometries from 3D rotational angiography without and with virtual stent placement and thus compared intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic problems. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to estimate the stent:no-stent minimum hemodynamic ratio thresholds that significantly (p0.05) determined the condition necessary for long-term (12 months) aneurysm occlusion. RESULTS We included 12 consecutive patients with sidewall aneurysms located in the internal carotid or vertebral artery. The measured porosity of the 12 deployed virtual FDSs was 833% (meanSD). Nine aneurysms were occluded during the 12 months' follow-up, whereas three were not. A significant (p=0.05) area under the curve (AUC) was found for spatiotemporal mean velocity reduction in the aneurysms: AUC=0.8890.113 (meanSD) corresponding to a minimum velocity reduction threshold of 0.353 for occlusion to occur. The 95% CI of the AUC was 0.66 to 1.00. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were 99% and 67%, respectively. For both wall shear stress and pressure reductions in aneurysms no thresholds could be determined: AUC=0.630.16 (p=0.518) and 0.670.165 (p=0.405), respectively.

This paper treats mainstream news about the current pandemic as a valuable entry point for analyzing the relationship between science and politics in the public sphere, where the outbreak must be both understood and confronted through appropriate public-health policy decisions. In doing so, the paper aims to examine which actors, institutions, and experts dominate the SARS-CoV-2 media narratives, with particular attention to the roles of political, medical, and scientific actors and institutions within the pandemic crisis. The study relies on a large dataset consisting of all SARS-CoV-2 articles published by eight major Italian national newspapers between January 1, 2020 and June 15, 2020. These articles underwent a quantitative analysis based on a topic modeling technique. The topic modeling outputs were further analyzed by innovatively combining ad-hoc metrics and a classifier based on the stacking ensemble method (combining regularized logistic regression and linear stochastic gradient descent) for quantifying scientific salience. This enabled the identification of relevant topics and the analysis of the roles that different actors and institutions engaged in making sense of the pandemic. The results show how the health emergency has been addressed primarily in terms of political regulation and concerns and only marginally as a scientific matter. Hence, science has been overwhelmed by politics, which, in media narratives, exerts a moral as well as regulatory authority. Media narratives exclude neither scientific issues nor scientific experts; rather, they configure them as a subsidiary body of knowledge and expertise to be mobilized as an ancillary, impersonal institution useful for legitimizing the expansion of political jurisdiction over the governance of the emergency.","output":"Politics overwhelms science in the Covid-19 pandemic: Evidence from the whole coverage of the Italian quality newspapers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 causes lung parenchymal and endothelial damage that lead to hypoxic acute respiratory failure (hARF). The influence of hARF severity on patients outcomes is still poorly understood. DESIGN: Observational, prospective, multicentre study. SETTING: Three academic hospitals in Milan (Italy) involving three respiratory high dependency units and three general wards. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive adult hospitalised patients with a virologically confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients aged <18 years or unable to provide informed consent were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Anthropometrical, clinical characteristics and blood biomarkers were assessed within the first 24 hours from admission. hARF was graded as follows: severe (partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) <100 mm Hg); moderate (PaO2/FiO2 101C200 mm Hg); mild (PaO2/FiO2 201C300 mm Hg) and normal (PaO2/FiO2 >300 mm Hg). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the assessment of clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality based on the severity of respiratory failure. Secondary outcomes were intubation rate and application of continuous positive airway pressure during hospital stay. RESULTS: 412 patients were enrolled (280 males, 68%). Median (IQR) age was 66 (55C76) years with a PaO2/FiO2 at admission of 262 (140C343) mm Hg. 50.2% had a cardiovascular disease. Prevalence of mild, moderate and severe hARF was 24.4%, 21.9% and 15.5%, respectively. In-hospital mortality proportionally increased with increasing impairment of gas exchange (p<0.001). The only independent risk factors for mortality were age 65 years (HR 3.41; 95% CI 2.00 to 5.78, p<0.0001), PaO2/FiO2 ratio 200 mm Hg (HR 3.57; 95% CI 2.20 to 5.77, p<0.0001) and respiratory failure at admission (HR 3.58; 95% CI 1.05 to 12.18, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A moderate-to-severe impairment in PaO2/FiO2 was independently associated with a threefold increase in risk of in-hospital mortality.

It was no surprise, then, that the Covid 19 pandemic that hit Kerala before any other part of India, became a test case for the Kerala model in dealing with such a crisis. Kerala was lauded across the world once again as a success story in containing this unprecedented pandemic, in treating those infected, and in making needed provisions for those adversely affected by the lockdown. But as it turned out, this celebration was premature as Kerala soon faced a third wave of Covid 19 infections. The objective of this paper is to examine Keralas trajectory in achieving the success and then confronting the unanticipated reversal. It will examine the legacy of the Kerala model such as robust and decentralized institutions and provisions for healthcare, welfare and safety nets, and especially the capacity of a democratic state working in synergy with civil society and enjoying a high degree of consensus and public trust. It will then examine the new surge of the virus and attempts to establish if this was due to any mistakes made by the state or some deficits in its model of public action that includes adversarial politics having a disruptive tenor about it.

Both the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and the alpha- subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (anchored to the membrane by fusion with the G protein membrane-spanning domain and cytoplasmic tail) were retained in the Golgi region of transfected cells when their single membrane-spanning domains were replaced with the first membrane- spanning domain from E1. Single amino acid substitutions in this sequence released retention of the chimeric G protein, as well as a mutant E1 protein which lacks the second and third membrane-spanning domains. The important feature of the retention sequence appears to be the uncharged polar residues which line one face of a predicted alpha helix. This is the first retention signal to be defined for a resident Golgi protein. The fact that it is present in a membrane-spanning domain suggests a novel mechanism of retention in which the membrane composition of the Golgi complex plays an instrumental role in retaining its resident proteins.","output":"A Golgi retention signal in a membrane-spanning domain of coronavirus E1 protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-shopping is growing globally, and the COVID-19 pandemic further accentuated this tendency. In this paper, online shopping adoption is analysed in Lisbon immediately before the pandemic outbreak. By focusing on an urban area, the impact of variables such as internet access or access to delivery services is controlled, thus enhancing the remaining components of the online purchase. The results show that online shopping is spatially dependent in an intraurban environment as a reflex of residential location preferences of different socioeconomic groups. Moreover, as internet access and delivery services become widespread, residential location preferences may come to explain e-shopping adoption both in urban and non-urban environments. The e-shopping geography of Lisbon suggests that age and affluence are determinants in explaining e-shopping adoption, with a marked distinction between central areas and more peripheral ones, some of which include extensive social housing projects. Hence, if retailers move online, shopping opportunities may become scarce for some consumers due to their socioeconomic status and consequent residential preferences. Nevertheless, strategic partnerships between retailers and the public sector may be devised to improve shopping opportunities. Physical stores can be encouraged to locate in areas where consumers are less prone to shop online. E-shopping adoption may also be encouraged by the public sector by promoting digital literacy, especially considering that the share of the older population is growing in Portugal as in most European countries.","output":"Exploring the e-shopping geography of Lisbon: Assessing online shopping adoption for retail purchases and food deliveries using a 7-day shopping survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airbnb has a major role to play in the competitiveness of the overall accommodation sector of individual destinations and it is rather unlikely that this role will diminish in the post-COVID-19 recovery of the tourism industry.

On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53%), diabetes (39.39%) and obesity (30.4%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80 304 cases with a mortality rate of 3.66%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an early transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico. The descriptive epidemiology shows similarities between the cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and those in China.

Traditionally quantifying this nuanced visual metric was undertaken using sensory panelists, which is both subjective and time consuming. Therefore, it is advantageous to develop an on-line quick and robust appearance assessment tool. The aim of this work is to develop a classification model which can classify the milk powder samples into different surface smoothness groups. This work proposes a strategy for quantifying the relative roughness of commercial milk powder from 3D images. Photogrammetry equipment together with the software RealityCapture were used to build 3D models of milk powder samples, and a surface normal analysis which compares the area of the triangle formed by the 3 adjacent surface normals or compares the angle between the adjacent surface normals was used to quantify the surface smoothness of the milk powder samples. It was found that the area of the triangle of the smooth-surface milk powder cone is smaller than the area of the triangle of the rough-surface milk powder cone, and the angle between the adjacent surface normals of the rough-surface milk powder cone is larger than the angle between the adjacent surface normals of the smooth-surface milk powder cone, which proved that the proposed area metrics and angle metrics can be used as tools to quantify the smoothness of milk powder samples.

Due to the difficulty of obtaining and emulating IoT firmware, the black-box fuzzing of IoT devices has become a viable option. However, existing black-box fuzzers cannot form effective mutation optimization mechanisms to guide their testing processes, mainly due to the lack of feedback. It is difficult or even impossible to apply existing grammar-based fuzzing strategies. Therefore, an efficient fuzzing approach with syntax inference is required in the IoT fuzzing domain. To address these critical problems, we propose a novel automatic black-box fuzzing for IoT firmware, termed Snipuzz. Snipuzz runs as a client communicating with the devices and infers message snippets for mutation based on the responses. Each snippet refers to a block of consecutive bytes that reflect the approximate code coverage in fuzzing. This mutation strategy based on message snippets considerably narrows down the search space to change the probing messages. We compared Snipuzz with four state-of-the-art IoT fuzzing approaches, i.e., IoTFuzzer, BooFuzz, Doona, and Nemesys. Snipuzz not only inherits the advantages of app-based fuzzing (e.g., IoTFuzzer, but also utilizes communication responses to perform efficient mutation. Furthermore, Snipuzz is lightweight as its execution does not rely on any prerequisite operations, such as reverse engineering of apps. We also evaluated Snipuzz on 20 popular real-world IoT devices. Our results show that Snipuzz could identify 5 zero-day vulnerabilities, and 3 of them could be exposed only by Snipuzz.

Extending our studies to lung epithelial cells, we found that there are major differences in drug sensitivity and entry pathways used by SARS-CoV-2 in these cells. Entry in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells is pH-independent and requires TMPRSS2, while entry in Vero and Huh7.5 cells requires low pH and triggering by acid-dependent endosomal proteases. Moreover, we found 9 drugs are antiviral in lung cells, 7 of which have been tested in humans, and 3 are FDA approved including Cyclosporine which we found is targeting Cyclophilin rather than Calcineurin for its antiviral activity.

We draw on Kingdon's definition of the agenda and Hilgartner and Bosk's public arenas model to conceptualize the global health agenda as those subjects or problems to which collectivities of actors operating nationally and globally are paying serious attention at any given time. We propose an arenas model for global health agenda setting and illustrate its potential utility by assessing priority indicators in five arenas, including international aid, pharmaceutical industry, scientific research, news media and civil society. We then apply the model to illustrate how the status of established (HIV/AIDS), emergent (diabetes) and rising (Alzheimer's disease) issues might be measured, compared and change in light of a pandemic shock (COVID-19). RESULTS: Coronavirus priority indicators rose precipitously in all five arenas in 2020, reflecting the kind of punctuation often caused by focusing events. The magnitude of change varied somewhat by arena, with the most pronounced shift in the global news media arena. Priority indicators for the other issues showed decreases of up to 21% and increases of up to 41% between 2019 and 2020, with increases suggesting that the agenda for global health issues expanded in some arenas in 2020- COVID-19 did not consistently displace priority for HIV/AIDS, diabetes or Alzheimer's disease, though it might have for other issues. CONCLUSIONS: We advance an arenas model as a novel means of addressing conceptual and measurement challenges that often undermine the validity of claims concerning the global health agenda status of problems and contributing causal factors. Our presentation of the model and illustrative analysis lays the groundwork for more systematic investigation of trends in global health agenda setting. Further specification of the model is needed to ensure accurate representation of vital national and transnational arenas and their interactions, applicability to a range of disease-specific, health systems, governance and policy issues, and sensitivity to subtler influences on global health agenda setting than pandemic shocks.","output":"The rise and fall of global health issues: an arenas model applied to the COVID-19 pandemic shock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019 a pneumonia outbreak by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, occurred in Wuhan City, China The disease was named as COVID-19 Information on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was first released on 10 January 2020 We urgently started development of genetic diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 On 14 January, soon after receiving the prototype designed primers, we have received the first clinical specimens suspected for COVID-19 We urgently started assessment of the primers and the laboratory diagnosis testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a parallel way After the nightlong assessment/testing, the first COVID19 case in Japan was confirmed The patient was a returnee from Wuhan Until 22 January, we have established the nested RT-PCR diagnostic method/protocol for SARS-CoV-2, and urgently distributed the primer set/protocol to  80 prefectural public health laboratories (PHLs) nationwide, because the Chun Jie holidays starts in China on 24 January and many Chinese tourists visit Japan As we concerned, sporadic COVID-19 cases with an epidemiological linkage to Wuhan have detected in Tokyo, Aichi, Nara, Hokkaido, and Osaka prefectures after 24 January Following the nested RT-PCR method, we have established the real-time RT-PCR diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2, and distributed the primer/probe set to  80 PHLs on 30C31 January However, the laboratory workload increased dramatically, because Japan has started to accept 829 returnees (15 were shown to be SARS-CoV-2-positive later) from Wuhan using government chartered flights on 29 January and screen 3,500 passengers and crew (&gt;600 were shown to be SARS-CoV-2-positive later) on a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama for SARS-CoV-2 About one month and a half has passed, a significant number of COVID-19 cases via unknown infection route are currently detected in many prefectures in Japan (total 239 cases, as of 2 March 2020)","output":"The initial response of the laboratory diagnosis team to SARS-CoV-2 in Japan and the current situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten human health worldwide, as new variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged.

In this work, we address this need by using the mRNA-lipid nanoparticle immunization method to generate a set of Omicron-targeting monoclonal antibodies.

Theoretical Perspectives: To address this gap in the field, I examine affordances from the lenses of diaspora literacy, transnational literacy, and racial literacy, which hold promise for understanding how to foreground race in the literacies of predominantly English-speaking Black immigrant youth I demonstrate how each of these lenses, as applied to the literacies of the invisible population of Black youth, allows for partial understandings regarding these students' enactment of literacies based on their Englishes and semiotic resources In turn, I illustrate how these lenses can work together to clarify the role of race in Black immigrant literacies Implications: Based on these discussions, I present the framework of Black immigrant literacies to assist researchers, practitioners, and parents who wish to better understand and support Black immigrant youth I invite researchers who work with populations that include Black immigrant youth to consider how race, when central to research and teaching surrounding the literacies and Englishes of these youth, can provide opportunities for them to thrive beyond the perceptions of them as \\"academic prodigies\\" while also facilitating relationships with their Black American peers I invite teachers to consider ways of viewing Black immigrant literacies that foster a sense of community between these youth and their Black American peers as well as ways of engaging their literacies in classrooms that allow them to demonstrate how they function as language architects beyond performance on literacy assessments I invite parents to provide spaces beyond school contexts where Black immigrant youth can use their literacies for social adjustment Through this essay, it is expected that the dominant population can gain further insights into the nuances that exist within the Black population and be cognizant of these nuances when engaging with Black immigrant youth","output":"Chapter 1: Silencing Invisibility: Towards a Framework for Black Immigrant Literacies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The kidney is not typically the main target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but surprisingly, acute kidney injury (AKI) may occur in 4C23% of cases, whereas the dialysis management of AKI from coronavirus 2019 has not gained much attention.

Design: Weighted prevalence estimates of students e-cigarette use using the 2014-2019 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS). For each year, t-tests for significance were used to compare estimates with those from the preceding year; t-tests were not performed on data for 2019 due to the change in survey format from paper to electronic. Setting: The NYTS is an annual school-based cross-sectional survey of US middle school (MS) and high school (HS) students. Participants: 117,472 students. Measurements: Self-report of past 30 day e-cigarette use based on students smoking status. Smoking status is assessed by asking if students have ever tried smoking, even one or two puffs, with never smokers responding no. Former smokers respond yes but have not smoked at all in the past 30 days. Current smokers used cigarettes at least once in the past 30 days. Frequent e-cigarette use is defined as use on 20 or more days in the past month. Findings: Past 30-day and frequent e-cigarette use increased among never, former, and current smoker youth from 2014-2019. In 2019, a greater proportion of current smokers used e-cigarettes frequently (HS = 46.1%, 95% CI: 39.1, 53.2; MS = 27.4%, 95% CI: 21.1, 33.6) compared to former smokers (HS = 23.2%, 95% CI: 18.1, 28.2; MS = 10.9%, 95% CI: 6.1, 15.7) and never smokers (HS = 3.7%, 95% CI: 3.0, 4.3; MS = 0.7%, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.9).

Both steroids and olfactory training have been proved to be effective for olfactory dysfunction with varied etiologies. We sought to perform a systematic review to summarize the evidence of steroids or olfactory training for patients with PVOD. Methods: A systematic literature review using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies assessing olfactory change in patients with PVOD receiving steroid or olfactory training. Results: Of the initial 273 abstracts reviewed, 20 articles with data from 2,415 patients with PVOD were included. Treatments including topical steroids, systemic steroids, classical olfactory training (COT), modified olfactory training (MOT), and olfactory training with steroid were analyzed. Both psychophysical olfactory testing and subjective symptom scores were utilized to assess the olfactory function. The routine use of nasal steroid spray alone during the management of PVOD seems to have no positive effect on olfactory dysfunction. Direct injection of steroid or nasal steroid spray into the olfactory cleft significantly improved the olfactory function in patients with PVOD. Olfactory improvement is greater than that of the natural course of the disease with short-term COT. Patients with PVOD would benefit more from long-term COT (>12 weeks). Treatment duration, various odorants, olfactory training devices, changing the types of odors periodically, different molecular odorants, and different concentrations of odorants tended to increase the efficiency of MOT. Clinically significant improvement after olfactory training was defined as an increase of threshold, discrimination, and identification (TDI) score 6. From week 24 to week 36, both COT and MOT groups reached the maximum therapeutic effect regarding the number of participants achieving clinically significant improvement. A combination of local or oral steroids with olfactory training is more efficient than COT only. Conclusion: Olfactory function in patients with PVOD was effectively improved through direct steroid administration in the olfactory cleft, COT, or modification of COT. The addition of topical steroids to COT therapy showed a tendency for greater olfactory improvement in patients with PVOD.","output":"Steroids and Olfactory Training for Postviral Olfactory Dysfunction: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of bile acids as functional biomarkers for hepatobiliary injury and disease has been proposed for decades, but the utility has been generally limited due to lack of sensitivity in diagnosis and assay availability. However, recent advances in liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry have allowed for highly sensitive profiling of individual bile acids across several different matrices. In the current work, a panel of 54 bile acids were quantified in plasma by high resolution mass spectrometry in the common species used for preclinical toxicity studies, including rat (both Wistar and Sprague-Dawley strains), Beagle dog, Cynomolgus macaque monkey, and New Zealand White rabbit. In each species, blood draws were collected across three days in such a way to derive overall interpretations of: 1) biological variability across species, 2) sex differences, 3) diurnal fluctuations in the bile acid pool (including over light/dark cycles), and 4) changes due to fed or fasting state. Various methods of normalization were applied to the dataset to overcome notable inter-individual variability in bile acid concentrations to allow for better data derivations and interpretation. As such, the current work elucidates not only key differences in the bile acid pool across species, but also informs best practices in protocol design and analytical methods for interpreting large sets of bile acid data. When taken together, these data facilitate better species translation and application of bile acids as biomarkers for hepatobiliary injury and disease.","output":"Establishment of baseline profiles of 50 bile acids in preclinical toxicity species: A comprehensive assessment of translational differences and study design considerations for biomarker development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Do partisan preferences, the electoral system, checks on government, political fragmentation, civil liberties and trust contribute to explaining the stringency of containment policies in European countries?

Social distancing policies have resulted in the rapid adoption of virtual learning (VL) by neurosurgeons as a method to exchange knowledge, but it has been met with variable acceptance. The authors surveyed neurosurgeons from around the world regarding their opinions about VL and how they see the future of neurosurgical conferences. METHODS The authors conducted a global online survey assessing the experience of neurosurgeons and trainees with VL activities. They also questioned respondents about how they see the future of on-site conferences and scientific meetings. They analyzed responses against demographic data, regions in which the respondents practice, and socioeconomic factors by using frequency histograms and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS Eight hundred ninety-one responses from 96 countries were received. There has been an increase in VL activities since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most respondents perceive this type of learning as positive. Respondents from lower-income nations and regions such as Europe and Central Asia were more receptive to these changes and wanted to see further movement of educational activities (conferences and scientific meetings) into a VL format. The latter desire may be driven by financial savings from not traveling. Most queried neurosurgeons indicated that virtual events are likely to partially replace on-site events.

Vancomycin is an option for treatment but is not without its own risks. Purpose: To institute a testing change to decrease time between ordering of MRSA tests and availability of results in patients admitted to the adult ICU. Procedures: A MRSA testing change was implemented at two adult (i.e., tertiary and community) ICUs located in a U.S. Midwestern health system. The change was implemented in 2018 and included the switch from culture to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in ICU admitted patients. Study data were collected from 2016-2020 and a Bayesian quantile regression model was fit to examine median level change in time to results and to calculate a counterfactual estimate. Main Findings: During the 58-month period, 71% of 19,975 patients seen at the two ICUs received MRSA testing.

The current state of diagnosis has led to misdiagnosis early on in infection. Here we describe the use of a novel sample preparation technology, NanoTrap particles, to enhance the detection of RVFV. Previous studies demonstrated that NanoTrap particles lead to both 100 percent capture of protein analytes as well as an improvement of more than 100-fold in sensitivity compared to existing methods. Here we extend these findings by demonstrating the capture and enrichment of viruses. RESULTS: Screening of NanoTrap particles indicated that one particle, NT53, was the most efficient at RVFV capture as demonstrated by both qRT-PCR and plaque assays. Importantly, NT53 capture of RVFV resulted in greater than 100-fold enrichment from low viral titers when other diagnostics assays may produce false negatives. NT53 was also capable of capturing and enhancing RVFV detection from serum samples. RVFV that was inactivated through either detergent or heat treatment was still found bound to NT53, indicating the ability to use NanoTrap particles for viral capture prior to transport to a BSL-2 environment. Furthermore, both NP-40-lysed virus and purified RVFV RNA were bound by NT53. Importantly, NT53 protected viral RNA from RNase A degradation, which was not observed with other commercially available beads. Incubation of RVFV samples with NT53 also resulted in increased viral stability as demonstrated through preservation of infectivity at elevated temperatures. Finally, NanoTrap particles were capable of capturing VEEV and HIV, demonstrating the broad applicability of NanoTrap particles for viral diagnostics. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing, enriching, and protecting RVFV virions.

AIM: We investigated whether patients and their families were consistent in recognizing the occurrence and severity of symptomatic side effects of chemotherapy treatment for cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective observational study. We administered a questionnaire survey to patients and family members to assess the frequency of occurrence (1: never, 2: almost never, 3: sometimes, 4: frequently, 5: almost always, 6: unknown) and the degree of severity (1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe, 4: extremely severe, 5: unknown) of physical and psychological symptoms associated with cancer chemotherapy. Weighted Kappa and Cramer coefficients were used to assess consistency between the two groups. We surveyed 20 pairs of patients (5 men, 15 women) and their families (10 men, 10 women); 17 pairs lived together. The median age was 65.5 years (interquartile [IQR], 58.75, 69.25) for patients and 61.00 years (IQR, 47.25, 71.25) for family members. Of patients, 17 had solid cancer, and three had leukemia. Family members mostly recognized objectively visible symptoms such as hair loss and development of spots and keratinization. However, it was difficult for families to detect invisible subjective symptoms such as weakness, dysesthesia, depressed mood, and unarticulated anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that recognition of invisible subjective symptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy was difficult even for family members. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach in which various medical professionals actively communicate with both patients and families is important. Information sharing in collaboration with patients and families could increase understanding of the patient's condition and optimize patient care.","output":"Consistency between patients and families in recognizing cancer chemotherapy side effects: A questionnaire survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the January JADA article titled Dentists Knowledge, Attitudes, and Professional Behavior Toward the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multisite Survey of Dentists Perspectives (Bakaeen LG, Masri R, AlTarawneh S, et al JADA 2021;152[1]:16-24), Dr Baqain's biography should read thus, Dr Baqain is the dean and a professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery, Hamdan Bin Mohammed College of Dental Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates;and a professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery, School of Dentistry, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan Address correspondence to Dr Baqain, Hamdan Bin Mohammed College of Dental Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, P O Box 505055, Building 14, Dubai Healthcare City, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, e-mail zaid baqain@mbru ac ae  The online version of this article has been corrected JADA regrets the error ? 2021 American Dental Association","output":"Correction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monitoring physical activity in medical and clinical rehabilitation, in sports environments or as a wellness indicator is helpful to measure, analyze and evaluate physiological parameters involving the correct subjects movements.

H2O2 is involved in ABA regulation of grafting-induced chilling tolerance of cucumber. Here we examined the role of ABA in the response of grafted cucumber to chilling stress. The data showed chilling induced an increase in leaf and root ABA content and there was a positive correlation between ABA content and the chilling tolerance of the varieties. The increase of ABA content and NCED mRNA abundance in the leaf of both Cs/Cs (self-root) and Cs/Cm (grafted with pumpkin as rootstock) showed a delay under aerial stress compared with those under whole plant and root-zone stress. Intriguingly, an increase in ABA in xylem was found under whole-plant and root-zone chilling stress but was not detected under aerial stress, implying the increases in ABA content in leaves were mainly from root ABA transportation. Compared to Cs/Cs, a higher ABA content and NCED mRNA abundance were observed in Cs/Cm, which showed that Cm could output more ABA than Cs. The removal of endogenous ABA decreased the difference in chilling tolerance induced by Cm, as evidenced by the observed similar oxidative stress levels and photosynthetic capacity between Cs/Cs and Cs/Cm after chilling stress. Moreover, we found that the H2O2 signal in grafted cucumber could respond to chilling stress earlier than the H2O2 signal in self-rooted cucumber. The inhibition of endogenous H2O2 decreased the chilling tolerance of grafted cucumber induced by ABA by reducing photosynthesis and the mRNA abundance of CBF1 and COR. Thus, our results indicate that H2O2, as the downstream signal, participated in the rootstock-induced chilling tolerance of grafted seedlings induced by ABA.","output":"H2O2 participates in ABA regulation of grafting-induced chilling tolerance in cucumber"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The demand for autologous hair transplantation is steadily increasing.

Nevertheless, current guidelines for neonatal resuscitation still recommend early cord clamping (ECC) for compromised babies, unless equipment and competent personnel to resuscitate the baby are available at the mother's bedside. The objective of this quality improvement cohort study was to evaluate whether implementing a new delivery room protocol involving mobile resuscitation equipment (LifeStart?) reduced the prevalence of ECC in assisted vaginal deliveries. METHODS Data on cord clamping and transitional care were collected 8 months before and 8 months after implementing the new protocol. The Model for Improvement was applied to identify drivers and obstacles to practice change. Statistical Process Control analysis was used to demonstrate signals of improvement, and whether these changes were sustainable. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of the new protocol on the primary outcome, adjusted for possible confounders. RESULTS Overall prevalence of ECC dropped from 13 to 1% (P < 0.01), with a 98% relative risk reduction for infants needing transitional support on a resuscitation table (adjusted OR 0.02, P < 0.001). Mean cord clamping time increased by 43% (p < 0.001). Although fewer infants were placed directly on mothers' chest (n = 43 [42%] vs n = 69 [75.0%], P < 0.001), there were no significant differences in needs for immediate transitional care or transfers to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. A pattern of improvement was seen already before the intervention, especially after mandatory educational sessions and cross-professional simulation training. CONCLUSIONS A new delivery-room protocol involving mobile resuscitation equipment successfully eliminated early cord clamping in assisted vaginal deliveries of term and near-term infants.

Only the 5'-most open reading frame (ORF) is believed to be transcribed from each sgRNA. The SHFV genome encodes nine ORFs that are presumed to be expressed from sgRNAs.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, an online-based anonymous survey was conducted within the Convention of University Professors of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery in Germany from April 3 to April 11, 2020. A bipolar 5-point Likert scale (with possible responses of \\"totally disagree,\\" \\"rather disagree,\\" \\"neutral,\\" \\"rather agree,\\" and \\"totally agree\\") was applied. Fifty-two (69.3%) of 75 clinic directors participated. RESULTS: Communication and cooperation with the government, hospital administration, and other departments during the COVID-19 pandemic were mainly perceived as appropriate. However, only 7 respondents (13.7%) totally agreed or rather agreed with the statement that the authorities are supporters of orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments. Substantial financial and personnel changes in orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments of university hospitals were reported, resulting in an average reduction of 49.4% in operating room capacity and an expected 29.3% loss of revenue. In addition, 14.7% of physicians were reallocated from orthopaedic and trauma surgery to other care-delivery environments. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments in German university hospitals. Distinct structural and financial effects were noted. Nevertheless, the present study demonstrates the commitment of our specialty to overcome the pandemic by providing competent personnel as well as close cooperation with the hospital administration and other departments.

The TREC-COVID Challenge was created to evaluate information retrieval methods and systems for this quickly expanding corpus. Based on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), several dozen research teams participated in over 5 rounds of the TREC-COVID Challenge. While previous work has compared IR techniques used on other test collections, there are no studies that have analyzed the methods used by participants in the TREC-COVID Challenge. We manually reviewed team run reports from Rounds 2 and 5, extracted features from the documented methodologies, and used a univariate and multivariate regression-based analysis to identify features associated with higher retrieval performance. We observed that fine-tuning datasets with relevance judgments, MS-MARCO, and CORD-19 document vectors was associated with improved performance in Round 2 but not in Round 5. Though the relatively decreased heterogeneity of runs in Round 5 may explain the lack of significance in that round, fine-tuning has been found to improve search performance in previous challenge evaluations by improving a system's ability to map relevant queries and phrases to documents. Furthermore, term expansion was associated with improvement in system performance, and the use of the narrative field in the TREC-COVID topics was associated with decreased system performance in both rounds. These findings emphasize the need for clear queries in search.

Integrated multi-omics analysis of data from these levels is necessary to understand the aberrant cellular functions accountable for cancer and its development. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have become a useful tool in integrated multi-omics analysis of cancer data. However, high dimensional multi-omics data are generally imbalanced with too many molecular features and relatively few patient samples. This imbalance makes a DL based integrated multi-omics analysis difficult. DL-based dimensionality reduction technique, including variational autoencoder (VAE), is a potential solution to balance high dimensional multi-omics data. However, there are few VAE-based integrated multi-omics analyses, and they are limited to pancancer. In this work, we did an integrated multi-omics analysis of ovarian cancer using the compressed features learned through VAE and an improved version of VAE, namely Maximum Mean Discrepancy VAE (MMD-VAE). First, we designed and developed a DL architecture for VAE and MMD-VAE. Then we used the architecture for mono-omics, integrated di-omics and tri-omics data analysis of ovarian cancer through cancer samples identification, molecular subtypes clustering and classification, and survival analysis. The results show that MMD-VAE and VAE-based compressed features can respectively classify the transcriptional subtypes of the TCGA datasets with an accuracy in the range of 93.2-95.5% and 87.1-95.7%. Also, survival analysis results show that VAE and MMD-VAE based compressed representation of omics data can be used in cancer prognosis. Based on the results, we can conclude that (i) VAE and MMD-VAE outperform existing dimensionality reduction techniques, (ii) integrated multi-omics analyses perform better or similar compared to their mono-omics counterparts, and (iii) MMD-VAE performs better than VAE in most omics dataset.","output":"Integrated multi-omics analysis of ovarian cancer using variational autoencoders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has impacted healthcare in many ways, including presentation of acute stroke. Since time-sensitive thrombolysis is essential for reducing morbidity and mortality in acute stroke, any delays due to the pandemic can have serious consequences. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records for patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke at a comprehensive stroke center in MarchCApril 2020 (the early months of COVID-19) and compared to the same time period in 2019. Stroke metrics such as incidence, time to arrival, and immediate outcomes were assessed. Results: There were 48 acute ischemic strokes (of which 7 were transfers) in MarchCApril 2020 compared to 64 (of which 12 were transfers) in 2019. The average last known well to arrival time (SD) for stroke codes was 1,041 (1682.1) min in 2020 and 554 (604.9) min in 2019.

Of the eyes, 63.2% (na?=a?87) presented with macular detachment in the post-COVID group compared with 45% (na?=a?100) in the pre-COVID group (odds ration [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.19-3.86; pa?=a?0.011). As well, eyes in the pre-pandemic cohort had significantly fewer detached quadrants on initial examination (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.93; pa?=a?0.026). Patients in the post-COVID group had a significantly worse corrected distance visual acuity at baseline (mean difference [MD]a?=a?-0.35 logMAR, 95% CI, -0.60 to -0.09; pa?=a?0.008), but not at 1 month or at final follow-up. No differences were seen between groups with respect to demographics, lens status, treatment, time to presentation, or chronicity. Pneumatic retinopexy was the most commonly performed procedure in both cohorts, with a 71.5% success rate. CONCLUSIONS: Closures after the COVID-19 pandemic affected the characteristics of RDs at presentation with respect to macular detachment, extent of RD, and presenting visual acuity. At final follow-up, final visual acuity and anatomic outcomes were similar between the 2 groups. These data are helpful for future patient education, triaging, and treatment decision making.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on characteristics of retinal detachments: the Canadian experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Primary care is the ideal place to implement behaviour change interventions for weight management. However, most primary care physicians are not managing patient weight as a standard of care due to lack of knowledge, skills and reimbursement. Generating more physicians who are familiar and comfortable with providing weight management is essential in leveraging a global change. In our university free clinic, medical students provide healthy lifestyle counselling using shared decision making to each patient at every clinic visit. OBJECTIVE: Improve the efficacy of behaviour change interventions via increased patient responsiveness and adherence. METHODS: The needs assessment demonstrated a subpar patient response rate to check-ins regarding behavioural change goals. In the first and second interventions, check-in message structure and contact schedule were varied to maximize patient responsiveness and goal achievement. RESULTS: In the needs assessment, 58% of patients responded to follow-ups and 58% of patients accomplished their goal. The first intervention cycle resulted in an improvement of responsiveness to 70% and accomplishment of goals to 59%. The second intervention cycle resulted in an improvement of responsiveness to 78% and accomplishment of goals to 74%. CONCLUSIONS: Messages that were frequent, unique, succinct and delivered within 4 weeks after the clinic visit resulted in the highest response rate and goal attainment. Other primary care clinics can use these interventions to increase patient completion of implemented behaviour changes for a healthier lifestyle.","output":"A patient-centredness improvement study for efficacy of behaviour change for healthy lifestyle and weight loss in a student-run free clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Dermatomyositis (DM) is an autoimmune disease mainly diagnosed by its symptoms and a physical examination, with only some subtypes of DM showing clear molecular changes. To date, few biomarkers have been identified to assess DM progression. Autophagy-related genes have been significantly correlated with inflammation, several types of autoimmune diseases, and the immune response, but few studies have explored the role of autophagy-related genes in DM. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the roles of autophagy-related genes in DM. Methods We collected three datasets of dermatomyositis-related transcriptome from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database: GSE1551, GSE46239, and GSE143323 and analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We also conducted functional enrichment analyses with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. To explore whether the autophagy-related genes were differentially expressed in DM compared with normal samples, we performed an intersection between the DEGs and autophagy-related genes obtained from the Human Autophagy Database (HADb, http://www.autophagy.lu/). Finally, we used selected autophagy-related genes as biomarkers for diagnosing and analyzing the correlation with immune cell infiltration. Results Our results showed that 143 genes were upregulated, and 14 were downregulated in the DM samples compared with healthy samples. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs played a significant role in the type I interferon signaling pathway, cytokine activity, chemokine activity, double-stranded RNA binding, and blood microparticles. The intersection results identified CCL2, CDKN1A, FOS, MYC, and TNFSF10 as the primary autophagy-related genes in DM. All showed significantly increased expressions in DM samples compared with healthy samples. We were also curious to investigate immune cell infiltration in DM. Our results showed that the selected autophagy-related genes significantly influenced the infiltration of multiple immune cells, such as B cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells. Finally, we assessed the diagnostic sensitivity of CCL2, CDKN1A, FOS, MYC, and TNFSF10 for DM. The results showed the area under the curve (AUC) values of the ROC were 0.855, 0.889, 0.744, 0.826, and 0.816, respectively. The combined genes' diagnostic AUC value was 0.951.

Even though the transmission risk is higher in indoor spaces, recent evidence suggests that physical contact outdoors also contributes to an increased virus exposure. Given that streets constitute the largest percentage of public space in cities, there is an increasing need to prioritise their use to minimise transmission risk. However, city officials currently lack the assessment tools to achieve this. This article evaluates the extent to which street segments are associated with spatiotemporal variations of potential exposures of pedestrians to virus transmission. We develop a multi-component risk score that considers both urban form and human activity along streets over time, including (a) an assessment of pedestrian infrastructure according to the average width of pavements, (b) a measure of accessibility for each street based on its position in the street network, (c) an activity exposure score that identifies places along streets where exposure could be higher and (d) an estimate of the number of pedestrians that will pass through each street during weekdays and weekends. We use Amsterdam in the Netherlands as a case study to illustrate how our score could be used to assess the exposure of pedestrians to virus transmission along streets. Our approach can be replicated in other cities facing a similar challenge of bringing life back to the streets while minimising transmission risks.","output":"Cities and infectious diseases: Assessing the exposure of pedestrians to virus transmission along city streets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is growing evidence on the effect of face mask use in controlling the spread of COVID-19.

We used data on daily and cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to calibrate and validate our model. We then used the model to assess the effect of the executive order on face mask use on infections and deaths due to COVID-19 in NYC. Our results showed that the executive order on face mask use was estimated to avert 99,517 (95% CIs 72,723-126,312) COVID-19 infections and 7978 (5692-10,265) deaths in NYC.

We add to this literature the finding that the school context alone, without referring to peers' ability, triggers social comparison and can decrease students' ASC. We hypothesize that attenuating the school context increases students' ASC. The paper shows two examples of how attenuating school context leads to an increase in ASC. In Study 1, we exploited COVID-19-induced home-based education where students learned online without their usual school context. We find that students' ASC in reading and writing increased outside the school context. In the randomized survey experiment of Study 2, we treated students by asking first for their ASC and subsequently their grades - thus, we attenuated the school context by ordering the questions. We asked control students first about their grades and subsequently their ASC. We found that treated students' ASC increased in reading (but not in writing) compared to the control students who first reported their grades and then their ASC.

Here, we review the difficulties of inferring reliable phylogenies by example of a data snapshot comprising all virus sequences available on May 5, 2020 from gisaid.org. We find that it is difficult to infer a reliable phylogeny on these data due to the large number of sequences in conjunction with the low number of mutations. We further find that rooting the inferred phylogeny with some degree of confidence either via the bat and pangolin outgroups or by applying novel computational methods on the ingroup phylogeny does not appear to be possible. Finally, an automatic classification of the current sequences into sub-classes based on statistical criteria is also not possible, as the sequences are too closely related. We conclude that, although the application of phylogenetic methods to disentangle the evolution and spread of COVID-19 provides some insight, results of phylogenetic analyses, in particular those conducted under the default settings of current phylogenetic inference tools, as well as downstream analyses on the inferred phylogenies, should be considered and interpreted with extreme caution.","output":"Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data is difficult"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic has led to a sudden disruption of routine treatment services.

The UN and WHO encourage countries to make health facility location data open, to encourage use and improvement. We provide a summary of open access health facility location data in Africa using re-useable code. We aim to support data analysts developing software tools to address COVID-19 response in individual countries. In Africa there are currently three main sources of such data; 1) direct from national ministries of health, 2) a database for sub-Saharan Africa collated and published by a team from KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme and now hosted by WHO, and 3) The Global Healthsites Mapping Project in collaboration with OpenStreetMap. Methods: We searched for and documented official national facility location data that were openly available. We developed re-useable open-source R code to summarise and visualise facility location data by country from the three sources. This re-useable code is used to provide a web user interface allowing data exploration through maps and plots of facility type. Results: Out of 53 African countries, seven provide an official open facility list that can be downloaded and analysed reproducibly. Considering all three sources, there are over 185,000 health facility locations available for Africa. However, there are differences and overlaps between sources and a lack of data on capacities and service provision.

These restrictions may be particularly difficult for adolescents, who rely heavily on their peer connections for emotional support. However, there has been no longitudinal research examining the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents mental health, and moderators of change, as well as assessing the factors perceived as causing the most distress. Two hundred and forty eight adolescents (M(age) = 14.4; 51% girls; 81.8% Caucasian) were surveyed over two time points; in the 12 months leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak (T1), and again two months following the implementation of government restrictions and online learning (T2). Online surveys assessed depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction at T1 and T2, and participants schooling, peer and family relationships, social connection, media exposure, COVID-19 related stress, and adherence to government stay-at-home directives at T2 only. In line with predictions, adolescents experienced significant increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety, and a significant decrease in life satisfaction from T1 to T2, which was particularly pronounced among girls. Moderation analyses revealed that COVID-19 related worries, online learning difficulties, and increased conflict with parents predicted increases in mental health problems from T1 to T2, whereas adherence to stay-at-home orders and feeling socially connected during the COVID-19 lockdown protected against poor mental health. This study provides initial longitudinal evidence for the decline of adolescents mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that adolescents are more concerned about the government restrictions designed to contain the spread of the virus, than the virus itself, and that those concerns are associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and decreased life satisfaction.","output":"Risk and Protective Factors for Prospective Changes in Adolescent Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reported COVID-19 cases in the United States of America have crossed over 10 million and a large number of infected cases are undetected whose estimation can be done if country-wide antibody testing is performed.

With no end date, the pandemic persists with the emergence of novel variants that threaten the effectiveness of diagnostic tests and vaccines. Mutations in the Spike surface protein of the virus are regularly observed in the new variants, potentializing the emergence of novel viruses with different tropism from the current ones, which may change the severity and symptoms of the disease. Growing evidence has shown that mutations are being selected in favor of variants that are more capable of evading the action of neutralizing antibodies. In this context, the most important factor guiding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is its interaction with the hosts immune system. Thus, as current vaccines cannot block the transmission of the virus, measures complementary to vaccination, such as the use of masks, hand hygiene, and keeping environments ventilated remain essential to delay the emergence of new variants. Importantly, in addition to the involvement of the immune system in the evolution of the virus, we highlight several chemical parameters that influence the molecular interactions between viruses and host cells during invasion and are also critical tools making novel variants more transmissible. In this review, we dissect the impacts of the Spike mutations on biological parameters such as (1) the increase in Spike binding affinity to hACE2; (2) bound time for the receptor to be cleaved by the proteases; (3) how mutations associate with the increase in RBD up-conformation state in the Spike ectodomain; (4) expansion of uncleaved Spike protein in the virion particles; (5) increment in Spike concentration per virion particles; and (6) evasion of the immune system.

METHODS: Published and peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of immunomodulators in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were searched up to June 30, 2021. Direct and network meta-analyses were applied to assess the outcomes. The probability of efficacy and safety was estimated, and the drugs were awarded a numerical ranking. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were eligible. Compared with standard of care, dexamethasone and tocilizumab had significantly lower mortality rates with pooled risk ratios (RRs) of 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84C0.99) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.82C0.96), respectively. Meanwhile, the most effective corticosteroid, interleukin-6 antagonist, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor were hydrocortisone, sarilumab, and ruxolitinib, respectively. However, when superimposed infection was considered, ruxolitinib was the best treatment followed by baricitinib. Moreover, methylprednisolone had the worst combined efficacy and safety among the examined treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, immunomodulators were more effective than standard of care. Important differences exist among immunomodulators regarding both efficacy and safety in favor of ruxolitinib and baricitinib. Further well-conducted randomized controlled trials should focus on JAK inhibitors. Methylprednisolone use should be discouraged because of its poor efficacy and high risk of superimposed infection.

Objective: To systematically assess the validity of reported post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children. Evidence Review: A search on PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies published up to January 22, 2022, that reported on post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children (<18 years) with a minimum follow-up of 2 months since detection of infection or 1 month since recovery from acute illness. We assessed the consideration of confounding bias and causality, and the risk of bias. Findings: 21 studies including 81,896 children reported up to 97 symptoms with follow-up periods of 2-11.5 months. Fifteen studies had no control group. The reported proportion of children with post-COVID syndrome was between 0% and 66.5% in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=16,986) and 2% to 53.3% in children without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=64,910).

RESULTS A total of 5,374 cases of COVID-19 and 26 decrees were analyzed. Nine decrees increased social distancing measures, nine maintained them, and eight loosened them. Of the 26 actions, 9 were consonant and 17 dissonant with the tendency indicated by the Rt. Dissonance was observed in all of the decrees that maintained the distance measures or loosened them. The fastest expansion in the number of new cases and the greatest amount of dissonant decrees was found in the last two months analyzed. CONCLUSION There was an important divergence between municipal measures of social distancing with epidemiological indicators at the time of each political decision.","output":"The potential spread of Covid-19 and government decision-making: a retrospective analysis in Florianpolis, Brazil."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to estimate the budget impact of increased uptake of the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring system in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in the UK. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A budget impact model was developed, applying real-world data collected in the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists (ABCD) FreeStyle Libre Nationwide Audit. Costs of diabetes glucose monitoring in a T1DM population (n=1790) using self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) or the FreeStyle Libre system were compared with a scenario with increased use of the FreeStyle Libre system. RESULTS: The ABCD audit demonstrates FreeStyle Libre system use reduces diabetes-related resource utilization. The cost analysis found that higher acquisition costs are offset by healthcare costs avoided (difference 168 per patient per year (PPPY)). Total costs were 1116 PPPY with FreeStyle Libre system compared with 948 PPPY with SMBG. In an average-sized UK local health economy, increasing FreeStyle Libre system uptake from 30% to 50% increased costs by 3.4% (1 787 345C1 847 618) and when increased to 70% increased by a further 3.3%. CONCLUSION: Increased uptake of the FreeStyle Libre system in the T1DM population marginally increases the cost to UK health economies and offers many system benefits.","output":"FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring system for people with type 1 diabetes in the UK: a budget impact analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are being used internationally off-label to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on in vitro and weak studies involving humans.

The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and was subsequently recognized by the World Health Organization as an international public health emergency and declared a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have had an unparalleled effect on all aspects of life. OBJECTIVE: With increasing total hospitalization and intensive care unit admissions, a better understanding of features related to patients with COVID-19 could help health care workers stratify patients based on the risk of developing a more severe case of COVID-19. Using predictive models, we strive to select the features that are most associated with more severe cases of COVID-19. METHODS: Over 3 million participants reported their potential symptoms of COVID-19, along with their comorbidities and demographic information, on a smartphone-based app. Using data from the >10,000 individuals who indicated that they had tested positive for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, we leveraged the Elastic Net regularized binary classifier to derive the predictors that are most correlated with users having a severe enough case of COVID-19 to seek treatment in a hospital setting. We then analyzed such features in relation to age and other demographics and their longitudinal trend. RESULTS: The most predictive features found include fever, use of immunosuppressant medication, use of a mobility aid, shortness of breath, and severe fatigue. Such features are age-related, and some are disproportionally high in minority populations. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors selected from the predictive models can be used to stratify patients into groups based on how much medical attention they are expected to require. This could help health care workers devote valuable resources to prevent the escalation of the disease in vulnerable populations.","output":"Modeling Predictive Age-Dependent and Age-Independent Symptoms and Comorbidities of Patients Seeking Treatment for COVID-19: Model Development and Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently, evaluation of the IgG antibodies specific for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein following vaccination is used worldwide to estimate vaccine response. Limited data are available on vaccine-elicited IgM antibodies and their potential implication in immunity to SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal study to quantify anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM (IgG-S and IgM-S) in health care worker (HCW) recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Samples were collected before administration (T0), at the second dose (T1) and three weeks after T1 (T2). The cohort included 1584 immunologically na?ve to SARS-CoV-2 (IN) and 289 with history of previous infection (PI). FINDINGS: IN showed three patterns of responses: (a) IgG positive/IgM negative (36.1%), (b) coordinated IgM-S/IgG-S responses appearing at T1 (37.4%) and (c) IgM appearing after IgG (26.3%). Coordinated IgM-S/IgG-S responses were associated with higher IgG titres. In IgM-S positive PI, 64.5% were IgM-S positive before vaccination, whereas 32% and 3.5% developed IgM-S after the first and second vaccine dose, respectively. IgM-S positive sera had higher pseudovirus neutralization titres compared to the IgM-S negative. INTERPRETATION: Coordinated expression of IgG-S and IgM-S after vaccination was associated with a significantly more efficient response in both antibody levels and virus-neutralizing activity. The unconventional IgG-S positive/IgM-S negative responses may suggest a recruitment of cross coronaviruses immunity by vaccination, warranting further investigation.

In the present study, we used a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to identify the putative causal link between omega-3 and low back pain. A broadly used genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 8,866 individuals from European ancestry) was used to select plasma omega-3 genetic instrumental variables (IVs). A previously reported GWAS (4,863 cases and 74,589 controls from European ancestry) for low back pain were used to assess the effect of plasma omega-3 levels on low back pain. MR-egger_intercept, MR-PRESSO, MR_egger, and inverse variance weighted (IVW) in Cochran's Q-test were used to determine the pleiotropy and heterogeneity, respectively. MR-egger, weighted median, IVW, and weighted mode were used to perform MR analysis. Finally, the effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was used to test the SNP bias. We did not find a significant pleiotropy or heterogeneity of all six selected plasma omega-3 genetic IVs in low back pain GWAS. Expectedly, we found that as plasma omega-3 levels genetically increased, the risk of low back pain had a decreased trend using MR-egger (Beta = ?0.593, p = 0.228; OR = 0.553) and weighted mode (Beta = ?0.251, p = 0.281; OR = 0.778).

This study models the impact of the reduction of misinformation and the diffusion of corrective information on social disruption, and it identifies the features of this impact. In this study, we analyzed misinformation regarding the shortage of toilet paper during the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, its corrections, and the excessive purchasing caused by this information. First, we analyze the amount of misinformation and corrective information spread on SNS, and we create a regression model to estimate the real-world impact of misinformation and its correction. This model is used to analyze the change in real-world impact corresponding to the change in the diffusion of misinformation and corrective information. Our analysis shows that the corrective information was spread to a much greater extent than the misinformation. In addition, our model reveals that the corrective information was what caused the excessive purchasing behavior.

The use of many and different outcome measures in human studies may contribute to this disagreement. METHODS We conducted a systematic review to identify all measures used to assess long-term neurocognitive outcomes following general anaesthesia (GA) and surgery in children. The quality of studies was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies investigating neurocognitive outcome after GA in children <18 yr. RESULTS Sixty-seven studies were identified from 19 countries during 1990-2017. Most assessments were performed within cognition, sensory-motor development, academic achievement or neuropsychological diagnosis. Few studies assessed other outcomes (magnetic resonance imaging, serum-biomarkers, mortality, neurological examination, measurement of head circumference, impairment of vision). Rating according to the NOS rewarded a mean of six stars out of nine. Some concerns prevail regarding potential inter-rater variability because of equivocal description of rating criteria. Specific features such as stability over lifetime and inter-relations of outcomes (e.g. prediction of subsequent development or diagnosis of neuropsychological conditions) are discussed. The importance of validity and reliability of the various test instruments are described. The studies vary immensely in important characteristics.

The pathophysiology of this respiratory failure is attributed to local immune dysregulation, but how the immune response to viral infection in the lower airways of the human lung differs between individuals with respiratory failure and those without is not well understood. We used quantitative multiparameter flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine assays to evaluate matched blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from control human subjects, subjects with symptomatic seasonal influenza who did not have respiratory failure, and subjects with severe seasonal influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infection with respiratory failure. We find that severe cases are associated with an influx of nonclassical monocytes, activated T cells, and plasmablast B cells into the lower airways. Cytokine concentrations were not elevated in the lower airways of moderate influenza patients compared with controls; however, 28 of 35 measured cytokines were significantly elevated in severe influenza, severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, or both. We noted the largest elevations in IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1, and IL-8. IL-1 family cytokines and RANTES were higher in severe influenza infection than severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of high tie and low tie of the inferior mesenteric artery on colonic length. METHODS This study was conducted in a surgical anatomy research laboratory. Anatomical dissections were performed on 11 human cadavers. We performed full left colonic mobilization, section of the descending-sigmoid junction, and high and low ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery. Distance from the proximal colon limb to the lower edge of the pubis symphysis was recorded after each step of vascular division. Three measurements were successively performed: before vascular section, after inferior mesenteric artery ligation, and after inferior mesenteric artery and vein section. RESULTS Before vascular section, the mean distance between colonic end and lower edge of the symphysis pubis was - 1.9  3.5 cm. After combined artery and vein section, the mean distance was + 10.7  4.6 cm for high tie and + 1.5  3 cm for low tie. A limitation of this study is the use of embalmed anatomical specimens, rather than live patients, and the small number of specimens. This study also does not evaluate colon limb vascularization or the impact of proximal lymph node dissection on survival rates.

METHODS: A survey was administered to students enrolled in the undergraduate biology, neuroscience and nursing programs at a large public research-intensive university. The survey queried demographics, previous mentorship experiences, ideal qualities of mentors, benefits/value of mentorship and future plans for seeking mentorship. Survey responses were evaluated using either t-test comparisons or one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The majority of the respondents were female and were interested in pursuing professional schools (nursing and medicine). Survey results indicate high student interest in receiving mentoring, but few were active participants in a mentoring relationship. Respondents indicated either lack of knowledge or discomfort in identifying a mentor. While faculty mentors versus peer mentors were preferred, respondents indicated that mentoring by either faculty or peers would be of value.

The impact of this finding on [ 18 F]FDG PET-CT interpretation and its correlation with the induced humoral immunity have been reported. Assuming the amnestic immune response is different following the third vaccine dose, we aimed to explore the incidence of VAHL over time after the third BNT162b2 dose administration, and its relevance to [ 18 F]FDGPET-CT interpretation in oncologic patients. Methods: : A total of 179 consecutive oncologic patients that underwent [ 18 F]FDG PET-CT after a third BNT162b2 vaccine dose were included. The presence of VAHL was assessed. On VAHL-positive scans, the SUVmax, number, location and size of thehot nodes were recorded. The median time interval between vaccination and imagingwas 8 (IQR,5-14) days. Results: : The incidences of all-grade VAHL and grade 3-4 VAHL were 47.5% and 8.9%,respectively. VAHL was identified on 82.5% of studies performed within the first 5 days from vaccination. Grade 3-4 VAHL was observed on 28.1% of studies performed within the first 5 days from vaccination, but was not detected on studies performed more than 5 days from vaccination. Separation between VAHL and malignant lymphadenopathy was not possible in only 2 of the 179 study patients. On a multivariable logistic regression, independent predictors of grade 3-4 VAHL were short time interval between vaccination and imaging (Pv<0.01), younger age (Pv<0.01) and lower BMI (Pv=0.03). Conclusion: VAHL is commonly identifiedon [ 18 F]FDG PET-CT performed within the first 5 days from the third BNT162b2 vaccine doseadministration. High-grade VAHL is unlikely to be observed on a scan performed 6 days or longer from vaccination, and is even less likely in older and obese patients.","output":"A Sigh of Relief: Vaccine-Associated Hypermetabolic Iymphadenopathy Following the Third Covid-19 Vaccine Dose is Short in Duration and Uncommonly Interferes with the Interpretation of [18F]FDG PET-CT Studies Performed in Oncologic Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent study in vitro has shown that a sulphated polysaccharide, a type of fucoidan, has potent antiviral activity against SARS-Cov2.

Procedural details included type of procedure (new insertion vs. exchange), operator seniority, side of insertion, catheter model and presence of catheter wings skin-sutures. Complications were reported as cumulative risk over time and Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate risk factors for cuff extrusion (CE). RESULTS: Median patient follow-up was 503 days (188,913 catheter-days) and median catheter survival 163 days. CE occurred in 23.8% of catheters, at a rate of 0.79 per 1,000 catheter-days and a median time of 64 days. It was more common than infection (14.6%) and inadequate flow (15.5%). The 1-month and 12-month risk of CE was 5.9% and 21.3% respectively. A first episode of CE was a strong predictor of future CE episodes. The only patient factor that affected the risk of CE was BMI (Hazard Ratio 2.36 for obese patients). Procedural factors that affected the risk of CE, adjusted for BMI, were catheter model, type of procedure (lower risk for new insertions) and catheter wings skin-sutures; the latter reduced the 30-day CE risk by 76% without increasing catheter-related infections.

This observational study aimed to analyse the consequences of national lockdown on the epidemiology of significant paediatric orthopaedic trauma, presenting to a tertiary referral centre in Wales, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Methods Paediatric patients presenting with orthopaedic trauma, from March 2019 to July 2019 (baseline period), March 2020 to July 2020 (lockdown period), and March 2021 to July 2021 (post lockdown period), were identified and compared. Those aged less than 16 years, presenting with a significant orthopaedic injury, defined here for the study as, those requiring either manipulation under anaesthesia or, surgical intervention were included in this study. Results Mean age of children with significant orthopaedic injuries during the lockdown dropped significantly to 6.52 years in comparison to those during the baseline period (7.9 years), and post lockdown period (8.85 years). The incidence of outdoor injuries plummeted significantly from 64.71% in the baseline period, to 41.27% during the lockdown period, but rose to 80.65% in the post lockdown period. There was a 48% reduction in the number of children who required intervention in operating theatre during the lockdown period, in comparison to the other two study periods. Conclusion Our study reports a significant decrease in the incidence of paediatric orthopaedic trauma needing intervention in operating theatre during the lockdown period, with a significant rise in the incidence of domestic injuries, and relatively younger children sustaining these injuries. A public information campaign could help reduce the incidence of such domestic accidents during future lockdowns. We recommend improving awareness among parents, creating a safe indoor as well as outdoor environment to help reduce the incidence of fractures in the paediatric population. This will subsequently help in reducing the financial burden on an already stretched healthcare system.","output":"Epidemiology of Paediatric Orthopaedic Trauma, Before, During, and After the Outbreak of COVID-19 Pandemic: An Observational Study From a Tertiary Referral Center in Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research objective was to detail COVID-19s natural trajectory in relation to the Czech populations viral load. Our prospective detailed daily questionnaire-based telemonitoring study evaluated COVID-19s impact among 105 outpatients. In accordance with government quarantine requirements, outpatients were divided into a cohort with two negative tests at the end of the disease (40 patients) and a cohort with a new algorithm (65 patients) following a 14-day quarantine. Median follow-up differed significantly between the 2 groups (23 days vs. 16 days). Only 6% of patients were asymptomatic during the entire telemonitoring period. Another 13% of patients were diagnosed asymptomatic, as suspected contacts, yet later developed symptoms, while the remaining 81% were diagnosed as symptomatic on average 6 days following symptom onset. Telemonitoring enabled precise symptom status chronicling. The most frequently reported complaints were fevers, respiratory issues, and anosmia. Six patients were eventually hospitalized for complications detected early after routine telemonitoring. During the extended follow-up (median 181 days), anosmia persisted in 26% of patients. 79% of patients in the new quarantine algorithm cohort reported no symptoms on day 11 compared to just 56% of patients in the two negative test cohort upon first testing negative (medianC19 days). The highest viral load occurred within 0C2 days of initial symptom onset. Both the PCR viral load and two consecutive PCR negative sample realizations indicated high interindividual variability with a surprisingly fluctuating pattern among 43% of patients. No definitive COVID-19 symptoms or set of symptoms excepting anosmia (59%) and/or ageusia (47%) were identified. No preexisting medical conditions specifically foreshadowed disease trajectory in a given patient. Without a PCR negativity requirement for quarantine cessation, patients could exhibit fewer symptoms.

This study aimed to quantify the hospital resource savings that could occur if all low-risk women in Australia gave birth at home or in birth centers. METHODS: A whole-of-population linked administrative data set containing all women (n = 44 498) who gave birth in Queensland, Australia, between 01/07/2012 and 30/06/2015 was reweighted to represent all Australian women giving birth in 2017. A static microsimulation model of woman and infant health service resource use was created based on 2017 data. The model was comprised of a base model, representing \\"current\\" care, and a counterfactual model, representing hypothetical scenarios where all low-risk Australian women gave birth at home or in birth centers. RESULTS: If all low-risk women gave birth at home in 2017, cesarean rates would have reduced from 13.4% to 2.7%. Similarly, there would have been 860 fewer inpatient bed days and 10.1 fewer hours of women's intensive care unit time per 1000 births.

To show the applicability of \\\\fw{}, we use it to evaluate a model trained to predict acute myeloid leukemia therapy response and we also assess its scalability via experiments on synthetic data. The experiments show that we efficiently compute exactly the same AUC with both evaluation metrics in a privacy preserving manner as one can obtain on the pooled test samples in the plaintext domain. Our solution provides security against semi-honest corruption of at most one of the servers performing the secure computation.","output":"ppAURORA: Privacy Preserving Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall Curves with Secure 3-Party Computation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Firms and statistical agencies that publish aggregate data face practical and legal requirements to protect the privacy of individuals.

Efforts to strengthen nutrition and food security is needed to build household food resilience (ie, being resourceful) more than ever as low-income families face unprecedented challenges due to the COVID pandemic. The rising food insecurity in California is concerning, which is linked to poor dietary outcomes and obesity. Parents recruited from low-income community settings in Tulare County, California. During FY2019-20, trained bilingual nutrition educator implemented the 9-week Expanded Food & Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) in English and Spanish using series-based adult curriculum Eating Smart Being Active. Each class was held once a week for 60-90 minutes in duration. Participants completed demographics questionnaire, Food Tracker dietary recall, and a pre-post Food & Physical Activity Questionnaire (FPAQ). Descriptive and Pre-Post analyses were completed using WebNEERS reporting tool. Of the total 149 program families reached, 136 participants who attended all the lessons graduated with a certificate. Majority of the participants were Hispanic. Differences in change from pre-to-post indicated improvements in all the program areas. Of the 136 graduates, 88% of participants showed improvement in 1 or more food resource management practices, 92% showed improvements in 1 or more diet quality/ nutrition practices, 88% showed improvements in 1 or more food safety practices, and 91% showed improvements in 1 or more physical activity behaviors. A noteworthy program impact was a random sample (n = 19) of these participants reported saving an average of $44.50 on food per month. The EFNEP program empower families to build household food resilience with knowledge and skills to adopt healthy practices in the areas of food resource management, food security, nutrition/physical activity, and food safety.

Pharmaceutical methods represent the main strategy of VTE prevention. The use of aspirin in VTE prevention is still controversial worldwide, especially in China. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of aspirin combined with mechanical measures in the prevention of VTE after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS Between January 2012 and May 2013 and in accordance with the inclusion criteria, 120 patients undergoing TKA were randomly allocated to two groups. To prevent VTE, patients in group A received aspirin combined with mechanical measures postoperatively, while patients in group B received low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) sodium and rivaroxaban sequentially in combination with mechanical measures postoperatively. All surgeries were performed by one surgeon using a posterior-stabilized cemented prosthesis. The two groups were followed up and compared for the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by duplex ultrasound scan and clinical VTE events. The adverse events, the blood loss index, and the cost of VTE prevention were also compared. RESULTS DVT was detected in 10 of 60 patients in group A (16.7%, 95% CI: 7.3%-26.1%) compared with 11 of 60 in group B (18.3%, 95% CI: 8.5%-27.8%) (P = 0.500). There is no statistical evidence supporting the inferior effect of aspirin in preventing DVT as compared with the other medications. There were no cases of symptomatic VTE or death during the follow-up period. Area of ecchymosis was lower in group A than in group B, and the differences were statistically significant. Patients in group A had the lower blood loss index as compared with patients in group B. No transfusion cases were found in both groups. The differences were statistically significant. The cost of VTE prevention analysis indicated a cost reduction using aspirin in group A compared with using LMWH and rivaroxaban in group B. CONCLUSION Aspirin combined with mechanical measures had a good effect on prevention of VTE after TKA and resulted in lower cost, less blood loss, and less subcutaneous ecchymosis.","output":"Aspirin combined with mechanical measures to prevent venous thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 is a dangerous, infectious disease that has affected the whole world in the past year. In Indonesia, many nurses were not only infected by the virus but also experienced varying psychological responses in providing treatment and performing their tasks. In other words, they faced the daunting responsibility of fighting the disease while taking care of COVID-19 patients. Objective: The study aimed to describe nurses psychological responses in caring for COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods: This was a qualitative descriptive study involving 13 nurses. Using purposive sampling, the participants were selected from three public hospitals in Semarang, Indonesia. These nurses were assigned to take care of COVID-19 patients in the isolation room. The participants underwent face-to-face interviews, either by video calls or through an online application, using semi-structured and in-depth guidelines. The collected data were analyzed using Ello and Kyngas inductive content analysis. Results: During the pandemic, the nurses had the following psychological responses in caring for COVID-19 patients in Indonesia: 1) being constantly stressed in carrying out their duties;2) having no choice but happy to help patients recover at the same time, and 3) getting closer to God as a form of spiritual relief.

The problem with vaccination is the time it takes to develop an effective vaccine, validate its safety and manufacture it in large quantities. Facing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), we simply do not have the time to develop the vaccine before thousands of people die. Therefore, any treatment which can decrease the severe symptoms due to lung damage may help attenuate mortality rates. Inactivation of ACE2 during virus fusion into the host cell may be one of the underlying reasons for intense immunological reaction seen in the lung tissue. This overreaction is probably mediated through the bradykinin receptor activation. Noscapine, a medication used for the treatment of cough, has been shown to inhibit bradykinin enhanced cough response in man.

What are the essential components of an ILD clinic according to ILD physician experts, patients, and caregivers? Study Design and Methods This study had 3 components. First, all 68 CCN sites were surveyed to determine the characteristics of their current ILD clinics. Second, an online, three-round modified Delphi survey was conducted between October and December 2019 with 48 ILD experts participating in total. Items for round one were generated using expert interviews. During rounds 1 and 2, experts rated the importance of each item on a 5-point Likert scale. The a priori threshold for consensus was greater than 75% of experts rating an item as important or very important. In round 3, experts graded items that met consensus and ranked items deemed essential for an ILD clinic. Third, ILD patient and caregiver focus groups were conducted and analyzed for content to determine their perspectives of an ideal ILD clinic. Results Forty items across four categories (members, infrastructure, resources and multidisciplinary conference) achieved consensus as essential to an ILD clinic. Patient and caregiver focus groups identified three major themes: comprehensive, patient-centered medical care; expanded access to care; and comprehensive support for living and coping with ILD. Interpretation The essential components of an ILD clinic are well-aligned between physician experts and patients.

Correspondingly, robotic gastroscopes with advanced functionalities, e.g., disposable, dextrous and not invasive solutions, have been developed in the last years. This article extensively reviews these novel devices and describes their functionalities and performance. In addition, the implementation of artificial intelligence technology into robotic gastroscopes, combined with remote telehealth endoscopy services, are discussed. The aim of this paper is to provide a clear and comprehensive view of contemporary robotic gastroscopes and ancillary technologies to support medical practitioners in their future clinical practice but also to inspire and drive new engineering developments. ABSTRACT: Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract pathology is common worldwide. With recent advancements in robotics, innovative diagnostic and treatment devices have been developed and several translational attempts made. This review paper aims to provide a highly pictorial critical review of robotic gastroscopes, so that clinicians and researchers can obtain a swift and comprehensive overview of key technologies and challenges. Therefore, the paper presents robotic gastroscopes, either commercial or at a progressed technology readiness level. Among them, we show tethered and wireless gastroscopes, as well as devices aimed for UGI surgery. The technological features of these instruments, as well as their clinical adoption and performance, are described and compared. Although the existing endoscopic devices have thus far provided substantial improvements in the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment, there are certain aspects that represent unwavering predicaments of the current gastroenterology practice. A detailed list includes difficulties and risks, such as transmission of communicable diseases (e.g., COVID-19) due to the doctorCpatient proximity, unchanged learning curves, variable detection rates, procedure-related adverse events, endoscopists and nurses burnouts, limited human and/or material resources, and patients preferences to choose non-invasive options that further interfere with the successful implementation and adoption of routine screening. The combination of robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as remote telehealth endoscopy services, are also discussed, as viable solutions to improve existing platforms for diagnosis and treatment are emerging.","output":"Frontiers of Robotic Gastroscopy: A Comprehensive Review of Robotic Gastroscopes and Technologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown is essential for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Even though pMHC complex formation [between a Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, which is encoded by an HLA allele, and an antigen peptide] is one of the fundamental processes of the adaptive human immune response, its binding mechanism has not yet been well studied, partially due to the high allelic variation of HLAs in the population. We have used our developed McMD-based dynamic docking method and have successfully reproduced the native complex structure, which is located near the free energy global minimum. Subsequent path sampling MD simulations elucidated the atomic details of the binding process and indicated that the peptide binding is initially driven by the highly positively charged N-terminus of the peptide that is attracted to the various negatively charged residues on the MHC molecule's surface. Upon nearing the pocket, the second tyrosine residue of the peptide anchors the peptide by strongly binding to the B-site of the MHC molecule via hydrophobic driven interactions, resulting in a very strong bound complex structure. Our methodology can be effectively used to predict the bound complex structures between MHC molecules and their antigens to study their binding mechanism in close detail, which would help with the development of new vaccines against cancers, as well as viral infections such as HIV and COVID-19.","output":"N-Terminal-Driven Binding Mechanism of an Antigen Peptide to Human Leukocyte Antigen-A*2402 Elucidated by Multicanonical Molecular Dynamic-Based Dynamic Docking and Path Sampling Simulations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first reported in Wuhan, China Clinical spectrum of this disease has nonspecific symptoms shared by many other frequent infectious diseases of the respiratory tract and other respiratory tract diseases This study explains the importance of differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and other lung diseases","output":"Differential diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients at the University Hospital Center Mohammed VI, Marrakesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has brought the vibrant and vivacious human life to a grinding halt.

Within this setting, the performance of the Russian innovation system significantly lags behind other countries and calls for modernisation based on the modern regulatory tools, policies, and worlds leading trends. The direct import of institutions of foreign innovation systems demonstrates its limited effectiveness due to the incompleteness of institutions and mechanisms for regulating the institutional environment of the Russian economy. One of the generally recognised, leading, and the most universalinstruments for implementing innovation policy by government institutions is the public procurement of innovation. The analysis of international experience shows that the implementation of the innovation policy via innovative public procurement has a highly heterogeneous landscape even in such a cohesivejurisdiction as those represented by the European Union (EU) as far as different types of policy dominate in different countries of the world. There is no clear trend towards the only one mainstream regulatory approach. In this context, the Russian experience demonstrates de facto the absence of any centralised, transparent, and effective policy expressed in such pseudo-innovative procurement as refuelling cartridges or car repairs.

The host response to SARS-CoV2 has not yet been fully delineated, hampering a precise approach to therapy. To address this, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data from the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic targets that could be modified with available drugs. The data suggest that transcriptomic profiling can provide an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in individual patients.","output":"Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of COVID-19 blood, lung, and airway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this work was to investigate the genome of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 by the paradigm of chaos theory and fractal geometry. Coronavirus is the agent that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and emergent infections such as the present pandemic of COVID-19. Understanding its genome pattern is important for developing new and faster ways of testing for identifying the genome of the virus and also for better understanding of its origin and evolution. METHODS: For that, it was calculated the alpha coefficient by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) for the sequences of these genomes converted to binary numbers in order to determine if it is a chaotic or a random series of data. Also, it applied the random walking for obtaining a fractal map of the whole genome and calculated the fractal dimension (FD) by box-counting of this map by two different software. RESULTS: With this, it was found that the alpha coefficient of the first SARS viruses was > 0.5, indicating that the series is chaotic or fractal, and has a persistent long-range memory or self-similarity along its sequence. This is not the case for MERS virus, which showed to have a completely random sequence ( < 0.5). For the fractal dimension, SARS viruses presented a FD around 1.5, and for MERS the fractal dimension decreases (FD < 1.5). CONCLUSION: The images generated by random walking of the entire RNA genome are by itself a fractal signature of the virus, which may be applied for studying its origin and for faster diagnostic of COVID-19.","output":"Fractal signature of coronaviruses related to severe acute respiratory syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forecasting research in the humanitarian context is scarce.

We aimed to assess the bidirectional association between sleep quality and mental health and describe how sleep and mental health were affected in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic (between June 2020 and September 2021). MethodsData were obtained from the Omtanke2020 study. Participants who completed the baseline survey and 8 monthly follow-up surveys were included (N=9035). We described the distribution of sleep and mental health in the different Swedish regions using maps and over the study period with longitudinal graphs adjusting for sex, age, recruitment type (self-recruitment or invitation), and COVID-19 status. The inner relationships between mental health, sleep and covid infection were described through relative importance networks. Finally, we modelled how mental health affects sleep and vice versa using generalized estimating equations with different adjustments. ResultsSeasonal and north-south regional variations were found in sleep and mental health outcomes at baseline and attenuated over time. The seasonal variation of sleep and mental health correlated moderately with the incidence rate of COVID-19 in the sample. Networks indicate that the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and mental health varies over time. We observed a bidirectional relationship between sleep quality and quantity at baseline and mental health at follow-up and vice versa. ConclusionSleep quality and quantity at baseline was associated with adverse symptom trajectories of mental health at follow-up, and vice versa, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nevertheless, Weber's understanding of everyday action is closely related to the various religious interpretations of what deprivations were suffered by humanity as a consequence of Adam's original sin and the paradisiacal yearning for salvation it engenders. Moreover, Weber's interpretation of the Fall is characteristic for his tragic sociology in the sense that it guarantees the freedom to subjectively create self-conscious meaning that is, however, no longer embedded in a context of common knowledge. His solution to this epistemological problem involves a Nietzschean heroic existentialism whereby individuals give personality to one's character by freely choosing their own values. Yet, he also realizes that many will not be able to choose by themselves and, therefore, will be attracted by charismatic leaders that can invoke a paradisiacal community of choice. Weber's modern antinomical interpretation of the Fall is still relevant today because it provides insight in the epistemological underpinnings of the contemporary populist Zeitgeist.","output":"Max Weber's antinomies of the Fall: Paradisiacal ethics and the populist Zeitgeist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Divya-Swasari-Vati (DSV) is a calcium-containing herbal medicine formulated for the symptomatic control of respiratory illnesses observed in the current COVID-19 pandemic. DSV is an Ayurvedic medicine used for the treatment of chronic cough and inflammation. The formulation has shown its pharmacological effects against SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation in the humanized zebrafish model. The present inventive research aimed to establish comprehensive quality parameters of the DSV formulation using validated chromatographic analytical tools. Exhaustive identification of signature marker compounds present in the plant ingredients was carried out using ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/QToF MS). This was followed by simultaneous estimation of selected marker components using rapid and reliable high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Eleven marker components, namely gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, methyl gallate, ellagic acid, coumarin, cinnamic acid, glycyrrhizin, eugenol, 6-gingerol, piperine and glabridin, were selected out of seventy-four identified makers for the quantitative analysis in DSV formulation. Validation of the HPLC method was evaluated by its linearity, precision, and accuracy tests as per the International Council of Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. Calibration curves for the eleven marker compounds showed good linear regression (r2 > 0.999). The relative standard deviation (RSD) value of intraday and interday precision tests were within the prescribed limits. The accuracy test results ranged from 92.75% to 100.13%. Thus, the present inclusive approach is first of its kind employing multi-chromatographic platforms for identification and quantification of the marker components in DSV, which could be applied for routine standardization of DSV and other related formulations.","output":"Comprehensive and Rapid Quality Evaluation Method for the Ayurvedic Medicine Divya-Swasari-Vati Using Two Analytical Techniques: UPLC/QToF MS and HPLC-DAD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How people respond to health threats can influence their own health and, when facing communal risks, even their community's health. We propose that people commonly respond to health threats by managing their emotions with cognitive strategies like reappraisal, which can reduce fear and protect mental health. However, because fear can also motivate health behaviors, reducing fear may also jeopardize health behaviors. In two diverse U.S. samples (N=1,241) tracked across three months, sequential and cross-lag panel mediation models indicated that reappraisal predicted lower fear about an ongoing health threat (COVID-19), and in turn, better mental health, but fewer recommended physical health behaviors. This trade-off was not inevitable, however: using reappraisal to increase socially-oriented positive emotions predicted better mental health without jeopardizing physical health behaviors.

Interruption of its transmission to prevent widespread community transmission is critical because its effects go beyond the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths and affect the health system capacity to provide other essential services. Highlighting the implications of such a situation, the predictions presented here are derived using a Markov chain model, with the transition states and country specific probabilities derived based on currently available knowledge. A risk of exposure, and vulnerability index are used to make the probabilities country specific. The results predict a high risk of exposure in states of small size, together with Algeria, South Africa and Cameroon. Nigeria will have the largest number of infections, followed by Algeria and South Africa. Mauritania would have the fewest cases, followed by Seychelles and Eritrea. Per capita, Mauritius, Seychelles and Equatorial Guinea would have the highest proportion of their population affected, while Niger, Mauritania and Chad would have the lowest. Of the World Health Organization's 1 billion population in Africa, 22% (16%-26%) will be infected in the first year, with 37 (29 - 44) million symptomatic cases and 150 078 (82 735-189 579) deaths.

To identify the images of prisoners and prisons, in this article, we focus on the discourses of the Peruvian written press about the collective actions (categorized as riots) of prisoners in the context of COVID-19. Through critical discourse analysis, we analyze 81 notes of the seven most-read journals in Peru which inform about the first collective claim actions that occurred in four prisons: Rio Seco, Picsi, Castro Castro and Anexo Chorrillos. The results are organized into three axes: (a) Explanation of the diaries about collective claim action;(b) Men's prisons: Collective claim action defined as riots;and (c) Women's prisons: Collective claim action defined as non-riots. We argue that the notes reproduce the image of prison as a punishment institution, with a tendency to delegitimize collective actions and to portray prisoners as subjects propelled by emotions with no possibility to establish a dialogical encounter. Also, discourses are embedded with stereotypes of crime and gender. Mass media informs through the simplification of the prison system, providing unidimensional images of prisons and prisoners. This makes it difficult to create holistic views that aid to understand the hindering and claims for prisoners' rights in order to establish processes of dialogue to construct alternative resolutions to violence.","output":"Riots or Collective Claim Actions?

However, some of the key challenges in recent years involve learning long-term dependencies, degradation of performance when considering returns net of transaction costs and adapting to new market regimes, notably during the SARS-CoV-2 crisis. Attention mechanisms, or Transformer-based architectures, are a solution to such challenges because they allow the network to focus on significant time steps in the past and longer-term patterns. We introduce the Momentum Transformer, an attention-based architecture which outperforms the benchmarks, and is inherently interpretable, providing us with greater insights into our deep learning trading strategy. Our model is an extension to the LSTM-based DMN, which directly outputs position sizing by optimising the network on a risk-adjusted performance metric, such as Sharpe ratio. We find an attention-LSTM hybrid Decoder-Only Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) style architecture is the best performing model. In terms of interpretability, we observe remarkable structure in the attention patterns, with significant peaks of importance at momentum turning points. The time series is thus segmented into regimes and the model tends to focus on previous time-steps in alike regimes. We find changepoint detection (CPD) [2105.13727], another technique for responding to regime change, can complement multi-headed attention, especially when we run CPD at multiple timescales. Through the addition of an interpretable variable selection network, we observe how CPD helps our model to move away from trading predominantly on daily returns data.

A total of 13,441 phenological records, spanning 118 years, now exist, with observations of many species ongoing. Relative abundance data for an additional 200 plant species is also provided. Thoreau's published journals and records in Special Collections libraries at the Concord Free Public Library, Harvard University, Peabody Essex Museum, and Morgan Library and Museum provide insight into his methods of routinely walking around Walden Pond, through natural areas, and within the town of Concord, seeking the first leaf or flower on plants, seasonal observations of migratory birds, and fruit maturation times. Several amateur naturalists, and most recently the present research group, have followed this method of regularly searching Concord for the earliest signs of seasonal events, visiting many of the same locations including Walden Pond, the site made famous by Thoreau. While Thoreau's observations were initially made out of a curious desire to document the natural world, these data have led to dozens to contemporary studies, addressing timely issues such as climate change, conservation, ecology, and invasive species. This time series of data, initiated by Thoreau and continued by others, has resulted in dozens of peer-reviewed publications, a popular science book, and numerous educational and outreach opportunities. These data grow increasingly valuable with time and as new and creative studies are undertaken with Thoreau's historic records.

The first approach benchmarks the classification performance for the models trained from scratch, while the second approach benchmarks the classification performance using pre-trained models based on the ImageNet dataset. Using k-fold cross-validation testing on the 5-class dataset, the best performing model trained from scratch was Inception V3, reporting 73.2% accuracy.

Patients were followed up for at least 12 months from the initiation of therapy. Propensity score bin bootstrapping with 10,000 replications was conducted to generate the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both treatment outcome (e.g., reduction of the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) in mmHG) and the cost (e.g., costs of drugs, clinic visits, and labs in Saudi riyals (SAR)). Among the 153 included patients who met the inclusion criteria, 111 patients were on ACEIs/ARBs, while 44 patients were on amlodipine. On the basis of the bootstrap distribution, we found that the use of ACEIs/ARBs was associated with an incremental reduction of SBP of up to 4.46 mmHg but with an incremental cost of up to SAR 116.39 (USD 31.04), which results in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SAR 26.09 (USD 6.95) per 1 mmHg reduction with 55.26% level of confidence. With regard to DBP, ACEIs/ARBs were associated with an incremental reduction of DBP of up to 5.35 mmHg and an incremental cost of up to SAR 144.96 (USD 38.66), which results in an ICER of SAR 27.09 (USD 7.23) per 1 mmHg reduction with 68.10% level of confidence.

The unexpected fear of COVID-19 has been reported to be associated with suicide occurrences, similar to prior pandemics. AIMS: Identifying the factors associated with fear of COVID-19 could help us to develop better mental health strategy and practice to improve the situation here in Bangladesh. This was the first attempt to present a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based distribution of fear of COVID-19 across the country's administrative districts in a nationwide sample. METHOD: Data for a total of 10 067 individuals were collected by an online survey during the first wave of the pandemic (1 to 10 April 2020); data for 10 052 participants were finally analysed after excluding 15 transgender individuals. The survey questionnaire included items concerning sociodemographic, behavioural and health-related variables, COVID-19-related issues, and the Bangla Fear of COVID-19 Scale. RESULTS: The mean fear of COVID-19 scores was 21.30  6.01 (out of a possible 35) in the present sample. Female gender, highly educated, non-smoker, non-alcohol consumer, having chronic diseases, using social media, and using social media and not using newspapers as COVID-19 information sources were associated with a higher level of fear of COVID-19. Higher levels of fear of COVID-19 were found in districts of Magura, Panchagarh, Tangail, Sunamganj and Munshiganj; by contrast, Kushtia, Pirojpur, Chapainawabganj, Jhalokathi and Naogaon districts had lower fear of COVID-19. Based on the GIS-distribution, fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with the district as well as in respect to its gender-based and education-level-based associations. However, fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 cases were heterogeneously distributed across the districts; that is, no consistent association of higher COVID-19 cases with higher fear of COVID-19 was found. CONCLUSIONS: This study being exploratory in nature may help to facilitate further studies, as well as directing governmental initiatives for reducing fear of COVID-19 in at-risk individuals. Providing adequate resources and mental health services in the administrative regions identified as highly vulnerable to fear of COVID-19 is recommended.","output":"Exploring factors in fear of COVID-19 and its GIS-based nationwide distribution: the case of Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aims to explore a case of exophytic nasal papilloma with acute dacryocystitis as the first symptom. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old male patient complaining of a 10-year history of tearing and purulent discharge from the right eye, with subsequent redness and pain in the inner canthus for three days was initially diagnosed with acute dacryocystitis of the right eye. The patient was treated with anti-inflammatory therapy. However, the redness and swelling of the inner canthus continued to increase. An endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy of the right eye was performed under general anesthesia. A large amount of purulent secretion was drained during the operation. As a result, the swelling of the inner canthus was significantly reduced. A routine intra-operative biopsy of the wall of the lacrimal sac revealed an exophytic nasal papilloma. A second biopsy, 1 week after the surgery, revealed the same result. The patient was advised to undergo a dacryocystectomy once the swelling had subsided. However, the patient was reluctant to undergo this surgery and remains under clinical observation. CONCLUSION: It is rare for an exophytic nasal papilloma, which is a benign tumor in the lacrimal sac, which has the potential for recurrence and malignant transformation, to manifest with acute dacryocystitis as the first symptom.

All volunteers had negative RT-PCR test results or had not had the RT-PCR test performed within 30 days before sampling. The ELISA test was made at two different time points (July/August 2020) with a 2-weeks gap between blood collections to avoid the serological window period. (3) Results: The IgG seropositivity of asymptomatic HCWs varied between 1.2% to 10% (Opole vs. Bytom, p < 0.05; all without any symptoms). IgA seropositivity in HCWs was 8.8% in Opole and 7.14% in Bytom. IgM positive levels in HCWs in Opole and Bytom was 1.11% vs. 2.38%, respectively. Individuals with IgA and IgM seropositivity results were observed only in Opole (1.19%). More studies are needed to determine whether these results are generalizable to other populations and geographic as well as socio-demographic locations.

Materials and methods. The study included 88 patients with cardiovascular diseases who hospitalized in the infectious diseases department for coronavirus infection. All patients underwent the following diagnostic methods: history taking, detailed questioning regarding the clinical picture of the disease, physical examination, laboratory and instrumental diagnostics, filling out the hospital anxiety and depression scale HADS, Becks anxiety rating scale, Hamiltons depression rating scale. Results. The absolute majority of the studied patients belonged to the middle and older age group and had a moderate-severe course of coronavirus infection. Among the abundance of symptoms from various organ systems, clinical manifestations of nervous system damage predominate: feelings of fear and anxiety sleep disorders, memory loss, and lethargy. In 47.7% of patients, bilateral polysegmental lung damage was detected, corresponding to the picture of RG-1. There was also an increase in transaminase levels (>70%), hyperglycemia (75%), accelerated ESR, and an increase in CRP (68.2%).

Statistical and analytical systems analysis methods make it possible to determine the trend of research and development (R&D) expenditures in the world over five years (2017-2021). Methodology. Research methods: theoretical generalization, analysis and synthesis, logical, system-structural analysis of economic processes and relations, statistical, comparative, sectoral and dialectical approaches. Results. In accordance with the theoretical study of the process of investment in innovation by TNCs under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conclude that innovation for multinational corporations is the realization of innovative and creative ideas, which are the basis of progress and profit. The balance of power in the global innovation space before and during the COVID-19 pandemic is demonstrated by examining the dynamics of innovation in countries and regions. Under the COVID-19 pandemic, companies' R&D spending has fluctuated slightly, while global R&D spending has increased. According to the Global R&D Finance Forecast 2021, Asian countries, including China, will act as the engine of innovation in the coming years. Countries in the Americas and Europe will continue to lose their leadership in R&D, even though their spending will rise as the overall global economy recovers. One of the key indicators of innovation development is the quota of expenditure on research and development in GDP in the world. The leaders in this indicator are South Korea, Israel, Japan, Finland, and Sweden. Practical implications. Innovation is recognized as a central factor in economic growth and development. Interest not only in the promotion but also in the evaluation of the results of innovation activities is growing not only in developed but also in developing countries. According to The Future of Post-COVID Innovation Finance GII (Global Innovation Index 2020/2021), the pandemic crisis had a short-term impact on innovation spending. Research and development (R&D) spending in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic has always been high. In contrast to previous fears, the crisis has had only a minor impact on overall investment in innovation, as well as on the main consumers of innovation. At the company level, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the industry distribution of innovation, but costs and access to innovation financing in developing countries and more volatile companies are at risk. Disparities in access to innovation finance are likely to intensify. Value/originality.

Despitea host range restricted to primates, experimental infection of rodents with certain genetically well defined poliovirus strains produces neurological disease. The outcome of infection of mice with mouse-adapted poliovirus strains has been described previously mainly in terms of paralysis and death, and it was generally assumed that these strains produce the same disease syndromes in normal mice and in mice transgenic for the human poliovirus receptor (hPVR-tg mice). We report a comparison of the clinical course and the histopathological features of neurological disease resulting from intracerebral virus inoculation in normal micewith those of murine poliomyelitis in hPVR-tg mice. The consistent pattern of clinical deficits in poliomyelitic transgenic mice contrasted with highly variable neurologic disease that developed in mice infected with different mouse-adapted polioviruses. Histopathological analysis showed a diffuse encephalomyelitis induced by specific poliovirus serotype 2 isolates in normal mice, that affected neuronal cell populations without discrimination, whereas in hPVR-tg animals, damage was restricted to spinal motor neurons. Mouse neurovirulent strains of poliovirus type 2 differed from mouse neurovirulent poliovirus type 1 derivatives in their ability to induce CNS lesions. Our findings indicate that the characteristic clinical appearance and highly specific histopathological features of poliomyelitis are mediated by the hPVR. Our data lead us to conclude that the tissue tropism of mouse-adapted poliovirus strains in normal mice is fundamentally different from that of poliovirus in hPVR-tg mice and primates, and that this is indicative of an as yet unknown mechanism of adsorption and uptake of the virus into cells of the murine CNS.","output":"Mouse neuropathogenic poliovirus strains cause damage in the central nervous system distinct from poliomyelitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the published literature to determine mode of delivery in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the indications reported for cesarean section early in the pandemic to add information to the current narrative and raise awareness of trends discovered. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases for articles published between December 2019 and April 29, 2020 using a combination of the keywords such as COVID-19, coronavirus 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pregnancy, vaginal delivery, cesarean section, vertical transmission, management, and guidelines. Peer-reviewed case studies with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 women who delivered were included to determine mode of delivery, indications for cesarean section, and maternal and neonatal characteristics. RESULTS: A review of 36 total articles revealed deliveries in 203 SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. A comparable severity of disease in pregnant versus nonpregnant women was noted, as previously determined. Overall, 68.9% of women delivered via cesarean section, with COVID-19 status alone being a common indication. Maternal COVID-19 may also be associated with increased risk of preterm labor, although neonatal outcomes were generally favorable. Despite eight of 206 newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, there remains no definitive evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 status alone became a common indication for cesarean delivery early in the pandemic, despite lack of evidence for vertical transmission. The increase in cesarean rate in this data may reflect obstetricians attempting to serve their patients in the best way possible given the current climate of constantly evolving guidelines on safest mode of delivery for the mother, infant, and provider. Upholding current recommendations from trusted organizations as new data are published, while also providing individualized support to expecting mothers on most appropriate mode of delivery, will reduce the amount of unnecessary, unplanned cesarean sections and could lessen the psychological impact of delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic our discipline emerged at the forefront of molecular medicine with the rapid uptake of immune-modulatory therapeutics and depth of immune pathogenesis understanding contributing fundamentally to the COVID-19 response. The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) played a fundamental and vital role in this response in guiding rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD) therapeutics, vaccine use and even treatment innovations in the context of COVID-19 itself. Given this remarkable contribution, it is timely to reflect on EULAR-what is it and for what does it stand? At its core, EULAR represents people with RMDs, including their national societies, health professionals in rheumatology and scientific societies of rheumatology across the European nations. Our mission is to reduce the burden of RMDs on individuals and society and improve the treatment and prevention of RMDs.

To fight against COVID-19, many countries are using a combination of containment and mitigation activities. Effective screening of contaminated patients is a critical step in the battle against COVID-19. During the early medical examination, it was observed that patient having abnormalities in chest radiography images shows the symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Motivated by this, in this article, we proposed a unique framework to diagnose the COVID-19 infection. Here, we removed the fully connected layers of an already proven model VGG-16 and placed a new simplified fully connected layer set that is initialized with some random weights on top of this deep convolutional neural network, which has already learned discriminative features, namely, edges, colors, geometric changes,shapes, and objects. To avoid the risk of destroying the rich features, we warm up our FC head by seizing all layers in the body of our network and then unfreeze all the layers in the network body to be fine-tuned.The suggested classification model achieved an accuracy of 97.12% with 99.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity for COVID-19 identification.

We investigated whether PIC treatment would have beneficial effects on glucolipotoxicity-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. Target proteins of PIC were identified from several online databases. Then, we confirmed the effect of PIC on endothelial barrier function. PIC treatment mitigated the impairment of endothelial cell motility, adhesion and migration ability associated with high glucose/lipid stimulation. PIC stabilized cytoskeletal reorganization and expression of cell cytoskeletal associated proteins GTPase. PIC reversed changes in critical vascular junction proteins and thus preserved endothelial barrier function and permeability. Finally, we confirmed that reducing of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B)/p65 activation and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in the protective effect of PIC against glucolipotoxicity-induced vascular barrier injury. We identify PIC as a promising therapeutic strategy for glucolipotoxicity-induced endothelial barrier injury.","output":"Piceatannol alleviates glucolipotoxicity induced vascular barrier injury through inhibition of the ROS/NF-kappa B signaling pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Italy has been one of the most affected countries in the world by COVID-19. There has been increasing concern regarding the impact of COVID\\\\19 on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in patients treated with immunosuppressants or biologics. The aim of our study is to understand the incidence of COVID-19 in a large cohort of patients with IBD. Furthermore, we analyzed possible risk factors for infection and severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This was an observational study evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on IBD patients in a single tertiary center. A 23 multiple-choice-question anonymous survey was administered to 1200 patients with IBD between March 10(th) and June 10(th) 2020. RESULTS: 1158 questionnaires were analyzed. The majority of patients had Crohn's disease (CD) (60%) and most of them were in clinical remission. Among the 26 patients (2.2%) who tested positive for COVID-19, only 5 (3CD) were on biological treatment and none required hospitalization. Two patients died and were on treatment with mesalazine only. Of the 1158 patients, 521 were on biological therapy, which was discontinued in 85 (16.3%) and delayed in 195 patients (37.4%). A worsening of IBD symptoms was observed in 200 patients on biological therapy (38.4%). Most of these patients, 189 (94.5%), had stopped or delayed biological treatment, while 11 (5.5%) had continued their therapy regularly (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data are in line with the current literature and confirm a higher incidence compared to the general population. Biological therapy for IBD seems to not be a risk factor for infection and should not be discontinued in order to avoid IBD relapse.","output":"COVID-19 in IBD: the experience of a single tertiary IBD center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article develops the notion of ?sense of scale? to theorize the emotional, tactile, and affective (re)production of scalarity during the coronavirus pandemic The pandemic?s geographic upheavals ? from personal proxemics to international travel bans ? call for a return to scale that attends to its experiential qualities Scale is continually conjured, apprehended, and (re)configured through proximal feelings and sensory encounters After charting some conceptual foundations, subsequent sections discuss the relational transformation of the domestic, global, and urban scales under COVID-19 ?Sense of scale? enables (post)humanistic theorizations of scale to take shape and also highlights the importance of scale for understanding everyday life","output":"Sensing scalarity: Towards a humanistic approach to scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, 127 sputum/tracheal aspirate specimens were evaluated by a laboratory-developed real-time RT-PCR method and Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay.

RECENT FINDINGS: Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the US population. Age-related changes and challenges can present difficulties, for older adults want to age healthily and maintain independence. Technology, specifically healthcare robots, has potential to provide health supports to older adults. These supports span widely across the physical, cognitive, and social aspects of healthy aging. SUMMARY: Our review suggests that while healthcare robotics has potential to revolutionize the way in which older adults manage their health, there are many challenges such as clinical effectiveness, technology acceptance, health informatics, and healthcare policy and ethics. Addressing these challenges at all levels of the healthcare system will help ensure that healthcare robotics promote healthy aging and are applied safely, effectively, and reliably.","output":"The Role of Healthcare Robotics in Providing Support to Older Adults: a Socio-ecological Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically shifted education and development priorities. The tragic death toll and high rates of morbidity across many countries are an unprecedented setback and a calamity for those affected physically and mentally. The economic and social effects of lockdowns, loss of production and business confidence, and global recession will cast a long shadow over education systems. Despite the 435 million items that Google already indexes under COVID-19 education, many things remain unknown. No one has a clear idea of how the current pandemic will unravel over anything but the short term. The challenge is to strengthen the mechanisms to separate evidence from opinion and to balance popularism with speaking truth to powerespecially when political systems can find it difficult to distinguish fact from convenient fiction. This paper advances ten propositions that will shape policy dialogue and whatever iteration of the Sustainable Development Goals is needed to ensure they remain fit for purpose. Testing these propositions over the next year will open the door to an evidence-based approach to reconstruction and sustainable development and juxtapose immediate concerns of the present with aspirations for the future. More than ever the need is to see beyond the exigencies of COVID-19 and act to secure the educational gains of the recent past. UNESCO and other development agencies can play a key role in sharing how to manage revitalised and resilient learning systems that allow the community of practice to stay focussed on development that is economically, socially, medically, and educationally sustainable.

Methods: We enrolled all hemodialysis patients from 8 hemodialysis facilities in Honghu and Jingzhou of Hubei province and Guangzhou and Foshan of Guangdong province in China. We screened these patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection by both a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for viral RNA and a serological test for IgG and IgM antibodies. Data on demographics and clinical characteristics were collected via case report forms. We also enrolled the health care workers from the participating hospitals and compared the seropositive rate between hemodialysis patients and health care workers in the same region. Results: Among 1542 hemodialysis patients, 5 (0.32%) and 51 (3.3%) were tested positive by the RT-PCR test and the serological test, respectively. The seropositive rate in Hubei (3.6%) was higher than that in Guangdong (2.8%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.5). Most of the seropositive patients were asymptomatic. Independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were being older than 65 years, having manifestation of lung infection in imaging examinations, and having a lower level of serum albumin. In comparison, the seropositive rate in 3205 health care workers was 1.2%which was significantly lower than that observed in the hemodialysis patients (P < .001). Conclusion: The cumulative rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hemodialysis patients in China was high at 3.3%.

In this paper, current literature is reviewed and a decision-making management tool has been developed to assist clinicians in discussing the risks of fasting in patients with CKD, with consideration also given to circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our review highlights that patients with CKD wishing to fast should undergo a thorough risk assessment ideally within a month before Ramadan, they may require medication changes and a plan for regular monitoring of renal function and electrolytes in order to fast safely. Recommendations have been based on risk tiers (very high risk, high risk and low/moderate risk) established by the International Diabetes Federation and the Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance. Patients in the Very high risk and High Risk categories should be encouraged to explore alternative options to fasting, those in the low/moderate category may be able to fast safely with guidance from their clinician.

We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately.

This study aimed to explore the experiences and challenges of nurses who worked with hospitalised patients with COVID-19. In this qualitative study, a purposive sample of 14 nurses participated in in-depth telephone interviews. Data were analysed using Colaizzis phenomenological method. Five key themes emerged: (1) physical and psychological distress of nurses, (2) willingness to work, (3) the essential role of support mechanisms, (4) educational and informational needs of nurses and (5) the role of modern technology in COVID-19 care. Although the provision of care led to physical and psychological distress among nurses, with their commitment and professional obligation, it is a new experience that leads to personal satisfaction. Guilty feeling related to inefficiency of care, witnessing the suffering of patients, discomfort associated with wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), work-related issues (e.g., long hour shifts), negative impact to the family and rejection by others are the leading distress factors. Religious beliefs, including keeping trust in good and bad merits, have become a strong coping mechanism. Addressing distress among nurses is essential. The reported learning needs of nurses included skills related to donning and doffing PPE, skills in performing nursing procedures and breaking bad news.

This paper examines online gig workers protests during Covid-19 in India to understand how the nature of labour resistance is changing with the introduction of platform work and digital cultures. Using the framework of typology of labour resistance in platforms, this study analyzes various strategies and methods platform workers use against forms of labour control. Although organized collective resistance is the predominant framework by which workers struggles in industrial capitalism is examined, the nature of platform capitalism and its methods of labour management by the use of data and algorithm necessitates the exploration of new ways of thinking about labour resistance. The absence of an identifiable work-site or fixed hours of work, fragmentation of workers, presence of educated workers in low-skill part-time jobs, and the accessibility of the internet and digital cultures mean that the cyberspace is evolving as the site of expression and contestation of worker right claims. We argue that this development has two important consequences. The first is that these digital spaces give way to the traditional type of organized forms of protests that are identifiable by institutional markers such as workers union, collective agreement, membership, leadership and strategies. The wild cat protests and flash strikes that online gig workers participated in various Indian cities under the leadership of the Indian federation of app-based transport workers and all India gig workers union, an unregistered umbrella organization of platform and gig workers, to collectivize their demands, coordinate with state-level labour unions, raise awareness and form strategic allies among other workers collectives are examples of this kind of protest. At the same time, new forms of resistance are also emerging on a different scale that are distinct from organized collective resistance in three important ways. The first difference is that these new types of workers resistance that are granular, individualistic, and invisible in the public sphere respond subterraneous to the blockages and choke points of control they encounter in digital platforms as part of their work. The second difference is that unlike organized resistance, they are not spectacular displays of protest, but mundane everyday acts of resistance. Third, the strategies of resistance they utilize range from withdrawal of cooperation to various forms of resourcefulness at work that results in overcoming the restrictive control of the algorithms. Evidence from India also suggests the presence of such acts used to overcome perceived injustices in their place of work by online gig workers.","output":"From granular to collective resistance: Rethinking workers protests in digital cultures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health events emerge from host, community, environment, and pathogen factorsforecasting epidemics is a complex task.

Other economic indicators performed less well: changes in total, female, urban, and rural population sizes; population density; net migration; change in per cent forest area; total forest area; and another novel indicator, change in percent of trade as a fraction of the total economy. We then undertook a further analysis of the start of the current COVID-19 pandemic that revealed similar associations, but confounding by global disease burden is likely. Continued development of forecasting approaches capturing information relevant to whole-of-society factors (e.g., economic factors as assessed in our study) could improve the risk management process through earlier hazard identification and inform strategic decision processes in multisectoral strategies to preventing, detecting, and responding to pandemic-threat events.","output":"Identifying Nontraditional Epidemic Disease Risk Factors Associated with Major Health Events from World Health Organization and World Bank Open Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the ongoing new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic is being investigated using a mathematical model.

In the absence of effective eradication strategies against HIV-1, research efforts are focused on obtaining a cure. One of these approaches is the creation of therapeutic vaccines. In this sense, the most promising one up to now is based on the establishing of the immunological synapse between dendritic cells (DCs) and T lymphocytes (TL). DCs are one of the first cells of the immune system to encounter HIV-1 by acting as antigen presenting cells, bringing about the interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses mediated by TL. Furthermore, TL are the end effector, and their response capacity is essential in the adaptive elimination of cells infected by pathogens. In this review, we summarize the knowledge of the interaction between DCs with TL, as well as the characterization of the specific T-cell response against HIV-1 infection. The use of nanotechnology in the design and improvement of vaccines based on DCs has been researched and presented here with a special emphasis.","output":"New Approaches to Dendritic Cell-Based Therapeutic Vaccines Against HIV-1 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To investigate the understanding of the head and face protection of the health care workers in operating room of Peking Union Medical College Hospital during the corona virus disease-19(COVID-19) pandemic.Methods The knowledge of head and face protection of health care workers in the operating room was evaluated based on the non-registered questionnaires for protection measures collected on-line.Results The survey was conducted in two phases.In the first phase(COVID-19 outbreak),153 questionnaires were collected.In the second phase(when Beijing lowered the emergency response to level 3 and normalized the epidemic prevention and control),101 questionnaires were collected.The results showed that 98% of health care workers had used any form of protective devices during the pandemic and anesthesiologists had the highest usage rate(93.0%)of ear-loop face mask with eye shield.During the pandemic,health care workers mainly used goggles(71.2%)for protection to diagnose and treat the patients with fever and ear-loop face mask with eye shield(56.2%)for protection to diagnose and treat the non-fever patients.In the first-and second-phase survey,43% and 68% of health care workers still used protection,and they mainly used face shield(50.0% and 56.5%)and ear-loop face mask with eye shield(56.1% and 68.1%).Conclusions During the pandemic,more than 90% of the health care workers in the operating room of Peking Union Medical College Hospital were aware of head and face protection.Different healthcare workers in the operating room had different choices of head and face protection,and more than 40% of them would still keep such protection during the normalized stage of pandemic prevention and control.","output":"[Head and Face Protection of the Health Care Workers in the Operating Room of Peking Union Medical College Hospital during the Corona Virus Disease-19 Pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread worldwide and caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to numerous dead cases. However, with the new COVID-19 outbreaks, there is a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) especially N95 masks worldwide including Thailand. This issue had placed the health professional in great need of an alternative mask. AIM: This study aimed to measure the fit factor of 3D printed frames by quantitative fit testing (QNFT) to find an alternative facemask by using a mask fitter together with 2 different kinds of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) level 1 surgical mask. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two commonly used surgical masks (Sultan Com-Fit Super Sensitive Ear Loop Mask or White Mask Group, not water-resistant, and Sultan Blue Com-Fit Super High Filtration Ear Loop Mask or Blue Mask Group, water-resistant) with and without 3D printed frame covering. The fit performance was measured by a quantitative fit test (QNFT) device (PortaCount, model 8048, TSI Incorporated, Minnesota, USA) accepted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The PortaCount device, which is based on a miniature continuous flow condensation nucleus counter (CNC), assesses the respiratory fit by comparing the concentration of ambient dust particles outside the surgical mask to the concentration that has leaked into the surgical mask. The ratio of these two concentrations (C(out)/C(in)) is called the fit factor. A fit factor of a 3D printed frame of at least 100 is required and considered as a pass level. RESULTS: We found that the mask fitter improves the overall performance of surgical masks significantly. The improved performance is comparable to that of N95. CONCLUSION: The mask fitter improves the performance of surgical masks.

METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). RESULTS: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p < 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001). Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic. The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p = 0.001).

Low-dose computed tomography (CT) detects pulmonary infiltrates with high sensitivity, but findings may be non-specific. This study assesses the diagnostic value of SARS-CoV-2 serology for patients with distinct CT features but negative PCR. METHODS: IgM/IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay was performed for 107 patients with confirmed (group A: PCR + ; CT ) and 46 patients with suspected (group B: repetitive PCR-; CT +) COVID-19, admitted to a German university hospital during the pandemic's first wave. A standardized, in-house CT classification of radiological signs of a viral pneumonia was used to assess the probability of COVID-19. RESULTS: Seroconversion rates (SR) determined on day 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 after symptom onset (SO) were 8%, 25%, 65%, 76% and 91% for group A, and 0%, 10%, 19%, 37% and 46% for group B, respectively; (p < 0.01). Compared to hospitalized patients with a non-complicated course (non-ICU patients), seroconversion tended to occur at lower frequency and delayed in patients on intensive care units. SR of patients with CT findings classified as high certainty for COVID-19 were 8%, 22%, 68%, 79% and 93% in group A, compared with 0%, 15%, 28%, 50% and 50% in group B (p < 0.01). SARS-CoV-2 serology established a definite diagnosis in 12/46 group B patients. In 88% (8/9) of patients with negative serology > 14 days after symptom onset (group B), clinico-radiological consensus reassessment revealed probable diagnoses other than COVID-19. Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 serology was superior to PCR > 17d after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of patients with distinct COVID-19 CT findings are tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR rendering correct diagnosis difficult. Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 serology testing alongside current CT/PCR-based diagnostic algorithms improves discrimination between COVID-19-related and non-related pulmonary infiltrates in PCR negative patients. However, sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 serology strongly depends on the time of testing and becomes superior to PCR after the 2nd week following symptom onset.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 serology increases diagnostic accuracy in CT-suspected, PCR-negative COVID-19 patients during pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hymenoptera stings of the upper airway are rare events, but can result in rapid, life-threatening airway emergencies.

METHODS This was a multicenter prospective study involving a consecutive series of structurally normal fetuses between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation (CRL between 45 and 84 mm). All fetuses were submitted to 3D transvaginal ultrasound using a sagittal view of the spine as the starting plane of acquisition. At offline analysis, the position of the CM was evaluated by 2 independent operators with a quantitative and a qualitative method: (1) the distance between the most caudal part of the CM and the distal end of the coccyx (CMCd) was measured; (2) a line perpendicular to the fetal spine joining the tip of the CM to the anterior abdominal wall was traced to determine the level of this line in relation to the umbilical cord insertion (conus to abdomen line, CAL). Interobserver agreement for the CCMd was evaluated. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between the CMCd and CRL, and a normal range was computed based on the best-fit model. The absence of congenital anomalies was confirmed in all cases after birth. RESULTS In the study period between December 2019 and March 2020, 143 fetuses were recruited. In 130 fetuses (90.9%), the visualization of the CM was feasible. The mean value of the CMCd was 1.09  0.16 cm. The 95% limits of agreement for the interobserver variability in measurement of the CMCd were 0.24 and 0.26 cm. The interobserver variability based on the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for the CCMd was good (ICC = 0.81). We found a positive linear relationship between the CCMd and CRL. In all these fetuses, the CAL encountered the abdominal wall at or above the level of the cord insertion. CONCLUSION In normal fetuses, the assessment of the CM position is feasible at the first trimester 3D ultrasound with a good interobserver agreement. The CM level was never found below the fetal umbilical cord insertion, while the CMCd was noted to increase according to the gestational age, confirming the \\"ascension\\" of the CM during fetal life.","output":"Three-Dimensional Sonographic Evaluation of the Position of the Fetal Conus Medullaris at First Trimester."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many viral fusionCmediating glycoproteins couple -helical bundle formation to membrane merger, but have different methods for fusion activation.

These analyses on residues L447 and I449, both in intact F protein and in 6HB, suggest a metamorphic region around these residues with dual structural roles. Mutation of L447 and I449 to aliphatic residues destabilizes the 6HB structure and attenuates fusion activity. Mutation of L447 and I449 to aromatic residues also destabilizes the 6HB structure despite promoting hyperactive fusion, indicating that 6HB stability alone does not dictate fusogenicity.

Therefore, this present study investigates the levels of circulating MMPs (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13) and TIMPs (1, 2, 3, 4) in TBL individuals with helminth (Strongyloides stercoralis [Ss], hereafter Hel+) coinfection and without helminth coinfection (hereafter, Hel-). In addition, we have also carried out the regression analysis and calculated the MMP/TIMP ratios between the two study groups. We describe that the circulating levels of MMPs (except MMP-8 and MMP-12) were elevated in TBL-Hel+ coinfected individuals compared to TBL-Hel- individuals. Similarly, the systemic levels of TIMPs (1, 2, 3, 4) were increased in TBL-Hel+ compared to TBL-Hel- groups indicating that it is a feature of helminth coinfection per se. Finally, our multivariate analysis data also revealed that the changes in MMPs and TIMPs were independent of age, sex, and culture status between TBL-Hel+ and TBL-Hel- individuals. We show that the MMP-2 ratio with all TIMPs were significantly associated with TBL-helminth coinfection.

Then we searched the latest published RCTs from the above three databases and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished RCTs. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate pooled estimates by using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of six RCTs involving 9 171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.92-1.28, P > .05), laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.70-1.11), laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.29) and influenzalike illness (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.14) using N95 respirators and surgical masks.

Emerging evidence suggests that Omicron breakthrough cases are associated with substantially lower antibody titers than other VOC cases. However, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, using a novel geometric deep-learning model, we discovered that the antigenic profile of Omicron RBD is distinct from the prior VOCs, featuring reduced antigenicity in its remodeled receptor binding sites (RBS). To substantiate our deep-learning prediction, we immunized mice with different recombinant RBD variants and found that the Omicrons extensive mutations can lead to a drastically attenuated serologic response with limited neutralizing activity in vivo, while the T cell response remains potent. Analyses of serum cross-reactivity and competitive ELISA with epitope-specific nanobodies revealed that the antibody response to Omicron was reduced across RBD epitopes, including both the variable RBS and epitopes without any known VOC mutations. Moreover, computational modeling confirmed that the RBS is highly versatile with a capacity to further decrease antigenicity while retaining efficient receptor binding. Longitudinal analysis showed that this evolutionary trend of decrease in antigenicity was also found in hCoV229E, a common cold coronavirus that has been circulating in humans for decades.

The new strains belonged to Lactobacillus fermentum, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus hire. The selected strains were non-hemolytic, showed high tolerance to low pH and bile salts, and strong adherence abilities. Furthermore, the strains displayed a wide range of antimicrobial activities, particularly against antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Moreover, five of the selected isolates demonstrated antiproliferative features against human colon cancer cell line (Caco-2). The results of this investigation confirm the diversity of microbial populations in the human gut and saliva, and since these strains are of human origin, they will highly likely display maximal activities in food and drugs set for human use. Hence, the new strains of this study require additional in vivo experiments to assess their health-promoting effects.","output":"Isolation of Novel Probiotic Lactobacillus and Enterococcus Strains From Human Salivary and Fecal Sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research describes a nanomaterial-assisted thread-based isotachophoresis (TB-ITP) setup for the clean-up, preconcentration, and trapping of alkaloids (coptisine, berberine, and palmatine) in biological fluids, followed by their on-thread desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) determination.

One of these, could be the use of antibiotic adjuvants that enhances the effect of antibiotics towards resistant bacteria. A novel antibiotic adjuvant is cannabidiol (CBD), which we have previously shown can enhance the effect of bacitracin (BAC). BAC targets cell wall synthesis by inhibiting dephosphorylation of the lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate prior to recycling across the membrane. However, the mechanism underlying this CBD mediated potentiation of BAC has remained unknown. To explore this, we examined resistance to CBD in Staphylococcus aureus through daily exposures to CBD. By subsequent whole genome sequencing, we observed multiple genes to be mutated, including the farE/farR system encoding a fatty acid efflux pump (FarE) and its regulator (FarR). Importantly, recreation of mutations in these genes showed decreased susceptibility towards the combination of CBD and BAC. Furthermore, we searched the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library for CBD susceptible strains and identified menH encoding a protein participating in menaquinone biosynthesis. Strains containing deletions in this and other menaquinone related genes showed increased susceptibility towards CBD, while addition of exogenous menaquinone reversed the effect and reduced susceptible towards CBD. These results suggest that CBD potentiates BAC by redirecting the isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl pyrophosphate towards production of menaquinone rather than the lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, which dephosphorylation is inhibited by BAC. This in turn might decrease the level of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate thus enhancing the effect of BAC. Our study illustrates how antibiotic adjuvants may apply to enhance efficacy of antimicrobial compounds.","output":"The menaquinone pathway is important for susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to the antibiotic adjuvant, cannabidiol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening medical emergency requiring urgent treatment.

The purpose of this study was to use electronic health record (EHR) data to replicate self-reported survey findings from the general US population and assess whether sexual orientation is associated with diagnosed physical health conditions that may elevate risk of COVID-19 severity among veterans who utilize the VA. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of VA EHR data from 10/01/1999-07-01-2019 analyzed in 2021. Veterans with minoritized sexual orientations were included if they had documentation of a minoritized sexual orientation within clinical notes identified via natural language processing. Veterans without minoritized sexual orientation documentation comprised the comparison group. Adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated overall and by race/ethnicity while accounting for differences in distributions of sex assigned at birth, age, calendar year of first VA visit, volumes of healthcare utilization, and VA priority group. RESULTS: Data from 108,401 veterans with minoritized sexual orientation and 6,511,698 controls were analyzed. After adjustment, veterans with minoritized sexual orientations had a statistically significant elevated prevalence of 10 of the 11 conditions. Amongst the highest disparities observed were COPD (aPR:1.24 [95% confidence interval:1.23-1.26]), asthma (1.22 [1.20-1.24]), and stroke (1.26 [1.24-1.28]).

The participants were randomly assigned into three groups: (1) face-to-face mindfulness training based on the Mindfulness Skills for Students course (n = 40), (2) a web-based Student Compass program using Mindfulness and Acceptance and Commitment therapy (n = 22), and (3) a control group that received mental health support as usual (n = 40). The primary outcome was psychological distress measured using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM). Secondary outcomes included hair cortisol concentrations and a wide range of well-being indicators. Psychological distress increased in all the groups from baseline to post-intervention, but significantly less so in the intervention groups than in the control group. At 4-month follow-up, were found no differences between the primary outcomes of the control and intervention groups, but the participants who continued practising mindfulness at least twice a week were less stressed than the others. Our results suggest that participating in a mindfulness course may mitigate health care students psychological distress during the academic year, but only if the participants continue practising mindfulness at least twice a week.

Patients with PPCS often rely on a comprehensive care team, requiring in-person treatments and consistent care. Little information exists regarding how access to these services have been impacted by public health measures, and what outcome the measures have had on the recovery of patients with PPCS. OBJECTIVE To explore the impact of the restriction of in-person treatments, shifts to virtual care, and global public health measures on the recovery and psychological well-being of patients with PPCS. DESIGN Qualitative interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a reflexive thematic analysis approach to identify the main impacts of the public health measures on participants with PPCS. SETTING Participant interviews were completed remotely via telephone or video-calling software during province-wide shutdowns. PARTICIPANTS 20 individuals with PPCS who attended the institution's Brain Injury Program consented to participate. INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. RESULTS The impacts of the public health measures emerged most prominently in three main categories: 1) day-to-day lived experiences; 2) personal health status; 3) health service experiences and barriers. CONCLUSION This in-depth investigation of the lived experiences of patients with PPCS outlines how the COVID-19 public health measures negatively impacted their care and well-being. The analysis identified that through increasing social support systems, providing better access to standard or remote treatment, and developing more effective telehealth strategies, this population could be better supported in the event of future public health measures.

This paper explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to evaluate interviews on loneliness, notably, employing natural language processing (NLP) to quantify sentiment and features that indicate loneliness in transcribed speech text of older adults. DESIGN: Participants completed semi-structured qualitative interviews regarding the experience of loneliness and a quantitative self-report scale (UCLA loneliness scale) to assess loneliness. Lonely and non-lonely participants (based on qualitative and quantitative assessments) were compared. SETTING: Independent living sector of a senior housing community in San Diego County. PARTICIPANTS: 80 English-speaking older adults of ages 66-94 (mean 83 years). MEASUREMENTS: Interviews were audiotaped and manually transcribed. Transcripts were examined using NLP approaches to quantify sentiment and expressed emotions. RESULTS: Lonely individuals (by qualitative assessments) had longer responses with greater expression of sadness to direct questions about loneliness. Women were more likely to endorse feeling lonely during the qualitative interview. Men used more fearful and joyful words in their responses. Using linguistic features, machine learning models could predict qualitative loneliness with 94% precision (sensitivity=0.90, specificity=1.00) and quantitative loneliness with 76% precision (sensitivity=0.57, specificity=0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence (e.g., NLP and machine learning approaches) can provide unique insights into how linguistic features of transcribed speech data may reflect loneliness.

METHODS: Pharmacokinetic studies of vancomycin in critically ill children published up to May 2021 were included in the review provided they included children aged > 1 month. Studies including neonates were excluded. A search was performed using the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) was used to check for quality and reduce bias. Data on study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical parameters, pharmacokinetic parameters, outcomes, and study limitations were collected. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in this review. A wide variety of dosing and sampling strategies were used in the studies. Methods for estimating vancomycin pharmacokinetics, especially the area under the curve over 24 h, varied. Vancomycin doses of 20C60 mg/kg were given daily. This resulted in high variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. Vancomycin trough level was less than 15 g/mL in most of the studies. Vancomycin clearance ranged from 0.05 to 0.38 L/h/kg.

As a result, cancer caregivers may have to shoulder triple crises: the COVID-19 pandemic, pronounced healthcare needs from the patient, and elevated need for care from within. While technology-based health interventions have the potential to address unique challenges cancer caregivers face amid COVID-19, limited insights are available. Thus, to bridge this gap, we aim to identify technology-based interventions designed for cancer caregivers and report the characteristics and effects of these interventions concerning the distinctive challenges cancer caregivers face amid COVID-19. Additionally, this paper will present practical insights into the diverse intervention approaches that can assist in the delivery of digital health solutions for cancer caregivers amid and beyond COVID-19. Methods A systematic review of the literature will be conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus in September, 2020. Articles that center on technology-based interventions for cancer caregivers will be included in the review. The search strategy was developed in consultation with an academic librarian who is experienced in systematic review studies.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures will be followed for the reporting process. Results NAThis is a protocol study. Conclusions COVID-19 has uprooted cancer care as we know it. Due to barriers introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as medical resources rationing, cancer caregivers often have to step up to address patients' healthcare needs and wants. This, in turn, will exert substantial stress on informal caregivers, above and beyond COVID-19-related burdens the general public shoulders on a daily basis. Findings of this study can shed light on evidence-based and practical solutions cancer caregivers can utilize to mitigate the unique challenges they face amid COVID-19. Furthermore, results of this study will also offer valuable insights for researchers who aim to develop interventions for cancer caregivers in the context of COVID-19. In addition, we also expect to be able to identify areas for improvement that need to be addressed in order for health experts to more adequately help cancer caregivers weather the storm of global health crises like COVID-19 and beyond.

BVs are commonly described as rod shaped particles with a high apical density of protein extensions (spikes) on the lipid envelope surface. However, due to the fragility of BVs the conventional purification and electron microscopy (EM) staining methods considerably distort the native viral structure. Here, we use cryo-EM analysis to reveal the near-native morphology of two intensively studied baculoviruses, Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and Spodoptera exigua MNPV (SeMNPV), as models for BVs carrying GP64 and F as envelope fusion protein on the surface. The now well-preserved AcMNPV and SeMNPV BV particles have a remarkable elongated, ovoid shape leaving a large, lateral space between nucleocapsid (NC) and envelope. Consistent with previous findings the NC has a distinctive cap and base structure interacting tightly with the envelope. This tight interaction may explain the partial retaining of the envelope on both ends of the NC and the disappearance of the remainder of the BV envelope in the negative-staining EM images. Cryo-EM also reveals that the viral envelope contains two layers with a total thickness of 6C7 nm, which is significantly thicker than a usual biological membrane (<4 nm) as measured by X-ray scanning.

Personnel who live and train on military installations live and train near one another facilitating disease transmission. An understanding of historical sanitation and hygiene can inform modern practices. This is especially pertinent considering the continuing rise of variants of infectious diseases, such as the recent pandemic of the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this article, we review the rise and decline of infectious disease at the United States Military Academy (USMA) during the period spanning 1890 through 1910, and the public health interventions used to combat disease spread. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary data regarding cadet illness were acquired from the historical archives of the USMA. These included annual reports, clinical admission records, casualty ledgers, and sanitation reports. Unpublished documents from the medical history of USMA provide periodic trends of health among cadets because of infectious disease. RESULTS: Between 1890 and 1910, the USMA at West Point was confronted with cases of influenza, measles, mumps, scarlet fever, smallpox, typhus, and malaria. In response, a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were instituted to curb the spread of infectious disease. These interventions most likely proved effective in suppressing the transmission of communicable diseases. The most common and arguably the most effective NPI was the physical separation of the sick from the well. CONCLUSIONS: The USMA experience mirrored what was occurring in the larger U.S. Army in the early 20th century and may serve as a model for the application of NPIs in response to modern infectious diseases resulting from novel or unknown etiologies.","output":"Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and Military Hygiene at the United States Military Academy between 1890 and 1910"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral RNAs can perturb the miRNA regulatory network, competing with host RNAs as part of their infective process.

As the viral spike (S) protein plays a key role in mediating virus entry, it becomes a potential target for the design of antiviral drugs against COVID-19. Here, we tested the antiviral activity of berbamine hydrochloride, a bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that berbamine hydrochloride could efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in different cell lines. Further experiments showed berbamine hydrochloride inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by targeting the viral entry into host cells. Moreover, berbamine hydrochloride and other bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids could potently inhibit S-mediated cell-cell fusion. Furthermore, molecular docking results implied that the berbamine hydrochloride could bind to the post fusion core of SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit.

This study aims to determine the association between inpatient statin use and severe disease outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially those with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study on hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The primary outcome was mortality during hospitalization. Patients were classified into statin and non-statin groups based on the administration of statins during hospitalization. Analysis included multivariable regression analysis adjusting for confounders and propensity score matching to achieve a 1:1 balanced cohort. Subgroup analyses based on presence of DM were conducted. RESULTS: In the cohort of 922 patients, 413 had a history of DM. About 27.1% patients (n = 250) in the total cohort (TC) and 32.9% patients (n = 136) in DM cohort received inpatient statins. Atorvastatin (n = 205, 82%) was the most commonly prescribed statin medication in TC. On multivariable analysis in TC, inpatient statin group had reduced mortality compared to the non-statin group (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42C0.90; p = 0.01). DM modified this association between inpatient statins and mortality. Patients with DM who received inpatient statins had reduced mortality (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.21C0.61; p < 0.001). However, no such association was noted among patients without DM (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.67C2.17; p = 0.52). These results were further validated using propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient statin use was associated with significant reduction in mortality among COVID-19 patients especially those with DM. These findings support the pursuit of randomized clinical trials and inpatient statin use appears safe among COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by a real-time RT-PCR test, who were admitted to non-ICU wards and underwent a chest CT scan were retrospectively enrolled. Descriptive evaluation of radiologic findings was performed using a classification based on the time interval between the initiation of the symptoms and chest CT-scan. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 58.0 years, and the median time interval from the onset of symptoms to CT scan evaluation was 7 days. Most patients had bilateral (94.4%) and multifocal (91.0%) lung involvement with peripheral distribution (60.7%). Also, most patients showed involvement of all five lobes (77.5%). Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (84.3%), and mixed GGO with consolidation (80.9%) were the most common identified patterns. We also found that as the time interval between symptoms and CT scan evaluation increased, the predominant pattern changed from GGO to mixed pattern and then to elongated-containing and band-like-opacities-containing pattern; on the other hand, the percentage of lung involvement increased.

The pandemic has further revealed the vulnerability of small-scale fishing households in the region. Given the few assets of fisher households, their ability to cushion the negative impact of crises and shocks is limited. Fishers made adaptive responses such as direct fish marketing, online marketing, and home delivery services.

To address this gap, we simulated the release of SARS-CoV-2 in a multistory office building and three social gathering settings (bar/restaurant, nightclub, wedding venue) using a well-mixed, multi-zone building model similar to those used by Wells, Riley, and others. We varied key factors of HVAC systems, such as the Air Changes Per Hour rate (ACH), Fraction of Outside Air (FOA), and Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values (MERV) to examine their effect on viral transmission, and additionally simulated the protective effects of in-unit ultraviolet light decontamination (UVC) and separate in-room air filtration. In all building types, increasing the ACH reduced simulated infections, and the effects were seen even with low aerosol emission rates. However, the benefits of increasing the fraction of outside air and filter efficiency rating were greatest when the aerosol emission rate was high. UVC filtration improved the performance of typical HVAC systems. In-room filtration in an office setting similarly reduced overall infections but worked better when placed in every room. Overall, we found little evidence that HVAC systems facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission; most infections in the simulated office occurred near the emission source, with some infections in individuals temporarily visiting the release zone. HVAC systems only increased infections in one scenario involving a marginal increase in airflow in a poorly ventilated space, which slightly increased the likelihood of transmission outside the release zone. We found that improving air circulation rates, increasing filter MERV rating, increasing the fraction of outside air, and applying UVC radiation and in-room filtration may reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission indoors.

RESULTS: Eleven of 16 patients (68.8%) survived to 6 months follow-up with four patients requiring short-term (<28 days) and seven requiring prolonged (?28 days) ECMO support. Lung compliance before ECMO was higher in the prolonged than in the short-term group (28.1 (28.8C32.1) ml/cmH(2)O vs 18.7 (17.7C25.0) ml/cmH(2)O, p = 0.030). Mechanical ventilation before ECMO was longer (19 (16C23) days vs 5 (5C9) days, p = 0.002) and SOFA score was higher (12.0 (10.5C17.0) vs 10.0 (9.0C10.0), p = 0.002) in non-survivors compared to survivors. Low viral load during the first days on ECMO tended to indicate worse outcomes. Seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2 occurred in all patients, but did not affect outcome. CONCLUSIONS: VV ECMO support for COVID-19-induced ARDS is justified if initiated early and at an experienced ECMO center. Prolonged ECMO therapy might be required in those patients. Although no relevant predictive factors for the duration of ECMO support were found, the decision to stop therapy should not be made dependent of the length of ECMO treatment.","output":"ECMO in COVID-19prolonged therapy needed?

The aim of the present study was to compare oncologic outcomes among patients with T1 renal mass treated with partial nephrectomy and local tumor ablation. METHODS To reduce the inherent differences between patients undergoing laparoscopic or robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (n = 405) and local tumor ablation (n = 137), we used a 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis. Local tumor ablation consisted of radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation. Disease-free survival, overall survival and other causes mortality-free survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable logistic regression and competing-risk regression models were used to identify predictors of complications, recurrence and other causes mortality, respectively. RESULTS Partial nephrectomy had higher disease-free survival estimates, as compared with local tumor ablation (92.8% vs 80.4% at 5 years, P = 0.02), with no significant difference between radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation (P = 0.9). Ablation showed comparable overall survival estimates to partial nephrectomy (91% vs 95.8% at 5 years, P = 0.6). The 5-year recurrence rates were 7.9% versus 23.8% for patients aged 70 years, and 2.5% versus 11.9% for patients aged >70 years treated with partial nephrectomy and ablation, respectively; the 5-year other causes mortality rates were 0% and 2.2% for patients treated with partial nephrectomy and ablation aged 70 years, and 3% versus 10.9% for patients aged >70 years treated with partial nephrectomy and ablation, respectively. At multivariable analysis, ablation was associated with fewer complications (odds ratio 0.41; P = 0.01). At competing risks analysis, age (hazard ratio 0.96) and ablation (hazard ratio 4.56) were independent predictors of disease recurrence (all P  0.008).

To validate the platform as a potential COVID-19 vaccine approach, we decorated the newly designed VLP with the glycosylated receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Cryo-Electron Microscopy structure revealed that up to 60 copies of this antigenic domain could be bound on a single ADDomer particle, with the symmetrical arrangements of a dodecahedron. Mouse immunization with the RBD decorated VLPs already showed a significant specific humoral response following prime vaccination, greatly reinforced by a single boost. Neutralization assays with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudo-typed-virus demonstrated the elicitation of strong neutralization titers, superior to those of COVID-19 convalescent patients.

The commentary highlighted the importance of a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) and its potential in addressing surveillance gap, and the inadequacy of existing sociodemographic database used for palliative administration. The authors examined the HDSS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response and learning from the Nahuche model. The Nahuche HDSS model has the potential of identifying poor households as it collects standard data on the socio-economic status of each of the households within the demographic surveillance area (DSA). Standard questionnaire in assessing the household socio-economic status adapted from standard surveys, such as Nigeria Health and Demographic Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey, was administered on the household heads of each household every 2 years to monitor socio-economic advancement of the households. Data on variables such as household possessions, including animals and livestock, were collected and analyzed using factor analysis to group the households into different wealth indices. HDSS provides an opportunity to ameliorate the challenges associated with halting the spread of the virus in the areas of surveillance and administration of palliatives in Nigeria, where there is a paucity of reliable demographic and household-level socio-economic data.

This study aimed to clarify how characteristics of hikikomori are associated with ASD, including undiagnosed autism spectrum conditions (ASC), in clinical settings. METHODS: A total of 416 clinical patients were recruited through the Mood Disorder/Hikikomori Clinic at Kyushu University Hospital. A total of 103 hikikomori cases and 221 clinical controls without hikikomori conditions were extracted using a semi\\\\structured interview, and completed a series of self\\\\rated scales, including the Japanese version of the Autism\\\\Spectrum Quotient (AQ\\\\J). RESULTS: Compared to non\\\\hikikomori controls, hikikomori cases were more likely to have higher autistic tendency based on the AQ\\\\J. The cases showed more severe subjective depressive symptoms based on the self\\\\rated Beck Depression Inventory II, whereas no significant difference was found on interview\\\\based severity evaluation using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Comparison within hikikomori cases based on the AQ\\\\J cut\\\\off score revealed that hikikomori cases with high ASC were significantly more likely to have higher traits of modern\\\\type depression, smaller social networks, and less social support. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that hikikomori sufferers are more likely to have autistic tendency, and that hikikomori sufferers with high ASC may have much more difficulty in social communication and social interaction. In addition, those with high ASC may also have lower self\\\\esteem and higher complaint tendencies as aspects of modern\\\\type depression traits, which may relate to the occurrence of hikikomori.

Content, based on prior formative work, included health research information and interactive postings (e.g., live interviews with researchers). Standard metrics obtained from Facebook analytics included participation (followers), content reach (views), and engagement (likes, shares, comments, clicks). RESULTS: During the 12-month period, we acquired 1406 followers (31% rural residents), with a retention of followers of 99.7%. Mean number of views per month was 9379.83 (Mdn = 2791, range 724C41,510). Engagement metrics indicated a mean of 535.2 likes, shares, comments, and/or clicks per month (Mdn = 296.5, range 55C1535).

In the present review, we have evaluated the various studies and argued the rationality that the anticoagulation in this condition should be initiated early during the infection and should be increased in a graded manner depending on clinical and laboratory progression of the condition until a strong specific antiviral drug for coronavirus disease 2019 infection is available.","output":"Thrombohaemorhhagic balance in coronavirus disease 2019 and its management: a perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A small minority of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a severe illness, characterised by inflammation, microvascular damage and coagulopathy, potentially leading to myocardial injury, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial occlusive events. People with risk factors for or pre-existing cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities associated with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a variety of settings, including the community, care homes and hospitals. We also assessed the nature and rate of subsequent cardiovascular complications and clinical events in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted an electronic search from December 2019 to 24 July 2020 in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, covid-19.cochrane.org, ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trial Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, controlled before-and-after, case-control and cross-sectional studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We analysed controlled trials as cohorts, disregarding treatment allocation. We only included peer-reviewed studies with 100 or more participants, and excluded articles not written in English or only published in pre-print servers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. Given substantial variation in study designs, reported outcomes and outcome metrics, we undertook a narrative synthesis of data, without conducting a meta-analysis. We critically appraised all included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies and the JBI checklist for case series. MAIN RESULTS: We included 220 studies. Most of the studies originated from China (47.7%) or the USA (20.9%); 9.5% were from Italy. A large proportion of the studies were retrospective (89.5%), but three (1.4%) were RCTs and 20 (9.1%) were prospective. Using JBI's critical appraisal checklist tool for prevalence studies, 75 studies attained a full score of 9, 57 studies a score of 8, 31 studies a score of 7, 5 studies a score of 6, three studies a score of 5 and one a score of 3; using JBI's checklist tool for case series, 30 studies received a full score of 10, six studies a score of 9, 11 studies a score of 8, and one study a score of 5 We found that hypertension (189 studies, n = 174,414, weighted mean prevalence (WMP): 36.1%), diabetes (197 studies, n = 569,188, WMP: 22.1%) and ischaemic heart disease (94 studies, n = 100,765, WMP: 10.5%) are highly prevalent in people hospitalised with COVID-19, and are associated with an increased risk of death. In those admitted to hospital, biomarkers of cardiac stress or injury are often abnormal, and the incidence of a wide range of cardiovascular complications is substantial, particularly arrhythmias (22 studies, n = 13,115, weighted mean incidence (WMI) 9.3%), heart failure (20 studies, n = 29,317, WMI: 6.8%) and thrombotic complications (VTE: 16 studies, n = 7700, WMI: 7.4%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review indicates that cardiometabolic comorbidities are common in people who are hospitalised with a COVID-19 infection, and cardiovascular complications are frequent.

BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, cardiac surgery for coronary artery disease (CAD) was dramatically reduced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many patients with \\"surgical disease\\" instead underwent PCI. METHODS: Between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2020, 215 patients with recognized \\"surgical\\" CAD who underwent PCI were enrolled in the prospective UK-ReVasc Registry (ReVR). 30-day major cardiovascular event outcomes were collected. Findings in ReVR patients were directly compared to reference PCI and isolated CABG pre-COVID-19 data from British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) and National Cardiac Audit Programme (NCAP) databases. RESULTS: ReVR patients had higher incidence of diabetes (34.4% vs 26.4%, P = .008), multi-vessel disease with left main stem disease (51.4% vs 3.0%, P < .001) and left anterior descending artery involvement (94.8% vs 67.2%, P < .001) compared to BCIS data. SYNTAX Score in ReVR was high (mean 28.0). Increased use of transradial access (93.3% vs 88.6%, P = .03), intracoronary imaging (43.6% vs 14.4%, P < .001) and calcium modification (23.6% vs 3.5%, P < .001) was observed. No difference in in-hospital mortality was demonstrated compared to PCI and CABG data (ReVR 1.4% vs BCIS 0.7%, P = .19; vs NCAP 1.0%, P = .48). Inpatient stay was half compared to CABG (3.0 vs 6.0 days). Low-event rates in ReVR were maintained to 30-day follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: PCI undertaken using contemporary techniques produces excellent short-term results in patients who would be otherwise CABG candidates.

India has also achieved a significant reduction in malaria burden in 2018 and has committed to eliminate malaria by 2030. The Mandla Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project (MEDP) was started in 2017 in 1233 villages of District Mandla to demonstrate malaria elimination in a tribal district with hard-to-reach areas was possible using active and passive surveillance, case management, vector control, and targeted information, education and communication campaigns. An operational plan was developed to strengthen the existing surveillance and malaria elimination systems, through fortnightly active case detection to ensure that all cases including those that are introduced into the communities are rapidly identified and treated promptly. The plan also focused on the reduction of human-mosquito contact through the use of Long-Lasting Insecticial Nets (LLINs) and Indoor Residual Spray (IRS). The operational plan was modified in view of the present COVID-19 pandemic by creating systems of assistance for the local administration for COVID-related work while ensuring the operational integrity of malaria elimination efforts. RESULTS: The use of MEDP study design and operational plan, with its built-in management control systems, has yielded significant (91%) reduction of indigenous cases of malaria during the period from June 2017 to May 2020. The malaria positivity rate was 0.33% in 2017-18, 0.13% in 2018-19, and 0.06% in 2019-20. Mass screening revealed 0.18% malaria positivity in September-October 2018, followed by 0.06% in June 2019, and 0.03% in December 2019, and these were mostly asymptomatic cases in the community. The project has been able to sustain the gains of the past three years during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: This paper provides the study design and the operational plan for malaria elimination in a high-burden district of Central India, which presented difficulties of hard to reach areas, forest malaria, and complex epidemiology of urban and rural malaria. The lessons learned could be used for malaria elimination efforts in rest of the country and other parts of South Asia with comparable demography and epidemiology.","output":"Study design and operational framework for a community-based Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project (MEDP) in 1233 villages of district Mandla, Madhya Pradesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An artificial intelligence-assisted low-cost portable device for the rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is presented here. This standalone temperature-controlled device houses tubes designed for conducting reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays. Moreover, the device utilises tubes illuminated by LEDs, an in-built camera, and a small onboard computer with automated image acquisition and processing algorithms. This intelligent device significantly reduces the normal assay run time and removes the subjectivity associated with operator interpretation of colourimetric RT-LAMP results. To further improve this devices usability, a mobile app has been integrated into the system to control the LAMP assay environment and to visually display the assay results by connecting the device to a smartphone via Bluetooth. This study was undertaken using ~5000 images produced from the ~200 LAMP amplification assays using the prototype device. Synthetic RNA and a small panel of positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patient samples were assayed for this study. State-of-the-art image processing and artificial intelligence algorithms were applied to these images to analyse them and to select the most efficient algorithm. The template matching algorithm for image extraction and MobileNet CNN architecture for classification results provided 98.0% accuracy with an average run time of 20 min to confirm the endpoint result. Two working points were chosen based on the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity. The high sensitivity point has a sensitivity value of 99.12% and specificity value of 70.8%, while at the high specificity point, the sensitivity is 96.05% and specificity 93.59%.

Study aims: (1) identify sociodemographic groups of the adult population at risk of anxiety and depression and (2) determine if the following social and psychological risk factors for poor mental health moderated these direct sociodemographic effects: loneliness, social support, threat perception, illness representations. METHODS: Cross-sectional nationally representative telephone survey in Scotland in June 2020. If available, validated instruments were used, for example, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. RESULTS: A total of 1006 participants; median age 53 years, 61.4% female, from all levels of area deprivation (i.e., 3.8% in the most deprived decile and 15.6% in the most affluent decile). Analyses show associations of anxiety and depression with sociodemographic (age, gender, deprivation), social (social support, loneliness) and psychological factors (perceived threat and illness representations). Mental health was poorer in younger adults, women and people living in the most deprived areas. Age effects were exacerbated by loneliness and illness representations, gender effects by loneliness and illness representations and deprivation effects by loneliness, social support, illness representations and perceived threat. In each case, the moderating variables amplified the detrimental effects of the sociodemographic factors.

The analysis of 166 severe and 167 mild cases from hospitals in Spain, Italy and Portugal revealed statistically significant differences in the composition of the IgG N-glycome. The most notable difference was the decrease in bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in severe patients from all three cohorts.

PARTICIPANTS: All people aged 18-65 years who received a first vaccination with ChAdOx1-S from 9 February 2021 to 11 March 2021. The general populations of Denmark (2016-18) and Norway (2018-19) served as comparator cohorts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed 28 day rates of hospital contacts for incident arterial events, venous thromboembolism, thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders, and bleeding among vaccinated people compared with expected rates, based on national age and sex specific background rates from the general populations of the two countries. RESULTS: The vaccinated cohorts comprised 148 792 people in Denmark (median age 45 years, 80% women) and 132 472 in Norway (median age 44 years, 78% women), who received their first dose of ChAdOx1-S. Among 281 264 people who received ChAdOx1-S, the standardised morbidity ratio for arterial events was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.20). 59 venous thromboembolic events were observed in the vaccinated cohort compared with 30 expected based on the incidence rates in the general population, corresponding to a standardised morbidity ratio of 1.97 (1.50 to 2.54) and 11 (5.6 to 17.0) excess events per 100 000 vaccinations. A higher than expected rate of cerebral venous thrombosis was observed: standardised morbidity ratio 20.25 (8.14 to 41.73); an excess of 2.5 (0.9 to 5.2) events per 100 000 vaccinations. The standardised morbidity ratio for any thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders was 1.52 (0.97 to 2.25) and for any bleeding was 1.23 (0.97 to 1.55). 15 deaths were observed in the vaccine cohort compared with 44 expected. CONCLUSIONS: Among recipients of ChAdOx1-S, increased rates of venous thromboembolic events, including cerebral venous thrombosis, were observed. For the remaining safety outcomes, results were largely reassuring, with slightly higher rates of thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders and bleeding, which could be influenced by increased surveillance of vaccine recipients. The absolute risks of venous thromboembolic events were, however, small, and the findings should be interpreted in the light of the proven beneficial effects of the vaccine, the context of the given country, and the limitations to the generalisability of the study findings.","output":"Arterial events, venous thromboembolism, thrombocytopenia, and bleeding after vaccination with Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S in Denmark and Norway: population based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: A study designed to assess the public perception of the response of government and its institutions to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.

The impact generated is still difficult to estimate accurately. As doctors, we are just beginning to unravel the epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical aspects of a new disease, while we are exposed to it on the frontline of care. The use of BDORT as an investigative tool in cases of diseases that are difficult to solve is part of the very development of the method by Prof. Omura and its principles are valid in cases of COVID 19, as well as in cases of neoplasms, neuropsychiatric disorders and so on. We have an invaluable resource that we must use in this fight but we need to understand how to get the most out of the method and explore the peculiarities of the moment. Methods The resonance phenomenon between identical substances is widely used in BDORT and we work based on this using microscopy images of the etiologic agent in different quantities, ranging from 1 to 200000 units, to estimate the viral load. Using the same principle, we also use images from Prevotella sp;vitrification lesions, histological images of arteritis and others. We also measured sixty-nine RCS parameters. The evaluation is done in printed photos of the patients and the records of the imaging patterns, measurement of RCS parameters and drug selection are written in these photos. The assessment of patients at a distance through photos is not a strange practice to BDORT and in the context of the pandemic it becomes even more valuable because it respects social distance. The sequential assessments documenting the evolution are archived and can at any time be the object of new studies and shared to exchange information. Findings We have observed over time the increase in viral load both in the environment and in patients and we consider this increase to be progressive and not yet stabilized. In the imaging patterns of individuals infected with SARS-Cov-2, there are areas of electromagnetic anomaly in various structures of the body where it was possible to check the resonance for UCV and measure the viral load. Unexpected findings in Imaging included vertical contamination in pregnant women, dysfunction of the thymus and the occurrence of high levels of UCV in the Cranial Imaging. This latest finding proved to be a longstanding contamination and it is too early to estimate its long-term effects, presence of residual injury or sequelae. These imaging patterns will be the subject of specific presentations. Contamination by SARS-CoV-2 appear to be correlated with remarkable alteration with remarkable alteration in inflammatory parameters, Thromboxane B2 and another RCS. Interpretation We are still beginning to learn about COVID-19 but research another RCS. Interpretation We are still beginning to learn about COVID-19 but research through BDORT brings valuable insights and is therefore now an indispensable support for clinical practice. BDORT allows a better diagnosis than other available resources and with proper evaluation we can treat it earlier, avoiding the progression of COVID-19 to severe forms. BDORT allows you to locate and quantify the infection in real time and this assessment allows you to understand the patient's response and monitor it safely. For this reason, we can not only choose the most effective interventions, but also introduce the precise therapeutic adjustments at an ideal time.","output":"Distant Medical Care of COVID-19 Cases through BDORT: A Treatment Approach for Pandemic Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer survivors (PCS) experience long-term side effects beyond treatment such as fatigue, depression and anxiety. Quality and engaging supportive care programs are needed to reduce these chronic and debilitating effects. Independent of physical activity (PA), high volumes of sedentary behavior (SB) are associated with chronic disease-related risk factors and poorer cancer-specific quality of life (QoL). Simultaneously increasing PA and decreasing SB may be an effective health promotion strategy. Given that PCS may face several barriers to engaging in supervised programs, there is a need to develop and assess the efficacy of interventions that employ distance-based approaches for behavior change. The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of a 12-week intervention (Fitbit + behavioral counselling) vs. Fitbit-only control group in reducing SB among PCS. Secondary outcomes include light-intensity PA, QoL, motivational outcomes, and patient satisfaction. METHODS: This two-armed, randomized controlled trial will recruit inactive PCS (stage I-IV) across Canada who self-report engaging in >8 hours/day of SB. Participants will be randomized to the intervention (n=60; Fitbit and behavioral support) or active control group (n=60; Fitbit-only). The intervention consists of the use of a Fitbit and a series of six behavioral support sessions (two group, four individual) to aid PCS in gradually replacing SB with light-intensity PA by increasing their daily step counts to 3,000 steps above their baseline values. The Fitbit-only control condition will receive a Fitbit and public health PA resources. The primary outcome is change in SB measured objectively using activPAL inclinometers. All secondary outcomes will be measured via self-report, except for PA which will be measuring using Fitbits. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6-month post-intervention. DISCUSSION: Reducing SB and increasing light-intensity PA plays an important, yet often undervalued role in the health and well-being of PCS.

Therefore, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19. Methods A systematic literature search was performed for original studies on chest CT findings in patients with COVID-19. Methodological quality of studies was evaluated. Pooled prevalences of chest CT findings were calculated using a random effects model in case of between-study heterogeneity (predefined as I250), otherwise a fixed effects model was used. Results Twenty-eight studies were included. Median number of COVID-19 patients per study was 124 (range 50-476), comprising a total of 3,466 patients. Median prevalence of symptomatic patients was 99% (range >76.3%-100%). 27/28 (96%) of studies had a retrospective design. Methodological quality concerns were present with either risk of or actual referral bias (13 studies), patient spectrum bias (8 studies), disease progression bias (26 studies), observer variability bias (27 studies), and test review bias (14 studies). Pooled prevalence was 10.6% for normal chest CT findings. Pooled prevalences were 90.0% for posterior predilection, 81.0% for ground-glass opacity, 75.8% for bilateral abnormalities, 73.1% for left lower lobe involvement, 72.9% for vascular thickening, and 72.2% for right lower lobe involvement. Pooled prevalences were 5.2% for pleural effusion, 5.1% for lymphadenopathy, 4.1% for airway secretions/tree-in-bud sign, 3.6% for central lesion distribution, 2.7% for pericardial effusion, and 0.7% for cavitation/cystic changes. Pooled prevalences of other CT findings ranged between 10.5%-63.2%. Conclusion Studies on chest CT findings in COVID-19 suffer from methodological quality concerns. More high-quality research is necessary to establish diagnostic CT criteria for COVID-19. Based on the available evidence that requires cautious interpretation, several chest CT findings appear to be suggestive of COVID-19, but normal chest CT findings do not exclude COVID-19, even not in symptomatic patients.","output":"Chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19 infection: in pursuit of the scientific evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need for the ability to rapidly develop effective countermeasures for emerging biological threats, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic We have developed a generalized computational design strategy to rapidly engineer de novo proteins that precisely recapitulate the protein surface targeted by biological agents, like viruses, to gain entry into cells The designed proteins act as decoys that block cellular entry and aim to be resilient to viral mutational escape Using our novel platform, in less than ten weeks, we engineered, validated, and optimized de novo protein decoys of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the membrane-associated protein that SARS-CoV-2 exploits to infect cells Our optimized designs are hyperstable de novo proteins (18-37 kDa), have high affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and can potently inhibit the virus infection and replication in vitro Future refinements to our strategy can enable the rapid development of other therapeutic de novo protein decoys, not limited to neutralizing viruses, but to combat any agent that explicitly interacts with cell surface proteins to cause disease","output":"De novo design of ACE2 protein decoys to neutralize SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, a new infectious viral disease appeared.

The primary objectives were the safety and pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab monotherapy. For JVCZ, randomized patients (N = 245) received paclitaxel (80 mg/m2-D1D8D15) plus ramucirumab (8 mg/kg- or 12 mg/kg-Q2W). The primary objective was progression-free survival (PFS) of 12 mg/kg-Q2W arm versus placebo from RAINBOW using meta-analysis. Relative to the registered dose, exploratory dosing regimens (EDRs) led to higher ramucirumab serum concentrations in both studies. EDR safety profiles were consistent with previous studies. In JVDB, serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the 8 mg/kg-D1D8-Q3W arm versus the registered dose; 6 mg/kg-QW EDR had a higher incidence of bleeding/hemorrhage. In JVCZ, PFS was improved with the 12 mg/kg plus paclitaxel combination versus placebo in RAINBOW; however, no significant PFS improvement was observed between the 12 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg arms.

However, little is known about which groups among the general population have been most affected. METHODS: A convenience sampling strategy via online advertising recruited 3046 adults between 19 August 2020 and 2 October 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19-related symptoms, COVID-19 testing, self-medication and prescribed medications were recorded. Serum anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid immunoglobulin G antibodies were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using cluster-corrected and adjusted Poisson's regression models. RESULTS: A crude positivity rate among asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals was estimated at 29.10%, with maximum possible seroprevalence of 44.82% corrected by test characteristics and an antibody decay rate of 32.31%. Regression models demonstrated a strong association towards marginalized low-income and vulnerable residents with limited access to health care.

METHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospective international registry comprising 109 consecutive patients (age 64a?a?16a?years; 62% male) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and noncontrast chest CT imaging. Using semi-automated software, we quantified the burden (%) of lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. EAT volume (mL) and attenuation (Hounsfield units) were measured using deep learning software. The primary outcome was clinical deterioration (intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor therapy) or in-hospital death. RESULTS: In multivariable linear regression analysis adjusted for patient comorbidities, the total burden of COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with EAT volume (?a?=a?10.6, pa?=a?0.005) and EAT attenuation (?a?=a?5.2, pa?=a?0.004). EAT volume correlated with serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (ra?=a?0.361, pa?=a?0.001) and C-reactive protein (ra?=a?0.450, pa?<a?0.001). Clinical deterioration or death occurred in 23 (21.1%) patients at a median of 3a?days (IQR 1-13a?days) following the chest CT. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, EAT volume (OR 5.1 [95% CI 1.8-14.1] per doubling pa?=a?0.011) and EAT attenuation (OR 3.4 [95% CI 1.5-7.5] per 5 Hounsfield unit increase, pa?=a?0.003) were independent predictors of clinical deterioration or death, as was total pneumonia burden (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.6, pa?=a?0.002), chronic lung disease (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1-1.7], pa?=a?0.011), and history of heart failure (OR 3.5 [95% 1.1-8.2], pa?=a?0.037).

No studies have used complementary imaging techniques, including molecular imaging, to elucidate this. Objective: We used multimodality imaging and biochemical sampling in vivo to identify the pathobiology of acute COVID19. Design, Setting and Participants: Consecutive patients presenting with acute COVID19 were recruited during hospital admission in a prospective cross sectional study. Imaging involved computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA - identified coronary disease), cardiac 2deoxy2[fluorine18]fluoroDglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F FDG PET/CT identified vascular, cardiac and pulmonary inflammatory cell infiltration) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR identified myocardial disease), alongside biomarker sampling. Results: Of 33 patients (median age 51 years, 94% male), 24 (73%) had respiratory symptoms, with the remainder having non-specific viral symptoms. Nine patients (35%, n=9/25) had CMR defined myocarditis. 53% (n=5/8) of these patients had myocardial inflammatory cell infiltration. Two patients (5%) had elevated troponin levels. Cardiac troponin concentrations were not significantly higher in patients with myocarditis (8.4ng/L [IQR 4.0, 55.3] vs 3.5ng/L [2.5, 5.5], p=0.07) or myocardial cell infiltration (4.4ng/L [3.4, 8.3] vs 3.5ng/L [2.8, 7.2], p=0.89).

Antibiotic challenges for resistant bacteria in neonates pose challenges of unknown dosing and side effects. We report two antenatally diagnosed CP-CRE colonization scenarios with the NDM 1 gene. The case involves extreme preterm twins who had worsening respiratory distress at birth requiring ventilator support, with the first twin also having cardiovascular instability. They were screened for CP-CRE, and a polymyxin antibiotic commenced. In the delivery room, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the follow-up clinic, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary group, contact precautions and isolation procedures were instituted. None of the infants exhibited infection with CP-CRE. Consolidating knowledge with regard to CP-CRE and modifying human behavior associated with its spread can mitigate potential negative consequences. This relates to now and later, when travel and prolific human to human contact resumes, from endemic countries, after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Standardized efforts to curb the acquisition of this infection would be judicious given the challenges of treatment and continued emerging antibiotic resistance. Simple infection control measures involving contact precautions, staff education and parental cohorting can be useful and cost-effective in preventing transmission. Attention to NICU specific measures, including screening of at-risk mothers (invitro fertilization conception) and their probands, careful handling of breastmilk, judicious antibiotic choice and duration of treatment, is warranted. What does this study add? CP-CRE is a nosocomial infection with increasing incidence globally, and a serious threat to public health, making it likely that these cases will present with greater frequency to the NICU team. Only a few similar cases have been reported in the neonatal literature. Current published guidelines provide a framework for general hospital management. Still, they are not specific to the NICU experience and the need to manage the parents' exposure and the infants.

The key residues for binding are identified through site-directed mutagenesis. Structural modeling revealed that MERS-4 binds to RBD only in the up position in the S trimer.

Fast and efficient teaching in a digital format poses a great challenge for medical students and lecturers as well as the universities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to capture the readiness of medical students and faculty members to participate in rapidly- evolving online education. METHODS: This cross-sectional study is based on two questionnaires distributed among medical students and associate deans for education in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Questions included decision- making questions, categorical questions, and open-ended questions, all addressing the frequency and format of the digital education offered, the perceived quality of digital education, and medical student satisfaction with digital education. Questions about missing content and areas for improvement from the perspectives of medical students were included. The associate deans were asked for their opinions about the impact of the pandemic on teaching, the organizational setup and implementation of digital education by universities, and plans for future initiatives. RESULTS: Three thousand and thirty medical students (m = 752 and f = 2245) from 53 universities participated in the study. The study showed that 92% of students were affected by the pandemic, and 19% of the students viewed the changes as entirely negative. 97% of the medical students were able to participate in digital courses, but only 4% were able to learn exclusively online. For 77% of the medical students, digital offerings accounted for over 80% of the education offered. In terms of content, medical students complained about a lack of practical teaching, such as contact with patients, lecturers, fellow medical students, and a poor perceived quality of teaching due to dubbing, frequent changeover of seminars, problem-oriented learning groups and in-person teaching, a lack of interaction possibilities and a lack of technical equipment, such as lecturers knowledge and server capacities, at the universities. Overall, almost half of the medical students (42%) rated the implementation of digital teaching at their universities as good or very good. Forty-one of the 53 associate deans responded to the questionnaire, and 35 felt medical education was influenced by the pandemic. The associate deans (80%; 33/41) felt that the digitalization of medical education was negatively influenced by the pandemic. Only 44% (18/41) felt that their universities were well or very well positioned for digital teaching. All the associate deans believe that digital teaching in medicine will continue after the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In the German-speaking world, the rapid conversion of medical teaching to a digital format has been well implemented in many cases. The perceived quality of the implementation of digital education still lacks practical relevance and the use of new digital media, such as learning games, VR, and online question time.

The results showed a correlation between total iron content and strength of pigmentation, which was further corroborated by ferritin iron quantification. To ask if the observed increase in iron body content along with increased pigment deposition could be generalizable, we crossed yellow and ebony alleles causing light and dark pigmentation, respectively, into similar genetic backgrounds and measured their metallomes. Iron remained unaffected in the various mutants providing no support for a causative link between pigmentation and iron content.

These asymptomatic patients on admission accounted for a small proportion of all patients (5.54%) with relatively weak transmissibility, and the detection rate was 0.35 per 100 close contacts. Moreover, the dynamics of symptoms of the 307 patients showed that the interval from symptom remission to the final negativity of viral nucleic acid was 5.0 days (IQR 2.0 to 11.0 days), with 14 patients (4.56%) having re-detectable viral RNA after discharge. Together, our findings suggested asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic patients only accounted for a small proportion of COVID-19. Also, the asymptomatic phase in during recovery of COVID-19 urged that negativity in viral RNA is necessary as de-isolation criteria and follow-up is recommended.","output":"Asymptomatic patients and asymptomatic phases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a population-based surveillance study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clostridium paraputrificum is an extremely rare species and constitutes only 1% of all clostridium infections in literature.

The factors driving SARS-CoV-2 fitness and evolution in the human respiratory tract remain poorly defined. Here, we provide evidence that both viral and host factors co-operate to shape SARS-CoV-2 genotypic and phenotypic change. Through viral whole-genome sequencing, we explored the evolution of two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 during passage in unmodified Vero-derived cell lines and in parallel, in well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) cultures. We identify a consistent, rich genetic diversity arising in vitro, variants of which could rapidly rise to near-fixation with 2 passages. Within isolates, SARS-CoV-2 evolution was dependent on host cells, with Vero-derived cells facilitating more profound genetic changes. However, most mutations were not shared between strains. Furthermore, comparison of both Vero-grown isolates on WD-PNECs disclosed marked growth attenuation mapping to the loss of the polybasic cleavage site (PBCS) in Spike while the strain with mutations in NSP12 (T293I), Spike (P812R) and a truncation of ORF7a remained viable in WD-PNECs.

The results suggested that there may be two peaks in the probability of SARS transmission, the first occurring around day 2 after symptom onset and the second occurring approximately 10 days after symptom onset. Index patients who were aged 60 years or older or whose lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated upon admission to the hospital (indicating higher viral loads) were more likely to transmit SARS to their contacts. There was little variation in the daily transmission probabilities before versus after the introduction of public health interventions on or around March 26, 2003.

Lubricants with different wax-oil combinations were prepared using beeswax, paraffin wax, olive oil, and mineral oil. In-vivo friction measurements involving seven participants were conducted by sliding a polydimethylsiloxane ball against the volar forearms to simulate the skin-PPE interface. The maximum static coefficient of friction was measured immediately and four hours after lubricant application. It was found that the coefficient of friction of wax-oil lubricants is mainly governed by the ratio of wax to oil and the thermal stability and morphology of the wax. To maintain long-term lubricity, it is crucial to consider the absorption of oil into the PPE material. The best performing lubricant is a mixture of 20 wt% beeswax, 40 wt% olive oil, and 40 wt% mineral oil, which compared to unlubricated skin, provides 87% (P = 0.0006) and 59% (P = 0.0015) reduction in instantaneous and 4-h coefficient of friction, respectively.","output":"Wax-oil lubricants to reduce the shear between skin and PPE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objective: To assess the prevalence of several impairing behavioral health domains in stable patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) through the use of computer adaptive testing and the association among the domains, standard assessments, and ED utilization. Methods: This was a single-center observational study of 828 randomly selected adult patients presenting to the ED from May 2019 to March 2020. The main outcomes of interest were the self-administered, validated computer adaptive assessments of suicidality, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance abuse using computer adaptive testing, the CAT-MHTM. We estimated the association among the CAT-MHTM subscales, standard assessments, and the number of ED visits in the year prior and 30 days after enrollment. Results: The proportion of those who scored above the threshold of low/mild risk were: 24.1% (suicidality), 8.3% (depression), 16.5% (anxiety), 12.3% (PTSD), and 20.4% (substance use). While the CAT-MHTM subscales were highly correlated with other self-report assessments, they were not highly associated with standard ED assessments of suicidality. When examining associations with ED use, for example, individuals who had two or more ED visits in the prior year had 51% increased odds of being in the intermediate-high suicide risk category (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.03-2.23) compared to those with zero prior ED visits. Conclusion: The CAT-MHTM can document the high prevalence of mental health conditions in the ED, which were missed by standard ED practices.

Pneumonia and systemic inflammation contribute to its high mortality. Many viruses use heparan sulfate proteoglycans as coreceptors for viral entry, and heparanase (HPSE) is a known regulator of both viral entry and inflammatory cytokines. We evaluated the heparanase inhibitor Roneparstat, a modified heparin with minimum anticoagulant activity, in pathophysiology and therapy for COVID-19. We found that Roneparstat significantly decreased the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and retroviruses (human T-lymphotropic virus 1 [HTLV-1] and HIV-1) in vitro. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients revealed a marked increase in HPSE gene expression in CD68(+) macrophages compared to healthy controls. Elevated levels of HPSE expression in macrophages correlated with the severity of COVID-19 and the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes, including IL6, TNF, IL1B, and CCL2. In line with this finding, we found a marked induction of HPSE and numerous inflammatory cytokines in human macrophages challenged with SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein. Treatment with Roneparstat significantly attenuated SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein-mediated inflammatory cytokine release from human macrophages, through disruption of NF-B signaling. HPSE knockdown in a macrophage cell line also showed diminished inflammatory cytokine production during S1 protein challenge. Taken together, this study provides a proof of concept that heparanase is a target for SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathogenesis and that Roneparstat may serve as a dual-targeted therapy to reduce viral infection and inflammation in COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The complex pathogenesis of COVID-19 consists of two major pathological phases: an initial infection phase elicited by SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication and an inflammation phase that could lead to tissue damage, which can evolve into acute respiratory failure or even death. While the development and deployment of vaccines are ongoing, effective therapy for COVID-19 is still urgently needed. In this study, we explored HPSE blockade with Roneparstat, a phase I clinically tested HPSE inhibitor, in the context of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Treatment with Roneparstat showed wide-spectrum anti-infection activities against SARS-CoV-2, HTLV-1, and HIV-1 in vitro. In addition, HPSE blockade with Roneparstat significantly attenuated SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein-induced inflammatory cytokine release from human macrophages through disruption of NF-B signaling. Together, this study provides a proof of principle for the use of Roneparstat as a dual-targeting therapy for COVID-19 to decrease viral infection and dampen the proinflammatory immune response mediated by macrophages.","output":"Heparanase Blockade as a Novel Dual-Targeting Therapy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant disruption to patients with chronic illnesses. We explored the emotional state, perception, and concerns of Saudi patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the crisis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey from 30 March to 5 April, 2020 using a pre-designed questionnaire distributed through social media platforms to IBD patients. The five-part questionnaire included an assessment of psychological wellbeing using a previously validated Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which includes domains for anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). A logistic regression analysis was used to uncover possible associations between patient characteristics and anxiety and depression. RESULTS: The data from 1156 IBD patients were analyzed. Normal, borderline, and HADS-A scores consistent with a diagnosis of anxiety were reported by 423 (36.6%), 174 (15.1%), and 559 (48.4%) patients, respectively. However, 635 (69%) patients had normal scores and 273 (30.1%) had borderline HADS-D scores; no patients reported scores consistent with depression. Based on a multiple logistic regression analysis, patients educated till a high school diploma (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 0.09C6.05, P = 0.03) and that had indeterminate colitis (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.27C3.89, P = 0.005) were more likely to express anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients expressed symptoms of anxiety, although not depression. Female patients, patients educated till a high school diploma, and those with indeterminate colitis were more likely to have anxiety.

Epitope stability, another issue to be solved when achieving herd immunity, is important. Mutation in the viral structure will call upon other sets of neutralizing antibodies and hence for other herd immunity type installment. The societal tactics to achieve the much-needed herd immunity should be developed keeping in mind the welfare of the population.

Glucapridase, the recommended therapy, is expensive and not always available. CASE SERIES We describe 3 cases (69, 67, 73 years) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who developed AKI and early-onset severely delayed MTX elimination after HD-MTX. MTX serum concentrations were 101 and 69 mol/L at 24 h after administration in two patients and 34 mol/L at 32 h in the third. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME Since glucarpidase was unavailable, we performed daily high-flux hemodialysis (HF-HD) or online hemodiafiltration (HDF) sessions (median duration, 6 h). The median serum MTX elimination half-life during HDF/HF-HD sessions was similar in all patients (median, 4.4 h; IQR, 3.8-5.3 h), but serum MTX concentrations rebounded after each dialysis by a median of 40% of the trough concentrations. The three patients underwent multiple dialysis sessions, until MTX serum concentrations remained sufficiently low to be neutralized by leucovorin. Only 1 patient developed severe pancytopenia, and renal function normalized in all patients after 3-6 weeks.

However, the effect of canakinumab on the total number of cardiovascular events, including recurrent events collected after a first event, is unknown. OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine whether randomly allocated canakinumab would reduce the total burden of serious cardiovascular events. METHODS We randomized 10,061 patients to placebo or canakinumab 50 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg once every 3 months and compared the rates of the composite of all serious cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular death) in active versus placebo groups. We used negative binomial regression to account for correlations among repeated events in the same person and to estimate rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS During a median of 3.7 years of follow-up, 3,417 total serious cardiovascular events occurred in 2,003 individuals among the 10,061 unique patients randomized. Canakinumab reduced the rates of total serious cardiovascular events, with rates per 100 person-years in the placebo, 50 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg canakinumab groups of 10.4, 8.4, 8.3, and 8.2, respectively. The corresponding rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) compared with placebo were 0.80 (0.69 to 0.93) for 50 mg, 0.79 (0.68 to 0.92) for 150 mg, and 0.78 (0.67 to 0.91) for 300 mg.

Direct comparison of several types of Au NPs possessing different surface species and serving as seeds in Au-AgNSs synthesis is the main objective of this paper. Borohydride-reduced (with varying stages of borohydride hydrolysis) and citrate-reduced Au NPs were prepared and used as seeds in Au-AgNSs generation.

In pregnancy, proning requires careful attention to often overlooked physiologic changes in pregnancy and additional technical challenges accompanying a gravid abdomen. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a proning technique that was successfully used at our institution to avoid premature delivery of the fetus while improving maternal outcomes. All technical challenges are addressed in the instructional videos using a pregnant model with twin gestation at 32 weeks. METHODS: We reviewed all the patients' charts with positive SARS-CoV-2 from March 2020 until July 2020 and identified those who developed ARDS. Subsequently, we identified four patients that were proned during the antepartum period. We described their clinical course, including the change in ventilatory parameters in relationship with proning timing. Stepwise instructions for self-proning and proning in mechanically ventilated patients are illustrated in video format. RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 100 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mechanical ventilation was required in 8 of these patients. In four cases, proning was performed during the antepartum period. We were able to improve the P/F ratio while decreasing FiO2 and avoiding iatrogenic preterm delivery. Except for one case, where the patient self-extubated and required emergent delivery, all patients were successfully extubated, followed for prenatal care, and delivered for usual obstetric indications. CONCLUSION: Proning remains a well-proven intervention in ARDS and should be considered in pregnant women when indicated. We recognize that proning might not be effective in all cases. However, proning positioning is an option to improve oxygenation in patients with severe hypoxemia when the next consideration is delivery of a premature infant or maternal cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","output":"Proning modus operandi in pregnancies complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the trading patterns of Australian retail investors during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Modern neo-liberal societies have sought to enhance healthcare through greater professional regulation, albeit in different ways and at variable pace. This general trend is illustrated with reference to medicine in the UK. However, although such reforms have helpfully cascaded to other health professions, government policy in high-income countries has not yet adequately regulated the interrelated group of non-professionalised health support workers who form the largest and least recognised part of the workforce. Nonetheless, in low- and middle-income (LMIC) countriesaside from the greater need for regulation of health professionsthere is even more of an imperative to regulate the disparate, largely invisible support workforce. METHODS: With reference to existing studies of the medical and wider health professions in the UK and selected other higher income societies, the importance of health professional regulation to the public is underlined in the Global North. The larger gap in the regulation of support workers in modern neo-liberal countries is also emphasised on a similar basis, with an increasingly ageing population and advances in healthcare. It is argued from the very limited patchwork of secondary literature, though, that policy-makers may want to focus even more on enhancing regulation of both the professional and non-professional workforce in LMIC societies centred mainly in the Global South, drawing on lessons from the Global North. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reform health professional regulatory approaches in more economically developed countries, while needing refinement, are likely to have had a positive effect. However, even in these societies there are still substantial shortfalls in the regulation of health support workers. There are even larger gaps in LMICs where there are fewer health professional staff and a greater dependence on support workers. With higher rates of morbidity and mortality, there is much more scope here for reforming health regulation in the public interest to extend standards and mitigate risk, following the pattern for healthcare professions in the Global North.","output":"The regulation of healthcare professions and support workers in international context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In our study, we aim to evaluate in terms of patients the quality and reliability of the most relevant and most-watched videos uploaded on YouTube about pancreatic cancer.

This endeavor describes generation of murine derived recombinant single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) as a monoclonal antibody (MAb) platform targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. A specific synthesized RBD coding sequence was cloned and expressed in Baculovirus expression system. The recombinant RBD (rRBD) was ascertained to be at the proper encoding size of  600bp and expressed protein of the molecular weight of  21KDa. Purified rRBD was proved genuinely antigenic and immunogenic, exhibiting specific reactivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and inducing strong seroconversion in immunized mice. The scFv phage display library against rRBD was successfully constructed, revealing  90% recombination frequency, and great enriching factor reaching 88% and 25% in polyclonal Ab-based and MAb-based ELISAs, respectively. Typically, three unique scFvs were generated, selected, purified and molecularly identified. That was manifested by their: accurate structure, close relation to the mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, right anchored six complementarily-determining regions (CDRs) as three within variable heavy (vH) and variable light (vL) regions each, and proper configuration of the three-dimensional (3D) structure.

Moreover, the purified scFvs showed authentic immunoreactivity and specificity to both rRBD and SARS-CoV-2 in western blot and ELISA. Accordingly, these developed scFvs platform might be a functional candidate for research, inexpensive diagnostics and therapeutics, mitigating spread of COVID-19.","output":"Generation and utility of a single-chain variable fragment monoclonal antibody platform against a baculovirus expressed recombinant receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, we discuss the future of digital contact tracing systems and the evolving role of cryptography in this regard.

Unlike many prior studies that concentrate on labour market determinants of migration, we place the subjective well-being (SWB) reported by each partner at centre stage. We test whether migration determinants differ depending on whether the female is the main breadwinner in a dual-earner couple. We also test if determinants differ when either the female or the male is the sole earner within a couple. The evidence shows that a couple is more likely to migrate if she reports low SWB in the year prior to migration, with the strength of this effect varying depending on the earnings status of each partner prior to migration. Male SWB does not have the same impact on the migration choice although we find some evidence that pre-migration male wages impact the migration decision.","output":"Migration of dual-earner couples: a subjective wellbeing approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated innovations in data collection protocols, including use of virtual or remote visits. Although developmental scientists used virtual visits prior to COVID-19, validation of virtual assessments of infant socioemotional and language development are lacking. We aimed to fill this gap by validating a virtual visit protocol that assesses mother and infant behavior during the Still Face Paradigm (SFP) and infant receptive and expressive communication using the Bayley-III Screening Test. Validation was accomplished through comparisons of data (i.e., proportions of missing data for a given task; observed infant and maternal behaviors) collected during in-person laboratory visits and virtual visits conducted via Zoom. Of the 119 mother-infant dyads who participated, 73 participated in lab visits only, 13 participated in virtual visits only, and 33 dyads participated in a combination of lab and virtual visits across four time points (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Maternal perspectives of, and preferences for, virtual visits were also assessed. Proportions of missing data were higher during virtual visits, particularly for assessments of infant receptive communication. Nonetheless, comparisons of virtual and laboratory visits within a given time point (3, 6, or 9 months) indicated that mothers and infants showed similar proportions of facial expressions, vocalizations and directions of gaze during the SFP and infants showed similar and expected patterns of behavioral change across SFP episodes. Infants also demonstrated comparable expressive and receptive communicative abilities across virtual and laboratory assessments. Maternal reports of ease and preference for virtual visits varied by infant age, with mothers of 12-month-old infants reporting, on average, less ease of virtual visits and a preference for in-person visits. Results are discussed in terms of feasibility and validity of virtual visits for assessing infant socioemotional and language development, and broader advantages and disadvantages of virtual visits are also considered.","output":"Zoom, Zoom, Baby!

Many nations, including Italy, took extreme actions to reduce the diffusion of the virus, profoundly changing lifestyles. The Italians have been faced with both the fear of contracting the infection and the consequences of enforcing social distancing. This study was aimed to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the psychopathological outcomes related to the first phase of this emergency. Methods: The study included 2291 respondents. An online survey collected information on socio-demographic variables, history of direct or indirect contact with COVID-19, and additional information concerning the COVID-19 emergency. Moreover, psychopathological symptoms such as anxiety, mood alterations and post-traumatic symptomatology were assessed. Results: The results revealed that respectively 31.38%, 37.19% and 27.72% of respondents reported levels of general psychopathological symptomatology, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms over the cut-off scores. Furthermore, a significant worsening of mood has emerged. Being a female or under the age of 50 years, having had direct contact with people infected by the COVID-19, and experiencing uncertainty about the risk of contagion represent risk factors for psychological distress. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic appear to impact not only on physical health but also on psychological well-being. Although these results need to be considered with caution being based on self-reported data collected at the beginning of this emergency, they should be used as a starting point for further studies aimed to develop interventions to minimize both the brief and long-term psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The Enemy Which Sealed the World: Effects of COVID-19 Diffusion on the Psychological State of the Italian Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN: Los coronavirus son una familia de virus que se encuentran ampliamente distribuidos en la naturaleza en animales y humanos.

However, a retrospective surveillance study identified six children who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in one of three central Wuhan hospitals between January 7th and January 15th. Given that Wuhan has over 395 other hospitals, there may have been far more severe pediatric cases than reported. There were six and 43 children out of 336 who tested positive for COVID-19 and influenza, respectively among all pediatric admissions during the 9-day period. By using this ratio in a detailed analysis of influenza surveillance data and COVID-19 epidemic dynamics (see Appendix), we estimate that there were 313 [95% CI: 171-520] children hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan during January 7-15, 2020 (Figure). Under an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days4, we estimate that there were 1105 [95% CI: 592, 1829] cumulative pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations prior to the January 23rd lockdown, which far surpasses the 425 confirmed cases reported across all age groups, none of which were children under age 15. Children are strikingly absent from COVID-19 reports and limited data suggest that pediatric infections are overwhelmingly mild5. Thus, our estimates for hundreds of severe pediatric cases likely translates to thousands or even tens of thousands of mildly infected children, suggesting that the force of infection from children may be grossly underestimated and the infection fatality rate overestimated from confirmed case counts alone.

Up-regulation of TGF- in serum/peritoneal fluid and increased levels of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 in endometriotic tissues are frequently observed in patients with endometriosis. However, the mechanisms underlying how TGF-/TGF- receptor and OCT4 affect endometriotic cell migration still remain largely unknown. Therefore, endometriotic tissue with high cell migratory capacity were collected from patients with adenomyotic myometrium (n = 23) and chocolate cyst (n = 24); and endometrial tissue with low cell migratory capacity in normal endometrium or hyperplastic endometrium (n = 8) were collected as the controls. We found the mRNA levels of TGF- receptor I (TGF- RI) and OCT4 were significantly higher in the high-migratory ectopic endometriotic tissues than those of the low-migratory normal or hyperplastic endometrium. Positive correlations between TGF- RI and OCT4, and either TGF- RI or OCT4 with migration-related genes (SNAIL, SLUG and TWIST) regarding the mRNA levels were observed in human endometriotic tissues. TGF-I dose-dependently increased the gene and protein levels of OCT4, SNAIL and N-Cadherin (N-CAD) and silencing of endogenous OCT4 significantly suppressed the TGF-I-induced expressions of N-CAD and SNAIL in primary human endometriotic stromal cells and human endometrial carcinoma cell lines RL95-2 and HEC1A. Furthermore, TGF-I significantly increased the migration ability of endometriotic cells and silencing of OCT4 dramatically suppressed the TGF-I-induced cell migration activity evidenced by wound-closure assay, transwell assay, and confocal image of F-actin cellular distribution. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that the niche TGF- plays a critical role in initiating expressions of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 which may contribute to the ectopic endometrial growth by stimulating endometrial cell migration.

The presence of several subtypes of the coronavirus and the genetic differences in the populations could condition that variation. Thus, the objective of this study was to propose variants in genes that encode proteins related to the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells as possible targets for genetic associations studies. METHODS: The allelic frequencies of the polymorphisms in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11A, cathepsin L (CTSL), and elastase (ELANE) genes were obtained in four populations from the American, African, European, and Asian continents reported in the 1000 Genome Project. Moreover, we evaluated the potential biological effect of these variants using different web-based tools. RESULTS: In the coding sequences of these genes, we detected one probably-damaging polymorphism located in the TMPRSS2 gene (rs12329760) that produces a change of amino acid. Furthermore, forty-eight polymorphisms with possible functional consequences were detected in the non-coding sequences of the following genes: three in ACE2, seventeen in TMPRSS2, ten in TMPRSS11A, twelve in ELANE, and six in CTSL. These polymorphisms produce binding sites for transcription factors and microRNAs. The minor allele frequencies of these polymorphisms vary in each community; indeed, some of them are high in specific populations.

Here, we detail how laparoscopic total colectomy can be safely performed within the constraints of such single site operating. METHODS Three patients (2 males and 1 female; mean age, 28.3 y; mean body mass index, 24.1 kg/m) requiring urgent total colectomy with end ileostomy for colitis resistant to medical therapy fully consented to have their operation performed by a single-port laparoscopic approach. The single port was placed at the site marked preoperatively for the end ileostomy. The operation commenced with rectosigmoid transection and proceeded with a close pericolic dissection proximally along the colon to the cecum. The resected colon was withdrawn via the port site and the end ileostomy fashioned within this wound. RESULTS The operation was safely completed in its entirety without additional abdominal access in each case. Mean operative time was 206 minutes. All patients are well with normal stoma appearance and function at a minimum follow-up of 4 months. CONCLUSION Judicious patient selection and considered operative technique allow major resectional colonic surgery to be safely performed solely by a single-port technique. Proof of clinical benefit along with refined instrumentation is required if such surgery is to progress from anecdotal reports to mainstream practice.","output":"Single-port laparoscopic total colectomy for medically uncontrolled colitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, human service professionals, like social workers, experience significant job demands (JD) which can lead to outcomes like psychological distress, burnout, and high turnover rates. This is especially true in China, where the social work profession has grown substantially in recent decades. Because social workers play a crucial role in supporting vulnerable communities, there is a need to understand how their work conditions affect outcomes like psychological distress. This study applies the job demands and resources (JD-R) model to study this relation, along with the mediational effects of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), in social workers from Chengdu, China (n = 897). The results of structural equation modeling indicate that JD-R differentially affect psychological distress. PA and NA partially mediate these relations. Job resources (JR) reduced psychological distress by reducing NA and increasing PA. JD did not have any effect on PA but significantly increased NA, which was associated with higher psychological distress. The magnitudes of each estimate suggest that JR has a greater effect on PA and NA, relative to the effects of JD on PA and NA. Interventions that seek to promote PA and reduce NA may be able to work with existing JR to buffer against the effects of JD in social workers.","output":"Job Demands and Resources, Positive and Negative Affect, and Psychological Distress of Social Workers in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite fast-tracked research, the precise origin, transmission and evolution of COVID-19 are still unknown.

We report here a synthetic biology-based vaccine platform that employs an expression vector with an inducible Gram-negative autotransporter to express vaccine antigens on surface of genome-reduced bacteria to enhance interaction of vaccine antigen with immune system. As a proof of principle, we utilized genome-reduced E. coli to express SARS-CoV-2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) fusion peptide (FP) on the cell surface, and evaluated their use as a killed whole cell vaccine. The FP sequence is highly conserved across coronaviruses; the 6 FP core amino acid residues along with the 4 adjacent residues upstream and the 3 residues downstream the core are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV. We tested the efficacy of PEDV FP and SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccines in a PEDV challenge pig model. We demonstrated that both vaccines induced potent anamnestic responses upon virus challenge, potentiated IFN- responses, reduced viral RNA loads in jejunum tissue, and provided significant protection against clinical disease. However, neither vaccines elicited sterilizing immunity. Since SARS-CoV-2 FP and PEDV FP vaccines provided similar clinical protection, the coronavirus FP could be a target for a broadly-protective vaccine using any platform. Importantly, the genome-reduced bacterial surface-expressed vaccine platform, when using a vaccine appropriate bacterial vector, has potential utility as an inexpensive, readily manufactured, and rapid vaccine platform for other pathogens. Significance Statement We report a new vaccine platform to express vaccine antigens on surface of genome-reduced bacteria to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. We demonstrated the utility of this vaccine platform by expressing the highly conserved fusion peptide (FP) of SARS-CoV-2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus on the surface of E.coli to produce killed whole cell bacterial vaccines. The vaccine primes a potent anamnestic response, potentiates IFN- responses, and provides significant protection in pigs against disease following virus challenge. The FP could be a target for a broadly-protective coronavirus vaccine since a Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccine provided cross-protection against Alphacoronavirus PEDV. When using a vaccine appropriate bacteria vector, this inexpensive new vaccine platform offers the potential for use in developing countries.","output":"Killed whole genome-reduced bacteria surface-expressed coronavirus fusion peptide vaccines protect against disease in a porcine model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Mechanical thrombectomy, in addition to intravenous thrombolysis, has become standard in acute ischemic stroke treatment in patients with large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation. However, previous randomized controlled stroke trials were not focused on patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms. Thus, there are limited data for patient selection, prediction of clinical outcome, and occurrence of complications in this patient population. The purpose of this analysis was to assess clinical and interventional data in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy in case of ischemic stroke with mild-to-moderate symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected stroke data base. Inclusion criteria were anterior circulation ischemic stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy at our institution between September 2010 and October 2015 with an NIHSS score of 8. RESULTS Of 484 patients, we identified 33 (6.8%) with the following characteristics: median NIHSS = 5 (interquartile range, 4-7), median onset-to-groin puncture time = 320 minutes (interquartile range, 237-528 minutes). Recanalization (TICI = 2b-3) was achieved in 26 (78.7%) patients. Two cases of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were observed. Favorable (mRS 0-2) and moderate (mRS 0-3) clinical outcome at 90 days was achieved in 21 (63.6%) and 30 (90.9%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The clinical outcome of patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke with mild stroke due to large-vessel occlusion appears to be predominately favorable, even in a prolonged time window. However, although infrequent, angiographic complications could impair clinical outcome. Future randomized controlled trials should assess the benefit compared with the best medical treatment.","output":"Mechanical Thrombectomy in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke and Lower NIHSS Scores: Recanalization Rates, Periprocedural Complications, and Clinical Outcome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Precision medicine is already a reality in the field of oncology given that the selection and use of biomarker-driven therapies has clearly improved patient survival. Furthermore, a new, minimally invasive strategy termed 'liquid biopsy' (LB) has revolutionized the field by allowing comprehensive cancer genomic profiling through the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released into the bloodstream. However, its detection requires extremely sensitive and efficient technologies. A powerful molecular tool based on the principle of 'divide and conquer' has emerged to solve this problem. Thus, digital PCR (dPCR) allows absolute and accurate quantification of target molecules. AREAS COVERED: : In this review we will discuss the fundamentals of dPCR and the most common approaches used for partition of samples and quantification. The advantages and limitations of dPCR will be mentioned in the context of the field of LB in oncology. EXPERT OPINION: In our opinion, dPCR has proven to be one of the most sensitive methods available for LB analysis, even though some aspects such as its capacity of multiplexing and protocol standardization still require further improvements. Furthermore, the increasing sensitivities and lower costs of next generation sequencing (NGS) methods position dPCR as a confirmatory and complementary technique for NGS results which will likely prove very useful for treatment monitoring and assessing minimal residual disease.","output":"dPCR application in liquid biopsies: divide and conquer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Public attitudes towards COVID-19 and social distancing are critical in reducing its spread. It is therefore important to understand public reactions, information dissemination and consensus building in all major forms, including social media.

Findings: The main themes identified for the 87 qualifying tweets accounting for 14 million retweets were: lockdown life; attitude towards social restrictions; politics; safety messages; people with COVID-19; support for key workers; work; and COVID-19 facts/news. Research limitations/implications: Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through unofficial tweets. Users shared social distancing information, helped build support for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed support for key workers, and helped each other to cope with social isolation. A few popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that government messages sometimes failed. Practical implications: Public health campaigns in future may consider encouraging grass roots social web activity to support campaign goals. At a methodological level, analysing retweet counts emphasised politics and ignored practical implementation issues.

HIV care is vital for viral suppression but is hindered by transphobia and HIV stigma. We assessed HIV care outcomes among transgender persons (TG) with HIV in the United States. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of peer-reviewed journal articles. METHODS We searched multiple electronic databases and CDC's HIV Prevention Research Synthesis database for 2006-September 2018. Eligible reports were US-based studies that included TG and reported HIV care outcomes. Random-effects models were used to calculate HIV care outcome rates. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018079564). RESULTS Few studies reported outcomes for TM; therefore, only TW meta-analysis results are reported. Twenty-one studies were identified having low-to-medium risk-of-bias scores. Among TW with HIV, 82% had ever received HIV care; 72% were receiving care, and 83% of those were retained in HIV care. Sixty-two percent were currently virally suppressed. Among those receiving HIV care or antiretroviral therapy (ART), 67% were virally suppressed at last test. Sixty-five percent were linked to HIV care 3 months after diagnosis. Seventy-one percent had ever been prescribed ART. Approximately 66% were taking ART, and 66% were ART-adherent. Only 56% were currently adherent the previous year. CONCLUSIONS HIV care outcomes for TW were not ideal, and research gaps exists for TM. High heterogeneity was observed; therefore, caution should be taken interpreting the findings.

Therefore, this study aims to validate the correlation between CSVD and cognitive impairment in neurosyphilis presenting with ischemic stroke. METHODS: We enrolled 179 neurosyphilis patients diagnosed as acute ischemic stroke and performed a 12\\\\month cognitive assessment follow\\\\up. CSVD burden was evaluated by neuroimaging markers, including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), and perivascular spaces (PVS). We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the association between cognitive decline and total CSVD burden score in neurosyphilis patients. RESULTS: The neurosyphilis participants had a significantly higher total CSVD score and lower cognitive function score compared with the syphilis\\\\uninfected patients. Acute cognitive impairment was associated with total CSVD score, extensive microbleeds, and Grade 3 WMHs. After 12\\\\month follow\\\\up, the poor prognosis of post\\\\stroke cognitive impairment was associated with a higher burden of CSVD and extensive microbleeds.

Community health and well-being may be impacted in neighborhoods with high proportions of people engaged in precarious work situations compounded by health inequities produced by other social determinants associated with their residential geography. However, little is known about how community residents experience work at the neighborhood level nor how work impacts health at the community-level, particularly in communities with a high proportion of residents engaged in precarious work. We sought to understand, through participatory research strategies, how work is experienced at the community level and to identify community interventions to establish a culture of healthy work. As part of a mixed-methods community health assessment, community researchers conducted focus groups with residents in two high social and economic hardship neighborhoods on Chicagos southwest side. Community and academic researchers engaged in participatory data analysis and developed and implemented member-checking modules to engage residents in the data interpretation process. Twelve focus group discussions (77 community resident participants) were completed.

Mortality due to ARDS remains very high and even in the case of survival, acute lung injury can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a significant role in these processes. The activities of RAS molecules are subject to dynamic changes in response to an injury. Initially, increased levels of angiotensin (Ang) II and des-Arg9-bradykinin (DABK), are necessary for an effective defense. Later, augmented angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 activity supposedly helps to attenuate inflammation. Appropriate ACE2 activity might be decisive in preventing immune-induced damage and ensuring tissue repair. ACE2 has been identified as a common target for different pathogens. Some Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, also use ACE2 to infiltrate the cells. A number of questions remain unresolved. The importance of ACE2 shedding, associated with the release of soluble ACE2 and ADAM17-mediated activation of tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;)-signaling is unclear. The roles of other non-classical RAS-associated molecules, e.g., alamandine, Ang A or Ang 1-9, also deserve attention. In addition, the impact of established RAS-inhibiting drugs on the pulmonary RAS is to be elucidated. The unfavorable prognosis of ARDS and the lack of effective treatment urge the search for novel therapeutic strategies. In the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and considering the involvement of humoral disbalance in the pathogenesis of ARDS, targeting the renin-angiotensin system and reducing the pathogen's cell entry could be a promising therapeutic strategy in the struggle against COVID-19.","output":"Renin-Angiotensin System: An Important Player in the Pathogenesis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most threatening pandemics in human history. As of the date of this analysis, it had claimed about 2 million lives worldwide, and the number is rising sharply. Governments, societies, and scientists are equally challenged under this burden. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to map global coronavirus research in 2020 according to various influencing factors to highlight incentives or necessities for further research. METHODS: The application of established and advanced bibliometric methods combined with the visualization technique of density-equalizing mapping provided a global picture of incentives and efforts on coronavirus research in 2020. Countries funding patterns and their epidemiological and socioeconomic characteristics as well as their publication performance data were included. RESULTS: Research output exploded in 2020 with momentum, including citation and networking parameters. China and the United States were the countries with the highest publication performance. Globally, however, publication output correlated significantly with COVID-19 cases. Research funding has also increased immensely. CONCLUSIONS: Nonetheless, the abrupt decline in publication efforts following previous coronavirus epidemics should demonstrate to global researchers that they should not lose interest even after containment, as the next epidemiological challenge is certain to come. Validated reporting worldwide and the inclusion of low-income countries are additionally important for a successful future research strategy.","output":"The Pandemic Year 2020: World Map of Coronavirus Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze the clinical symptoms and types of disc displacement of patients with anterior disc displacement (ADD) of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and to explore the correlation between chewing side preference (CSP) and the clinical symptoms and types of disc displacement of ADD patients. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of the ADD patients diagnosed by clinical symptoms and MRI findings of TMJ in the Department of Stomatology, General Hospital of Chinese PLA from January 2018 to December 2019. A total of 111 ADD patients [33 males and 78 females, aged(31.010.9) years old] were included. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had CSP: non-CSP group (n=40) and CSP group (n=71). The clinical symptoms and types of ADD were observed and recorded. According to the specific side of CSP in the CSP group, the patients were further divided into the ipsilateral side and the contralateral side of CSP. The pain, TMJ sounds and the ADD types were also observed. Chi square test was used to compare the pain, TMJ sounds, limited mouth opening and ADD types of the two groups. Binary Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between CSP and clinical symptoms and ADD characteristics. Results: The incidence of pain in the CSP group [89% (63/71)] was significantly higher than that in the non-CSP group [70% (28/40)] (P<0.05). In CSP patients, the incidences of pain and joint sounds on the ipsilateral side of CSP were significantly higher than that on the contralateral side (P<0.05). MRI showed that the incidence of bilateral ADD in the CSP group [58%(41/71)] was significantly higher than that in the non-CSP group [37%(15/40)] (P<0.05).There were significant differences in the incidences of no disc displacement (), anterior disk displacement with reduction(ADDwR) and anterior disk displacement without reduction (ADDwoR) between ipsilateral and contralateral joints of the CSP patients (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidences of no , ADDwR and ADDwoR between left and right joints of the non-CSP patients (P>0.05).

OBJECTIVE To compare accuracy between RT-PCR and computed tomography (CT) for detecting COVID-19 in the first week of its symptoms during the pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic review of comparative studies of diagnostic accuracy within the Evidence-based Health Program of a federal university in S?o Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS A systematic search of the relevant literature was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and LILACS databases, for articles published up to June 6, 2020, relating to studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of RT-PCR and chest CT for COVID-19 diagnoses. The QUADAS 2 tool was used for methodological quality evaluation. RESULTS In total, 1204 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated; 1045 had tomographic findings while 755 showed positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. RT-PCR demonstrated 81.4% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 92.3% accuracy. Chest CT demonstrated 95.3% sensitivity, 43.8% specificity and 63.3% accuracy.

Cost data to inform evidence-based priority setting are urgently needed. Consequently, in this paper, we calculate the full economic health sector costs of COVID-19 clinical management in 79 LMICs under different epidemiological scenarios. METHODS: We used country-specific epidemiological projections from a dynamic transmission model to determine number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 1 year under four mitigation scenarios. We defined the health sector response for three base LMICs through guidelines and expert opinion. We calculated costs through local resource use and price data and extrapolated costs across 79 LMICs. Lastly, we compared cost estimates against gross domestic product (GDP) and total annual health expenditure in 76 LMICs. RESULTS: COVID-19 clinical management costs vary greatly by country, ranging between <0.1%C12% of GDP and 0.4%C223% of total annual health expenditure (excluding out-of-pocket payments). Without mitigation policies, COVID-19 clinical management costs per capita range from US$43.39 to US$75.57; in 22 of 76 LMICs, these costs would surpass total annual health expenditure. In a scenario of stringent social distancing, costs per capita fall to US$1.10CUS$1.32. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first dataset of COVID-19 clinical management costs across LMICs. These costs can be used to inform decision-making on priority setting. Our results show that COVID-19 clinical management costs in LMICs are substantial, even in scenarios of moderate social distancing.

A study was carried out to further analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific aspects of clinical, training, and research activities performed by the otolaryngology residents in Spain. Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted during the last two weeks of February 2021. The study consisted of an online survey taken by otolaryngology residents who had undertaken one-year continuing training from February 15, 2020 to February 15, 2021 and consisted of 26 questions exploring the impact of the COVID-19 on the health of the ENT residents and training activities. Categorical variables were reported as frequency and percentage. When indicated, Pearsons Chi-square test (c2) with Yatess correction and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) were used. Results: 143 completed surveys were received from 264 Residents (54.17%). 36 residents (25.2%) have suffered from the disease due to SARS-CoV-2. Most of them only developed mild symptoms (86.1%), with 3 requiring hospitalization (8.3%). The origin of infection was unknown in all cases and the need for confinement was principally due to either attending an asymptomatic patient in 9 cases (6.3%) or to being in close contact with an asymptomatic person off hospital grounds in 22 (15.4%). 60.1% of the residents surveyed reported having lost more than 6 months of their training period, and in 18.8% of cases, it was as high as 10 and 12 months.

METHODS: Focus groups with health care providers of patients with CF, adolescents with CF, and caregivers of children with CF were conducted to determine what modifications were necessary. Focus group data were analyzed using a thematic analysis, and emergent themes were ranked according to desirability and technical feasibility. The mHealth platform was then modified to meet the identified needs and preferences, and the flow of patient-generated health data to a secure Research Electronic Data Capture database was tested. Protocols for data management and clinical follow-up were also developed. RESULTS: A total of 5 focus groups with 21 participants were conducted. Recommended modifications pertained to all functionalities of the mHealth platform, including tracking of symptoms, treatments, and activities of daily care; creating and organizing medication lists and setting up reminders; generating reports for the health care team; language and presentation; sharing and privacy; and settings and accounts.

These two diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years of age. Vitamin D is believed to have immunomodulatory effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems by modulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides, like cathelicidin, in response to both viral and bacterial stimuli. The aim of this review is to summarize the more recently published data with regard to potential associations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] with infectious respiratory tract diseases of childhood and the possible health benefits from vitamin D supplementation.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) is known to affect human health, causing heart and cardiovascular diseases, and it has been shown that locations with long term NO(2) pollution recorded a high number of fatalities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no ground stations monitoring emissions of NO(2) over West Africa. The present study aimed to use satellite observations to examine pollutant trends over this region. OBJECTIVE. To examine the trend of NO(2) over the entire West Africa sub region in relationship to contributions to environmental emissions using satellite-derived data. This enables the assessment of West Africa regional air pollution hot spots in relationship to enhancing atmospheric factors. The results from this study will also be useful guidance for setting air quality standards for air pollution controls to minimize health hazards. METHODS. The present study examined thirteen years of average monthly values of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) to determine the spatio-temporal variation of this pollutant over West Africa. Satellite data for NO(2) between 2005 and 2017 were used to determine the variation in pollution levels over West Africa. Correlations between NO(2) and meteorological variables (wind speed, rainfall and air temperature) were obtained to explain the influence of West African weather on the region's pollution accumulation. RESULTS. The present study observed that NO(2) concentrations varied from place to place and from season to season. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations during the dry season were higher (sometimes 200% higher) than values observed in the wet season which ranged between 0.5 and 610(15) molec/cm(2). Nitrogen dioxide north-south oscillation during the course of a year is largely controlled by the inter-tropical discontinuity (ITD) zone as high concentrations of NO(2) are found in the vicinity of the ITD where wind speeds and horizontal vorticity approaches zero. Correlation analysis between NO(2) and some atmospheric variables indicated NO(2) concentrations are well influenced by atmospheric variables showing bipolar signals depending on the season. An increasing trend of NO(2) was also found over selected cities of the region. This indicated that regional air quality is gradually deteriorating. CONCLUSIONS. The implications of worsening regional air quality were examined in the light of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. The dominant atmospheric factor determining pollution episodes in the region is the inter-tropical discontinuity line which marks the meeting point between the two wind regimes over the region. Densely populated areas are characteristically prone to elevated pollution and have experienced high fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. COMPETING INTERESTS.

Here we employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron spin resonance (ESR) to gather information on the membrane fusion mechanism promoted by two putative SARS FPs. DSC data showed the peptides strongly perturb the structural integrity of anionic vesicles and support the hypothesis that the peptides generate opposing curvature stresses on phosphatidylethanolamine membranes. ESR showed that both FPs increase lipid packing and head group ordering as well as reduce the intramembrane water content for anionic membranes. Therefore, bending moment in the bilayer could be generated, promoting negative curvature.

Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume fast mixing of the population relative to the local infection rate, similar to the regime applicable to many chemical reactions. However, in human populations, especially under different levels of quarantine conditions, this assumption is likely to fail. We develop a continuous spatial model that includes five different populations, in which the infectious population is split into latent (or pre-symptomatic) and symptomatic. Based on nearest-neighbor infection kinetics, we arrive into a \`\`reaction-diffusion'' model. Our model accounts for front propagation of the infectious population domains under partial quarantine conditions, which is present on top of the common local infection process. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. Our results demonstrate how infected domains spread outward from epicenters/hotspots, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (quasi linear or power-law) growth. Moreover, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the center of the populated area. Predicted heat-maps show remarkable similarity to recently media released heat-maps. We further demonstrate how localized strong quarantine conditions can prevent the spreading of the disease from an epicenter/hotspot, significantly reducing the number of infected people. Application of our model in different countries, using actual demographic data and infectious disease parameters, can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localizes areas.","output":"Epidemiological model for the inhomogeneous spatial spreading of COVID-19 and other diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveExplore the impact and responses to public health advice on the health and wellbeing of individuals identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) and advised to shield (not leave home for 12 weeks at start of the pandemic) in Southwest England during the first COVID-19 lockdown.

Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), which is recognized as a pancreatic manifestation of systemic immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD), is a chronic fibroinflammatory disorder driven by autoimmunity. IgG4-RD is a multi-organ autoimmune disorder characterized by elevated serum concentrations of IgG4 antibody and infiltration of IgG4-expressing plasmacytes in the affected organs. Although the immunopathogenesis of IgG4-RD and AIP has been poorly elucidated, recently, we found that activation of pDCs mediates the development of murine experimental AIP and human AIP/IgG4-RD via the production of IFN-I and interleukin-33 (IL-33). Depletion of pDCs or neutralization of signaling pathways mediated by IFN-I and IL-33 efficiently inhibited the development of experimental AIP. Furthermore, enhanced expression of IFN-I and IL-33 was observed in the pancreas and serum of human AIP/IgG4-RD. Thus, AIP and IgG4-RD share their immunopathogenesis with SLE and psoriasis because in all these conditions, IFN-I production by pDCs contributes to the pathogenesis. Because the enhanced production of IFN-I and IL-33 by pDCs promotes chronic inflammation and fibrosis characteristic for AIP and IgG4-RD, neutralization of IFN-I and IL-33 could be a new therapeutic option for these disorders.

Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1 [not hospitalized with no limitations on activities] to 7 [death]) with a cutoff at 3 (hospitalized and not requiring supplemental oxygen). We collected demographics, neurological history, Expanded Disability Severity Scale score (EDSS; ranging from 0 to 10, with cutoffs at 3 and 6), comorbidities, COVID-19 characteristics, and outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of collected variables with COVID-19 outcomes. Results A total of 347 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.6 [12.8] years, 249 women; mean [SD] disease duration, 13.5 [10.0] years) were analyzed. Seventy-three patients (21.0%) had a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more, and 12 patients (3.5%) died of COVID-19. The median EDSS was 2.0 (range, 0-9.5), and 284 patients (81.8%) were receiving DMT. There was a higher proportion of patients with a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more among patients with no DMT relative to patients receiving DMTs (46.0% vs 15.5%; P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression models determined that age (odds ratio per 10 years: 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4-2.5]), EDSS (OR for EDSS 6, 6.3 [95% CI. 2.8-14.4]), and obesity (OR, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.0-8.7]) were independent risk factors for a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more (indicating hospitalization or higher severity).

Conclusions and Relevance In this registry-based cohort study of patients with MS, age, EDSS, and obesity were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19; there was no association found between DMTs exposure and COVID-19 severity. The identification of these risk factors should provide the rationale for an individual strategy regarding clinical management of patients with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Multiple Sclerosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific advice to the UK government throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has been informed by ensembles of epidemiological models provided by members of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Modelling (SPI-M).

These differences capture genuine uncertainty in the understanding of disease dynamics and in the choice of simplifying assumptions underpinning the model.

We aimed to assess the magnitude and correlates of stigma in these survivors, on return to their communities. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based, exploratory study conducted by the postgraduate department of psychiatry, in collaboration with the postgraduate department of chest medicine, Govt. medical college, Srinagar. The study was performed among COVID-19 survivors, who attended the outpatient department after their discharge from the hospital. Socio-demographic characteristics were recorded through semi-structured proforma. Stigma was measured by the stigma questionnaire. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 91 survivors consented to participate in the study. Almost half (46.2%) of them were in the age group of 30C49 years and close to two-thirds (68.1%) were males. About threeCfourths (74.7%) were from the urban background. The mean time from hospital discharge to study entry was 11.75.1 [Range(R) = 7C21] days. 98% of survivors provided at least one stigma endorsing response and the total mean stigma score was 28.57.1[R = 6C39]. The mean stigma sub-scores were highest for enacted stigma (7.61.8) [R = 2C9] and externalized stigma (15.04.1) [R = 1C20]. Enacted stigma was significantly high in males as compared to females. Enacted stigma and internalized stigma were both associated with education. Enacted stigma, externalized stigma, disclosure concerns, and total stigma was significantly associated with the occupation. Being unemployed and time since discharge were identified as independent predictors of total stigma. CONCLUSION: Our study results showed high levels of enacted and externalized stigma among COVID-19 survivors. Enacted stigma was more among males and in those who were highly educated.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the analgesic effect and safety of nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture in patients with PHN. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a single-center, two-group (1:1), randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. A total of 42 patients with postherpetic neuralgia will be recruited and randomly divided into the intervention group and the control group. The control group will receive routine treatment plus oxygen, and the intervention group will receive routine treatment plus nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture. Data collectors, patients, and clinicians are all blind to the therapy. The outcomes of each group will be monitored at baseline (T0), 5 min (T1), and 15 min (T2) after the start of the therapy and at 5 min after the end of the therapy (T3). The primary outcome measure will be the pain intensity. Secondary outcomes included physiological parameters, adverse effects, patients acceptance of analgesia, and satisfaction from patients. DISCUSSION: Previous studies have shown that nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture can effectively relieve cancer patients with breakthrough pain. This study will explore the analgesic effect of oxide/oxygen mixture on PHN. If beneficial to patients with PHN, it will contribute to the pain management of PHN.

From our screening of over one million compounds including approved drugs, investigational drugs, natural products, and organic compounds, and a rescreening protocol incorporating enzyme dynamics via ensemble docking, we have been able to identify a range of prospective 3CLpro inhibitors. Importantly, some of the identified compounds had previously been reported to exhibit inhibitory activities against the 3CLpro enzyme of the closely related SARS-CoV virus. The top- ranking compounds are characterized by the presence of multiple bi- and monocyclic rings, many of them being heterocycles and aromatic, which are flexibly linked allowing the ligands to adapt to the geometry of the 3CLpro substrate site and involve a high amount of functional groups enabling hydrogen bond formation with surrounding amino acid residues, including the catalytic dyad residues H41 and C145. Among the top binding compounds we identified several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which include a bioflavonoid, the group of natural products that binds best to 3CLpro. Another class of compounds that decently binds to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease are steroid hormones, which thus may be endogenous inhibitors and might provide an explanation for the age-dependent severity of COVID-19. Many of the compounds identified by our work show a considerably stronger binding than found for reference compounds with in vitro demonstrated 3CLpro inhibition and anticoronavirus activity.

Multiplex labeling is used for specific clinical situations, but there remain barriers to expanded use in anatomic pathology practice. Methods: We review immunohistochemistry (IHC) and related assays used to localize molecules in tissues, with reference to United States regulatory and practice landscapes. We review multiplex methods and strategies used in clinical diagnosis and in research, particularly in immuno-oncology. Within the framework of assay design and testing phases, we examine the suitability of multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) for clinical diagnostic workflows, considering its advantages and challenges to implementation. Results: Multiplex labeling is poised to radically transform pathologic diagnosis because it can answer questions about tissue-level biology and single-cell phenotypes that cannot be addressed with traditional IHC biomarker panels. Widespread implementation will require improved detection chemistry, illustrated by InSituPlex technology (Ultivue, Inc., Cambridge, MA) that allows coregistration of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and mIF images, greater standardization and interoperability of workflow and data pipelines to facilitate consistent interpretation by pathologists, and integration of multichannel images into digital pathology whole slide imaging (WSI) systems, including interpretation aided by artificial intelligence (AI). Adoption will also be facilitated by evidence that justifies incorporation into clinical practice, an ability to navigate regulatory pathways, and adequate health care budgets and reimbursement. We expand the brightfield WSI system pixel pathway concept to multiplex workflows, suggesting that adoption might be accelerated by data standardization centered on cell phenotypes defined by coexpression of multiple molecules. Conclusion: Multiplex labeling has the potential to complement next generation sequencing in cancer diagnosis by allowing pathologists to visualize and understand every cell in a tissue biopsy slide. Until mIF reagents, digital pathology systems including fluorescence scanners, and data pipelines are standardized, we propose that diagnostic labs will play a crucial role in driving adoption of multiplex tissue diagnostics by using retrospective data from tissue collections as a foundation for laboratory-developed test (LDT) implementation and use in prospective trials as companion diagnostics (CDx).","output":"Tissue Multiplex Analyte Detection in Anatomic Pathology C Pathways to Clinical Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness is a common experience in adolescence and is related to a range of mental health problems. Such feelings may have been increased by social distancing measures introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to investigate the effect of loneliness, social contact, and parent relationships on adolescent mental health during lockdown in the UK. Young people aged 11-16 years (n = 894) completed measures of loneliness, social contact, parent-adolescent relationships, and mental health difficulties during the first 11 weeks of lockdown and one-month later (n = 443). We examined cross-sectional associations and longitudinal relationships between loneliness, social contact, and parent relationships and subsequent mental health. Adolescents who reported higher loneliness had significantly higher symptoms of mental health difficulties during lockdown. We found that adolescents who had closer relationships with their parents reported significantly less severe symptoms of mental health difficulties and lower levels of loneliness. We also found that adolescents who spent more time texting others reported higher symptoms of mental health difficulties. Our hypothesis that loneliness would predict poorer mental health one month later was not supported. Time spent texting others at baseline was significantly associated with higher hyperactivity at follow-up, and closeness to parents was significantly associated with lower psychological distress at follow-up. We conclude that while loneliness was associated with greater mental health difficulties at baseline, it did not predict increased mental health difficulties one month later.

Limited antigen presentation skills of CNS cells in comparison to peripheral tissues is because of a total lack of dendritic cells and feeble expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in neurons and glia. However, research over the past two decades has identified immune effector mechanisms intrinsic to the CNS for immediate tackling, attenuating and clearing of viral infections, with assistance pouring in from peripheral circulation in the form of neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T cells at a later stage. Specialized CNS cells, microglia and astrocytes, were regarded as sole sentinels of the brain for containing a viral onslaught but neurons held little recognition as a potential candidate for protecting itself from the proliferation and pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses.

These measures have proven to be effective in significantly reducing the prevalence of the virus. To date, no effective treatment or vaccine is available. In the effort of preserving both public health and the economical and social textures, France and Italy governments have partially released lockdown measures. Here, we extrapolate the long-term behavior of the epidemic in both countries using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model, where parameters are stochastically perturbed with a lognormal distribution to handle the uncertainty in the estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and to simulate the presence of super-spreaders. Our results suggest that uncertainties in both parameters and initial conditions rapidly propagate in the model and can result in different outcomes of the epidemic leading or not to a second wave of infections. Furthermore, the presence of super-spreaders adds instability to the dynamics, making the control of the epidemic more difficult. Using actual knowledge, asymptotic estimates of COVID-19 prevalence can fluctuate of the order of 10106 units in both countries.","output":"Modeling the second wave of COVID-19 infections in France and Italy via a stochastic SEIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.

We investigated the adverse effect of ACEIs in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with COVID-19. METHODS This prospective study consisted of 617 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients. Demographic and baseline characteristics, underlying comorbid diseases, and antihypertensive drugs were evaluated. Study outcome (in-hospital death) was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meyer method and Cox regression model. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows. P values < .05 were considered significant. RESULTS Mean  SD age was 58.49  15.80 (range: 18 to 94) years old. Cox regression analysis revealed that age (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.06), diabetes mellitus (adjusted HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.32 to 3.26), immunocompromised patients (adjusted HR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29 to 4.21), acute kidney injury (AKI) (adjusted HR = 3.23, 95% CI: 2.01 to 5.19), ICU admission (adjusted HR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.46 to 4.21), Asthma and COPD (adjusted HR = 2.13, CI:1.6 to 4.28) and ACEI (adjusted HR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.56 to 6.06), respectively were associated with in-hospital death. Among diabetic patients, ACEI (adjusted HR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.59 to 7.75), AKI (adjusted HR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.76 to 6.45) and ICU admission (adjusted HR = 3.64, 95% CI: 1.530 to 8.65) were associated with increased mortality.

AIM: To describe the effect of contracting private medical practitioners at primary healthcare facilities on the self-referral rate of clients at district hospitals as a proxy for perceived quality of care in a National Health Insurance pilot district. SETTING: The study was set in Tshwane National Health Insurance pilot district compared to Ekurhuleni district. METHODS: We compared findings before and after implementing the National Health Insurance private medical practitioners contracting between a pilot and a non-pilot district. A quasi-experimental ecological study design was used to compare district hospital outpatient department indicators of clients follow-up, self-referral, self-referral rate and referred in the two districts from June 2012 to May 2014 using single and controlled interrupted time-series analyses. RESULTS: Controlled interrupted time series analysis found decreases in self-referral rate (?1.8 [?2.2, ?1.1] [p < 0.0001]) and the initial trend of headcounts of self-referral (?516 [?969, ?66] [p = 0.0260]), but an increase in headcounts of referred clients (1293 [77, 2508] [p = 0.0376]) in the pilot compared with the non-pilot district.

They are involved in: detecting clinical change; communicating/discussing pharmacotherapy with patients, their advocates, and other healthcare professionals; proposing and implementing medication-related interventions; and ensuring follow-up of patients and medication regimens. To date, a framework of nurses' competences on knowledge, skills, and attitudes as to interprofessional pharmaceutical care tasks is missing. OBJECTIVES To reach agreement with experts about nurses' competences for tasks in interprofessional pharmaceutical care. METHODS A two-phase study starting with a scoping review followed by five Delphi rounds was performed. Competences extracted from the literature were assessed by an expert panel on relevance by using the RAND/UCLA method. The experts (n = 22) involved were healthcare professionals, nurse researchers, and educators from 14 European countries with a specific interest in nurses' roles in interprofessional pharmaceutical care. Descriptive statistics supported the data analysis. RESULTS The expert panel reached consensus on the relevance of 60 competences for 22 nursing tasks. Forty-one competences were related to 15 generic nursing tasks and 33 competences were related to seven specific nursing tasks. CONCLUSIONS This study resulted in a competence framework for competency-based nurse education. Future research should focus on imbedding these competences in nurse education.

Sorghum is known for multiple end-uses as food, feed, fuel, forage, and as source of bioactive compounds that could be used for medical applications. Although the great improvement in the process of sorghum breeding, the average yield of this crop is still very low. Therefore, exploring the genetic diversity in sorghum accessions is a critical step for improving this crop. The main objective of the current work was to study the genetic variation existing in a Moroccan sorghum collection. Indeed, 10 sorghum ecotypes were characterized based on agromorphological descriptors. Both quantitative (25) and qualitative (7) traits revealed variability (p < 0.05) among the studied ecotypes. At the seedling stage, most of the ecotypes showed good to high vigor (70%). However, as the sorghum plants grow, the difference between genotypes become more apparent, especially at the generative phase. For instance, three different panicle shapes have been observed, erect (50%), semi-bent (30%), and bent (20%) with different degree of compactness (20% for loose, semi-compact, and compact panicles, and 30% for semi-loose panicles). In another part of this study, the phytochemical composition and antioxidant activities of the sorghum ecotypes have been determined. The results showed variable total phenolic contents, and total flavonoid contents ranging from 125.86  1.36 to 314.91  3.60 mg GAE/g dw and 114.0  13.2 to 138.5  10.8 (mg catechin equivalent/100 g, dw) respectively, with a differential antioxidant activities as well.

In this perspective, the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as DHA/EPA might reduce the harmful effects of obesity. Here, we used the cafeteria diet model to induce obesity in Wistar rats. Animals received ultra-processed food for 20 weeks, and DHA/EPA supplementation (500mg/Kg/day) was performed between the 16th and the 20th week. At the end of the experiment, it was evaluated: body weight, visceral fat deposition, plasma glucose, insulin and triglycerides, and it was also measured the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-6 in plasma and liver, and TNF- in the prefrontal cortex. The elevated plus-maze test was performed to analyze anxiety-like behaviour. Our results demonstrated that DHA/EPA could not reverse weight and fat gain and did not modify plasma dosages. However, there was a decrease in IL-6 in the liver (DHA/EPA effect: p = 0.023) and TNF- in the brain (CAF compared to CAF+DHA/EPA, p < 0.05).

Studies documenting approaches to deliver MAB infusions and demonstrating their efficacy are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We describe our experience and the outcomes of almost 3000 patients who received MAB infusion therapy at Northwell Health, a large integrated health care system in New York. METHODS: This is a descriptive study of adult patients who received MAB therapy between November 20, 2020, to January 31, 2021, and a retrospective cohort survival analysis comparing patients who received MAB therapy prior to admission versus those who did not. A multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score including covariates (sociodemographic, comorbidities, and presenting vital signs) was used. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; additional evaluations included emergency department use and hospitalization within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test for patients who received MAB therapy. RESULTS: During the study period, 2818 adult patients received MAB infusion. Following therapy and within 28 days of a COVID-19 test, 123 (4.4%) patients presented to the emergency department and were released, and 145 (5.1%) patients were hospitalized. These 145 patients were compared with 200 controls who were eligible for but did not receive MAB therapy and were hospitalized. In the MAB group, 16 (11%) patients met the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality, versus 21 (10.5%) in the control group. In an unadjusted Cox model, the hazard ratio (HR) for time to in-hospital mortality for the MAB group was 1.38 (95% CI 0.696-2.719). Models adjusting for demographics (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.53-2.23), demographics and Charlson Comorbidity Index (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.573-2.59), and with inverse probability weighting according to propensity scores (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.619-2.29) did not demonstrate significance. The hospitalization rate was 4.4% for patients who received MAB therapy within 0 to 4 days, 5% within 5 to 7 days, and 6.1% in 8 days of symptom onset (P=.15). CONCLUSIONS: Establishing the capability to provide neutralizing MAB infusion therapy requires substantial planning and coordination.

The replication of three different MHV strains was studied in mouse dissociated spinal cord cultures containing differentiated neurons and nonneuronal cells (NN) (including astrocytes). Cell tropism and maturation of each virus strain was analyzed by immunolabeling methods using antisera to the virion or to purified membrane glycoproteins (E1 and E2) and by electron microscopy (EM). Wt-JHM, which causes acute encephalitis in mice, produces acute cytopathic changes in both neurons and NN cells. In neurons, virions mature in smooth ER cisternae closely associated to the Golgi apparatus. As judged by EM, fewer virions are produced by neurons than NN cells and neurons do not fuse or stain for E2 as do NN cells. NN cells contain large inclusions made of nucleocapsid strands. A temperature-sensitive mutant of JHM, Ts8-JHM, which causes demyelination in mice, infects NN cells but not neurons. Infected NN cells synthesize E1 and E2, and contain large inclusions but few mature virions, even at permissive temperatures. These inclusions appear granular and rarely contain nucleocapsid strands in contrast to wt-JHM infection. NN cells infected with this mutant also display numerous membrane whorls. The hepatotropic strain A59 lacks tropism for neurons and primarily infects NN cells, thus resembling ts8-JHM. Infected NN cells become loaded with intracytoplasmic virions which are secreted from the cells. E1 can only be detected in the perinuclear area of these cells while E2 rapidly spreads throughout the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of A59 infected NN cells frequently contains large tubular structures often in the lumen of the RER. In conclusion, in primary CNS cultures consisting of neurons and NN cells: (1) wt-JHM replicates in both neurons and NN cells but has different effects on these cells; (2) Ts8-JHM exhibits no productive infection of neurons, and in NN cells appears to be defective in assembly and to stimulate membrane synthesis; (3) A59 also shows tropism restricted to NN cells which produce many viruses and display differential distribution of the two virion glycoproteins. Thus, in the absence of the immune system, the MHV strains assayed exhibit differences in viral tropism, cytopathic changes, and viral assembly in CNS cells, and these differences may account for the different disease patterns.","output":"Cell tropism and expression of mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) in mouse spinal cord cultures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prenatal maternal infection and anxiety have been linked, in separate lines of study, with child neurodevelopment.

Child neurodevelopment at approximately 8 years of age was assessed by in-person testing, reports of social and communication problems associated with autism, and psychiatric evaluation. Covariates included psychosocial, demographic, and perinatal/obstetric risks. Prenatal infection was associated with increased likelihood of co-occurring prenatal risk, including anxiety. Regression analyses indicated that both prenatal infection and prenatal anxiety predicted child social and communication problems; the predictions were largely independent of each other.

Multivariable General Linear Model analysis was conducted, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and coronavirus prenatal experiences, maternal prenatal anxiety levels, perceived social support, speech-language, motor skills, and cognitive and socio-emotional development at the infants' age of 12 months. Results: The study revealed the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal trait anxiety. The association between selected independent factors and infants' development was found in a demographically unified sample except for employment and the number of children. There was a correlation between all observed developmental functions. Univariate General Linear model statistical analysis indicated that linear models with selected independent factors and covariates could account for 30.9% (Cognition) up to 40.6% (Speech-language) of variability in developmental functions. It turned out that two-way and three-way interactions had a dominant role on models, and STAI-T Level and COVID-19 related fear were present in all interaction terms. Conclusion: Our findings reveal important determinants of child developmental outcomes and underline the impact of maternal anxiety on early child development. These findings lay the groundwork for the following interdisciplinary research on pregnancy and child development to facilitate and achieve positive developmental outcomes and maternal mental health.","output":"The Impact of Maternal Anxiety on Early Child Development During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Suicide is proposed as an important and growing issue in public health. The aim of this study is to compare suicide load in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries in order to pave the way for correct health policy making. METHODS: The population included 21 MENA countries. The data of Global Burden of Diseases in 2017 that estimate death rate for 264 causes was used. The GBD considers suicide according to definition of the ninth and tenth editions of the international classification of diseases as death due to poisoning or intentional self-injury. All suicide-related analyzes were evaluated using these indicators in excel 2016. RESULTS: The highest percentage of total suicide DALY attributable to risk factors of Alcohol and drug use are related to United Arab Emirates and Afghanistan countries, respectively. Iran is the sole country without suicide DALY attributable to alcohol consumption risk factor. Moroccan women and Libya, Afghanistan and Yemen men have the highest DALY rates in terms of ASR in the region, respectively. Suicide incidence have an increasing trend until the age group of 20C24 and then a decreasing trend. This trend is on the rise again since the age of 65.

And receptor binding domain (receptorbindingdomain, RBD), a recombinant spike protein extracted from SARS - CoV - 2 virus, can bind to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in human body. This study aims to observe the biodistribution of [124I]I-RBD in mammals, evaluate the ability of [124I]I-RBD to detect ACE2-positive lesions, and explore the potential of RBD against COVID-19. Method: The binding ability of RBD to human ACE2 receptor was studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). RBD was labeled with 124I by N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) mediated method, and high quality radiopharmaceutics [124I]I-RBD were obtained after purification. The binding potency of [124I]I-RBD to human ACE2 was detected by a modified enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The biodistribution of [124I]I-RBD in normal BALC/c mice was observed at 0.5 h, 2 h, 24 h and 60 h after tail vein injection. The human radiation dosimetry was estimated based on the animal studies. Results: The labeled [124I] I-RBD was purified by size-exclusion chromatography (PD-10), yielding a radio-chemical purity over 99%, as tested by radio-TLC. Specific activity of the product [124I]I-RBD was 28.9 GBq/nmol, and the radio chemistry purity (RCP) was over in saline for seven days. RBD binds to ACE2 with K<INFD= 14.08 nM, while the binding potency of [124I]I-RBD to ACE2 was calculated as 75.7 nM. Biodistribution data in normal balc/c mice showed that, RBD had a moderate metabolic rate, and its 24-hours-p.i. distribution was basically consistent with the high expression distribution of ACE2 in human body. Human radiation dosimetry estimates an indicated effective dose of 6.42 x 10-2 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: These experimental results confirmed the penitential of 124I-RBD as a novel molecular targeting probe for COVID-19. (Figure Presented) The probing of ACE2 expression via radiolabeled RBD may not only be used for non-invasive ACE2 mapping in mammals, but also have the prospect of radiotherapy to suppress the pandemic of COVID-19 by simply changing the iodine isotopes.","output":"Preliminary evaluation of 124I labeled virus receptor binding domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveEvaluate antithrombotic (AT) use in individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) and high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2) and investigate whether pre-existing AT use may improve COVID-19 outcomes. MethodsIndividuals with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2 on January 1st 2020 were identified using pseudonymised, linked electronic health records for 56 million people in England and followed-up until May 1st 2021. Factors associated with pre-existing AT use were analysed using logistic regression. Differences in COVID-19 related hospitalisation and death were analysed using logistic and Cox regression for individuals exposed to pre-existing AT use vs no AT use, anticoagulants (AC) vs antiplatelets (AP) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) vs warfarin. ResultsFrom 972,971 individuals with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2, 88.0% (n=856,336) had pre-existing AT use, 3.8% (n=37,418) had a COVID-19 related hospitalisation and 2.2% (n=21,116) died. Factors associated with no AT use included comorbidities that may contraindicate AT use (liver disease and history of falls) and demographics (socioeconomic status and ethnicity). Pre-existing AT use was associated with lower odds of death (OR=0.92 [0.87-0.96 at 95% CI]), but higher odds of hospitalisation OR=1.20 [1.15-1.26 at 95% CI]). The same pattern was observed for AC vs AP (death (OR=0.93 [0.87-0.98]), hospitalisation (OR=1.17 [1.11-1.24])) but not for DOACs vs warfarin (death (OR=1.00 [0.95-1.05]), hospitalisation (OR=0.86 [0.82-0.89]). ConclusionsPre-existing AT use may offer marginal protection against COVID-19 death, with AC offering more protection than AP. Although this association may not be causal, it provides further incentive to improve AT coverage for eligible individuals with AF. KEY QUESTIONSO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIAnticoagulants (AC), a sub-class of antithrombotics (AT), reduce the risk of stroke and are recommended for individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) and at high risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold). However, previous evaluations suggest that up to one third of these individuals may not be taking AC. Over estimation of bleeding and fall risk in elderly patients have been identified as potential factors in this under medicating. C_LIO_LIIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several observational studies have observed correlations between pre-existing AT use, particularly anticoagulants (AC), and lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes such as hospitalisation and death. However, these correlations are inconsistent across studies and have not compared all major sub-types of AT in one study. C_LI What does this study add?O_LIThis study uses datasets covering primary care, secondary care, pharmacy dispensing, death registrations, multiple COVID-19 diagnoses routes and vaccination records for 56 million people in England and is the largest scale evaluation of AT use to date. This provides the statistical power to robustly analyse targeted sub-types of AT and control for a wide range of potential confounders. All code developed for the study is opensource and an updated nationwide evaluation can be rapidly created for future time points. C_LIO_LIIn 972,971 individuals with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2, we observed 88.0% (n=856,336) with pre-existing AT use which was associated with marginal protection against COVID-19 death (OR=0.92 [0.87-0.96 at 95% CI]). C_LI How might this impact on clinical practice?O_LIThese findings can help shape global AT medication policy and provide population-scale, observational analysis results alongside gold-standard randomised control trials to help assess whether a potential beneficial effect of pre-existing AT use on COVID-19 death alters risk to benefit assessments in AT prescribing decisions.

Although real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is considered the first tool to make a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, the high false negative rate, low sensitivity, limited supplies and strict requirements for laboratory settings might delay accurate diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) has been reported as an important tool to identify and investigate suspected patients with COVID-19 disease at early stage. Findings RT-PCR shows low sensitivity (60C71%) in diagnosing patients with COVID-19 infection compared to the CT chest. Several studies reported that chest CT scans show typical imaging features in all patients with COVID-19. This high sensitivity and initial presentation in CT chest can be helpful in rectifying false negative results obtained from RT-PCR. As COVID-19 has similar manifestations to other pneumonia diseases, artificial intelligence (AI) might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases. Conclusion Although CT scan is a powerful tool in COVID-19 diagnosis, it is not sufficient to detect COVID-19 alone due to the low specificity (25%), and challenges that radiologists might face in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia on chest CT scans. AI might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases.

Limited data are available about COVID-19 during pregnancy and infancy, mostly from China. Herein, our experience on a safe perinatal management of neonates born to COVID-19 mothers is reported. Method: Since late February through May 15, 2020, 375 pregnant women delivered at our City Hospital in Piacenza, at the epicenter of the Italian epidemic. Of these, 144 were tested via a SARS-CoV-2 quantitative rRT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab prior to delivery, firstly on the basis of epidemiological and clinical criteria, then adopting a universal screening approach. All newborns from SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers were tested via nasopharyngeal swab at birth, on day 3 and/or day 7. In case of positive result, they were re-tested on day 14. Results: Fifteen women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All newborns except one were born at term. All of them were non-infected at birth, irrespective of mode of delivery; 13 out 15 remained negative; the two positive neonates became negative by day 14 of life. All of them have always remained asymptomatic. All newborns except two were allowed to have immediate bonding, permanent rooming-in, and direct breastfeeding. Conclusions: Our study supports the claim that COVID-19 in pregnancy is not associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to non-COVID-19 pregnant women and/or with higher rates of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction. Intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be unlikely.

METHODS: Seventy-four COVID-19 patients admitted between March 16th and June 3rd 2020 to the Asklepios Lung Clinic Munich-Gauting, Germany, were included in the study. Patients were categorized in a non-severe group including patients hospitalized on general wards only and in a severe group including patients requiring intensive care treatment. Fully automated quantification of CT scans was performed via IMBIO CT Lung Texture analysis? software. Predictive biomarkers were assessed with receiver-operator-curve and likelihood analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (44% female) presented with non-severe COVID-19 and 19 patients (32% female) with severe disease. Five fatalities were reported in the severe group. Accurate automated CT analysis was possible with 61 CTs (82%). Disease severity was linked to lower residual normal lung (72.5% vs 87%, p = 0.003), increased ground glass opacities (GGO) (8% vs 5%, p = 0.031) and increased reticular pattern (8% vs 2%, p = 0.025). Disease severity was associated with advanced age (76 vs 59 years, p = 0.001) and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP, 92.2 vs 36.3 mg/L, p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 485 vs 268 IU/L, p < 0.001) and oxygen supplementation (p < 0.001) upon admission. Predictive risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 were oxygen supplementation, LDH >313 IU/L, CRP >71 mg/L, <70% normal lung texture, >12.5% GGO and >4.5% reticular pattern.

METHODS A total of 64 subjects with MDD who were free of psychoactive medications were evaluated for severity of headache pain in the past week. Brain function was assessed using resting-state quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). We derived cordance in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency bands at each electrode, and examined correlations with headache pain in regions of interest while controlling for depression severity. Frontal and posterior asymmetry in alpha power was calculated in regions of interest. RESULTS Headache pain severity was associated with depression severity ( r = 0.447, P < .001). In bilateral frontal and right posterior regions, alpha cordance was significantly associated with headache intensity, including when controlling for depression severity. The direction of the correlation was positive anteriorly and negative posteriorly. Frontal left dominant alpha asymmetry correlated with severity of headache but not depression symptoms.

This study aimed to clinically and histomorphometric compare commercially-available sandblasted (RBM) implants, treated with hydrothermal anodization and placed into an animal maxillary sinus model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty 3.75 mm  8.5 mm threaded titanium implants were placed into the maxillary sinuses of 10 sheep via an external approach, with three test groups and 10 implants per group: right side, Control = CP-titanium with RBM surface, Test group 1 = CP-titanium with RBM + anodized surface; left side, Test group 2 = Ti-6Al-7Nb with RBM + anodized surface. Schneiderian membranes were elevated but not bone grafted. Resonant frequency analysis (RFA) was measured at surgery. Animals were sacrificed after 1 month unloaded healing. Resin-embedded undemineralized ground-sections were digitised, and mean bone-implant contact (% BIC) was measured bilaterally for the best-three consecutive threads. RESULTS Seven of 30 implants showed signs of failure. RFA was low at placement but did not differ between the groups (group mean ISQ values ranged from 23 to 35; (2) = 0.37). RFA was not repeated at sacrifice due to implant instability. Histomorphometric analysis showed % BIC was highest for control (34.8  15.7), followed by Test 1 (29.6  18.1) and Test 2 implants (23.3  22.7), but this difference was not statistically significant ((2) = 0.3). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Early integration of RBM implants placed into thin maxillary sinus walls was not enhanced by hydrothermal anodization of implant surfaces. This may be related to the initial low stability of the implants and the relatively short healing period. However, non-anodized RBM surfaces showed promising results, with % BIC values comparable to the best estimates of other studies using sinus grafting.

OBJECTIVE: This project aimed to determine the baseline level of health literacy, behavioral practices, and accessibility to resources in a set of 16 informal settlements located around Lagos, Nigeria in order to identify topics that should be emphasized in a new teaching curriculum directed at local Community Health Educators. METHODS: In June of 2017, a unique cross-sectional survey composed of 37 questions was conducted in informal settlements around Lagos. Sites selected were areas in which future CHE trainings were planned to take place and survey participants were chosen by trained community health educators based on convenience sampling with snowball effect. Survey questions included both multiple-choice and open-ended questions and were asked in the local language. We collected demographic information and assessed health literacy, health behaviors, and community practices. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics to assess for differences between demographic groups. FINDINGS: Our survey collected 348 total responses. Respondents displayed a high level of knowledge regarding the benefits of hand washing (97.1%) and childhood immunizations (81.0%). Knowledge around infectious diseases and reproductive health was lower, including a large proportion of people (50%) incorrectly indicating that HIV could be spread through a mosquito bite. Malaria was reported to be the most prevalent disease affecting both adults (40.0%) and children (58.3%). Health access was limited, with most people not reporting access to a nearby health center (55.8%).

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a surge in critical care capacity and prone positioning practices which may increase the risk of ocular complications. This article aims to review all ocular complications associated with prone positioning, with a focus on challenges posed by COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review using keywords of \\"intensive care\\", \\"critical care\\", \\"eye care\\", \\"ocular disorders\\", \\"ophthalmic complications,\\" \\"coronavirus\\", \\"COVID-19,\\" \\"prone\\" and \\"proning\\" was performed using the electronic databases of PUBMED, EMBASE and CINAHL. RESULTS: The effects of prone positioning on improving respiratory outcomes in critically unwell patients are well established; however, there is a lack of literature regarding the effects of prone positioning on ocular complications in the critical care setting. Sight-threatening ophthalmic disorders potentiated by proning include ocular surface disease, acute angle closure, ischemic optic neuropathy, orbital compartment syndrome and vascular occlusions. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to ocular complications with increased proning practices and increasing demand on critical care staff. This review outlines these ocular complications with a focus on preventative and treatment measures to avoid devastating visual outcomes for the patient.","output":"Ocular Complications in the Prone Position in the Critical Care Setting: The COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The history of humeral component design has evolved from prostheses with relatively long stems and limited anatomic head options to a contemporary platform with short stems and stemless implants with shared instrumentation and the ability to provide optimal shoulder reconstruction for both anatomic and reverse configurations.

A detailed analysis of the first human case of HO-1 deficiency revealed that HO-1 is involved in the protection of multiple tissues and organs from oxidative stress and excessive inflammatory reactions, through the release of multiple molecules with anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory functions. HO-1 production is induced in vivo within selected cell types, including renal tubular epithelium, hepatic Kupffer cells, vascular endothelium, and monocytes/macrophages, suggesting that HO-1 plays critical roles in these cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have indicated that impaired HO-1 production results in progressive monocyte dysfunction, unregulated macrophage activation and endothelial cell dysfunction, leading to catastrophic systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Data from reported human cases of HO-1 deficiency and numerous studies using animal models suggest that HO-1 plays critical roles in various clinical settings involving excessive oxidative stress and inflammation. In this regard, therapy to induce HO-1 production by pharmacological intervention represents a promising novel strategy to control inflammatory diseases.","output":"Heme Oxygenase-1 Deficiency and Oxidative Stress: A Review of 9 Independent Human Cases and Animal Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many studies have shown that changes in lumbar flexion angle and the pelvic inclination angle can be affected by the shortening of the lumbar muscles, which can cause low back pain. Decreased lumbar flexion angle and pelvic inclination angle can cause or exacerbate low back pain by disrupting the lumbo-pelvic rhythm. PURPOSE: This study aimed to use myofascial release techniques as a specialized treatment on muscle tissue to cause muscles to reach the optimal length and improve lumbar flexion angle and pelvic inclination angle, and thus improve low-back pain. SETTING: Non-specific low back pain patients, Tarbiat Modares University, Iran. PARTICIPANTS: 30 chronic non-specific low back pain participants were randomly assigned into two groups. RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a randomized control trial. INTERVENTIONS: The myofascial release group (n=15) underwent 4 sessions of myofascial release treatment based on Myers techniques, and the control group (n=15) underwent 10 sessions of routine electrotherapy for two weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Before starting the intervention and after the last treatment session, both groups were evaluated by the lumbar flexion angle with a flexible ruler, calculating the pelvic inclination angle by a trigonometric formula, and VAS measured the pain score of the participants. RESULTS: The results of the paired t test showed that, after treatment in both groups, the severity of pain and lumbar flexion angle changed significantly (p  .001). However, the pelvic inclination angle was changed considerably only in the myofascial release group, and we did not see significant changes in the control group (p = .082). Also, the independent sample t test results to examine the between-group changes showed that changes in the myofascial release group were significantly different from the control group (p  .000). Also, the effect size shows the large effect of the myofascial release technique compared to the control group (effect size  1.85). CONCLUSION: The present study results showed that myofascial release techniques in patients with low back pain could help decrease pain intensity and increase lumbar flexion and pelvic inclination angle. Based on the present study results, myofascial release can be a treatment to correct posture in patients with chronic non-specific, low back pain. Due to the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not possible to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment.","output":"Evaluation of Lumbar Myofascial Release Effects on Lumbar Flexion Angle and Pelvic Inclination Angle in Patients with Non-Specific Low Back Pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to understand autoimmune phenomena contributing to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and post-COVID syndrome, we have been profiling autoantigens (autoAgs) from various cell types. Although cells share numerous autoAgs, each cell type gives rise to unique COVID-altered autoAg candidates, which may explain the wide range of symptoms experienced by patients with autoimmune sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the unifying property of affinity between autoantigens (autoAgs) and the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate (DS), this paper reports 140 candidate autoAgs identified from proteome extracts of human Jurkat T-cells, of which at least 105 (75%) are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with currently available multi-omic COVID-19 data shows that 125 (89%) of DS-affinity proteins are altered at protein and/or RNA levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells or patients, with at least 94 being known autoAgs in a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Protein alterations by ubiquitination and phosphorylation in the viral infection are major contributors of autoAgs. The autoAg protein network is significantly associated with cellular response to stress, apoptosis, RNA metabolism, mRNA processing and translation, protein folding and processing, chromosome organization, cell cycle, and muscle contraction. The autoAgs include clusters of histones, CCT/TriC chaperonin, DNA replication licensing factors, proteasome and ribosome proteins, heat shock proteins, serine/arginine-rich splicing factors, 14-3-3 proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins. AutoAgs such as LCP1 and NACA that are altered in the T cells of COVID patients may provide insight into T-cell responses in the viral infection and merit further study. The autoantigen-ome from this study contributes to a comprehensive molecular map for investigating acute, subacute, and chronic autoimmune disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2.","output":"An Autoantigen Profile from Jurkat T-Lymphoblasts Provides a Molecular Guide for Investigating Autoimmune Sequelae of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This project produced an online astronomy course based on the free, online OpenStax textbook.

Although the significance remains unclear, intestinal organoid lines display heterogeneity in their growth and morphology. We hypothesized that organoids will also display variability in the degree to which they are susceptible to infectious agents. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a model, we found orders of magnitude differences in the amount of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from small intestinal and colonic organoids generated from different donors. SARS-CoV-2 burden did not correlate with demographic or clinical features associated with donors, but rather reflected the expression level of the virus receptor ACE2. Remarkably, organoid ACE2 transcript levels matched the amount of ACE2 detected in primary tissue from the same individual, indicating that certain properties of the intestinal epithelium are retained during ex vivo differentiation. Longitudinal transcriptomics of organoids identified a delayed yet robust interferon signature, the magnitude of which corresponded to the degree of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that intestinal organoids display substantial heterogeneity in their ability to support viral infections and can potentially inform mechanisms behind interindividual differences in susceptibility to infectious disease.","output":"Intestinal organoids expose heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Years of tinkering with the mouse immune system genes has finally produced a winner, with the approval of the first fully human monoclonal antibody made in a mouse.

But attraction-expanding technology also raises a moral concern C one that can be cast in non-harm-based and harm-based terms. I argue that the non-harm-based objection should be rejected, because it is incompatible with a moral principle central to queer rights.

During the beginning of the pandemic, everyone wanted to learn more about the virus. After 4 months, with death-tolls rising and isolation not being over anytime soon, psychological fatigue may have set in. To what degree has this psychological fatigue, with perspective of age groups along with the factor of personally knowing someone affected by COVID-19, impacted people's interest in the virus? Methods: We conducted an online survey using a Likert Scale from 1-5 to rate interest in hearing about COVID-19 related news when the pandemic started, around early March, and then to rate their interest in hearing about COVID-19 related news at the end of June. We divided respondents between two age groups, 25 and younger or older than 25, and whether or not they knew someone that has been affected by the virus. The survey was done online and was open to everyone who could access the survey online. Each participant answered the same two questions assessing their interest in March and then in June. Results: We received 410 survey responses which were divided into two groups according to age limit i.e., Younger Group (YG) with age  25 (n =133), and Older Group (OG) with age &gt; 25 (n = 277). We found that both groups were interested (level 4/5 at a scale of 1-5) at the beginning of the pandemic (around the end of March) with a frequency of 65.4% (87/133) and 77.2% (214/277). In the span of 12 weeks, both groups' interest dropped drastically to 32.3% (43/133) and 41.5% (115/277) respectively with no statistically significant difference between the two groups when calculated with 2x2 Fischer exact test (P=0.7).

BACKGROUND The efficacy and safety of ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine were established in phase 3 randomized controlled trials. However, there is no real-world data of patient experience with ubrogepant in a population in which the majority of patients have chronic migraine, multiple prior unsuccessful treatments, complex medical comorbidities, and concurrent use of other migraine-specific medications. METHOD This was a post-market cohort study conducted at Mayo Clinic Arizona. All patients prescribed ubrogepant were tracked and contacted 1-3 months after the prescription to answer a list of standardized questions. Demographic information and additional headache history were obtained from chart review. RESULTS We obtained eligible questionnaire responses from 106 patients. Chronic migraine accounted for 92/106 (86.8%) of the population. Complete headache freedom (from mild/moderate/severe to no pain) and headache relief (from moderate/severe to mild/no pain or mild to no pain) for 75% of all treated attacks at 2 hours after taking ubrogepant were achieved in 20/105 (19.0%) and 50/105 (47.6%) patients, respectively. A total of 33/106 (31.1%) patients reported being \\"very satisfied\\" with ubrogepant. Adverse events were reported in 42/106 (39.6%) patients, including fatigue in 29/106 (27.4%), dry mouth in 8/106 (7.5%), nausea/vomiting in 7/106 (6.6%), constipation in 5/106 (4.7%), dizziness in 3/106 (2.8%), and other adverse events in 7/106 (6.6%). Predictive factors for being a \\"good responder\\" to ubrogepant, defined as headache relief for 75% of all treated attacks at 2 hours after taking ubrogepant, included migraine with aura, episodic migraine, <5 prior unsuccessful preventive or acute treatment trials. Additionally, prior treatment responses to a CGRP monoclonal antibody and onabotulinumtoxinA injections are predictive of treatment responses and patient satisfaction to ubrogepant. For the 62/106 (58.5%) patients concurrently using a CGRP monoclonal antibody, there was no difference in the \\"good responder\\" rate or adverse event rate compared to those who were not on a CGRP monoclonal antibody, though the rate of moderate, as opposed to mild adverse events was higher, 11/62 (47.8%) versus 3/44 (17.6%), p = 0.048. Additionally, 16 patients had a history of significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. No severe adverse events were reported in any patient. CONCLUSION Our study confirms and extends the efficacy profile and tolerability of ubrogepant in a real-world tertiary headache clinic and identifies factors that may predict efficacy. Adverse event rates were higher than reported in clinical trials.

We present a retrospective analysis of meropenem and vancomycin concentrations in serum and CSF in the first nine ventriculitis patients treated with continuous infusion and TDM-guided dose optimization aiming at 20C30 mg/L. Median initial dosing was 8.8 g/24 h meropenem and 4.25 g/24 h vancomycin, respectively, resulting in median serum concentrations of 21.3 mg/L for meropenem and 24.5 mg/L for vancomycin and CSF concentrations of 3.4 mg/L for meropenem and 1.7 mg/L for vancomycin. Median CSF penetration was 15% for meropenem and 7% for vancomycin. With initial dosing, all but one patient achieved CSF concentrations above 1 mg/L. Dose adjustment according to TDM ensured sufficient CSF concentrations in all patients within 48 h of treatment.

Passengers passed through layered screening then exited the model. 80% screening effectiveness was assumed for symptomatic passengers; 6% asymptomatic passengers. Results In the first 100 days of a global pandemic, U.S. airport screening would evaluate over 17M passengers with 800K secondary screenings. 11,570 PI infected passengers (majority asymptomatic) would enter the U.S. undetected from all 18 airports.

U.S. attack rates: no screening (26.9%C30.9%); screening (26.4%C30.6%); however airport screening results in 800KC1.8M less U.S. PI cases; 16KC35K less deaths (2% fatality rate). Antiviral medications for travel contact prophylaxis (10 contacts/PI passenger) were high C 8.8M. False positives from all 18 airports: 100C200/day. Conclusions Foreign shore exit screening greatly reduces numbers of PI infected passengers. U.S. airport screening identifies 50% infected individuals; efficacy is limited by the asymptomatic PI infected. Screening will not significantly delay arrival of PI via international air transport, but will reduce the rate of new US cases and subsequent deaths.","output":"U.S. airport entry screening in response to pandemic influenza: Modeling and analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe, becoming a major public health challenge not for China only, but also for countries around the world. Despite worldwide efforts to contain viral spread, the outbreak has not been stopped yet. Among healthcare personnel, dentists seem to be at elevated risk of exposure to COVID-19. This risk is even more serious in pediatric dentistry, since affected children, frequently, present an asymptomatic, mild or moderate clinical viral infection and, therefore, they may play a major role in community-based COVID-19 transmission. To date, despite no universal guidelines are available for dental procedures in pediatric dentistry during COVID-19 outbreak, routine dental practice should be postponed and only severe dental emergencies must be treated. In the case of a dental emergency, involving a pediatric patient, dentists should be aware of which recommended management protocol can be adopted during the practice to protect patient health, to safeguard their-self and to prevent viral transmission. The aim of this paper is to provide clinical recommendations, presenting a needed tool for dentists to allow a valid and safe how-to-do protocol. Pediatric dentists should keep a high level of awareness to help patients, minimize risk and prevent viral spread.","output":"COVID-19 Disease in Children: What Dentists Should Know and Do to Prevent Viral Spread.

Here, A9, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) of the tyrphostin class, is identified as a robust inhibitor of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection in cell-based assays. Moreover, A9 exhibited potent antiviral activity against the replication of various CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). We further performed a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis to investigate the mechanism of action of A9 against TGEV infection in vitro. We specifically identified p38 and JNK1, which are the downstream molecules of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) required for efficient TGEV replication, as A9 targets through plaque assays, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays. p38 and JNK1 inhibitors and RNA interference further showed that the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV infection was mainly mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. All these findings indicated that the RTKI A9 directly inhibits TGEV replication and that its inhibitory activity against TGEV replication mainly occurs by targeting p38, which provides vital clues to the design of novel drugs against CoVs.","output":"Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors block proliferation of TGEV mainly through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed for the detection of lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV).

Methods: : Time-series analyses can help understand the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic and take appropriate measures to curb the spread of the disease. In this study, an ARIMA model was developed to predict the trend of COVID-19 prevalence in the states of Maharashtra, Delhi and Kerala, and India as a whole. Results: : The prevalence of COVID-19 from 16 March 2020 to 17 May 2020 was collected from the website of Covid19india. Several ARIMA models were generated along with the performance measures.

After coming to consensus on the codes, the researchers clustered the codes and used them to identify emerging themes, consistent with analytic techniques suggested by Miles and Huberman. Setting Telephone interviews were conducted with individuals with multiple sclerosis living in the community who were recruited from the mailing list of the National MS Society. Participants The 24 individuals interviewed had an average age of 66 years, and had been diagnosed an average of 32 years. Half were married, and 75% were female. Many had college degrees; six were employed. Interventions This is a qualitative study with no intervention. Main Outcome Measures Self-reported health, health care access, and health promoting behaviors. Results Four interconnected themes emerged from the analysis: negative effects on health and health promotion, being isolated, loss of spontaneity in daily life, and resilience. Although most individuals initially reported no effect of COVID-19 on their health, additional probing revealed that some felt weaker and had more balance problems. Normal exercise regimens had been disrupted for approximately half of them. Several also described decreased social interactions; 80% expressed negative emotional impacts. Many utilized previously developed coping mechanisms, such as cognitive reframing, and support from family as they adapted to COVID-19. Most individuals reported no MS exacerbations and were able to have some contact with providers, usually through telehealth.

Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a powerful method for nucleic acid detection and absolute quantification. However, it requires thermal cycling and accurate temperature control, which are difficult in resource-limited conditions. Accordingly, isothermal methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), are more attractive. We developed a picoliter well array (PWA) chip with 27,000 consistently sized picoliter reactions (314 pL) for isothermal DNA quantification using digital RPA (dRPA) at 39C. Sample loading using a scraping liquid blade was simple, fast, and required small reagent volumes (i.e., <20 L). Passivating the chip surface using a methoxy-PEG-silane agent effectively eliminated cross-contamination during dRPA. Our creative optical design enabled wide-field fluorescence imaging in situ and both end-point and real-time analyses of picoliter wells in a 6-cm(2) area. It was not necessary to use scan shooting and stitch serial small images together. Using this method, we quantified serial dilutions of a Listeria monocytogenes gDNA stock solution from 9  10(-1) to 4  10(-3) copies per well with an average error of less than 11% (N = 15).

We aimed to compare COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic blood donors from healthcare and non-healthcare setting to analyse the difference in exposure level of each group as well as the risk of acquiring infection during the process of blood donation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of whole blood donors tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was carried out after categorizing them into healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW). NHCW were further categorized into residents of containment and non-containment zones and seroprevalence analyzed. Seroprevalence among different ABO blood groups was also analyzed. RESULTS: 1191 blood donors were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 9.5 % seropositivity. Significantly lower seropositivity of 3.2 % (p < 0.001) was observed among HCW as compared to 10.9 % seropositivity in NHCW. Among NHCW no difference in seropositivity was observed based on residence in containment or non-containment zone. Significantly higher (p = 0.012) seroprevalence was observed among A blood group donors (12.5 %) as compared to O blood group donors (6.8 %). CONCLUSION: Results suggests that a blood donor, in a hospital setting is less likely to be exposed to COVID-19 disease than when participating in activities of daily living. It is postulated that the lower seroprevalence among HCW as compared to NHCW reflects differences in knowledge and practice of preventive measures among these groups.

METHODS: We recorded the BF and SpO(2) signals for confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of a teaching hospital during both the first and subsequent outbreaks of the pandemic in France. An unsupervised machine-learning algorithm (the Gaussian mixture model) was applied to the patients' data for clustering. The algorithm's robustness was ensured by comparing its results against actual intubation rates. We predicted intubation rates using the algorithm every hour, thus conducting a severity evaluation. We designed a S(24) severity score that represented the patient's severity over the previous 24 h; the validity of MS(24), the maximum S(24) score, was checked against rates of intubation risk and prolonged ICU stay. RESULTS: Our sample included 279 patients. . The unsupervised clustering had an accuracy rate of 87.8% for intubation recognition (AUC = 0.94, True Positive Rate 86.5%, true Negative Rate 90.9%). The S(24) score of intubated patients was significantly higher than that of non-intubated patients at 48 h before intubation. The MS(24) score allowed for the distinguishing between three severity levels with an increased risk of intubation: green (3.4%), orange (37%), and red (77%). A MS(24) score over 40 was highly predictive of an ICU stay greater than 5 days at an accuracy rate of 81.0% (AUC = 0.87).

RESULTS: Our EMS-based testing program can test approximately 15 homebound patients per day. Through April 2020 our program had performed 477 home-based tests. Additionally, we have recently undertaken several mass testing operations, testing up to 900 patients per testing site. CONCLUSION: Facility-based SARS-CoV-2 testing requires that a patient physically present to a facility for a nasopharyngeal swap to be collected. Unfortunately, access may be limited for patients that are homebound, chronically ill, or without a means of private transportation. By leveraging existing EMS infrastructure in new ways, our community has been able to keep almost 500 vulnerable patients in their home. Using EMS, we can strengthen the healthcare systems response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and support at-risk populations, including those that are underserved, homebound, and frail.","output":"Home-based Testing for SARS-CoV-2: Leveraging Prehospital Resources for Vulnerable Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are important individual differences in adaptation and reactivity to stressful challenges. Being subjected to strict social confinement is a distressful psychological experience leading to reduced emotional well-being, but it is not known how it can affect the cognitive and empathic tendencies of different individuals. Cortisol, a key glucocorticoid in humans, is a strong modulator of brain function, behavior, and cognition, and the diurnal cortisol rhythm has been postulated to interact with environmental stressors to predict stress adaptation. The present study investigates in 45 young adults (21.09 years old, SD = 6.42) whether pre-pandemic diurnal cortisol indices, overall diurnal cortisol secretion (AUCg) and cortisol awakening response (CAR) can predict individuals' differential susceptibility to the impact of strict social confinement during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on working memory, empathy, and perceived stress. We observed that, following long-term home confinement, there was an increase in subjects' perceived stress and cognitive empathy scores, as well as an improvement in visuospatial working memory. Moreover, during confinement, resilient coping moderated the relationship between perceived stress scores and pre-pandemic AUCg and CAR. In addition, in mediation models, we observed a direct effect of AUCg and an indirect effect of both CAR and AUCg, on change in perceived self-efficacy. These effects were parallelly mediated by the increase in working memory span and cognitive empathy. In summary, our findings reveal the role of the diurnal pattern of cortisol in predicting the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential biomarker for the identification of at-risk groups following public health crises.","output":"Differential Susceptibility to the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Working Memory, Empathy, and Perceived Stress: The Role of Cortisol and Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bangladesh is a lower-middle-income country affected by a severe lack of mental health service availability due to a scarcity of mental health experts, limited mental health literacy, and community stigma. In other low and middle-income countries, the online provision of mental health care services has addressed issues affecting service availability, accessibility, mass awareness of services, and stigma. OBJECTIVE: The current study sought to understand stakeholders' perceptions of the potential of digital media-based mental health care delivery in strengthening Bangladesh's mental health system. METHOD: Online in-depth interviews were conducted with seven psychiatrists and eleven people with lived experiences of mental health issues. In addition, two online focus groups were conducted with ten psychologists and nine mental health entrepreneurs. A thematic analysis of the audio transcriptions was used to identify themes. RESULT: Stakeholders perceived that the benefits of digital media-based mental health services included the potential of increasing the awareness, availability, and accessibility of mental health services. Participants recommended: the rehabilitation of existing pathways; the use of social media to raise awareness; and the implementation of strategies that integrate different digital-based services to strengthen the mental health system and foster positive mental health-seeking behaviors. CONCLUSION: Growing mental health awareness, combined with the appropriate use of digital media as a platform for distributing information and offering mental services, can help to promote mental health care.

There is a crucial demand for rapid techniques such as antigen detection test. Considering the different diagnostic accuracy of tests with other respiratory viruses in adults and children, SARS-CoV-2 antigen test must be evaluated specifically in children. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott) as a point-of-care test for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to RT-qPCR in a pediatric population. RESULTS: Four hundred forty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. Amongst the 18 positive RT-qPCR samples, 14 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 77.7%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also positive with RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device is lower in children than in adults. Nevertheless, considering the good values of specificity, negative and positive predictive values this test could be used as a frontline test to obtain quick results, although the negative values with COVID-19 high clinical suspicion should be confirmed using RT-qPCR.","output":"Think of the Children: Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test in Pediatric Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza A (AI) viruses of subtypes H5 can cause serious disease outbreaks in poultry including panzootic due to H5N1 highly pathogenic (HP) viruses. These viruses are a threat not only for animal health but also public health due to their zoonotic potential. The domestic duck plays a major role in the epidemiological cycle of influenza virus subtypes H5 but little is known concerning host/pathogen interactions during influenza infection in duck species. In this study, a subtracted library from duck trachea (a primary site of influenza virus infection) was constructed to analyse and compare the host response after a highly or low pathogenic (LP) H5N1-infection. RESULTS: Here, we show that more than 200 different genes were differentially expressed in infected duck trachea to a significant degree. In addition, significant differentially expressed genes between LPAI- and HPAI-infected tracheas were observed. Gene ontology annotation was used and specific signalling pathways were identified. These pathways were different for LPAI and HPAI-infected tracheas, except for the CXCR4 signalling pathway which is implicated in immune response. A different modulation of genes in the CXCR4 signalling pathway and TRIM33 was induced in duck tracheas infected with a HPAI- or a LPAI-H5N1. CONCLUSION: First, this study indicates that Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) is an alternative approach to gain insights into the pathogenesis of influenza infection in ducks. Secondly, the results indicate that cellular gene expression in the duck trachea was differently modulated after infection with a LPAI-H5N1 or after infection with a HPAI-H5N1 virus. Such difference found in infected trachea, a primary infection site, could precede continuation of infection and could explain appearance of respiratory symptoms or not.","output":"Differential cellular gene expression in duck trachea infected with a highly or low pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Identification of patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring hospital admission or at high-risk of in-hospital mortality is essential to guide patient triage and to provide timely treatment for higher risk hospitalized patients. METHODS: A retrospective multi-centre (8 hospital) cohort at Beaumont Health, Michigan, USA, reporting on COVID-19 patients diagnosed between 1 March and 1 April 2020 was used for score validation. The COVID-19 Risk of Complications Score was automatically computed by the EHR. Multivariate logistic regression models were built to predict hospital admission and in-hospital mortality using individual variables constituting the score. Validation was performed using both discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: Compared to Green scores, Yellow Scores (OR: 5.72) and Red Scores (OR: 19.1) had significantly higher odds of admission (both p < .0001). Similarly, Yellow Scores (OR: 4.73) and Red Scores (OR: 13.3) had significantly higher odds of in-hospital mortality than Green Scores (both p < .0001). The cross-validated C-Statistics for the external validation cohort showed good discrimination for both hospital admission (C = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.77C0.81)) and in-hospital mortality (C = 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71C0.78)).

The RECOVERY (Randomised Trials in COVID-19 Therapy) trial provided data on the mortality benefits of corticosteroids. The study aimed to determine the association between corticosteroid use on mortality and infection rates and to define subgroups who may benefit from corticosteroids in a real-world setting. METHODS: Clinical data were extracted that included demographic, laboratory data and details of the therapy, including the administration of corticosteroids, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and anticoagulation. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation. Outcomes were compared in patients who did and did not receive corticosteroids using the multivariate Cox regression model. RESULTS: 4313 patients were hospitalised with COVID-19 during the study period, of whom 1270 died (29.4%). When administered within the first 7 days after admission, corticosteroids were associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97, p=0.03) and decreased transfers to the ICU (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.11, p=0.02).

We aimed to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence system using chest x-rays and clinical data to predict disease severity and progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We did a retrospective study in multiple hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia, PA, USA, and Brown University affiliated hospitals in Providence, RI, USA. Patients who presented to a hospital in the University of Pennsylvania Health System via the emergency department, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and with an available chest x-ray from their initial presentation or admission, were retrospectively identified and randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets (7:1:2). Using the chest x-rays as input to an EfficientNet deep neural network and clinical data, models were trained to predict the binary outcome of disease severity (ie, critical or non-critical). The deep-learning features extracted from the model and clinical data were used to build time-to-event models to predict the risk of disease progression. The models were externally tested on patients who presented to an independent multicentre institution, Brown University affiliated hospitals, and compared with severity scores provided by radiologists. FINDINGS: 1834 patients who presented via the University of Pennsylvania Health System between March 9 and July 20, 2020, were identified and assigned to the model training (n=1285), validation (n=183), or testing (n=366) sets. 475 patients who presented via the Brown University affiliated hospitals between March 1 and July 18, 2020, were identified for external testing of the models. When chest x-rays were added to clinical data for severity prediction, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) increased from 0821 (95% CI 0796-0828) to 0846 (0815-0852; p<00001) on internal testing and 0731 (0712-0738) to 0792 (0780-0 803; p<00001) on external testing. When deep-learning features were added to clinical data for progression prediction, the concordance index (C-index) increased from 0769 (0755-0786) to 0805 (0800-0820; p<00001) on internal testing and 0707 (0695-0729) to 0752 (0739-0764; p<00001) on external testing. The image and clinical data combined model had significantly better prognostic performance than combined severity scores and clinical data on internal testing (C-index 0805 vs 0781; p=00002) and external testing (C-index 0752 vs 0715; p<00001). INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19, artificial intelligence based on chest x-rays had better prognostic performance than clinical data or radiologist-derived severity scores. Using artificial intelligence, chest x-rays can augment clinical data in predicting the risk of progression to critical illness in patients with COVID-19.

Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of feces revealed 36 viruses from 18 families and 21 genera, including at least 6 novel viruses and 3 novel genera. A representative screen of 15 viruses by PCR confirmed the presence of 13 of these viruses in liver.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The medical records of 31 (20 male, 11 female) cases (with 38 eyes) who underwent secondary IAC and/or IVC between February 2010 and June 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Thirteen (41.9%) cases had unilateral and 18 (58.1%) had bilateral RB. According to the International Classification of RB, 6 (15.8%) eyes had group B, 9 (23.7%) eyes had group C, 16 (42.1%) eyes had group D, and 7 (18.4%) eyes had group E RB at diagnosis. All patients underwent six-cycle intravenous chemotherapy as primary treatment and 8 eyes received external radiotherapy before IAC/IVC. Secondary IAC was performed in 21 (55.3%) eyes, IVC in 10 (26.3%) eyes, and IAC + IVC in 7 (18.4%) eyes. External radiotherapy was applied in 2 (5.3%) eyes after IAC/IVC, one of which was later enucleated. In total, 17 (44.7%) eyes undergoing secondary IAC/IVC treatments were enucleated. Metastasis and death were not observed in any case during the mean follow-up period of 59.3 (median 61, range: 10-98) months. DISCUSSION Although 60.5% of the eyes undergoing IAC/IVC consisted of groups D and E RB, globe salvage and survival rates were 55.3% and 100.0%, respectively. External radiotherapy was required in 5.3% of the eyes after IAC/IVC. In conclusion, IAC and IVC are safe and effective treatment methods in eyes with RB unresponsive to other eye-preserving treatments and those demonstrating recurrence.","output":"Secondary intra-arterial chemotherapy and/or intravitreal chemotherapy as salvage treatment for retinoblastoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging studies increasingly demonstrate the importance of the throat and salivary glands as sites of virus replication and transmission in early COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, characterised by an outer lipid membrane derived from the host cell from which it buds. While, it is highly sensitive to agents that disrupt lipid bio-membranes, there has been no discussion about the potential role of oral rinsing in preventing transmission. Here, we review known mechanisms of viral lipid membrane disruption by widely available dental mouthwash components that include ethanol, chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, hydrogen peroxide and povidone-iodine. We also assess existing formulations for their potential ability to disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 lipid envelope, based on their concentrations of these agents, and conclude that several deserve clinical evaluation. We highlight that already published research on other enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, directly support the idea that oral rinsing should be considered as a potential way to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Research to test this could include evaluating existing or specifically-tailored new formulations in well-designed viral inactivation assays, then in clinical trials. Population-based interventions could be undertaken with available mouthwashes, with active monitoring of outcome to determine efficacy.

The pandemic has made a significant impact on the way we behave and interact in our daily life. The past year has witnessed a strong interplay between human behaviors and epidemic spreading. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic framework to study the coupled evolutions of herd behaviors and epidemics. Our framework extends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over complex networks by coupling it with the evolutionary game dynamics. The statistically equivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity intensities based on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the epidemics. Meanwhile, the spreading of the infectious disease over the complex network is reciprocally influenced by the players' social activities. We analyze the coupled dynamics by studying the stationary properties of the epidemic for a given herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given epidemic process. The decisions of the herd turn out to be strategic substitutes. We formulate an equivalent finite-player game and an equivalent network to represent the interactions among the finite populations. We develop structure-preserving approximation techniques to study time-dependent properties of the joint evolution of the behavioral and epidemic dynamics. The resemblance between the simulated coupled dynamics and the real COVID-19 statistics in the numerical experiments indicates the predictive power of our framework.","output":"Herd Behaviors in Epidemics: A Dynamics-Coupled Evolutionary Games Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to investigate if and how disordered gaming, loneliness, and family relations have changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic (from 2019 to 2021), and if there were any changes in the association between these variables across three samples of gamers (for each respective year). Samples from 2019, 2020, and 2021 were matched by using propensity score matching across socio-demographic characteristics. The total effective sample comprised 897 gamers (N = 299 per year).

ANCOVAs showed that while IGD and GD scores have increased significantly during the pandemic years, loneliness and family harmony did not change significantly. However, the correlation differences tests in correlations between IGD/GD and loneliness and family harmony showed that the correlations between both IGD and GD with loneliness as well as poorer family harmony have increased during the pandemic years. This study provides empirical evidence that the well-being of gamers might have been negatively affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the UK, a critical player in the oversight of port health is the Health Protection Agency (HPA), which became a non-Departmental public body in 2005. A major part of port health is preparedness, a set of techniques aimed at managing, and responding to, emergencies of public health concern. More recently, certain jurisdictions have embarked on public health preparedness work across a number of different geographical scales. Using methods pioneered by the military, this form of distributed preparedness is of increased interest to social science and medical scholars. With reference to case studies conducted in localities surrounding two UK regional airports following the 2009C10 H1N1 influenza pandemic, we consider the extent to which distributed preparedness as a concept and a set of practices can inform current debates - in the UK, and beyond - concerning interventions at the border within.","output":"Model of health?

We aimed to determine the incidence of acute rheumatic fever in northern and western Uganda. METHODS For our prospective epidemiological study, we established acute rheumatic fever clinics at two regional hospitals in the north (Lira district) and west (Mbarara district) of Uganda and instituted a comprehensive acute rheumatic fever health messaging campaign. Communities and health-care workers were encouraged to refer children aged 3-17 years, with suspected acute rheumatic fever, for a definitive diagnosis using the Jones Criteria. Children were referred if they presented with any of the following: (1) history of fever within the past 48 h in combination with any joint complaint, (2) suspicion of acute rheumatic carditis, or (3) suspicion of chorea. We excluded children with a confirmed alternative diagnosis. We estimated incidence rates among children aged 5-14 years and characterised clinical features of definite and possible acute rheumatic fever cases. FINDINGS Data were collected between Jan 17, 2018, and Dec 30, 2018, in Lira district and between June 5, 2019, and Feb 28, 2020, in Mbarara district. Of 1075 children referred for evaluation, 410 (38%) met the inclusion criteria; of these, 90 (22%) had definite acute rheumatic fever, 82 (200%) had possible acute rheumatic fever, and 24 (6%) had rheumatic heart disease without evidence of acute rheumatic fever. Additionally, 108 (26%) children had confirmed alternative diagnoses and 106 (26%) had an unknown alternative diagnosis. We estimated the incidence of definite acute rheumatic fever among children aged 5-14 years as 25 cases (95% CI 137-303) per 100 000 person-years in Lira district (north) and 13 cases (71-210) per 100 000 person-years in Mbarara district (west). INTERPRETATION To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based study to estimate the incidence of acute rheumatic fever in sub-Saharan Africa. Given the known rheumatic heart disease burden, it is likely that only a proportion of children with acute rheumatic fever were diagnosed. These data dispel the long-held hypothesis that the condition does not exist in sub-Saharan Africa and compel investment in improving prevention, recognition, and diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever.

As the most reliable epidemic diagnosis, we propose the PCR test positive rate. Examining the COVID-19 epidemic in Tokyo shows that the positive rate follows the epidemic accurately, without being affected by medical institution closures or the psychology of people. By comparing with the change of the positive rate, we argue that the psychology of people was the cause of the observed asymmetry and shallow valleys in the number of confirmed cases. We discuss that the positive rate as large as 1-5% in the valleys of the epidemic implies that many people are already infected and immune. The observed fact that the positive rate followed the number of positives accurately and the value lower than those reported in the test-negative design studies of influenza are attributable to the governments policy of finding as many patients as possible.

Here, we characterized the TCR repertoire of MIS-C patients and found a profound expansion of TCR eta Variable gene (TRBV)11-2, with up to 24% of clonal T cell space occupied by TRBV11-2 T cells, which correlated with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels. Analysis of TRBJ gene usage and CDR3 length distribution of MIS-C expanded TRBV11-2 clones revealed extensive junctional diversity. Patients with TRBV11-2 expansion showed HLA class I allele restriction to HLA-I A02, C35 and C04, indicating a novel mechanism for CDR3-independent T cell expansion. In silico modelling indicated that polyacidic residues in the V chain encoded by TRBV11-2 strongly interact with the superantigen-like motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, suggesting that unprocessed SARS-CoV-2 spike may directly mediate TRBV11-2 expansion.

Changes in bispect (BIS) index, heart rates, and doses of anesthetics used for induction were also recorded. RESULTS Baseline plasma concentrations of BDNF did not differ between group A and group B; 15 minutes after induction, concentrations of plasma BDNF were significantly reduced in group A. Twenty-four hours after surgery, the concentration was still higher in group B than in group A. In contrast, plasma concentrations of BDNF at other time points tested did not differ between the two groups.

METHODS: National data were used to calculate the weekly and monthly CFRs, stratified by three age groups: 0-64, 65-79, and 80+ years. We also calculated the standardized mortality ratios (SMR) to offset the differences in age composition. RESULTS: The epidemic consisted of the initial wave, a trough in June, and two conjoined summer waves, yielding 17 206 coronavirus disease 2019 cases and 290 deaths. While the number of confirmed cases nearly quadrupled during summer, case fatality estimates decreased; CFR in spring was 4.81 (95% confidence interval 3.91-5.71), compared with 1.24 (1.06-1.42) in summer. The SMR for summer was 0.45 (0.37-0.55), suggesting that the case fatality risk halved compared with spring. Cardiovascular comorbidity was an important risk factor for case fatality (SMR 2.63 [2.20-3.13] during spring and 1.28 [1.02-1.59] during summer).

METHODS From January 2003 through September 2014, a total of 49 CSdAVFs with ipsilateral IPS occlusion were identified in 49 patients, who then underwent endovascular treatment. Clinical and radiologic data were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Either transvenous (n = 38) or transarterial (n = 11) access was initially elected, the latter reserved for single-hole or dominant arterial feeder fistulas. Access via occluded ipsilateral IPS was usually attempted (n = 34) by transvenous approach, with a 54.3% success rate. Anterior (n = 3) or posterior (n = 1) facial vein was alternatively used. Direct surgical exposure of ophthalmic vein (n = 3) or radiosurgery (n = 4) was performed for access failure or unsuccessful occlusion by other means. In 46 fistulas (93.9%), complete occlusion was achieved, with no procedure-related morbidity or mortality.

METHODS: The official data for COVID-19, from March 2020 to March 2021 in the states of the Northeast Region (NE), were used. The analysis of capital cities and states for accumulated weekly cases and confirmed deaths was made using the JoinPoint Trend Analysis application. RESULTS: In one year, the Northeast region reported 22.9% of the cases and 21.5% of the deaths in the country due to C OVID-19. At the beginning of the pandemic, all states showed a growing number of cases, first in the capitals and then in the interior. Following this wave, decreases are observed in all states and their capitals, but with many still reporting a large number of cases. In the middle of the 2nd semester of 2020 the number of cases begins to increase again simultaneously in states and their capitals-some at explosive speed-especially in late 2020 and early 2021. A similar pattern is observed in deaths, which exceed or approach the peak seen in the first wave. In the first wave, all capitals and northeastern states adopted intense isolation measures.

Little is known about the current utilization of this strategy with non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. An international multicenter, survey study was conducted to identify what strategies are planned or in place for patients with COVID-19 who are not critically ill. The survey was distributed from March 23-29th, 2020 to GIM physicians in Canada, USA, Denmark, Singapore, Hong Kong, and England. Of the 31 hospitals, 29 (94%) indicated that they plan on cohorting all GIM patients with COVID-19 to one location in the hospital. Among these 29 hospitals, 23 (79%) had implemented the plan at the time of the survey. The primary reasons for this decision were to limit the spread of COVID-19 and conserve PPE use.

METHODS: This is a pre-post study that was conducted in Jordan in December 2020. An electronic questionnaire was used to assess the awareness, perception of community pharmacists towards AMS, and their ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic before and after the educational workshop. The two-days workshop was conducted on Zoom application. Analysis was conducted using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, McNemars test using SPSS version 22. RESULTS: During the study period, 100 community pharmacists attended the educational workshop. Pharmacists knowledge was assessed prior to their participation which revealed a relatively good knowledge score with a median score of 6/10 (IQR = 4); their scores have improved significantly following the educational workshop with a median score of 7/10 (IOR = 2), p-value<0.001. Although one-third of the participants knew the definition of AMS prior to the workshop, almost half of the respondents (n = 56, 56%) knew the definition after the educational workshop. Regarding community pharmacists ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic therapy, they showed a significant improvement in selecting the optimal antimicrobial for the virtual cases following the workshop (p-value < 0.05). Perceptions towards AMS were consistently positive before and after the workshop. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the benefit of AMS-focused workshops for improving community pharmacists knowledge and appropriate antibiotic prescribing. Thus, efforts are required to implement more AMS educational workshops for community pharmacists.","output":"Impact of Educational Intervention to Promote Jordanian Community Pharmacists Knowledge and Perception Towards Antimicrobial Stewardship: Pre-Post Interventional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We examined the perceptions of healthcare workers about the side-effects of COVID-19 vaccine and the types of side-effects they experienced in the post-vaccination period. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional survey research design was used in which a semi-structured questionnaire was distributed to collect quantitative data from healthcare workers in Southern Ethiopia that were selected on the basis of a multi-stage cluster sampling technique. After inserting the completed cases into SPSS software, descriptive statistical techniques, such as frequencies, percentages, charts and inferential statistical tool, particularly binary logistic regression analysis, were used to analyze and present the data. RESULTS: Majority (43.6%) of respondents perceive that COVID-19 vaccine will have muscle pain around the injection site, followed by fever (39.9%), problems of blood clots (37.8%), headache (35.6%), fatigue (33.5%), and aching limbs (16%). And 63.6%) of them reported that they have experienced muscle pain around the injection site after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, followed by fatigue (42%), headache (37.2%), fever (34.2%), redness around the injection site (21.6%), and swelling around the injection site (17.8%). Moreover, 25% reported that the fear of potential side-effects of COVID-19 vaccine inhibited them from taking the vaccine. Above all, it is found that respondents expectation of COVID-19 vaccine to have such serious side-effects is significantly associated to their educational status (OR = 0.229; P < 0.01; 95%C.I.: 0.080C0.651). CONCLUSION: While the expectations of most of the healthcare workers regarding the side-effects of the vaccine are parallel to the normal reactions of the vaccine, a significant proportion of the study participants have reported that they perceive COVID-19 vaccine will have life-threatening side-effects. Such fears have also played a role in affecting vaccine uptake.

We aim to quantify aerosolized particles during laryngology procedures to understand their potential for transmission of infectious aerosol-based diseases. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective quantification of aerosol generation. METHODS: Airborne particles (0.3-25 m in diameter) were measured during live-patient laryngology surgeries using an optical particle counter positioned 60 cm from the oral cavity to the surgeon's left. Measurements taken during the procedures were compared to baseline concentrations recorded immediately before each procedure. Procedures included direct laryngoscopy with general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA), direct laryngoscopy with jet ventilation, and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) laser use with or without jet ventilation, all utilizing intermittent suction. RESULTS: Greater than 99% of measured particles were 0.3 to 1.0 m in diameter. Compared to baseline, direct laryngoscopy was associated with a significant 6.71% increase in cumulative particles, primarily 0.3 to 1.0 m particles (P < .0001). 1.0 to 25 m particles significantly decreased (P < .001). Jet ventilation was not associated with a significant change in cumulative particles; when analyzing differential particle sizes, only 10 to 25 m particles exhibited a significant increase compared to baseline (+42.40%, P = .002). Significant increases in cumulative particles were recorded during CO2 laser use (+14.70%, P < .0001), specifically in 0.3 to 2.5 m particles. Overall, there was no difference when comparing CO2 laser use during jet ventilation versus GETA. CONCLUSIONS: CO2 laser use during laryngology surgery is associated with significant increases in airborne particles. Although direct laryngoscopy with GETA is associated with slight increases in particles, jet ventilation overall does not increase particle aerosolization.

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in combination with standard of care for the treatment of hospitalised adults with COVID-19. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, participants were enrolled from 101 centres across 12 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Hospitalised adults with COVID-19 receiving standard of care were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily baricitinib (4 mg) or matched placebo for up to 14 days. Standard of care included systemic corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, and antivirals, including remdesivir. The composite primary endpoint was the proportion who progressed to high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death by day 28, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. All-cause mortality by day 28 was a key secondary endpoint, and all-cause mortality by day 60 was an exploratory endpoint; both were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in the safety population defined as all randomly allocated participants who received at least one dose of study drug and who were not lost to follow-up before the first post-baseline visit. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04421027. FINDINGS: Between June 11, 2020, and Jan 15, 2021, 1525 participants were randomly assigned to the baricitinib group (n=764) or the placebo group (n=761). 1204 (793%) of 1518 participants with available data were receiving systemic corticosteroids at baseline, of whom 1099 (913%) were on dexamethasone; 287 (189%) participants were receiving remdesivir. Overall, 278% of participants receiving baricitinib and 305% receiving placebo progressed to meet the primary endpoint (odds ratio 085 [95% CI 067 to 108], p=018), with an absolute risk difference of ?27 percentage points (95% CI ?73 to 19). The 28-day all-cause mortality was 8% (n=62) for baricitinib and 13% (n=100) for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 057 [95% CI 041C078]; nominal p=00018), a 382% relative reduction in mortality; one additional death was prevented per 20 baricitinib-treated participants. The 60-day all-cause mortality was 10% (n=79) for baricitinib and 15% (n=116) for placebo (HR 062 [95% CI 047C083]; p=00050). The frequencies of serious adverse events (110 [15%] of 750 in the baricitinib group vs 135 [18%] of 752 in the placebo group), serious infections (64 [9%] vs 74 [10%]), and venous thromboembolic events (20 [3%] vs 19 [3%]) were similar between the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Although there was no significant reduction in the frequency of disease progression overall, treatment with baricitinib in addition to standard of care (including dexamethasone) had a similar safety profile to that of standard of care alone, and was associated with reduced mortality in hospitalised adults with COVID-19.

Some of the emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 have shown potential for causing serious disease and death, a threat that has been ameliorated by ensuring the vaccine coverage in populations. Still, the vaccine coverage remains unsatisfactory in certain populations. Hence, understanding and working on the factors which affect acceptance of the vaccine amongst the public can be considered a priority for public health as much as ensuring availability of the vaccines. OBJECTIVE: This research work aims to build and validate a scale to assess the public attitude towards COVID vaccination. The proposed scale has been named as COVID Vaccination Attitude Scale (C-VAS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-stage process was used to develop the C-VAS which includes (1) item generation (deductive and inductive approach); (2) itemCrefinement (pre-testing and pilot testing, exploratory factor analysis (EFA); and (3) scale validation (confirmatory factor analysis, CFA). The sample size used for this research was 840. In order to overcome the issue of common method bias, the data was collected in two phases. The sample n1 (411) was used for EFA and the sample n2 (429) was employed for undertaking CFA. Common method bias was assessed to check if variations in responses are caused by the instrument instead of the actual dispositions of the respondents. Items of the scale were taken by reviewing the extant literature about vaccination, from the relevant established theories such as health belief model and by interviewing with domain experts. The content validity of the scale was determined. RESULTS: EFA extracted five factors, labelled as Perceived Benefits, Perceived Barriers, Perceived Severity, Health Motivation and Perceived Risk. To further validate the factorCitem structure CFA was performed. CONCLUSION: The measurement model was assessed by applying CFA to examine the reliability, accuracy and validity of the scale. Development of this scale can help in understanding factors that affect vaccine acceptability behavior. This can be used in promoting COVID vaccine coverage in countries and societies which still have low vaccination rates especially due to lack of acceptance of the vaccine. This scale also has the potential to understand public behavior in relation to similar future outbreaks and the acceptance of the mitigatory vaccines.","output":"Public Attitude Towards COVID-19 Vaccination: Validation of COVID-Vaccination Attitude Scale (C-VAS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2020 will be remembered as the year of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic which confined most of the world's population at home Rehabilitation units will have to face specific challenges to protect the vulnerable in-patients Moreover, they must prepare for post-COVID-19 patients who might suffer from illness consequences or present a post intensive care syndrome secondary to the increased ICU length of stay The purpose of this paper is to highlight the deficiencies of post-COVID-19 patients and suggest a decision algorithm to best match their needs","output":"[Role of physical and rehabilitation medicine in the aftermath of SARS-CoV-2 disease]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To describe clinical and demographic characteristics of youths who seek help at the first Headspace centre in Israel and their families.

Therefore, we described the clinical characteristics, laboratory features, treatment and outcomes of CVD complicating SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes were collected and analysed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with COVID-19 with or without new-onset CVD were compared. RESULTS: Of 219 patients with COVID-19, 10 (4.6%) developed acute ischaemic stroke and 1 (0.5%) had intracerebral haemorrhage. COVID-19 with new onset of CVD were significantly older (75.710.8 years vs 52.115.3 years, p<0.001), more likely to present with severe COVID-19 (81.8% vs 39.9%, p<0.01) and were more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes and medical history of CVD (all p<0.05). In addition, they were more likely to have increased inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state as reflected in C reactive protein (51.1 (1.3-127.9) vs 12.1 (0.1-212.0) mg/L, p<0.05) and D-dimer (6.9 (0.3-20.0) vs 0.5 (0.1-20.0) mg/L, p<0.001).

Since NfL are not expressed in muscle, elevated sNfL in patients with primary myopathies suggest additional nervous system involvement. To verify this hypothesis, we measured sNfL in a series of patients with myopathies. Methods: sNfL were determined in 62 patients with molecular proven primary myopathies in whom some nervous system involvement may be predicted: myotonic dystrophy type I and II (DM I, II) and mitochondrial disease. In addition, sNfL were measured in 8 patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and in a disease control group caused by genetic defects exclusively expressed in muscle. Results: sNfL values were significantly elevated in the DM I, the DM II and the mitochondrial group, with FSHD patients showing the lowest sNfL elevations. sNfL levels in the disease control group were not different from the healthy controls. A significant correlation between repeat length and sNfL levels was found in the DM I patients, but not in the DM II patients. Mitochondrial patients with encephalopathy showed significantly higher sNfL concentrations compared to patients with only muscular symptoms. Conclusion: sNfL levels are elevated in myopathies with, based on the underlying molecular defect or clinical features, established nervous system involvement, i.e., myotonic dystrophies and mitochondrial disorders. sNfL were also raised in FSHD, where involvement of the nervous system is not usually clinically apparent.

Thus, during the last year, drastic changes occurred in everyday life of every human being. Following social distancing and economic insecurity, significant increases in mental health concerns (loneliness, anxiety, depression, or insomnia) have developed [2]. Aims: The objective of this study was to explore the sleep quality in students and employees, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data collection occurred between February and March 2021. The online survey included questions regarding socio-demographic characteristics, COVID-19 status, and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) [3]. Snowball sampling was conducted to recruit participants and the survey was shared through social media networking. 620 responses were validated. The analysis was carried out using SPSS Statistics. The Chi-Square test, the corresponding corrections (when the criteria were not met - Likelihood ratio, Fisher test) and Phi and Cramer V parameters were used to verify the interval combinations;the t-independent test with the reporting of the degrees of release, the difference of the means, the Levenes test for the homogeneity test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests for the subgroups under 30 respondents and the confidence interval set at 95%. Results: 74.8% of the respondents were female and most of them were young adults (18 and 35 years - 82.4%). 53.4% were students, while 46.6% were employees. 91.8% lived in urban areas. The average working hours per week was 20-40 hours (32.9%). Regarding COVID-19 disease, 16% were infected, of which 65% had a mild form. Women reported more frequent by impairment of total sleep duration (p=0.032, df=3, Phi=0.119, moderate correlation) and overall poorer quality of sleep (p=0.042, df=3, Phi=0.115, moderate correlation). AIS scores were significantly higher for women, (Mean Differences-1,027: women's mean score=6.39, men s mean score =5.37), p=0.007. The frequency of awakenings during night increase with age (p<0.001, df=6, Phi=0.248, strong correlation), as well as awakenings earlier than the desired time (p=0.004, df=6, Phi=0.202, strong correlation). Drowsiness during the day is more prevalent at younger ages (p<0.001, df=6, Phi=0.251, large association). In student population, the sleep induction is more affected (p=0.013, df=3, Phi=0.132, moderate association). Also, the perception of physical and mental functioning (p<0.001, df=3, Phi=0.206, strong association) and sleepiness during daytime (p<0.001, df=3, Phi=0.189, strong association) are more prevalent. In contrast, awakenings during the night are more prevalent among employees (p<0.001, df=3, Phi=0.185, strong association). The final awakening was found to be earlier than desired (p=0.002, df=3, Phi=0.155, strong association). Overall, the AIS results are not significant by different between groups (p=0.140, df=1). Conclusion: Students have experienced more frequently next day consequences of insomnia, while for workers awakenings during the night and early morning awakening were more prevalent. Regarding sociodemographic factors, AIS score was significantly higher among women and awakenings during the night were a sleep disturbance associated with ageing. This online survey suffers from two methodological limitations: limited access to certain portals, and participation biases (respondents may select themselves into the sample), thus more research on insomnia during a pandemic crisis is necessary.

We demonstrated that men exposed to prolonged environmental or clinically recognized local heat stress in adulthood may suffer from dysregulation of seminal antioxidant components, which can be directly associated with epididymal and prostate function. The comparative analysis of the studied parameters showed numerous correlations among all biochemical parameters (particularly neutral alpha-glucosidase) with low standard semen quality in almost all the investigated infertile groups.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020 is testing economic resilience and surge capacity of healthcare providers worldwide. At the time of writing, positive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains the only method for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. Rapid upscaling of national SARS-CoV-2 genome testing presented challenges: (1) Unpredictable supply chains of reagents and kits for virus inactivation, RNA extraction and PCR-detection of viral genomes. (2) Rapid time to result of <24 h is required in order to facilitate timely infection control measures.Hypothesis. Extraction-free sample processing would impact commercially available SARS-CoV-2 genome detection methods.Aim. We evaluated whether alternative commercially available kits provided sensitivity and accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 genome detection comparable to those used by regional National Healthcare Services (NHS).Methodology. We tested several detection methods and tested whether detection was altered by heat inactivation, an approach for rapid one-step viral inactivation and RNA extraction without chemicals or kits.Results. Using purified RNA, we found the CerTest VIASURE kit to be comparable to the Altona RealStar system currently in use, and further showed that both diagnostic kits performed similarly in the BioRad CFX96 and Roche LightCycler 480 II machines. Additionally, both kits were comparable to a third alternative using a combination of Quantabio qScript one-step Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) mix and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-accredited N1 and N2 primer/probes when looking specifically at borderline samples. Importantly, when using the kits in an extraction-free protocol, following heat inactivation, we saw differing results, with the combined Quantabio-CDC assay showing superior accuracy and sensitivity. In particular, detection using the CDC N2 probe following the extraction-free protocol was highly correlated to results generated with the same probe following RNA extraction and reported clinically (n=127; R2=0.9259).Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that sample treatment can greatly affect the downstream performance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits, with varying impact depending on the kit. We also showed that one-step heat-inactivation methods could reduce time from swab receipt to outcome of test result. Combined, these findings present alternatives to the protocols in use and can serve to alleviate any arising supply-chain issues at different points in the workflow, whilst accelerating testing, and reducing cost and environmental impact.","output":"Comparative effects of viral-transport-medium heat inactivation upon downstream SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the point of nasal entry is a novel strategy that has the potential to help contain the ongoing pandemic.

Therefore, an effort that is considered effective in finding therapeutic agents is needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection. One of the steps that can be chosen is by utilizing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from animal venom by targeting the specific receptor of SARS-CoV-2, namely the main protease (Mpro). Through this research, a computational approach will be conducted to predict antiviral activity, including protein-peptide docking using PatchDock algorithm, to identify, evaluate, and explore the affinity and molecular interactions of four types of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as Mucroporin, Mucroporin-M1, Mucroporin-S1, and Mucroporin-S2 derived from scorpion venom (Lychas mucronatus) against main protease (Mpro) SARS-CoV-2. These results were then confirmed using protein-peptide interaction dynamics simulations for 50 ns using Gromacs 2016 to observe the molecular stability to the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Based on protein-peptide docking simulations, it was proven that the Mucroporin S-1 peptides have a good affinity against the active site area of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with an ACE score of ?779.56 kJ/mol. Interestingly, Mucroporin-S1 was able to maintain the stability of its interactions based on the results of RMSD, RMSF, and MM/PBSA binding free energy calculations.

OBJECTIVE We aim to test whether DKK1 induced protein signature obtained in vitro were associated with markers of AD pathology as used in the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework as well as with clinical outcomes. METHODS We first overexpressed DKK1 in HEK293A cells and quantified 1,128 proteins in cell lysates using aptamer capture arrays (SomaScan) to obtain a protein signature induced by DKK1. We then used the same assay to measure the DKK1-signature proteins in human plasma in two large cohorts, EMIF (n = 785) and ANM (n = 677). RESULTS We identified a 100-protein signature induced by DKK1 in vitro. Subsets of proteins, along with age and apolipoprotein E ?4 genotype distinguished amyloid pathology (A + T-N-, A+T+N-, A+T-N+, and A+T+N+) from no AD pathology (A-T-N-) with an area under the curve of 0.72, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. Furthermore, we found that some signature proteins (e.g., Complement C3 and albumin) were associated with cognitive score and AD diagnosis in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Our results add further evidence for a role of DKK regulation of Wnt signaling in AD and suggest that DKK1 induced signature proteins obtained in vitro could reflect theATNframework as well as predict disease severity and progression in vivo.","output":"Dickkopf-1 Overexpression in vitro Nominates Candidate Blood Biomarkers Relating to Alzheimer's Disease Pathology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is generally considered that photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) cannot be enhanced concurrently, as they are dependent on competitive photophysical processes at the single molecular level.

Various animal models have been established to investigate HCoV infection, including mice and non-human primates. To establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans, an organotypic human airway culture system, that recapitulates the human airway epithelium, has been developed. Currently, different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways, including the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) human airway epithelium (HAE) model. Tracheobronchial HAE cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses while the alveolar model allows for elucidation of mechanisms involved in viral infection and pathogenesis in the alveoli. These organotypic human airway cultures represent a universal platform to study respiratory virus-host interaction by offering more detailed insights compared to cell lines. Additionally, the epidemic potential of this virus family highlights the need for both vaccines and antivirals.

However, the cause for this enhanced susceptibility remains unclear, and the effects of HIV on pulmonary perfusion and ventilation are unknown. METHODS: We used PET-CT in 46 smokers and non-smokers, 23 of whom had documented HIV infection. Emphysema was assessed by CT and perfusion by nitrogen-13 (13NN) PET scans. After removal of image noise, vertical and axial gradients in perfusion were calculated. We tested for differences in the total spatial heterogeneity of perfusion (CV2Qtotal) and its components (CV2Qtotal = CV2Qvgrad (vertical gradient) + CV2Qzgrad (axial gradient) + CV2Qr (residual heterogeneity)) among groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographic parameters among groups, and all subjects had minimal radiographic evidence of emphysema. Compared to controls, non-smokers living with HIV had a significantly greater CV2 Qr/ CV2Qtotal (0.48 vs 0.36, P = 0.05) and reduced CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal (0.46 vs 0.65, P = 0.038). Smokers also had a reduced CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal, however, there was no significant difference in CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal between smokers living with and without HIV (0.39 vs 0.34, P = 0.58), despite a decreased vertical perfusion gradient (Qvgrad) in smokers living with HIV. CONCLUSION: In non-smokers living with well-controlled HIV and minimal radiographic emphysema, HIV infection contributes to pulmonary perfusion abnormalities similar to smokers.

This study aims to present the potential impacts of COVID-19 in this region and to model possible benefits of mitigation efforts. The COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics was used to estimate the probable evolution of COVID-19 in three scenarios: (i) no social distancing, (ii) social distancing in place at 50% effectiveness, and (iii) social distancing in place at 60% effectiveness. Projections of the number of inpatient hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and patients requiring ventilators were made for each scenario. Using the model described, it was predicted that peak case volume at 0% mitigation was to occur on April 30, 2020 at 11,553,566 infected individuals. Peak case volume at 50% mitigation was predicted to occur on June 1, 2020 with 5,970,093 infected individuals and on June 21, 2020 for 60% mitigation with 4,128,574 infected individuals. Occupancy rates in hospitals during peak periods at 0%, 50%, and 60% mitigation would be 875.9%, 322.8%, and 203.5%, respectively, when all inpatient beds are included. Under these scenarios, peak daily hospital admissions would be 40,438, 13,820, and 8,650. Additionally, 60% mitigation would result in a decrease in peak intensive care beds from 94,706 to 23,116 beds and a decrease in peak ventilator need from 67,889 to 17,087 units.

METHODS: Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit bed days, and non-intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources. RESULTS: Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below 50 000 per QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national income loss. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to claim that the hypothetical Imperial model-projected suppression policies are obviously cost-ineffective relative to the alternatives available.

Nutritional interventions to correct prisoner behaviour have been largely overlooked in the literature. Emerging evidence suggests that dietary intake influences aggressive behaviours and that nutritional supplementation with omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) could attenuate both the severity and frequency of aggressive behaviour. METHODS: Adult male prisoners who have a history of aggressive behaviour (n = 600) will be recruited from at least 6 Correctional Centres and randomised to receive either n-3 LCPUFA or placebo supplementation for a 16-week duration. Treatment will be with either 1 g/day of n-3 LCPUFA (694 mg DHA and 397 mg EPA) or placebo capsules, which are a corn/soy oil blend and are identical in size and colour. The primary outcome measure is the Inmate Behavioural Observation Scale (IBOS): an objective measure of aggressive behaviour. Secondary outcome measures include questionnaires (including aggression, attention deficit disorder, impulsivity, depression/anxiety/stress scales), engagement in programmes, recidivism and quality of life. Baseline and post-intervention assessments include the IBOS, questionnaires and blood to measure the levels of n-3 LCPUFA. DISCUSSION: To conclusively test the potential that increasing n-3 LCPUFA intakes can improve rates of prisoner aggression and associated mental health and violence-related social system management costs, we propose an adequately powered multi-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, examining the effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on aggressive behaviour in adult male prisoners.

Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the generalised prognostic role of small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) in malignancies, based on variable data from different studies. METHODS Four public databases were used to identify eligible studies. The association between prognostic indicators and clinical features was extracted and pooled to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Publication bias was measured using Begg's test and Egger's test, and the stability of pooled results were measured using sensitivity analysis. Additionally, an online database based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was screened to further validate our results. Ultimately, we predicted the molecular regulation of SNHG15 based on the public databases. RESULTS In total, 11 studies including 1087 patients were ultimately enrolled in our meta-analysis. We found that SNHG15 overexpression was associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and this was validated in the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) cohort. Moreover, increased SNHG15 expression suggested advanced TNM stage and LNM, but was not associated with age, gender, or tumour size. No publication bias or instability of the results was observed. SNHG15 was significantly upregulated in seven cancers and elevated expression of SNHG15 indicated shorter OS and DFS in five malignancies based on the validation using the GEPIA cohort.

We use this observation to argue that incidents like the COVID-19 pandemic reveal the ambiguity and permeability of the divide between normal and abnormal functioning, while recommending more humanistic perspectives on individual distress.","output":"Were All Going Crazy Now: How the COVID-19 Pandemic Can Promote More Compassionate Clinical Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored experiences with telemedicine among persons with HIV (PWH) during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A convenience sample of adults (>18 years) receiving care in an urban clinic in Atlanta were invited to participate.

Demographic, plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ T-cell count data were obtained via medical chart abstraction. Bootstrapped t-tests and Chi-square tests were used to examine differences in patient experiences by age, sex and race. Of 406 PWH contacted, 101 completed the survey (median age 55 years, 84% male, 77% Black, 98% virally-suppressed, median CD4 count 572 cells/L). The main HIV care disruptions experienced were delays in follow-up visits (40%), difficulty getting viral load measured (35%), and difficulty accessing antiretroviral therapy (21%). Participant ratings for quality (median score 6.5/7), usefulness (median score 6.0/7), and satisfaction (median score 6.3/7) with telemedicine were high. However, 28% of patients expressed concerns about providers' ability to examine them and about the lack of laboratory tests. More women had concerns about providers' ability to examine them (92% vs. 50%, p = 0.005) and about the safety of their personal information (69% vs. 23%, p = 0.002) compared to men. No age or race differences were observed. While PWH are generally satisfied with telephone-based telemedicine, concerns with its use were notable, particularly among women.

Befor the Covid-19 virus struck, the new face of the digital transformation and the rise of the 'platform' economy already raised existential questions for future welfare provision. The Great Lockdown - if anything - is bound to accelerate these trends. Greater automation will reinforce working from home to reduce Covid-19 virus transmission risks. At the same time, the Great Lockdown will reinforce inequality, as the poor find it more difficult to work from home, while low-paid workers in essential service in health care, supermarket retail, postal services, security and waste disposal, continue to face contagion risks. And although popular conjectures of 'jobless growth' and 'routine-biased' job polarization, driven by digitization and artificial intelligence, may still be overblown, intrusive change in the nature of work and employment relations require fundamental rethinking of extant labour market regulation and social protection.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective pilot study from 11/2018-3/2020 within an integrated health system. Patients 50-85 years with newly elevated glycemic parameters without prior history of diabetes were invited to complete a three-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography pancreas-protocol scan while participating in the Prospective Study to Establish a New-Onset Hyperglycemia and Diabetes (NOD) Cohort. Abnormal pancreatic findings, incidental extra-pancreatic findings, as well as subsequent clinical evaluation were identified. Variability in clinical reporting between medical centers based on descriptors of pancreatic duct and parenchyma was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 130 of 147 (88.4%) participants consented to imaging; 93 scans were completed (prior to COVID-19 stay-at-home order). Median age was 62.4 years (IQR 56.3, 68.8), 37.6% female; Hispanic (39.8%), White (29.0%), Black (14.0%), and Asian (13.3%). One (1.1%) case of pancreatic cancer (stage IV) was diagnosed, 12/93 (12.9%) participants had additional pancreatic findings: 5 fatty infiltration, 3 cysts, 2 atrophy, 1 divisum, 1 calcification. There were 57 extra-pancreatic findings among 52/93 (56%) unique patients, 12/57 (21.1%) prompted clinical evaluation with 2 additional malignancies diagnosed (non-small cell lung, renal oncocytoma). Reports from one participating medical center more frequently provided description of pancreatic parenchyma and ducts (92.9% vs. 18.4%), P<0.0001.

As a result, home-based patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI) are not only less able to go out, but they may have difficulty in easily receiving long-term care services. There are concerns that their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) may have deteriorated. We aimed to clarify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on HRQOL in home-based patients with SCI.In June 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was finally settling down in Japan, we conducted a mail survey of 266 patients with SCI regarding changes in the frequency of going out, the long-term care services, and their HRQOL due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They had all been discharged from our hospital (Rehabilitation medical center) by 2019, and were expected to be living at home. We received answers from 135 patients about their HRQOL. FINDINGS Respondent characteristics indicated that many of them were elderly (74.1% were over 60 years of age) and many had cervical SCI (70.5%). Worsened HRQOL since the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by 40% of respondents. The most commonly reported dimension was pain/discomfort. Significantly, many had been injured comparatively recently and had reduced frequency of going out and receiving home-visit nursing or rehabilitation services than patients whose HRQOL was unchanged. CONCLUSION/ CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study clarifies the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on HRQOL in home-based patients with SCI. Many respondents had worsened HRQOL, in particular pain/discomfort. It was suggested that the decrease in the frequency of going out may be one of the factors that affected the deterioration of their HRQOL.","output":"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health-related quality of life in home-based patients with spinal cord injuries in Japan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to presence of secondary bioactive metabolites, natural compounds are considered a major source of new active molecules that can be developed as new drugs.

It further ensured that clinicians time was spent more efficiently and minimised the risk of people moving between wards. Feedback was sought throughout and the ward round was adapted accordingly. Post-ward round feedback was sought by distributing a questionnaire to those directly involved. The questionnaire comprised nine questions comparing before and after the ward rounds were implemented.ResultsResults showed a considerable improvement following the ward round. Staff felt more prepared, more confident, reassured with decision making, better informed and witnessed improved team working and clear leadership. In addition staff spent less time on the ward, therefore reducing the risk of contracting/transmitting COVID.

Manufacturers have begun using BPA-free alternatives instead of BPA in many consumer products. However, these alternatives have had much less testing and oversight, yet they are already being mass-produced and used across industries from plastics to food-contact coatings. Here, we used human female adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), a type of adult mesenchymal stem cell, to compare the effects of BPA and BPA alternatives on adipogenesis or fat cell development in vitro. We focused on two commonly used BPA replacements, bisphenol AF (BPAF) and tetramethyl bisphenol F (TMBPF; monomer of the new valPure V70 food-contact coating). Human ASCs were differentiated into adipocytes using chemically defined media in the presence of control differentiation media with and without 17-estradiol (E2; 10 M), or with increasing doses of BPA (0, 0.1 and 1 M), BPAF (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 nM), or TMBPF (0, 0.01 and 0.1 M). After differentiation, the cells were stained and imaged to visualize and quantify the accumulation of lipid vacuoles and number of developing fat cells. Treated cells were also examined for cell viability and apoptosis (programmed cell death) using the respective cellular assays. Similar to E2, BPA at 0.1 M and BPAF at 0.1 nM, significantly increased adipogenesis and lipid production by 20% compared to control differentiated cells (based on total lipid vacuole number to cell number ratios), whereas higher levels of BPA and BPAF significantly decreased adipogenesis (p < 0.005). All tested doses of TMBPF significantly reduced adipogenesis and lipid production by 30C40%, likely at least partially through toxic effects on stem cells, as viable cell numbers decreased and apoptosis levels increased throughout differentiation. These findings indicate that low, environmentally-relevant doses of BPA, BPAF, and TMBPF have significant effects on fat cell development and lipid accumulation, with TMBPF having non-estrogenic, anti-adipogenic effects. These and other recent results may provide a potential cellular mechanism between exposure to bisphenols and human obesity, and underscore the likely impact of these chemicals on fat development in vivo.","output":"BPA, BPAF and TMBPF Alter Adipogenesis and Fat Accumulation in Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells, with Implications for Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Government bailouts of corporate sectors in the COVID-19 crisis are part of a tripartite arrangement between government, business and institutional investors Business should respond to the changing preferences of customers, employees and societies by identifying value propositions that justify the provision of risk capital by institutional investors Critical to this is the determination and implementation of corporate purposes by owners and board directors that focus on inter-generational horizons Family owners are particularly well placed to do this, but institutional investors need to make it part of their stewardship function as well Measurement is key and significant reforms are required in the areas of accounting, valuation and reporting Consistent with these observations, companies that had strong environmental, social and governance records performed better during the initial stages of the crisis, as did family owned firms and those that avoided high levels of leverage prior to the crisis","output":"Business in times of crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The conceptual basis for a genetic predisposition underlying risk for type 1 diabetes (T1D) development predates modern human molecular genetics.

METHODS: Fresh peripheral blood samples were collected from 44 glaucoma patients (38 with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and 6 with (primary open-angle glaucoma POAG)) and 36 age-matched healthy donors (HD). Density gradient centrifugation was performed to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Flow cytometry was performed to determine B cell phenotypes. The severity of glaucoma was determined based on the mean deviation (MD) of visual field. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that total B cells was significantly increased in glaucoma patients compared to HD. Next, we checked changes of different B cell subsets in glaucoma.

COVID-19 will accentuate the existing vulnerabilities and create new ones, forcing many smallholders into alternative livelihoods. This outcome, however, is not inevitable. COVID-19 presents an opportunity to rebalance the system that currently creates large profits on one end of the supply chain and great vulnerability on the other.","output":"Will COVID-19 be one shock too many for smallholder coffee livelihoods?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since early 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has a massive impact on health care systems worldwide.

To overcome this problem, countries have adopted different policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"COVID-ABS: An Agent-Based Model of COVID-19 Epidemic to Simulate Health and Economic Effects of Social Distancing Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is a major health problem whose well-known association with psoriasis has been amply described.

People with disabilities who are Medicare beneficiaries (under 65) are a vulnerable population, frequently having multiple chronic conditions, and facing a number of social disadvantages, even before the pandemic. As a result of the lack of attention drawn to the pandemic needs and experiences of people with disabilities, as well as the increased needs of Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities, the aim of this study is to examine the mental health of Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: To do so, we conducted a secondary analysis of United States Census Bureau COVID-19 Household Pulse Survey data from 65,639 (unweighted) people with disabilities who were Medicare beneficiaries. Generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), respectively. RESULTS: Our findings (weighted) revealed, during the pandemic, 43.3% of Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities had symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, and 36.8% had symptoms of major depressive disorder. In addition, 15.3% said they needed counseling/therapy from a mental health professional but did not get it. CONCLUSIONS: Many Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities reported symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder during the pandemic, and a lack of access to needed mental health services. As the pandemic continues, and in wake of recovery from the pandemic, it is important to pay attention to, and target the, mental health disparities unearthed in this study.

Results: Of the 56 samples collected from women, 2 (3.5%) were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whereas 8 (10%) of the 80 samples from men were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The number of respiratory syncytial virus-A--positive cases was 6 (10.7%) in women and 14 (17.5%) in men. Two (3.5%) of the women were positive for parainfluenza-3, and 6 of the men were positive for influenza-B. The number of human metapneumovirus (HMPV)--positive women and men was 6 (10.7%) and 6 (7.5%), respectively. Rhinovirus caused 14.2% and 10% of the cases in men and women, respectively. With a ratio of 10.7% in women and 7.5% in men;SARS-CoV-2, with a ratio of 10% in men and 3.5% in women;influenza-B, with a ratio of 7.5% in men;and parainfluenza-3 and 4, with a ratio of 3.5% in women. SARS-CoV-2 had a mean incidence rate of 7% in men and women. The antibody screening results reveal that antibody formation did not occur in 3 women among the 10 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, and antibody formation occurred in 2 of 7 men. Antibody formation occurred in 5 women (16.6%) and 7 men (20.5%) among the 58 patients who were positive for other respiratory tract pathogens. However, 23 (29.5%) of the blood samples collected from 78 individuals who were negative for the COVID-19 agent and other respiratory tract viral pathogens were positive for the COVID-19 antibody. Conclusion: Because the climate is colder than normal in areas settled at higher altitudes, more than one pathogens act together. In addition, respiratory infections are seen in all seasons. This causes the diseases to be fewer and milder than in other regions.

Thus, there is a significant interest in monitoring drug consumption. Relevant epidemiological information on lifestyle habits can be obtained from the chemical analysis of urban wastewater. In this work, passive sampling using polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) was used to quantify licit and illicit drugs biomarkers in wastewater for the application of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In this WBE study, a small urban community of approximately 1179 inhabitants was monitored from 18 March 2020 to 3 March 2021, covering the mobility restriction and flexibilization periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Consumption was estimated for amphetamine, caffeine, cocaine, MDMA, methamphetamine, nicotine, and THC. The highest estimated consumption among illicit drugs was for THC (2369  1037 mg day(?1) 1000 inh(?1)) followed by cocaine (353  192 mg day(?1) 1000 inh(?1)). There was a negative correlation between consumption of caffeine, cocaine, MDMA, nicotine, and THC with human mobility, expressed by cellular phone mobility reports (P-value = 0.0094, 0.0019, 0.0080, 0.0009, and 0.0133, respectively). Our study is the first long-term drug consumption evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic, with continuous sampling for almost a whole year. The observed reduction in consumption of both licit and illicit drugs is probably associated with stay-at-home orders and reduced access, which can be due to the closure of commercial facilities during some time of the evaluated period, smaller drug supply, and reduced income of the population due to the shutdown of companies and unemployment. The assay described in this study can be used as a complementary and cost-effective tool to the long-term monitoring of drug use biomarkers in wastewater, a relevant epidemiological strategy currently limited to short collection times.","output":"Long-term monitoring of drug consumption patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic in a small-sized community in Brazil through wastewater-based epidemiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia is a newly recognized disease, and its diagnosis is primarily confirmed by routine RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2.

The reasons for the occurrence and severity of MHWs in 2020 the intensification of Northwest Pacific subtropical high and its extension leading to increased shortwave radiation reaching the sea surface during the summer, reduced typhoon activity in July, weakened wind fields north of 20.5N, and an enhancement in sea level anomalies. These act in concert to prevent heat transport away from the Beibu Gulf and thus, more intense MHWs.

The effect of turbulence created by the air puff associated with coughing has been considered. Different possible scenarios varying in the presence of air ventilation within the elevator, number of persons coughing, direction of ejection of cough droplets, and ambient relative humidity and temperature have been postulated and simulated. The results obtained show that in the presence of proper ventilation within the elevator, most of the ejected cough droplets fall to the ground before impacting other persons traveling in the same elevator.

It is largely unknown how hospitalized patients conceptualize trust in their providers. OBJECTIVE: To examine the dimensionality of a measure of trust in the inpatient setting. DESIGN: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients (N = 1756; 76% response rate) across six hospitals in the midwestern USA. The sample was randomly split such that approximately one half was used in the EFA, and the other half in the CFA. MAIN MEASURES: The Trust in Physician Scale, adapted for inpatient care. KEY RESULTS: Based on the Kaiser-Guttman criterion and parallel analysis, EFAs were inconclusive, indicating that trust may be comprised of either one or two factors in this sample. In follow-up CFAs, a 2-factor model fit best based on a chi-squared difference test ((2) = 151.48(1), p < .001) and a Comparative Fit Index (CFI) difference test (CFI difference = .03). The overall fit for the 2-factor CFA model was good ((2) = 293.56, df = 43, p < .01; CFI = .95; RMSEA = .081 [90% confidence interval = .072C.090]; TLI = .93; SRMR = .04). Items loaded onto two factors related to cognitive (i.e., whether patients view providers as competent) and affective (i.e., whether patients view that providers care for them) dimensions of trust. CONCLUSIONS: While measures of trust in the outpatient setting have been validated as unidimensional, in the inpatient setting, trust appears to be composed of two factors: cognitive and affective trust. This provides initial evidence that inpatient providers may need to work to ensure patients see them as both competent and caring in order to gain their trust.","output":"Examining the Dimensionality of Trust in the Inpatient Setting: Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regulatory authorities place stringent guidelines on the removal of contaminants during the manufacture of biopharmaceutical products. Monoclonal antibodies, Fc-fusion proteins, and other mammalian cell-derived biotherapeutics are heterogeneous molecules that are validated based on the production process and not on molecular homogeneity. Validation of clearance of potential contamination by viruses is a major challenge during the downstream purification of these therapeutics. Virus filtration is a single-use, size-based separation process in which the contaminating virus particles are retained while the therapeutic molecules pass through the membrane pores. Virus filtration is routinely used as part of the overall virus clearance strategy. Compromised performance of virus filters due to membrane fouling, low throughput and reduced viral clearance, is of considerable industrial significance and is frequently a major challenge. This review shows how components generated during cell culture, contaminants, and product variants can affect virus filtration of mammalian cell-derived biologics.

The innate pattern recognition receptors TLR7/8 recognize single stranded (ss) RNA naturally packaged into some VLPs and have been shown to enhance the production of IgG antibodies upon immunization. Here we demonstrate that, upon immunization with RNA-loaded bacteriophage-derived VLP Q, TLR7 signaling accelerates germinal center formation, promotes affinity/avidity maturation of VLP-specific IgG and isotype switching to IgG2b/2c. These findings extrapolated to antigens displayed on Q; as Fel d 1, the major cat allergen, chemically attached to Q also induced higher affinity/avidity IgG2b/2c antibodies in a TLR7-dependent fashion. Chimeric mice lacking TLR7-expression exclusively in B cells demonstrated that the enhanced IgG responses were driven by a B cell intrinsic mechanism. Importantly, deep sequencing of the BCR repertoire of antigen-specific B cells demonstrated higher diversity in mice with TLR7 signaling in B cells, suggesting that TLR7-signaling drives BCR repertoire development and diversity. Furthermore, the current data demonstrate that high levels of clonal diversity are reached early in the response and maintained by TLR7 signaling. In conclusion, TLR7 signaling enhances levels and quality of IgG antibodies, and this finding has major implications for vaccine design.","output":"TLR7 Signaling Shapes and Maintains Antibody Diversity Upon Virus-Like Particle Immunization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the start of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 pandemic, it has been difficult to differentiate between SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 re\\\\infection and prolonged RNA shedding.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all consecutive admissions to ED from 1 January to 9 April in both 2019 and 2020. According to the ED discharge ICD-9-CM code, patients were grouped in urological and respiratory patients. We evaluated the type of access (self-presented/ambulance), discharge priority code, ED discharge (hospitalization, home), need for urological consultation or urgent surgery. RESULTS: The number of urological diagnoses in ED was inversely associated to COVID-19 diagnoses (95% confidence interval -0.41/-0.19; Beta = -0.8; P < .0001). The average access per day was significantly lower after 10 March 2020 (1.5  1.1 vs 6.5  2.6; P < .0001), compared to reference period. From 11 March 2020, the inappropriate admissions to ED were reduced (10/45 vs 96/195; P = .001). Consequently, the patients admitted were generally more demanding, requiring a higher rate of urgent surgeries (4/45 vs 4/195; P = .02). This reflected in an increase of the hospitalization rate from 12.7% to 17.8% (Beta = 0.88; P < .0001) during 2020.

Numerous detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been reported globally using various methods, demonstrating the technical feasibility of routine monitoring. However, in order to reliably interpret data produced from these efforts for informing public health interventions, additional quality control information and standardization in sampling design, sample processing, and data interpretation and reporting is needed. This review summarizes published studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater as well as available information regarding concentration, extraction, and detection methods. The review highlights areas for potential standardization including considerations related to sampling timing and frequency relative to peak fecal loading times; inclusion of appropriate information on sample volume collected; sample collection points; transport and storage conditions; sample concentration and processing; RNA extraction process and performance; effective volumes; PCR inhibition; process controls throughout sample collection and processing; PCR standard curve performance; and recovery efficiency testing. Researchers are recommended to follow the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR (MIQE) guidelines. Adhering to these recommendations will enable robust interpretation of wastewater monitoring results and improved inferences regarding the relationship between monitoring results and disease cases.","output":"Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater: Methods optimisation and quality control are crucial for generating reliable public health information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) imaging combined with artificial intelligence is important in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate temporal changes of quantitative CT findings in patients with COVID-19 in three clinic types, including moderate, severe, and non-survivors, and to predict severe cases in the early stage from the results. METHODS: One hundred and two patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Based on the time interval between onset of symptoms and the CT scan, four stages were defined in this study: Stage-1 (0 a7 days); Stage-2 (8 a 14 days); Stage-3 (15 a 21days); Stage-4 (> 21 days). Eight parameters, the infection volume and percentage of the whole lung in four different Hounsfield (HU) ranges, ((-, -750), [-750, -300), [-300, 50) and [50, +)), were calculated and compared between different groups. RESULTS: The infection volume and percentage of four HU ranges peaked in Stage-2. The highest proportion of HU [-750, 50) was found in the infected regions in non-survivors among three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate rapid deterioration in the first week since the onset of symptoms in non-survivors.

METHODS A single-center observational study was performed in patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx by total (pharyngo)-laryngectomy between 2010 and 2015. Study data comprised: maximum phonation time (sec), number of and reasons for prosthesis exchanges (leakage through or around the prosthesis, expulsion or inclusion of the prosthesis), plus 2 quality of life questionnaires (QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&N35) and the Voice Handicap Inventory (VHI 30). RESULTS Forty-nine patients were included. The most common causes of prosthesis exchange were leakage through (73.2%) or around the prosthesis (18.5%). The median time between exchanges was 4 months. Global quality of life status on the QLQ-C30 was 63.5. Mean maximum phonation time was 7.4sec. Mean VHI was 46/120; 10 patients had a mild voice handicap, 12 moderate and 10 severe. No relation emerged between the number of prosthesis exchanges per year and quality of life. Voice handicap significantly decreased quality of life, with QLQ-C30 72.3 for the 22 patients with mild to moderate voice handicap and 44.2 for the 10 patients with severe voice handicap (P=0.001).

We use a transmission dynamics model, parameterized through model fitting to cumulative incidence data during different social distancing escalation phases, to identify the optimal timing of reopening based on social-distancing de-escalation in a population. We use the Province of Ontario, Canada as a case study. The optimization is subject to the constraint that a future COVID-19 outbreak will not lead to the need of acute and intensive care unit beds beyond their local public health capacity. We minimize the cost, the total number of contacts lost until we reach a certain targeted date. We illustrate this optimization process by considering a particular de-escalation strategy that simply reverses the escalation steps. We consider several scenarios depending on the number of de-escalation phases (characterized by an increase in the daily number of contacts), and different lengths of the period between a date when the cost is evaluated until a targeted data when the constraint is to be removed (for example, the anticipated date when a mass COVID-19 vaccination or an effective treatment becomes available) so that normal contacts prior to COVID-19 pandemic can be resumed. In the case of Ontario, we conclude that resuming 80% of pre-pandemic activity level should not happen 2 months before the vaccine/drug treatment becomes available.

A major barrier has been the lack of necessary data. We compiled the largest known database of traffic forecast accuracy, composed of forecast traffic, post-opening counts and project attributes for 1291 road projects in the United States and Europe. We compared measured versus forecast traffic and identified the factors associated with accuracy. We found measured traffic is on average 6% lower than forecast volumes, with a mean absolute deviation of 17% from the forecast. Higher volume roads, higher functional classes, shorter time spans, and the use of travel models all improved accuracy. Unemployment rates also affected accuracytraffic would be 1% greater than forecast on average, rather than 6% lower, if we adjust for higher unemployment during the post-recession years (2008 to 2014).

Traffic on projects that opened from the 1980s through early 2000s was higher on average than forecast, while traffic on more recent projects was lower on average than forecast.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether physiological respiratory parameters in pre-hospital patients with COVID-19 differed from those without COVID-19 and if they could be used to aid EMS personnel in the prediction of illness severity. METHODS: Patients with suspected COVID-19 were included by EMS personnel in Uppsala, Sweden. A portable respiratory monitor based on pneumotachography was used to sample the included patients physiological respiratory parameters. A questionnaire with information about present symptoms and background data was completed. COVID-19 diagnoses and hospital admissions were gathered from the electronic medical record system. The physiological respiratory parameters of patients with and without COVID-19 were then analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: Between May 2020 and January 2021, 95 patients were included, and their physiological respiratory parameters analyzed. Of these patients, 53 had COVID-19. Using adjusted logistic regression, the odds of having COVID-19 increased with respiratory rate (95% CI 1.000C1.118), tidal volume (95% CI 0.996C0.999) and negative inspiratory pressure (95% CI 1.017C1.152). Patients admitted to hospital had higher respiratory rates (p<0.001) and lower tidal volume (p = 0.010) compared to the patients who were not admitted. Using adjusted logistic regression, the odds of hospital admission increased with respiratory rate (95% CI 1.081C1.324), rapid shallow breathing index (95% CI 1.006C1.040) and dead space percentage of tidal volume (95% CI 1.027C1.159). CONCLUSION: Patients taking smaller, faster breaths with less pressure had higher odds of having COVID-19 in this study. Smaller, faster breaths and higher dead space percentage also increased the odds of hospital admission.

Such sentiments continue to have a presence and impact on Asian American youth. The objective of this presentation is to review the historical and current context of anti-Asian racism, understand how experiences of racism impact identity and mental health in Asian American youth, and identify approaches for clinicians to manage and treat Asian youth populations with cultural humility. Methods: The presenter will review the historical, social, and political contexts of anti-Asian racism in the United States and draw on themes and experiences gathered from facilitating university-based discussion groups among Asian/Asian American transitional-aged youth (TAY) students to explore the impact of anti-Asian racism and culture on mental health and identity. Results: Throughout US history, perceptions of Asians as a threat to America, commonly termed the yellow peril, resulted in the passage of laws barring migration and naturalization, as well as executive orders resulting in internment of Asian citizens. Today, anti-Asian racism manifests in the perpetuation of the model minority stereotype and rising attacks on Asian people during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the facilitated discussion groups of Asian/Asian American TAY students, emerging themes include forms of violence experienced during COVID-19, issues with the model minority stereotype, burden of acculturation with subsequent loss of cultural identity, and cultural clashes between Eastern collectivist and Western individualist values. These themes reflect the ongoing struggles of Asian students reconciling ones identity, self-esteem, connection to ones family and community, and experiences of mental illness. Conclusions: Anti-Asian racism impacts Asian American youth in multiple ways, particularly on their development of identity, sense of self, and mental well-being.

We used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to assess Google Trends data representing searches in the United States for 18 terms related to suicide and known suicide risk factors following the emergence of COVID-19.

Here, we examine the effect of employing more geographically detailed diffusion models based on known spatial features of interpersonal networks, most particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the probability of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 U.S cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate highly non-uniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform healthcare planning, predict community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.","output":"Spatial Heterogeneity Can Lead to Substantial Local Variations in COVID-19 Timing and Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, remdesivir is the first and only FDA-approved antiviral drug for COVID-19 treatment.

However, there were limitations to using solely a machine learning model. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objective was to propose a robust method to compute the probability of AE underreporting that could complement our machine learning model. Our model was developed to enhance patients safety while reducing the need for on-site and manual QA activities in clinical trials. METHODS: We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the site reporting rates and assess the risk of underreporting. We designed the model with Project Data Sphere clinical trial data that are public and anonymized.

CONCLUSION: The new model will be integrated into the current dashboard designed for clinical QPLs. This approach reduces the need for on-site audits, shifting focus from source data verification to pre-identified, higher risk areas.

This epidemic even now encompasses the globe. This paper takes the COVID-19 epidemic that has occurred in China as an example, the original data of this paper is derived from 20 Chinese media reports on COVID-19, and the grounded theory is used to analyze the original data to find the risk transmission rules of a sudden infectious epidemic.

There has been a substantial decrease in admissions for acute medical conditions with longer delays between the onset of the symptoms and hospital treatment compared to the pre-pandemic period. The impact of the COVID pandemic on primary care services is uncertain. AIM: Using an online survey, we examined the impact of the COVID pandemic on primary care diabetes services in the UK. METHODS: An online survey was developed by the Primary Care Diabetes Society research group and administered to healthcare and allied health professionals delivering diabetes care in the UK from January to May 2021. Descriptive statistics and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: Of the 1070 professionals surveyed, 975 (91.1%) completed the questionnaire. Most respondents were nurses or nurse practitioners (59.7%) and doctors (32.9%). The mean age of respondents was 52 years and 79% were female. The majority of respondents felt overloaded with work (71.2%) or emotionally drained at the end of a working day (79.1%) compared with the pre-pandemic period. Being a doctor and worried about infecting a family member with the Coronavirus were each associated with an increased odds of being substantially overworked or emotionally drained: (OR = 2.52; 95% CI, 1.25?5.07) and (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.24C3.39), respectively. The most common consultation method used to provide diabetes care during the pandemic was telephone consultation (92.0%).

Results A total of 160 patients were included in analysis, with 80 in each arm. 60% of patients in the treatment group required antibiotics compared to 35% in the control group (p = 0.0015), with the highest usage of anti-MRSA coverage, beta-lactams, cephalosporins, and carbapenems in both groups. Antifungal therapy was required in 21.3% of patients in the tocilizumab group compared to 6.3% in the control group (p = 0.0059), with echinocandins being the most used class in both groups. The median days of antimicrobial use in the tocilizumab group was 14 (IQR 7, 24.5) compared to 9 (IQR 6.5, 19) in the control group (p = 0.3346). In the treatment group, 60% of patients developed a secondary infection compared to 35% of patients in the control group (p < 0.0017). Secondary infection treatment failure was observed in 75% of tocilizumab patients compared to 60.7% of control patients (p = 0.1910). In hospital mortality was 50% in patients who received tocilizumab compared to 27.5% in the control group (p < 0.0039). Conclusion Patients on tocilizumab received more antimicrobials, but with a similar spectrum of antimicrobial coverage. Patients who received tocilizumab had higher odds of developing secondary infections and expiring during their hospital stay. There were similar durations of antimicrobial therapy and treatment outcomes.

DESIGN: A qualitative phenomenological design was used. METHODS: We enrolled 15 nurses who provided care for patients infected by COVID-19 purposively and through snowballing, using a phenomenological approach in critical care units of Iran's public hospitals between May and June 2020. The semi-structured interviews were carried out either via face-to-face or telephone and were analyzed using the 7-step method of Colaizzi. RESULTS: The experiences of nurses caring for patients infected with COVID-19 were categorized into four challenges, including psychological (eight subthemes), organizational (six subthemes), social (six subthemes), and professional (five subthemes). In general, based on the current classification, there seems to be a mixture of positive and negative effects on the psychological, social, and professional challenges and the negative effect only on the organizational challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Positive and negative emotions and experiences have coexisted for the critical care nurses since the COVID-19 outbreak. Emotional support and psychological counseling play an important role in maintaining nurses' optimal mental health during the COVID-19 crisis. Adequate protective equipment, financial and nonfinancial supports, effective communication, training and hiring of staff, and appropriate work shifts are also required to reduce nurses' negative experiences when providing care for the affected individuals.","output":"Experiences of critical care nurses fighting against COVID-19: A qualitative phenomenological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we are seeing widespread disease burden affecting patients of all ages across the globe.

Materials: and Methods: 127 adult COVID-19 patients underwent chest CT scans on a CT scanner using the same scan protocol except with the manual positioning (MP group) for the initial scan and an AI-based automatic positioning method (AP group) for the follow-up scan. Radiation dose, patient positioning time and off-center distance, of the two groups were recorded and compared. Image noise and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed by three experienced radiologists and were compared between the two groups. Results: : The AP operation was successful for all patients in the AP group and reduced the total positioning time by 28% compared with the MP group. Compared with the MP group, the AP group had significantly less patient off-center distance (AP:1.56cm0.83 vs. MP: 4.05cm2.40, p <0.001) and higher proportion of positioning accuracy (AP: 99% vs. MP: 92%), resulted in 16% radiation dose reduction (AP: 6.1mSv1.3 vs. MP: 7.3mSv1.2, p< 0.001) and 9% image noise reduction in erector spinae and lower noise and higher SNR for lesions in the pulmonary peripheral areas.

However, a complete HIV-1 cure, including a functional cure for or eradication of HIV-1, has yet to be achieved because of the persistence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs in adherent patients. The primary source of these viral reservoirs is integrated proviral DNA in CD4(+) T cells and other non-T cells. Although a small fraction of this proviral DNA is replication-competent and contributes to viral rebound after the cessation of cART, >90% of latent viral reservoirs are replication-defective and some contain high rates of G-to-A mutations in proviral DNA. At least in part, these high rates of G-to-A mutations arise from the APOBEC3 (A3) family proteins of cytosine deaminases. A general model has shown that the HIV-1 virus infectivity factor (Vif) degrades A3 family proteins by proteasome-mediated pathways and inactivates their antiviral activities. However, Vif does not fully counteract the HIV-1 restriction activity of A3 family proteins in vivo, as indicated by observations of A3-mediated G-to-A hypermutation in the proviral DNA of HIV-1-infected patients. The frequency of A3-mediated hypermutation potentially contributes to slower HIV-1/AIDS disease progression and virus evolution including the emergence of cytotoxic T lymphocyte escape mutants. Therefore, combined with other strategies, the manipulation of A3-mediated mutagenesis may contribute to an HIV-1 functional cure aimed at cART-free remission.

The incidence data of the COVID-19 (during the period of 2nd March 2020 to 31st May 2020) outbreak in India was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve, making use of the exponential growth, the maximum likelihood estimation, sequential Bayesian method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction. The best fit (based on the data considered) was for the time-dependent approach. Accordingly, this approach was used to assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate. The period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3, saw a $45\\\\%$ reduction in the rate of effective reproduction rate. During the same period the growth rate reduced from $393\\\\%$ during the pre-lockdown to $33\\\\%$ after lockdown 3, accompanied by the average doubling time increasing form $4$-$6$ days to $12$-$14$ days. Finally, the death-to-recovery ratio dropped from $0.28$ (pre-lockdown) to $0.08$ after lockdown 3. In conclusion, all the four metrics considered to assess the effectiveness of the lockdown, exhibited significant favourable changes, from the pre-lockdown period to the end of lockdown 3.

This murine virus is used as a common model to study acute and chronic virus-induced demyelination in the central nervous system. Studies with recombinant MHV strains that differ in the gene encoding the spike protein have demonstrated that the spike has a role in MHV pathogenesis and retrograde axonal transport. Fusion peptides (FPs) in the spike protein play a key role in MHV pathogenesis. In a previous study of the effect of deleting a single proline residue in the FP of a demyelinating MHV strain, we found that two central, consecutive prolines are important for cell-cell fusion and pathogenesis. The dihedral fluctuation of the FP was shown to be repressed whenever two consecutive prolines were present, in contrast to the presence of a single proline in the chain. Using this proline-deleted MHV strain, here we investigated whether intracranial injection of this strain can induce optic neuritis by retrograde axonal transport from the brain to the retina through the optic nerve. We observed that the proline-deleted recombinant MHV strain is restricted to the optic nerve, is unable to translocate to the retina, and causes only minimal demyelination and no neuronal death. We conclude that an intact proline dyad in the FP of the recombinant demyelinating MHV strain plays a crucial role in translocation of the virus through axons and subsequent neurodegeneration.","output":"One proline deletion in the fusion peptide of neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) restricts retrograde axonal transport and neurodegeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the feasibility of using Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) filter cards for the storage of allantoic fluid containing an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), such as Arkansas-DPI, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, and for their identification by reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and characterization by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or nucleotide sequencing.

However, it has been hypothesized that a decrease in the sensitivity of the sensory neurons as well as the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the alveolar epithelial cells are the main causes of olfactory-gustatory disorders. The possible mechanisms described in the literature for changes in taste perception in patients with COVID-19 include olfactory disorders and a competitive activity of COVID-19 on ACE2 receptors in the taste buds. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can bind to sialic acid receptors in the taste buds. In general, evidences show that there is no specific treatment for olfactory-taste disorders induced by SARS-CoV-2, even though some treatments have been used and have shown some promising results, such as olfactory training, intranasal application of sodium citrate and vitamin A, as well as systemic use of omega-3 and zinc. Corticosteroids have also been used as a pharmacological approach to treat patients with olfactory dysfunction with some contradictory results. The knowledge of the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 influences the sensory systems and how effective therapies can treat the loss of smell and taste will have important implications on the understanding and clinical management of olfactory-taste disorders.","output":"Pathophysiology and possible treatments for olfactory-gustatory disorders in patients affected by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To explore challenges facing nurse managers during and beyond coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic and its relation to perceived organizational support. BACKGROUND: When faced with high\\\\pressure situations like the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, it is critical that nurse managers be equipped with the support they need to successfully surpass these hard times. METHODS: Descriptive correlational design was utilized. The study was conduct at different health care settings across Egypt. Convenience sampling technique was employed to recruit (214) nurse managers. Two instruments were used; questionnaire of challenges faced by nurse managers and survey of perceived organizational support. MannCWhitney test, KruskalCWallis test, Spearman's correlation, and regression analysis were utilized. RESULTS: The highest percentage of managers reported being faced with high level of challenges. There was a highly statistically significant negative correlation between challenges currently faced by managers and their perception of organizational support. CONCLUSION: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic had placed additional challenges on nurse managers and these challenges are expected to persist in the future. Higher perception of organizational support minimizes managers' perception of being challenged in times of pandemics. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Better training focused on disaster management, ethical decision making, leading in times of uncertainty, and maintaining well\\\\being will help nurse managers lead better their teams.","output":"Challenges facing nurse managers during and beyond COVID\\\\19 pandemic in relation to perceived organizational support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To provide an overview of the current literature on pulmonary-specific therapeutic approaches to pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome to determine recommendations for clinical practice and/or future research. DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception until January 2013 using the following keywords in various combinations: ARDS, treatment, nitric oxide, heliox, steroids, surfactant, etanercept, prostaglandin therapy, inhaled beta adrenergic receptor agonists, N-acetylcysteine, ipratroprium bromide, dornase, plasminogen activators, fibrinolytics or other anticoagulants, and children. No language restrictions were applied. References from identified articles were searched for additional publications. STUDY SELECTION All clinical studies pertaining to pulmonary-specific therapeutic approaches to pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome were reviewed. If clinical pediatric data were sparse or unavailable, the findings from studies of adult acute respiratory distress syndrome and animal models that might be relevant to pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome were examined. DATA EXTRACTION All relevant studies were reviewed and pertinent data abstracted. DATA SYNTHESIS Over the course of three international meetings, the pertinent findings of the literature review were discussed by a panel of 24 experts in the field representing 21 academic institutions and 8 countries. Recommendations developed and the supporting literature were distributed to all panel members without a conflict of interest and were scored by using the Research ANd Development/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness method. The modified Delphi approach was used as the methodology to achieve consensus among the panel. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the routine use of surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide, glucocorticoids, prone positioning, endotracheal suctioning, and chest physiotherapy cannot be recommended. Inhaled nitric oxide should only be used for patients with documented pulmonary hypertension and/or right ventricular failure. Prone positioning may be considered in patients with severe pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.

This study is part of a worldwide survey of radiologists' responses to COVID-19 in 18 different countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The purpose of this study is to analyze the changes made in international radiology departments and practices in response to the pandemic. METHODS: The 18-item survey was sent via email from April to May 2020 to radiologists in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America to assess their response to COVID-19. Our survey included questions regarding imaging, workforce adjustments, testing availability, staff and patient safety, research and education, and infrastructure availability. RESULTS: Twenty-eight survey responses were reviewed. Of the 28 respondents, 42.9% have shortages of infrastructure and 78.6% responded that COVID-19 testing was available. Regarding the use of Chest CT in COVID-19 patients, 28.6% respondents used Chest CT as screening for COVID-19. For staff safety, interventions included encouraging use of masks in patient encounters, social distancing and PPE training. To cope with their education and research mission, radiology departments are doing online lectures, reducing the number of residents in rotations, and postponing any non-urgent activities. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there are disparities in infrastructure, research, and educational initiatives during COVID-19 which also provides opportunity for the global radiology community to work together on these issues.","output":"COVID-19 Radiology Preparedness, Challenges & Opportunities: Responses From 18 Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Repeated emergence of highly contagious and potentially immune-evading variant SARS-CoV-2 is posing global health and socioeconomical threats. For suppression of the spread of the virus infection among people, a procedure to inactivate virus in saliva may be useful, because saliva of infected persons is the major origin of droplets and aerosols that mediate viral transmission to nearby persons. We previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly and remarkably inactivated by treatment in vitro with tea including green tea, roasted green tea, oolong tea and black tea. Tea catechin-derived compounds including theaflavins (TFs) with (a) galloyl moiety(ies) showed this activity. Although black tea is popularly consumed worldwide, a lot of people consume it with sugar, milk, lemon juice, and so on. But it has not been determined whether these ingredients may influence the inactivation effect of black tea against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has not been revealed whether black tea is capable of inactivating variant viruses such as delta variant. Here we examined the effect of black tea on some variants in the presence or absence of sugar, milk, and lemon juice in vitro. Black tea and galloylated TFs remarkably inactivated alpha, gamma, delta and kappa variants. Intriguingly, an addition of milk but not sugar and lemon juice totally prevented black tea from inactivating alpha and delta variant viruses. The suppressive effect was also exerted by milk casein. These results suggest the possibility that intake of black tea without milk by infected persons may result in inactivation of the virus in saliva and attenuation of spread of SARS-CoV-2 to nearby persons through droplets. Clinical studies are required to investigate this possibility.","output":"Milk casein prevents inactivation effect of black tea galloylated theaflavins on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of 2020, SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, has led to a global pandemic that also affects ophthalmology. Ophthalmologists can be confronted at any time with potentially COVID-19 associated ocular symptoms or manifestations in patients and also become infected through close patient contact. Even without systemic infection, the ocular surface can come into direct contact with aerosols or liquids containing SARS-CoV-2 particles. A smear infection through hand-to-eye contact is also possible. A purely isolated ocular infection has not yet been shown. Rather, it seems that ocular complications occur in the context of a systemic infection. However, ocular symptoms can also be the first symptom of COVID-19. The most common ocular complication of COVID-19 is mild follicular conjunctivitis. Haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, episcleritis, or retinal involvement can also occur less frequently. There are currently no evidence-based therapy recommendations for COVID-19 associated diseases of the ocular surface. Artificial tears might be helpful for symptom relief. There is no evidence for antiviral, antibiotic, or anti-inflammatory therapies, but these medications might be used in individual cases. Potential intraocular complications include retinal artery occlusions and haemorrhages, as well as cotton wool spots caused by complement-mediated thrombotic angiopathy. Neuro-ophthalmological complications including Miller-Fisher syndrome or infarct-related central blindness can also occur in very rare cases. Knowledge of potential transmission routes and personal protective equipment is just as essential for each ophthalmologist as a basic knowledge of potential ocular symptoms and complications.","output":"Ocular Involvement in COVID-19: Conjunctivitis and More./ Okul?re Mitbeteiligung bei COVID-19: Konjunktivitis und mehr"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection continue to cause the morbidity and mortality in many countries.

The structural study of the Nsp1-ribosomal complexes reported post-termination 80S complex containing Nsp1, eRF1 and ABCE1. Considering the presence of Nsp1 in the post-termination 80S ribosomal complex, we hypothesized that Nsp1 may be involved in translation termination. Using a cell-free translation system and reconstituted in vitro translation system, we show that Nsp1 stimulates peptide release and formation of termination complexes. Detailed analysis of Nsp1 activity during translation termination stages reveals that Nsp1 facilitates stop codon recognition. We demonstrate that Nsp1 stimulation targets eRF1 and does not affect eRF3. Moreover, Nsp1 increases amount of the termination complexes at all three stop codons. The activity of Nsp1 in translation termination is provided by its N-terminal domain and the minimal required part of eRF1 is NM domain. We assume that the biological meaning of Nsp1 activity in translation termination is binding with the 80S ribosomes translating host mRNAs and remove them from the pool of the active ribosomes.","output":"Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 stimulates host translation termination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a re-calibration method for Machine Learning models, based on computing confidence intervals for the predicted confidence scores.

We analyzed the qualitative data using descriptive approach. RESULTS: Pregnant women in the Bronx learned about Zika from family, television, the internet and their doctor. Informational sources played different roles. Television, specifically Spanish language networks, was often the initial source of information. Women searched the internet for additional information about Zika. Later, they engaged in further discussions with their healthcare providers.

Not all health care providers and patients are equally ready to take part in the telehealth revolution, which raises concerns for health equity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Without proactive efforts to address both patient- and provider-related digital barriers associated with socioeconomic status, the wide-scale implementation of telehealth amid COVID-19 may reinforce disparities in health access in already marginalized and underserved communities. To ensure greater telehealth equity, policy changes should address barriers faced overwhelmingly by marginalized patient populations and those who serve them. CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed fundamental shifts across the US health care delivery system, including a rapid transition to telehealth. Telehealth has many potential advantages, including maintaining critical access to care while keeping both patients and providers safe from unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus. However, not all health care providers and patients are equally ready to take part in this digital revolution, which raises concerns for health equity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study analyzed data about small primary care practices' telehealth use and barriers to telehealth use collected from rapid-response surveys administered by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Bureau of Equitable Health Systems and New York University from mid-April through mid-June 2020 as part of the city's efforts to understand how primary care practices were responding to the COVID-19 pandemic following New York State's stay-at-home order on March 22. We focused on small primary care practices because they represent 40% of primary care providers and are disproportionately located in low-income, minority or immigrant areas that were more severely impacted by COVID-19. To examine whether telehealth use and barriers differed based on the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities served by these practices, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to stratify respondents as being in high-SVI or low-SVI areas. We then characterized respondents' telehealth use and barriers to adoption by using means and proportions with 95% confidence intervals. In addition to a primary analysis using pooled data across the five waves of the survey, we performed sensitivity analyses using data from respondents who only took one survey, first wave only, and the last two waves only. FINDINGS: While all providers rapidly shifted to telehealth, there were differences based on community characteristics in both the primary mode of telehealth used and the types of barriers experienced by providers. Providers in high-SVI areas were almost twice as likely as providers in low-SVI areas to use telephones as their primary telehealth modality (41.7% vs 23.8%; P <.001). The opposite was true for video, which was used as the primary telehealth modality by 18.7% of providers in high-SVI areas and 33.7% of providers in low-SVI areas (P <0.001). Providers in high-SVI areas also faced more patient-related barriers and fewer provider-related barriers than those in low-SVI areas. CONCLUSIONS: Between April and June 2020, telehealth became a prominent mode of primary care delivery in New York City. However, the transition to telehealth did not unfold in the same manner across communities. To ensure greater telehealth equity, policy changes should address barriers faced overwhelmingly by marginalized patient populations and those who serve them.","output":"Rapid Transition to Telehealth and the Digital Divide: Implications for Primary Care Access and Equity in a Post-COVID Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"\\"Mouse Is Not Man and Blood Is Not Brain\\" is a frequent response when neurologists are confronted with findings from translational medicine.","output":"Of mice and men: COVID\\\\19 challenges translational neuroscience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type I interferons (IFN-I) are a group of related proteins that help regulate the activity of the immune system and play a key role in host defense against viral infections.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to characterize how community pharmacy in Ontario (Canada) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic of winter/spring 2020, in particula in understanding what factors may influence or predict resiliency of individual practitioners and their workplaces. METHODS: One-on-one interviews mediated through technology (Microsoft Teams) were used, following a semi-structured interview protocol. Verbatim transcripts were produced and analyzed by two independent researchers, using an inductive coding process to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: A total of 21 pharmacists participated in this study. Six themes were identified: a) use of and comfort with technology; b) early adoption of corporate and professional guidance; c) workplaces that emphasized task-focus rather than multi-tasking were more resilient; d) scheduling methods and practices in the workplace are important for personal resilience; e) dedicated specialty staff allowed pharmacists to focus on their work; and f) provision of personal protective equipment was essential.

OBJECTIVES: To examine trends in the number of hospital admissions for care home residents during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a national linked dataset on hospital admissions for residential and nursing home residents in England (257,843 residents, 45% in nursing homes) between 20 January 2020 and 28 June 2020, compared to admissions during the corresponding period in 2019 (252,432 residents, 45% in nursing homes). Elective and emergency admission rates, normalised to the time spent in care homes across all residents, were derived across the first three months of the pandemic between 1 March and 31 May 2020 and primary admission reasons for this period were compared across years. RESULTS: Hospital admission rates rapidly declined during early March 2020 and remained substantially lower than in 2019 until the end of June. Between March and May, 2,960 admissions from residential homes (16.2%) and 3,295 admissions from nursing homes (23.7%) were for suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Rates of other emergency admissions decreased by 36% for residential and by 38% for nursing home residents (13,191 fewer admissions in total). Emergency admissions for acute coronary syndromes fell by 43% and 29% (105 fewer admission) and emergency admissions for stroke fell by 17% and 25% (128 fewer admissions) for residential and nursing home residents, respectively. Elective admission rates declined by 64% for residential and by 61% for nursing home residents (3,762 fewer admissions). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study showing that care home residents hospital use declined during the first wave of COVID-19, potentially resulting in substantial unmet health need that will need to be addressed alongside ongoing pressures from COVID-19.","output":"Hospital admissions from care homes in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis using linked administrative data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2018, Puerto Rico (PR) enacted a Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine school-entry requirement for students ages 11 to 12. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we aimed to identify potential barriers and facilitators of this implementation. We conducted 38 qualitative interviews with stakeholders in PR from different organizations (Department of Health, Schools, Healthcare Providers, and Community organizations). We evaluated construct rating variability between the organizations to determine barriers and facilitators. The strongest facilitator determined was stakeholder's awareness of the parent's and student's needs to meet the HPV school-entry requirement. Other facilitators included initiatives for school-entry policies and the relative advantage of this requirement over different strategies. The strongest barriers included was the cost for private providers to administer the HPV vaccine, the negative influence of social media about the vaccine, which affected parents' acceptance, and the lack of school nurses as available staff resources for the school entry requirement. Findings from this study can be used to improve implementation (adaptations/modifications) and inform other states and countries in earlier stages of consideration of the adoption of similar immunization policies. Most barriers can be modifiable with the implementation of educational programs/training across schools, considering that they are the first line of response to parents of this school entry requirement.","output":"Implementation of the human papillomavirus school-entry requirement in Puerto Rico: barriers and facilitators using the consolidated framework for implementation research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has a major impact on a global scale.

National guidelines do not currently recommend testing students prior to campus arrival. However, the impact of presemester testing has not been studied. DESIGN: Dynamic SARS-CoV-2 transmission models are used to explore the effects of three presemester testing interventions. INTERVENTIONS: Testing of students 0, 1 and 2 times prior to campus arrival. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Number of active infections and time until isolation bed capacity is reached. SETTING: We set on-campus and off-campus populations to 7500 and 17 500 students, respectively. We assumed 2% prevalence of active cases at the semester start, and that one-third of infected students will be detected and isolated throughout the semester. Isolation bed capacity was set at 500. We varied disease transmission rates (R(0)=1.5, 2, 3, 4) to represent the effectiveness of mitigation strategies throughout the semester. RESULTS: Without presemester screening, peak number of active infections ranged from 4114 under effective mitigation strategies (R(0)=1.5) to 10 481 under ineffective mitigation strategies (R(0)=4), and exhausted isolation bed capacity within 10 (R(0)=4) to 25 days (R(0)=1.5). Mandating at least one test prior to campus arrival delayed the timing and reduced the size of the peak, while delaying the time until isolation bed capacity was reached. Testing twice in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies (R(0)=1.5) was the only scenario that did not exhaust isolation bed capacity during the semester. CONCLUSIONS: Presemester screening is necessary to avert early and large surges of active COVID-19 infections. Therefore, we recommend testing within 1 week prior to and on campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the peak outbreak, presemester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to significantly reduce outbreak size and preserve isolation bed capacity.","output":"Modelling the impact of presemester testing on COVID-19 outbreaks in university campuses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract writing is a very important since it is the piece of formal writing which should attract the attention of the reader and make him/her read the rest of the paper.

METHODS: We assessed self-reported capability change in Sweden in 10 capability dimensions in a cross-sectional online survey among 500 participants on a five-item Likert scale. We analysed the distribution of answers by comparing the balance of positive and negative perceived changes and used mixed effects logistic regression to examine associations with background characteristics of the participants. RESULTS: Reported perceived negative changes outweighed positive changes, and a higher proportion stated negative perceived changes if they also stated having low capability in the same dimension. In the capabilities of financial situation, political resources and health, the proportions of perceived negative change were highest. Odds for perceived negative change compared to no or positive change were higher for lower incomes, living in smaller municipalities compared to living in medium-sized municipalities, being born outside Europe, living in the south of Sweden, and renting instead of owning housing.

Here, we have made an attempt to do computational drug design by targeting main protease of SARS-CoV2. High-throughput virtual screening of million molecules and natural compounds databases were performed followed by docking. After that, the protein-ligand complexes were optimized and rescoring of binding energies were accomplished through molecular dynamics simulation and Molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area approaches, respectively. In addition, conformational effect of various ligands on protein was also examined through essential dynamics simulation. Three compounds namely ZINC14732869, ZINC19774413, and ZINC19774479 were finally filtered that displayed better binding affinities than N3 (known) inhibitor and formed conformationally stable complexes.

Televisits are one type of telemedicine in which clinical visits are conducted remotely using an audio-visual connection with the patient at home. The use of televisits is more established in Stroke care but was also recently formally evaluated for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This retrospective case series describes patient characteristics and reasons for televisits in persons with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Italy, which was declared in February 2020. Methods: Recruitment occurred in a general hospital based MS clinic during Italys lockdown months period (9 MarchC18 May). Each subject completed at least one televisit. The baseline data included were demographics and MS history; reasons for the remote house calls were analyzed focusing on COVID-19 related needs. Results: Forty-six participants completed at least one study visit. The patients enrolled were more often females suffering from Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). Half of the patients had an intermediate level of education and lived within a 60 min drive from the clinic. These patients predominately had a short disease duration and were mostly involved in oral treatment. The main reasons for the call were drug use and counseling on social distancing. In 5 cases, COVID-19 infection was reported. Conclusions: Televisits during the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated their utility as a care delivery method for MS.

Methods An online survey was conducted in between October and December 2020 targeting the general population in Lithuania. Participants rated their interest and avoidance of news about the COVID-19 pandemic, with possible answers ranging from completely agree to completely disagree. Participants were also evaluated for symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7), post-traumatic stress (Impact of Events Scale Revised) and COVID-19 fear (COVID-19 Fears Questionnaires). Results In total, 1036 participants (83% women) completed the survey. Results indicated that 37% of participants were losing interest in COVID-19 news, 32% had started avoiding COVID-19 news and 26% had stopped following news about COVID-19.

These are highly polymorphic peptide receptors selecting and presenting endogenously derived epitopes to circulating CTLs. The polymorphism of the MHC effectively individualizes the immune response of each member of the species. We have recently developed efficient methods to generate recombinant human MHC-I (also known as human leukocyte antigen class I, HLA-I) molecules, accompanying peptide-binding assays and predictors, and HLA tetramers for specific CTL staining and manipulation. This has enabled a complete mapping of all HLA-I specificities (the Human MHC Project). Here, we demonstrate that these approaches can be applied to other species. We systematically transferred domains of the frequently expressed swine MHC-I molecule, SLA-1*0401, onto a HLA-I molecule (HLA-A*11:01), thereby generating recombinant human/swine chimeric MHC-I molecules as well as the intact SLA-1*0401 molecule. Biochemical peptide-binding assays and positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries were used to analyze the peptide-binding motifs of these molecules. A pan-specific predictor of peptideCMHC-I binding, NetMHCpan, which was originally developed to cover the binding specificities of all known HLA-I molecules, was successfully used to predict the specificities of the SLA-1*0401 molecule as well as the porcine/human chimeric MHC-I molecules. These data indicate that it is possible to extend the biochemical and bioinformatics tools of the Human MHC Project to other vertebrate species.

The purpose of this longitudinal study among 881 first-year bachelor students is to explore the mechanisms by which loneliness, coping strategies in the context of COVID-19, mental health outcomes and procrastination sequentially mediate the relationship depression and anxiety on the one hand, and academic performance on the other hand. We measured mental health variables several times during the COVID-19 crisis and assessed how this translates into academic performance at the end of the academic year. By performing exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, three high-order factors for the coping strategies in the context of the COVID-19 crisis were identified, namely maladaptive coping, adaptive coping, and supportive coping. Structural equation modeling was used to test the sequential mediational model. The results showed that maladaptive coping strategies employed at T2 during the lockdown, but not adaptive or supportive coping partially mediate the trajectories of depression (T1) and anxiety (T1). Loneliness (T2) partially mediated the trajectory of depression and anxiety (T1), and procrastination fully mediated the impact of depression (T3) on academic performance (T4).

This study aimed at filling this gap by creating a visual dictionary of stewardship through an assessment of data visualization (i.e., graphical representation of quantitative information) in stewardship research. Methods: A random sample of 150 data visualizations from published research articles on stewardship were assessed (excluding geographical maps and flowcharts). The visualization vocabulary (content) and design space (design elements) were combined to create a visual dictionary. Additionally, visualization errors, chart junk, and quality were assessed to identify problems in current visualizations and to provide improvement recommendations. Results: Despite a heterogeneous use of data visualization, distinct combinations of graphical elements to reflect stewardship data were identified. In general, bar (n = 54; 36.0%) and line charts (n = 42; 28.1%) were preferred visualization types. Visualization problems comprised color scheme mismatches, double y-axis, hidden data points through overlaps, and chart junk.

This 3paper reports a protocol for a systematic review that aims to (a) identify the effects of individual BCTs in eHealth interventions for lowering glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) and (b) investigate which additional intervention features (duration of intervention, tailoring, theory-base, and mode of delivery) affect levels of HbA1c in this population. The protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 guideline. METHODS/DESIGN To identify eligible studies, an extensive systematic database search (PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) using keywords will be conducted. This review will include randomized controlled trials examining the effects of eHealth interventions on HbA1c in persons with poorly controlled T2DM over a minimum follow-up period of 3 months. Relevant data will be extracted from the included studies using Microsoft Excel. The content of the interventions will be extracted from the description of interventions and will be classified according to the BCT taxonomy v1 tool. The quality of studies will be independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. If the studies have adequate homogeneity, meta-analysis will be considered. The effect sizes of each BCT will be calculated using the random effect model. The quality of the synthesized evidence will be evaluated employing the Grading of the Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. DISCUSSION This systematic review is one of the firsts to appraise the effectiveness of eHealth interventions employing BCTs which aimed at improving glycemic control in persons with poorly controlled T2DM. The review will aggregate the effect sizes of BCTs on HbA1c levels. The results may inform future eHealth interventions targeting poorly controlled T2DM populations.

Using validated psychometric questionnaires and employing the nested hierarchical modeling approach, we estimate the impact of perceived resilience on the decision to migrate from the city. We find that even though Eilat has all the attributes to experience significant out-migration, its residents are not inclined towards migration due to its prior investment in resilience measures, which strengthened the local community and created a unique credo shared by its residents. These findings call for policymakers to focus on long-term resilience schemes directed at increasing the appeal that cities have for their residents and ensuring their endurance in times of extreme hardship.","output":"Urban resilience as a mitigating factor against economically driven out-migration during COVID-19: The case of Eilat, a tourism-based city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An 83-year-old man was hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after a 10-day history of a persistent fever.

METHOD: Our department, according to the actual COVID-19 protocol national guidelines, has suspended elective procedures and, in the last month, only three patients underwent to endoscopic endonasal procedures, due to urgent conditions (a pituitary apoplexy, a chondrosarcoma causing cavernous sinus syndrome, and a pituitary macroadenoma determining chiasm compression). We describe peculiar surgical technique modifications and the use of an endonasal face mask, i.e., the nose lid, to be applied to the patient during transnasal procedures for skull base pathologies as a further possible COVID-19 mitigation strategy. RESULTS: The nose lid is cheap, promptly available, and can be easily assembled with the use of few tools available in the OR; this mask allows to both operating surgeon and his assistant to perform wider surgical maneuvers throughout the slits, without ripping it, while limiting the nostril airflow.

Despite being common, its identification is tremendously hard because of the complexities like skin tone and color variation due to the presence of hair regions. Therefore the type of skin disease prediction is not accurately achieved in many pieces of research. To deal with mentioned concerns, a novel optimal probability-based deep neural network is proposed to assist medical professionals in appropriately diagnosing the type of skin disease. Initially, the input dataset is fed into the pre-processing stage, which helps to remove unwanted contents in the image. Afterward, features extracted for all the pre-processed images are subjected to the proposed Optimal Probability-Based Deep Neural Network (OP-DNN) for the training process. This classification algorithm classifies incoming clinical images as different skin diseases with the help of probability values. While learning OP-DNN, it is essential to determine the optimal weight values for reducing the training error. For optimizing weight in OP-DNN structure, an optimization approach is implemented in this research. For that, whale optimization is utilized because it works faster than other methods. The proposed multi-type skin disease prediction model is implemented in MatLab software and achieved 95% of accuracy, 0.97 of specificity, and 0.91 of sensitivity.

OBJECTIVE: This research aims to develop a deep learning methodology for automated differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis based on routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 146 patients who underwent radiation therapy after glioma resection and presented with suspected recurrent lesions at the follow-up MRI examination were selected for analysis. Routine MRI scans were acquired from each patient, including T1, T2, and gadolinium-contrast-enhanced T1 sequences. Of those cases, 96 (65.8%) were confirmed as glioma recurrence on postsurgical pathological examination, while 50 (34.2%) were diagnosed as necrosis. A light-weighted deep neural network (DNN) (ie, efficient radionecrosis neural network [ERN-Net]) was proposed to learn radiological features of gliomas and necrosis from MRI scans. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate performance of the model in both image-wise and subject-wise classifications. Preoperative diagnostic performance of the model was also compared to that of the state-of-the-art DNN models and five experienced neurosurgeons. RESULTS: DNN models based on multimodal MRI outperformed single-modal models. ERN-Net achieved the highest AUC in both image-wise (0.915) and subject-wise (0.958) classification tasks. The evaluated DNN models achieved an average sensitivity of 0.947 (SD 0.033), specificity of 0.817 (SD 0.075), and accuracy of 0.903 (SD 0.026), which were significantly better than the tested neurosurgeons (P=.02 in sensitivity and P<.001 in specificity and accuracy).

Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is essential for decision making, and to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. The present study aimed to estimate the effective reproductive number (Rt) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection during the first 10 days of the outbreak in seven Latin American countries with the highest incidence of cases as of March 23, 2020. Furthermore, we chose to compare the seven countries with Spain and Italy given their history with the virus. Methods Incidence data retrieved from the COVID-19 data repository by Johns Hopkins University were analyzed. The Rt was calculated for the first 10 days of the epidemic in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, and Peru. Rt estimations were compared with Spain and Italy values for the same interval. Results The median Rt for the first 10 days of the COVID-19 epidemic were 2.90 (2.67-3.14) for Spain and 2.83 (2.7-2.96) for Italy. Latin American Rt estimations were higher in Ecuador (3.95(3.7-4.21)), Panama (3.95(3.7-4.21)), and Brazil (3.95(3.7-4.21)). The smallest one was observed in Peru (2.36(2.11-2.63)). All Latin American countries had Rt greater than 2. Conclusions The initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Latin America suggested a high Rt.

Current approaches to understanding these behaviors model evolution as an optimization problem in which the traits of organisms are assumed to optimize an objective function representing evolutionary fitness. Here, we use a mechanistic birth-death dynamics approach to study the evolution of innate behavioral strategies in a simulated population of organisms. In particular, we performed agent-based stochastic simulations and mean-field analyses of organisms exploring random environments and competing with each other to find locations with plentiful resources. We find that when organism density is low, the mean-field model allows us to derive an effective objective function, predicting how the most competitive phenotypes depend on the exploration-exploitation trade-off between the scarcity of high-resource sites and the increase in birth rate those sites offer organisms. However, increasing organism density alters the most competitive behavioral strategies and precludes the derivation of a well-defined objective function. Moreover, there exists a range of densities for which the coexistence of many phenotypes persists for evolutionarily long times.","output":"Evolution of innate behavioral strategies through competitive population dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Studies have shown a high prevalence of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) among elite athletes yet there is a paucity of data on FAI in Nordic skiers. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of radiographic FAI in professional Nordic Combined Skiers and Ski jumpers compared to controls and assess functional outcomes including hip range of motion (ROM) and pain in patients with radiographic evidence of FAI compared to those without it. METHODS: A cohort of elite Nordic Skiers underwent medical history, physical examination, and pelvic radiographs at their visit with a fellowship-trained sports medicine physician. On pelvis radiographs, Alpha angle>55 degrees was deemed cam-positive, and positive crossover signs, T?nnis<0, or LCEA>40 were deemed pincer positive. Further stratification was performed by sex, ski event type, hip pain, presence of cam lesions, and presence of pincer lesions. Spearman correlation matrix was performed to measure the association between radiographic measurements and ROM. RESULTS: Nineteen Nordic skiers and nineteen age, sex, and BMI matched controls were included in the study. There were no significant differences in age, sex, BMI, and hip pain between groups. While Nordic skiers demonstrated decreased ROM bilaterally on external rotation compared to controls, skiers had larger ROM bilaterally on extension, abduction, adduction compared to controls. Skiers were significantly more likely to have bilateral crossover sign and alpha angles>55 compared to controls. Subgroup analysis showed that Cam positive patients had higher flexion and adduction ROM and pincer positive patients had significantly higher flexion and abduction ROM compared to patients without cam and pincer lesions respectively. Patients with hip pain had significantly lower right hip abduction ROM compared to patients without hip pain. No significant correlations were seen between radiographic measurements and ROM. CONCLUSION: Similar to other elite 'hip heavy' sport athletes, Nordic skiers gave a notably higher prevalence of radiographic cam and pincer type morphology and significantly higher ROM compared to nonathletic controls. Clinicians evaluating Nordic skiers should be aware of these baseline findings with respect to a possible elevated long-term risk of symptomatic FAI in these athletes as well as other conditions related to radiographic FAI.","output":"Characterizing femoroacetabular impingement in professional Nordic Skiers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 put prisons across the globe into an emergency state where extraordinary reactions and measures have been taken. Prison governance and management under such circumstances have facilitated the revelation of existing mechanisms of control. Focusing on the experience of frontline officers, this paper explores how the Chinese prison system contained the spread of COVID-19 inside its walls by demanding officers work on 'lockdown shifts', and what we can learn about its governing logic. Multi-sourced data is utilized, including government-issued policies and reports, media reports, blog posts written by prison officers and participant observation as well as semi-structured interviews with frontline prison officers. This study offers a diachronic analysis of pandemic control within the prison system, focusing on key turning points. By examining frontline prison officers' accounts through first- and second-hand data, the study explores the execution of control policies and how they affect individual lives. The study found that prison officers were ordered to fight at the forefront of pandemic control in prisons by working on shifts inside for an extended and indefinite period of time, which proved effective in terminating the spread of the virus, but placed a heavy burden on the personal lives of the officers. The findings also reveal new facets in the mobility and experience of frontline officers. While effective in terms of what the statistics have demonstrated, the Chinese measures have been less effective in adjusting to the needs of frontline staff and acknowledging the personal sacrifices demanded and made in this process.","output":"Administrative Governance and Frontline Officers in the Chinese Prison System During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 disease (COVID)-19 is having profound effects on the global economy and food trade.

The Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations and the NCD Roadmap created at the request of the Pacific Finance and Economic Ministers identify prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases as core priorities. Among the various risk factors responsible for the development of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), overweight and obesity are particularly of concern with the potential to negate many of the health benefits that have contributed to increased life expectancy. With the increase in childhood obesity across the region, it has become apparent that surveillance data remains a challenge; however, it is essential to inform the development of effective policies and strategies to tackle the challenge of childhood obesity in the Pacific region. RECENT FINDINGS: The paper highlights the paucity of childhood obesity surveillance data available in the Pacific region and how the absence of a standardised tool to collect this data makes it difficult to do comparative analysis between countries.

Diffusion MRI and clinical assessments were performed in 77 patients at baseline (22 low visual function/55 intact vision and 13 PD\\\\mild cognitive impairment/51 normal cognition) and 25 controls and again after 18 months. We compared microstructural changes in fiber density, macrostructural changes in fiber bundle cross\\\\section and combined fiber density and cross\\\\section, across white matter, adjusting for age, sex, and intracranial volume. RESULTS: Patients with PD and visual dysfunction showed worse cognitive performance at follow\\\\up and were more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment compared with those with normal vision (P = 0.008). Parkinson's with poor visual function showed diffuse microstructural and macrostructural changes at baseline, whereas those with mild cognitive impairment showed fewer baseline changes. At follow\\\\up, Parkinson's with low visual function showed widespread macrostructural changes, involving the fronto\\\\occipital fasciculi, external capsules, and middle cerebellar peduncles bilaterally. No longitudinal change was seen in those with mild cognitive impairment at baseline or converters, even when the 2 groups were combined.

The Parent Artery Reconstruction for Large or Giant Cerebral Aneurysms Using the Tubridge Flow Diverter (PARAT) trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Tubridge flow diverter in the treatment of large or giant aneurysms in comparison with Enterprise stent-assisted coiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective, multicenter, randomized trial was conducted at 12 hospitals throughout China. Enrolled adults with unruptured large/giant intracranial aneurysms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either Enterprise stent-assisted coiling or Tubridge flow diverter implantation. The primary end point was complete occlusion at 6-month follow-up, while secondary end points included technical success, mortality, target vessel-related stroke, aneurysm bleeding, in-stent stenosis, parent artery occlusion, and the frequency of all adverse events. RESULTS Among 185 enrolled subjects, 41 withdrew before procedure initiation. Overall, 82 subjects underwent Tubridge implantation, and 62 subjects were primarily treated with stent-assisted coiling. The results of 6-month follow-up imaging included complete occlusion rates of 75.34% versus 24.53% for the Tubridge and stent-assisted coiling groups, respectively, with a calculated common odds ratio of 9.4 (95% confidence interval, 4.14-21.38; P < .001). There was a higher, nonsignificant frequency of complications for Tubridge subjects. Multivariate analysis showed a decreased stroke rate at the primary investigational site, with a marginal P value (P = .051). CONCLUSIONS This trial showed an obviously higher rate of large and giant aneurysm obliteration with the Tubridge FD over Enterprise stent-assisted coiling. However, this higher obliteration rate came at the cost of a nonsignificantly higher rate of complications.

Immediately after their acquisition, the chest CTs were prospectively interpreted by on-call teleradiologists (OCTRs) and systematically reviewed within one week by another senior teleradiologist. Each OCTR reading was concluded using a 5-point scale: normal, non-infectious, infectious non-COVID-19, indeterminate and highly suspicious of COVID-19. The senior reading reported the lesions semiology, distribution, extent and differential diagnoses. After pre-filtering clinical and radiological features through univariate Chi-2, Fisher or Student t-tests (as appropriate), multivariate stepwise logistic regression (Step-LR) and classification tree (CART) models to predict a positive RT-PCR were trained on 412 patients, validated on an independent cohort of 101 patients and compared with the OCTR performances (295 and 71 with available clinical data, respectively) through area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC).

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical, prospective study. ANIMALS: Eight healthy, skeletally mature horses. METHODS: In vitro-serial dilutions of CHD-EDTA-Tris and EDTA-Tris alone were evaluated for bactericidal and fungicidal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus equi subspecies ssp. equi, Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vivo-eight healthy horses were topically treated twice with 30 ml of 0.0005% CHD-EDTA-Tris. Mucosal samples from each location were evaluated for the presence of inflammation or pathologic lesions. RESULTS: Solutions containing CHD were superior in fungal and bacterial killing to those without. In vitro-a 0.005% CHD-EDTA-Tris was 100% effective against all bacterial and fungal species evaluated, while a 0.0005% CHD-EDTA-Tris was less efficacious against A. fumigatus and S. equi ssp. equi.

Several studies have indicated that these games using mobile phones may improve students learning motivation and effectiveness when they are equipped with appropriate learning strategies. However, investigating the impact of learning strategies in students utilization of educational mobile games has received little scholarly attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, this research proposed two learning games scenarios to fill this gap. In the first scenario, students were offered an educational mobile game with a learning strategy called scaffolding strategy;while in the second scenario, the same game was offered without the strategy. To achieve this objective, an experimental design with a research model was developed to examine the role of scaffolding learning strategy in students use of educational mobile games. In this experimental study, 43 students from two classes participated in the two learning scenarios. The results indicate that educational mobile gaming with the scaffolding learning strategy significantly influenced students utilization of the mobile game. In addition, the adoption of the learning strategy significantly affected students perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioural intention to use, compared with the same game without the learning strategy. The results also indicate that the introduction of the scaffolding learning strategy into the educational mobile game will increase students learning effectiveness and motivation.","output":"A Conceptual Model to Investigate the Role of Mobile Game Applications in Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gastrointestinal system of horses is affected by a large variety of inflammatory infectious and noninfectious conditions.

Primary data were collected onsite at a local FQHC and an urban AMC between March 2017 and March 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical outcomes of study participants were compared with matched controls (CON) from a sister FQHC site who were referred for traditional in-person specialty visits at the AMC. No-show rates for study participants were calculated and compared to their no-show rates for standard (STD) in-person specialty visits at the AMC during the study period.

This study was carried out to early assess students' sources of information, perceived risk of infection, knowledge and preventive practices in order to resume academic activity. The impact of training and volunteer work was also assessed. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in May 2020 among medical students enrolled in the School of Medicine and Surgery, Bologna University. RESULTS The analysis included 537 responses. On average students used seven sources of information on COVID-19. Scientific journals were considered the most trustworthy but they ranked only 6th in the frequency of use. Perceived risk of infection was higher for academic activities, especially in the hospital than daily living activities. Less than 50% of students reported being trained on biological risk and use of PPE. Training received was significantly associated with both perceived risk of infection and confidence in the use of PPE. Students engaged in volunteer work had higher confidence in PPE usage. INTERPRETATION Accessible scientific information and students' engagement in spreading correct knowledge play an important role in challenging misinformation during the pandemic crisis. Students showed suboptimal knowledge about PPE use, calling for additional training. We found a moderate-high perceived risk of infection that could be mitigated with specific educational programs and by promoting voluntary work.

METHODS Our retrospective, multicentric study included 1304 patients who underwent paraaortic lymphadenectomy for gynecological malignancies. The patients were categorized into the following five groups based on treatment type: transperitoneal laparoscopy (group A, n = 198), extraperitoneal laparoscopy (group B, n = 681), robot-assisted transperitoneal laparoscopy (group C, n = 135), robot-assisted extraperitoneal laparoscopy (group D, n = 44), and laparotomy (group E, n = 246). RESULTS The prevalence of cancer types differed according to the surgical approach: there were more ovarian cancers in group E and more cervical cancers in groups B and D (p < 0.001). Estimated blood loss was higher in group E (844.2 mL) than in groups treated with minimally invasive interventions (115.8-141.5 mL, p < 0.005). For infrarenal dissection, fewer nodes were removed in group C compared with the other approaches (16 vs. 21 nodes, respectively, p < 0.05). The average operative time ranged from 169 min for group A to 247 min for group E (p < 0.001). Length of hospital stay was 14 days for group E versus 3.5 days for minimally invasive procedures (p < 0.05).

We developed two COVID-19 vaccines based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-CoV2-S); their immunogenicity was evaluated in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunizations. Both vaccines induced robust, broad and polyfunctional S-specific CD4+ (mainly Th1) and CD8+ T-cell responses, with a T effector memory phenotype. DNA/MVA immunizations elicited higher T-cell responses. All vaccine regimens triggered high titers of IgG antibodies specific for the S, as well as for the receptor-binding domain; the predominance of the IgG2c isotype was indicative of Th1 immunity. Notably, serum samples from vaccinated mice neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures, and those from MVA/MVA immunizations showed a higher neutralizing capacity. Remarkably, one or two doses of MVA-CoV2-S protect humanized K18-hACE2 mice from a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, two doses of MVA-CoV2-S confer full inhibition of virus replication in the lungs. These results demonstrate the robust immunogenicity and full efficacy of MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in animal models and support its translation to the clinic.IMPORTANCE The continuous dissemination of the novel emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus, with more than 78 million infected cases worldwide and higher than 1,700,000 deaths as of December 23, 2020, highlights the urgent need for the development of novel vaccines against COVID-19. With this aim, we have developed novel vaccine candidates based on the poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and we have evaluated their immunogenicity in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunization protocols. The results showed the induction of a potent S-specific T-cell response and high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Remarkably, humanized K18-hACE2 mice immunized with one or two doses of the MVA-based vaccine were 100% protected from SARS-CoV-2 lethality. Moreover, two doses of the vaccine prevented virus replication in lungs.

Vitamin D is well-known to play a significant role in maintaining the immune health of an individual. Moreover, it induces antimicrobial peptide expression that can decrease viral replication and regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, supplementation of vitamin D has the potential to reduce the incidence, severity and the risk of death from pneumonia resulting from the cytokine storm of many viral infections including COVID-19.

Drawing on semi-structured interviews with school principals, documents and media sources, and a field survey, we found that the state has the capacity to quickly internalize new norms and harness the cooperation of previously suspicious communities. At the same time, we found that communal authorities were able to shield widespread communal defiance from legal enforcement. These findings expose the bidirectionality of legal socialization: As the community uses its defiance power to attenuate the law, it socializes public authorities to accede to their bounded authority. As public authorities come to realize that the community cannot be brought to full compliance, they curtail enforcement efforts and socialize the community to operate outside the law. Our findings animate the reciprocity assumption in legal socialization theory and highlight one of the crucial tasks for the next 50 years of research: to examine the bidirectionality of legal socialization and discover its socio-legal effects.","output":"Bidirectional legal socialization and the boundaries of law: The case of enclave communities compliance with COVID-19 regulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted existing educational systems worldwide.

A recently published article points to a method of prevention and prophylaxis of COVID-19 through the use of anti-malarial drugs such as the 4-aminoquinolones: chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, based on their mechanisms of action against SARS-CoV-2. This report aims to explore the correlation between COVID-19 cases and countries where malaria is prevalent using statistical means. It is hypothesized that countries where malaria is endemic will have few cases of COVID-19 since these countries use the 4-aminoquinolone antimalarial drugs for prophylaxis. Statistical analysis demonstrates that the numbers and incidence of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths are substantially lower (multiple-fold lower) in countries with the highest prevalence of malaria. The difference between both the COVID-19 incidence rate and the COVID-19 mortality rate in malaria prevalent countries compared to COVID-19 prevalent countries is statistically significant (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04 respectively). This study provides further evidence that anti-malaria drugs may prove essential to breaking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing COVID-19 and COVID-19 related mortality. As the pandemic continues to evolve and doctors and researchers across the globe try to attenuate or stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the medical community should not overlook the potential role of the 4-aminoquinolones anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and 8-aminoquinolone anti-malaria drugs, tafenoquine and primaquine, as a prophylaxis.","output":"COVID-19 cases are less prevalent in countries where malaria is endemic, suggesting a role for anti-malarial drugs as prophylaxis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a word that is increasingly facing issues related to climate change, environmental degradation, economic crisis and social inequalities, rethinking the urban development models is becoming an imperative. Furthermore, the COVID-19 is accelerating this necessity. In fact, the health emergency has affected almost all sectors, determining radical change in economic and social systems. Tourism and culture are among those most affected and therefore they require strategies to support their recovery and to strengthen their resilience for the future. The closure of cultural venues has highlighted the importance of finding alternative ways to join cultural heritage and to allow it continuing to develop its productive potential. In this context, the importance of the opportunities offered by digital technologies for conservation, valorization and enjoyment of cultural heritage has emerged. This study proposes the circular city as a new urban development model to achieve a more sustainable future, focusing in particular on cultural heritage as an entry point to implement this model.

METHODS: This was an observational, prospective, usual care study including consecutive patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases in maintenance therapy with RTX. All patients received a two-dose regimen COVID-19 vaccination. Serum IgG antibody levels against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike proteins were measured at the time of the new RTX infusion. RESULTS: From the recruited patients, 16/45 (36%) produced antibodies reaching the assay cut-off value of 15 AU/ml and 29/45 (64%) had a negative serology. Within RTX-treated patients, 25 (56%) had undetectable B cells. Negative serology was associated with undetectable B cells (24/25 vs 5/20, P < 0.001). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies correlated with CD19 counts (r = 0.86, P < 0.001). The effect of RTX and MTX was additive in terms of seroconversion rates (23% vs 50% in patients receiving RTX in monotherapy, P = 0.12) and SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody levels [3.80 (95% CI 3.80, 7.50) vs 75 (95% CI 3.8, 353) AU/ml in patients receiving RTX in monotherapy; P = 0.025]. Multivariate analyses including demographics, disease characteristics, gammaglobulin levels, RTX and other therapies used, CD19 counts, and the time between the last RTX infusion and vaccination identified detectable B cells as the only variable independently associated with seropositivity [odds ratio 35.2 (95% CI 3.59, 344.20)]. CONCLUSIONS: B cell depletion is the main independent contributing factor of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in RTX-treated patients.

Probabilistic theories often treat it as axiomatic, whereas it follows from the meanings of conditionals in the theory of mental models. In this theory, intuitive models (system 1) do not represent what is false, and so produce errors in estimates of p(if A then C), yielding instead p(A & C). Deliberative models (system 2) are normative, and yield the proportion of cases of A in which C holds, i.e., the Equation. Intuitive estimates of the probability of a conditional about unique events: If covid-19 disappears in the USA, then Biden will run for a second term, together with those of each of its clauses, are liable to yield joint probability distributions that sum to over 100%.

More than 99% of malaria cases are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the main vector being the mosquito Anopheles albimanus. In this paper, we describe the epidemiological profile of malaria in Haiti between 2009 and 2018. METHODS: We analyzed information on cases reported by the Ministry of Health of Haiti and the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2018, 232,479 malaria cases were reported by the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP); an increase in the incidence of malaria in the country in 2010, followed by a decrease in 2011, was primarily observed. Due to recent efforts to reduce malaria by 2020, its incidence declined from 60,130 cases in 2010 to 8,978 cases in 2018. Controversially, in terms of the number of reported cases, the MSPP and WHO report conflicting data. However, the results from both datasets present the same trend in Haiti from 2009 to 2018. The results also illustrate the endemicity of the disease throughout Haiti, both in rural and urban areas, especially along the coast.

The audio file comprises many features, which are highly important in classifying the results. It is important to convert the audio signals into the required spectrograms. In this article, we are trying to find efficient solutions to the problem of predicting the reason behind an infant's cry.

To address this, we employed cerebroventricular microinjection (CVMI) to deliver Pgk1 into the brain of larvae and adult zebrafish treated with methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as a PD-like model. The number of dopamine-producing cells in ventral diencephalon clusters of Pgk1-injected, MPTP-treated embryos increased over that of MPTP-treated embryos. Swimming distances of Pgk1-injected, MPTP-treated larvae and adult zebrafish were much longer compared to MPTP-treated samples. The effect of injected Pgk1 on both dopamine-producing cells and locomotion was time- and dose-dependent. Indeed, injected Pgk1 could be detected, located on dopamine neurons. When the glycolytic mutant Pgk1, Pgk1-T378P, was injected into the brain of MPTP-treated zebrafish groups, the protective ability of dopaminergic neurons did not differ from that of normal Pgk1. Therefore, ePgk1 is functionally independent from intracellular Pgk1 serving as an energy supplier. Furthermore, when Pgk1 was added to the culture medium for culturing dopamine-like SH-SY5Y cells, it could reduce the ROS pathway and apoptosis caused by the neurotoxin MPP+.

We then built a pipeline for systematically pre-processing the text to ensure quality input to the core classification model. Finally, results of the model were filtered by a series of post-processing steps. Our classification model itself uses the FLAIR language model pre-trained on PubMed abstracts. The modular nature of our pipeline allows for ease of future developments in this area by substituting higher quality components at each stage of the pipeline.

Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalisation to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence implicating expression of multiple genes, including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased mucin expression (MUC1), in severe disease.

RECENT FINDINGS Supportive care in Influenza centres around optimizing respiratory failure, particularly through well established and recognized ventilatory strategies. Noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen may have a limited role in selected patients under carefully monitored circumstances. Drug therapy exerts only a modest clinical effect and has been poorly studied in the critically ill, though there is some evidence to support the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) - particularly oseltamivir - as early as possible in this cohort. Newer agents have failed to demonstrate superiority over NAIs but may be useful options if the patient fails to respond or should resistant influenza strains emerge. Steroid therapy, in the absence of another indication, must be recommended against given the repeated trend towards increased mortality in this group.

Implementation of stay-at-home orders was associated with a gradual increase in domestic violence hotline calls. Although 911 calls regarding assault fell by nearly half, calls to police for domestic violence were unchanged. In sum, there was a decrease in help-seeking for sexual assault and assault in general but not for domestic violence during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis underscores the importance of distinguishing between the violence itself, calls to police, and calls to helplines when claims are made about changes over time in violence against women. The opportunities and constraints for each can differ widely under usual circumstances, circumstances that were altered by public health interventions related to the pandemic.","output":"The Endemic Amid the Pandemic: Seeking Help for Violence Against Women in the Initial Phases of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Refugees are already a vulnerable group in society and are in a stressful situation due to their often uncertain legal status in seeking asylum and integration in the new society after migration Refugees are, in general, at greater risk of poor health outcomes when contracting Covid-19, exacerbated by poor living conditions and difficulties in accessing healthcare The longer-term social consequences of the pandemic also disproportionately impact refugees, including social isolation, unemployment, and difficulties to obtain correct health information The aim of this paper is to review the social and health consequences that Covid-19 has brought to the refugees residing in Sweden This needs to be emphasized in order to mitigate against these likely consequences and improve the overall well-being among such a highly vulnerable group in society As Covid-19 demonstrates, human health needs to be understood holistically, meaning that the vulnerability of any individuals, or even nations, is a vulnerability for the whole population requiring urgent action ?

AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by decline of memory, behavioral impairments that affects a persons ability to function independently ultimately leading to death. The current pressing need for a treatment for (AD) and advances in the field of cell therapy, has rendered stem cell therapeutics a promising field of research. Despite advancements in stem cell technology, confirmed by encouraging pre-clinical utilization of stem cells in AD animal models, the number of clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of stem cell therapy is limited, with the results of many ongoing clinical trials on cell therapy for AD still pending. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been the main focus in these studies, reporting encouraging results concerning safety profile, however their efficacy remains unproven. In the current article we review the latest advances regarding different sources of stem cell therapy and present a comprehensive list of every available clinical trial in national and international registries. Finally, we discuss drawbacks arising from AD pathology and technical limitations that hinder the transition of stem cell technology from bench to bedside. Our findings emphasize the need to increase clinical trials towards uncovering the mode of action and the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of transplanted cells as well as the molecular mechanisms controlling regeneration and neuronal microenvironment.","output":"Advances in stem cell therapy in Alzheimers disease: a comprehensive clinical trial review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 affects mainly the lungs, however, other manifestations, including neurological manifestations, have also been described during the disease. Some of the neurological findings have involved intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage, strokes, and other thrombotic/hemorrhagic conditions. Nevertheless, the gross pathology of hemorrhagic lesions in the central nervous system has not been previously described in Brazilian autopsy cases. This study aimed to describe gross and microscopic central nervous system (CNS) pathology findings from the autopsies and correlate them with the clinical and laboratory characteristics of forty-five patients with COVID-19 from Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Forty-four patients were autopsied of which thirty-eight of these (86.36%) were positive by RT-PCR for COVID-19, and six (13.3%) were positive by the serological rapid test. Clinical and radiological findings were compatible with the infection. The patients were classified in two groups: presence (those who had hemorrhagic and/or thrombotic manifestations in the CNS) and absence (those who did not present hemorrhagic and/or thrombotic manifestations in the CNS). For risk assessment, relative risk and respective confidence intervals were estimated. Macroscopic or microscopic hemorrhages were found in twenty-three cases (52,27%). The postmortem gross examination of the brain revealed a broad spectrum of hemorrhages, from spots to large and confluent areas and, under microscopy, we observed mainly perivascular discharge. The association analyses showed that the use of corticosteroid, anticoagulant and antibiotic had no statistical significance with a risk of nervous system hemorrhagic manifestations. However, it is possible to infer a statistical tendency that indicates that individuals with diabetes had a higher risk for the same outcome (RR = 1.320, 95% CI = 0.7375 to 2.416, p = 0.3743), which was not observed in relation to other comorbidities. It is unknown whether the new variants of the virus can cause different clinical manifestations, such as those observed or indeed others. As a result, more studies are necessary to define clinical and radiologic monitoring protocols and strategic interventions for patients at risk of adverse and fatal events, such as the extensive hemorrhaging described here. It is imperative that clinicians must be aware of comorbidities and the drugs used to treat patients with COVID-19 to prevent CNS hemorrhagic and thrombotic events.","output":"Hemorrhagic and thrombotic manifestations in the central nervous system in COVID-19: A large observational study in the Brazilian Amazon with a complete autopsy series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On September 18, 2009, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) was notified by a local hospital of a suspected case of fatal laboratory-acquired infection with Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. The patient, a researcher in a university laboratory, had been working along with other members of the laboratory group with a pigmentation-negative (pgm-) attenuated Y. pestis strain (KIM D27). The strain had not been known to have caused laboratory-acquired infections or human fatalities. Other researchers in a separate university laboratory facility in the same building had contact with a virulent Y. pestis strain (CO92) that is considered a select biologic agent; however, the pgm- attenuated KIM D27 is excluded from the National Select Agent Registry. The university, CDPH, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), and CDC conducted an investigation to ascertain the cause of death. This report summarizes the results of that investigation, which determined that the cause of death likely was an unrecognized occupational exposure (route unknown) to Y. pestis, leading to septic shock. Y. pestis was isolated from premortem blood cultures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified the clinical isolate as a pgm- strain of Y. pestis. Postmortem examination revealed no evidence of pneumonic plague. A postmortem diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis was made on the basis of histopathologic, laboratory, and genetic testing. One possible explanation for the unexpected fatal outcome in this patient is that hemochromatosis-induced iron overload might have provided the infecting KIM D27 strain, which is attenuated as a result of defects in its ability to acquire iron, with sufficient iron to overcome its iron-acquisition defects and become virulent. Researchers should adhere to recommended biosafety practices when handling any live bacterial cultures, even attenuated strains, and institutional biosafety committees should implement and maintain effective surveillance systems to detect and monitor unexpected acute illness in laboratory workers.","output":"Fatal laboratory-acquired infection with an attenuated Yersinia pestis Strain--Chicago, Illinois, 2009."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a deep learning (DL)\\\\based automated whole lung and COVID\\\\19 pneumonia infectious lesions (COLI\\\\Net) detection and segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) images.

We aimed to characterise the experiences of those working in English NHS secondary mental health services during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods: : The design was a qualitative interview-based study. We conducted semi-structured, remote (telephone or online) interviews with 35 members of staff from NHS secondary (inpatient and community) mental health services in England. Analysis was based on the constant comparative method. Results: : Participants reported wide-ranging changes in the organisation of secondary mental health care and the nature of work in response to the pandemic, including pausing of all services deemed to be non-essential, deployment of staff across services to new and unfamiliar roles, and moves to remote working. The quality of participants working life was impaired by increasing levels of daily challenge associated with trying to provide care in trying and constrained circumstances, the problems of forging new ways of working remotely, and constraints on ability to access informal support for decision-making. Participants were confronted with difficult dilemmas relating to clinical decision-making, prioritisation of care, and compromises in ability to perform the therapeutic function of their roles. Other dilemmas centred on trying to balance the risks of controlling infection with the need for human contact. Many reported features of moral injury linked to their perceived failures in providing the quality or level of care that they felt service users needed. They sometimes sought to compensate for deficits in care through increased advocacy, taking on additional tasks, or making exceptions, but this led to further personal strain. Many experienced feelings of grief, helplessness, isolation, distress, and burnout. These problems were compounded by sometimes poor communication about service changes and by staff feeling that they could not take time off because of the potential impact on others. Some reported feeling poorly supported by organisations. Conclusions: : Mental health workers faced multiple adversities during the pandemic that were highly consequential for their wellbeing.

The present study mainly explores the predictive significance of coagulation parameters at the time of NEC diagnosis in identifying the patients who eventually received surgery and/or NEC-related deaths. METHODS: The retrospective study of 114 neonates with NEC was conducted with assessments of demographic data, laboratory results at the time of NEC diagnosis, treatment methods and prognosis. According to treatment methods, patients were divided into surgical intervention group and medical treatment group. Predictive factors were put forward and determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. An analysis of the surgical intervention and prognosis was performed. RESULTS: Of 114 patients, 46 (40.4%) cases received surgical intervention and 14 (12.3%) deaths. prothrombin time (PT), PT international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen and platelet count at the time of NEC diagnosis were independently associated with surgical NEC. The APTT could identify patients at high risk for surgical NEC, with 67.39% sensitivity, 86.76% specificity, better than that of other serological parameters. Coagulopathy was found in 38.6% of all patients. For surgical intervention, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of coagulopathy was 0.869 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.794 ~ 0.944, P < 0.001), with 82.61% sensitivity and 91.18% specificity, outperformed APTT (95% CI: 0.236 ~ 0.173, P = 0.001).

As this drug moves into clinical trials, further characterization of GC376 with the main protease of coronaviruses is required to gain insight into the drugs properties, such as reversibility and broad specificity. Reversibility is an important factor for therapeutic proteolytic inhibitors to prevent toxicity due to off-target effects. Here we demonstrate that GC376 has nanomolar Ki values with the Mpro from both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strains. Restoring enzymatic activity after inhibition by GC376 demonstrates reversible binding with both proteases. In addition, the stability and thermodynamic parameters of both proteases were studied to shed light on physical chemical properties of these viral enzymes, revealing higher stability for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The comparison of a new X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV complexed with GC376 reveals similar molecular mechanism of inhibition compared to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and gives insight into the broad specificity properties of this drug. In both structures, we observe domain swapping of the N-termini in the dimer of the Mpro, which facilitates coordination of the drugs P1 position.

DESIGN: The data consist of 41 thematic one-on-one interviews conducted during May-December 2020 with family members of nursing home residents. Convenience sampling was utilized by asking several nursing homes in different parts of Finland to relay a contact request from the researchers to the residents' family members. The main themes of the interviews were lockdown and visiting restrictions. Subthemes included the frequency of visits, other means of interaction, changes in the relationships of family members with their loved ones and with nursing home staff, and the feelings aroused by the situation. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, resulting in 794 pages of data. METHOD: The qualitative study uses inductive content analysis. NVivo12 software facilitated the systematic coding of the data. RESULTS: According to the family members, distancing aggravated the residents' pre-existing conditions: they reported a sudden progression in memory disorders and significant deterioration in physical abilities, for example. Both residents and family members experienced anxiety, grief, and severe stress, and family members expressed concern that residents might die due to a lack of social contact and activity. Family members were also frustrated about not being able to touch their relatives or participate in their care, and therefore sometimes thought that their visits were useless. New forms of interaction with family members, introduced by the nursing homes, were appreciated. However, some family members perceived the interactional protocols as unfair and complained about insufficient information. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underline the need for nursing homes to implement a good interactional protocol. Overall, the results show that the measures taken to protect residents' health during the Covid-19 outbreak were short-sighted in terms of the social dimension of well-being.

At the 11th workshop on VKH, the disease was said to be well controlled with corticosteroids alone in Japanese patients. The aim of this study was to review the literature to determine whether different levels of severity exist in different geographical areas. METHODS: Literature was reviewed for studies on the evolution of initial-onset VKH disease, looking at treatment modalities and proportion of cases with chronic evolution and/or sunset-glow fundus (SGF). RESULTS: PubMed search yielded 1249 references containing the term of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada. Twenty references (15 from outside of Japan and 5 from Japan) contained information on the evolution of treated initial-onset disease. For the \\"international\\" group, percentage of chronic evolution after systemic corticosteroid monotherapy was 61%, and after combined steroidal and non-steroidal therapy it fell to 2% (0% in 3/4 studies). In the Japanese studies where all patients received systemic corticosteroids alone, chronic evolution was reported in 25%; however, SGF amounted to 61%. CONCLUSION: In the world at large, chronic evolution of initial-onset VKH disease treated with corticosteroids alone concerned two-thirds of patients.

Outcome measuresPrimary outcome was change in service utilisation between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Secondary outcome was the change in proportions of users of healthcare services with milder or more severe illness (e.g. triage scores). Results3097 unique references were identified, and 81 studies across 20 countries included, reporting on >11 million services pre-pandemic and 6.9 million during pandemic. For the primary outcome, there were 143 estimates of changes, with a median 37% reduction in services overall (interquartile range -51% to -20%), comprising median reductions for visits of 42%(-53% to -32%), admissions, 28%(-40% to -17%), diagnostics, 31%(-53% to -24%), and for therapeutics, 30%(-57% to -19%). Among 35 studies reporting secondary outcomes, there were 60 estimates, with 27(45%) reporting larger reductions in utilisation among people with a milder spectrum of illness, and 33 (55%) reporting no change. ConclusionsHealthcare utilisation decreased by about a third during the pandemic, with considerable variation, and with greater reductions among people with less severe illness. While addressing unmet need remains a priority, studies of health impacts of reductions may help health-systems prioritise higher-value care in the post-pandemic recovery.

PROSPERO: CRD42020203729 Strengths and limitations of this study- The review is the first broad synthesis of global studies of pandemic related changes in utilisation across all categories of healthcare services. - The review provides novel findings informing design of future studies of pandemic-related changes in utilisation and its impacts. - Limitations include the possibility of publication bias and the potential of our eligibility criteria to exclude important data sources such as studies in single-centres and unpublished datasets from health systems. - Heterogenous designs and settings precluding meta-analysis.","output":"Pandemic impacts on healthcare utilisation: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In order to deal with the current pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus several serological immunoassays have been recently developed with the objective of being used as a complementary diagnostic tool and to support the RT-PCR technique currently considered the \\"gold-standard\\" method. However, these new assays need to be evaluated and validated. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays (two ELISA and three CLIA assays) and one rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: Five semiquantitative immunoassays (MENARINI?, PALEX?, VIRCLIA?, ROCHE? and SIEMENS?) and one lateral flow rapid test (WONDFO?) were performed. A total of 124 samples were studied. Case serum samples (n=78) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR/epidemiological-clinical-radiological criteria, and control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n=46) belonged to healthy healthcare workers involved in a seroprevalence study. RESULTS: Overall, the tests showed sensitivities around 70-90% and specificities greater than 95%, including the immunochromatographic test. In addition, we observed very good agreements among them, being better for the detection of IgG than for IgM antibodies (Cohen's kappa index of 0.95 for VIRCLIA? IgG with ROCHE?), as well as good diagnostic power of the tests as determined by the ROC curves. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the proper performance of the different immunoassays in order to be applied in the clinical practice as support in the diagnostic approach and in the development of vaccines and seroepidemiological studies of COVID-19.","output":"Evaluation of five immunoassays and one lateral flow immunochromatography for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Providing adequate writing instruction and practice in schools is an essential cornerstone of writing development and it affords a diagnostic approach for teachers. But what writing instruction is being practiced in Australian primary schools? The aim of this study was to survey a sample of teachers (n = 310) about their instructional practices for writing and their preparation and self-efficacy to teach writing. The majority of the teachers surveyed indicated they allocated on average less than three hours per week for writing practice in their classrooms, with findings further showing a large variability in the frequency of writing practice ranging from 15 min to 7.5 h per week. Findings suggested an emphasis placed on teaching foundational skills, such as spelling, over the teaching of process skills, such as planning and revising. Results further indicated that less emphasis is placed on teaching handwriting and typing. The majority of participating teachers reported implementing only six of the 20 different instructional practices included in the survey on a weekly basis, with school-home strategies being the least frequently reported strategies to foster students writing development. Most teachers expressed positive beliefs about their preparation and self-efficacy for teaching writing. Results from multiple regression analysis showed that preparation and self-efficacy for teaching writing significantly and statistically accounted for variability in using evidence-based practices, teaching foundational skills, and teaching process skills. However, only self-efficacy made a statically significant contribution to predicting strategies to extend writing to the home environment.

The therapeutic index (TI = CC(50)/EC(50)) was calculated for each compound. The potential synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effect of different compound combinations was determined by CalcuSyn v1 software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK), which estimated the combination index (CI) values. Iota and lambda carrageenan showed the most potent antiviral activity (EC(50) between 3.2 and 7.5 g/mL). Carrageenan and griffithsin combinations exhibited synergistic activity (EC(50) between 0.2 and 3.8 g/mL; combination index <1), including against recent SARS-CoV-2 mutations.

METHODS: An entire population-based epidemiological study was conducted. Data collection was based on the Child Death Reporting Card of the Beijing Under-5 Mortality Rate Surveillance Network. Trends in mortality and leading causes of death were analysed using the (2) test and SPSS 19.0 software. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was fitted to forecast U5MRs between 2016 and 2020 using the EViews 8.0 software. RESULTS: Mortality in neonates, infants and children aged under 5 years decreased by 84.06%, 80.04% and 80.17% from 1992 to 2015, respectively. However, the U5MR increased by 7.20% from 2013 to 2015. Birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities comprised the top five causes of death. The greatest, most rapid reduction was that of pneumonia by 92.26%, with an annual average rate of reduction of 10.53%. The distribution of causes of death differed among children of different ages. Accidental asphyxia and sepsis were among the top five causes of death in children aged 28 days to 1 year and accident was among the top five causes in children aged 1C4 years. The U5MRs in Beijing are projected to be 2.88, 2.87, 2.90, 2.97 and 3.09 for the period 2016C2020, based on the predictive model. CONCLUSION: Beijing has made considerable progress in reducing U5MRs from 1992 to 2015. However, U5MRs could show a slight upward trend from 2016 to 2020. Future considerations for child healthcare include the management of birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities.

Their ability to predict influenza-related pneumonia, however, is less well-established. METHODS: A total of 693 laboratory-confirmed FluA-p patients diagnosed between Jan 2013 and Dec 2018 and recruited from five teaching hospitals in China were included in the study. The sample included 494 patients in the derivation cohort and 199 patients in the validation cohort. The prediction rule was established based on independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in FluA-p patients from the derivation cohort. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality of FluA-p patients was 19.6% (136/693). The FluA-p score was based on a multivariate logistic regression model designed to predict mortality. Results indicated the following significant predictors (regression statistics and point contributions toward total score in parentheses): blood urea nitrogen > 7 mmol/L (OR 1.604, 95% CI 1.150C4.492, p = 0.040; 1 points), pO(2)/F(i)O(2)  250 mmHg (OR 2.649, 95% CI 1.103C5.142, p = 0.022; 2 points), cardiovascular disease (OR 3.967, 95% CI 1.269C7.322, p < 0.001; 3 points), arterial PH < 7.35 (OR 3.959, 95% CI 1.393C7.332, p < 0.001; 3 points), smoking history (OR 5.176, 95% CI 2.604C11.838, p = 0.001; 4 points), lymphocytes < 0.8  10(9)/L (OR 8.391, 95% CI 3.271C16.212, p < 0.001; 5 points), and early neurominidase inhibitor therapy (OR 0.567, 95% CI 0.202C0.833, p = 0.005; ? 2 points).

In many territorial species, territory owners advertise territorial boundaries to conspecifics by scent marking. Several studies have investigated the information that scent marks convey about donors' characteristics (e.g., dominance, age, sex, reproductive status), but less is known about whether scents affect the behavior and stress of recipients. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that scent marking may be a potent source of social stress in territorial species. We tested this hypothesis for Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus) during lactation, when territorial females defend individual nest-burrows against conspecifics. We exposed lactating females, on their territory, to the scent of other lactating females. Scents were either from unfamiliar females, kin relatives (a mother, daughter, or sister), or their own scent (control condition). We expected females to react strongly to novel scents from other females on their territory, displaying increased vigilance, and higher cortisol levels, indicative of behavioral and physiological stress. We further expected females to be more sensitive to unfamiliar female scents than to kin scents, given the matrilineal social structure of this species and known fitness benefits of co-breeding in female kin groups. Females were highly sensitive to intruder (both unfamiliar and kin) scents, but not to their own scent. Surprisingly, females reacted more strongly to the scent of close kin than to the scent of unfamiliar females. Vigilance behavior increased sharply in the presence of scents; this increase was more marked for kin than unfamiliar female scents, and was mirrored by a marked 131% increase in free plasma cortisol levels in the presence of kin (but not unfamiliar female) scents. Among kin scents, lactating females were more vigilant to the scent of sisters of equal age, but showed a marked 318% increase in plasma free cortisol levels in response to the scent of older and more dominant mothers. These results suggest that scent marks convey detailed information on the identity of intruders, directly affecting the stress axis of territory holders.","output":"Territorial scent-marking effects on vigilance behavior, space use, and stress in female Columbian ground squirrels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS In addition to laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LS), laparoscopic pectopexy (LP) is a novel surgical method for correcting apical prolapse. The descended cervix or vaginal vault is suspended with a synthetic mesh by fixing the bilateral mesh ends to the pectineal ligaments. This study was aimed at developing a learning curve for LP and to compare it with results with LS. METHODS We started laparoscopic/robotic pectopexy in our department in August 2019. This retrospective study included the initial 18 consecutive women with apical prolapse receiving LP and another group undergoing LS (21 cases) performed by the same surgeon. The medical and video records were reviewed. RESULTS The age was older in the LP group than in the LS group (65.2 vs 53.1 years). The operation time of LP group was significantly shorter than that of the LS group (182.9  27.2 vs 256.2  45.5 min, p < 0.001). The turning point of the LP learning curve was observed at the 12th case. No major complications such as bladder, ureteral, bowel injury or uncontrolled bleeding occurred in either group. Postoperative low back pain and defecation symptoms occurred exclusively in the LS group. During the follow-up period (mean 7.2 months in LP, 16.2 months in LS), none of the cases had recurrent apical prolapse. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic pectopexy is a feasible surgical method for apical prolapse, with a shorter operation time and less postoperative discomfort than LS. LP may overcome the steep learning curve of LS because the surgical field of LP is limited to the anterior pelvis and avoids encountering the critical organs.","output":"Laparoscopic pectopexy: the learning curve and comparison with laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Accurate population-level assessment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) burden is fundamental for navigating the path forward during the ongoing pandemic, but current knowledge is scant. We conducted the first nationwide population study using a probability-based sample to assess active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, combined with a longitudinal follow-up of the entire cohort over the next 6 months. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing results and the first 3-week follow-up results are presented. METHODS: A probability-based sample of the Slovenian population comprising data from 2.1 million people was selected from the Central Population Register (n = 3000). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal samples using the cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 assay. Each participant filled in a detailed baseline questionnaire with basic sociodemographic data and detailed medical history compatible with COVID-19. After 3 weeks, participants were interviewed for the presence of COVID-19-compatible clinical symptoms and signs, including in household members, and offered immediate testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA if indicated. RESULTS: A total of 1368 individuals (46%) consented to participate and completed the questionnaire. Two of 1366 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (prevalence 0.15%; posterior mean 0.18%, 95% Bayesian confidence interval 0.03-0.47; 95% highest density region (HDR) 0.01-0.41).

To mitigate transmission of COVID-19 at polling locations, jurisdictions have adopted changes to protocols and procedures, informed by CDC's interim guidance, developed in collaboration with the Election Assistance Commission (2). The driving principle for this guidance is that voting practices with lower infection risk will be those which reduce the number of voters who congregate indoors in polling locations by offering a variety of methods for voting and longer voting periods. The guidance for in-person voting includes considerations for election officials, poll workers, and voters to maintain healthy environments and operations. To assess knowledge and adoption of mitigation strategies, CDC collaborated with the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services and the Delaware State Election Commission on a survey of poll workers who served during the statewide primary election on September 15, 2020. Among 522 eligible poll workers, 93% correctly answered all three survey questions about COVID-19 transmission. Respondents noted that most voters and poll workers wore masks. However, masks were not always worn correctly (i.e., covering both the nose and mouth). Responses suggest that mitigation measures recommended for both poll workers and voters were widely adopted and feasible, but also highlighted gaps in infection prevention control efforts. Strengthening of measures intended to minimize the risk of poll workers acquiring COVID-19 from ill voters, such as additional training and necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as support for alternative voting options for ill voters, are needed. Adherence to mitigation measures is important not only to protect voters but also to protect poll workers, many of whom are older adults, and thus at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness. Enhanced attention to reducing congregation in polling locations, correct mask use, and providing safe voting options for ill voters are critical considerations to minimize risk to voters and poll workers. Evidence from the Delaware election supports the feasibility and acceptability of implementing current CDC guidance for election officials, poll workers, and voters for mitigating COVID-19 transmission at polling locations (2).","output":"Adoption of Strategies to Mitigate Transmission of COVID-19 During a Statewide Primary Election - Delaware, September 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant spread in congregate settings and various forms of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) have been implemented to prevent spread Basic Military Training at Joint Base-San Antonio is the entrance to the US Air Force and has been associated with respiratory outbreaks in the past A two-week arrival quarantine was implemented in March 2020 Effects on subsequent testing for COVID-19 after an arrival quarantine is unknown Methods: The first four weekly cohorts of trainees who underwent an arrival quarantine between March 16-April 13 were monitored during their 7 week training for COVID-19 symptoms Symptoms, medical testing, and days removed from training were collected on every patient with possible COVID-19 symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, or fever Testing during the two-week arrival quarantine were compared to the subsequent five weeks of training Nominal variables were compared by chi squared or Fisher's exact test as appropriate Continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U Test Results: A total of 2,573 started training during study period, 89 (3 4%) had symptoms concerning for COVID-19 and were tested 5 (6%) patients tested positive, all of whom in the arrival quarantine Compared to patients who completed quarantine (n=29), patients in the arrival quarantine who tested negative for COVID-19 (n=54) were tested more often (26 trainees a week vs 5 8 later in training, p=&lt; 0 0001), and received more rapid flu tests (74% vs 38%, p=0 001) and multiplex respiratory PCR (15% vs 0%, p=0 05) Trainees in quarantine were isolated longer for symptoms than patients who completed quarantine (median 3 vs 2, p=0 01) There was no difference in presenting symptoms for trainees in quarantine or after quarantine Conclusion: Arrival quarantine appears to be an effective NPI, which in conjunction with other interventions prevented any COVID-19 transmission after quarantine completion For those who went through arrival quarantine, there was more intense initial testing and initial longer symptomatic patient isolation, this was balanced by fewer symptomatic patients, less testing, and shorter isolations later in training","output":"The effects of arrival quarantine on subsequent COVID-19 testing in a cohort of military basic trainees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has infected over 109 000 000 people with 2 423 443 deaths as of February 17, 2021.

Conclusion: DM is an important risk factor for adverse endpoints in patients with COVID-19. In diabetic patients, proper consideration of clinical characteristics is thus of utmost importance. In addition, special clinical insight for disease prevention, good glycemic control during hospitalization, and efforts to develop a vaccine can help improve disease outcomes in this population.","output":"The Association between Poor Glycemic Control in Diabetes Mellitus and Progression of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, and spread gradually throughout the world There are multiple reports of prolonged viral shedding in people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2);however, such findings have not been documented in Bangladesh Herein, we present a case of metabolic syndrome that remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over a prolonged period On clinical and laboratory examination, the patient was diagnosed with obesity, raised blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and uncontrolled glycemia However, upon taking appropriate measures and controlling the plasma sugar level, he tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on the 72nd day since illness onset We observed that COVID-19 patients with several comorbidities, such as metabolic syndrome, may shed the virus over a prolonged period Therefore, strict public health measures and isolation rules should be followed by a high-risk population","output":"Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a male with metabolic syndrome for 72 days: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to analyze the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on 120 patients with schizophrenia, and their caregivers (control group), in the city of Arica, northern Chile. The hypotheses of this study hold that (1) self-reports of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among patients and caregivers would be positively correlated, (2) caregivers would self-report a greater impact of the pandemic on their daily lives, and (3) patients infected with COVID-19 would experience lower levels of mental health improvement and higher levels of psychological distress. Hypotheses were tested using correlations, mean differences, and effect sizes (Cohens d). The results showed that patients with schizophrenia who had been in quarantine for almost a year showed similar levels of concern as their caregivers in the domains of health and social life. However, caregivers showed significant differences from patients in the areas of income, concern, and employment status. In addition, patients who were infected with COVID-19 showed lower levels of well-being and worse psychological recovery. The implications of the findings highlight the need to incorporate mental health interventions in the pandemic health context for caregivers of people with schizophrenia.

We analyzed tissue ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis (EG), and in normal adult esophagi using publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets. Similar to findings evaluating the airway, there was no difference in tissue ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in EoE or EG when compared with control non-EoE/EG esophagus/stomach. ACE2 gene expression was significantly lower in esophagi from children with or without EoE and from adults with EoE as compared with normal adult esophagi.

In this study a general rhinovirus assay is described which utilises synthetic oligonucleotides as probes in a filter hybridization assay. The probes are designed to bind to short but highly conserved regions of the rhinovirus genome. Indeed, the probes successfully detected all 57 rhinovirus serotypes tested. Furthermore, the test was used to demonstrate rhinovirus infection in clinical samples from 57 volunteers, inoculated with HRV, collected on six consecutive days.

The availability of filtering facepiece class 3 (FFP3) respirators could be greatly increased if they could be reused after sterilisation. Aims: To determine the effects of repeated autoclave cycles on the fit and filter function of the 3M 1863 FFP3 disposable respirator. Methods: Participants underwent fit tests with 3M 1863 FFP3 respirators. Respirators were subjected to autoclave cycles and a repeat fit test was conducted after each cycle until failure. The filter function of both unused and autoclaved respirators was determined by quantitatively assessing the differential pressures and filter penetration of aerosolised sodium chloride particles. Mask structural inspection was also carried out by light microscopy. Results: A total of 38 participants were recruited. Repeat fit testing with a new respirator was passed by 30 of 38 (79%) participants in comparison with 31 of 38 (82%) of participants after the respirator had undergone one autoclave cycle. There was fit test failure with further rounds of autoclave. There was no evidence of structural changes after one autoclave cycle, but the nose foam began to separate from the mask following further cycles. Filter efficiency of all 15 autoclaved respirators that underwent filter testing was 97.40% or more. Differential pressure (breathability) of respirators was unaffected by autoclaving. Conclusions: 3M 1863 FFP3 respirator retains good fit and filter function after a single autoclave cycle.

METHODS A systematic review of studies published from inception to May 2020 using Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed and Scopus. Prospective studies, which pre-operatively assessed any imaging modality for the presence of bladder DE, and correlated with the gold standard surgical data as a reference were included. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess quality. This review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059872). RESULTS Of the 1,977 references identified, 8 studies (n = 1,052) were included in the analysis. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity, from which the likelihood ratio of a positive test (LR+), likelihood ratio of a negative test (LR-) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated, for all transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) techniques were 55 % (95 % CI 28-79%), 99 % (95 % CI 98-100%), 54.5 (95 % CI 18.9-157.4), 0.46 (95 % CI 0.25 - 0.85) and 119 (95 % CI 24-577), and for only two-dimensional (2D) TVS 53 % (95 % CI 23-82%), 99 % (96 % CI 97-100%), 48.8 (95 % CI 13.1-181.4), 0.47 (95 % CI 0.23 - 0.98), and 104 (95 % CI 15-711), respectively. Meta-analyses of the other modalities, namely magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal endoscopic sonography (RES), were not possible due to the limited number of studies. There was significant heterogeneity and the studies were considered poor methodologically according to the QUADAS-2 tool. CONCLUSIONS Whilst the sensitivity of TVS was limited, the specificity was excellent. Given that there is a paucity of literature for other imaging modalities, until more studies are performed, TVS should be considered as the first-line tool given it is the only modality with sufficient evidence.","output":"Meta-analysis and systematic review to determine the optimal imaging modality for the detection of bladder deep endometriosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective.

However, while the latest released platforms are equipped with modern microcontrollers, the programming model is still tied to a single-threaded, legacy approach. This limits the exploitation of the underlying hardware platform and poses limitations in new application scenarios, such as IoT and UAVs. This paper presents the Arduino real-time extension (ARTe), which seamlessly extends the Arduino programming model to enable the concurrent execution of multiple loops at different rates configurable by the programmer. This is obtained by embedding a low-footprint, real-time operating system in the Arduino framework. The adherence to the original programming model, together with the hidden support for managing the inherent complexity of concurrent software, allows expanding the applicability of the Arduino framework while ensuring a more efficient usage of the computational resources. Furthermore, the proposed approach allows a finer control of the latencies and the energy consumption. Experimental results show that such advantages are obtained at the cost of a small additional overhead and memory footprint. To highlight the benefits introduced by ARTe, the paper finally presents two case studies, one of such in which ARTe has been leveraged to rapidly prototype a mechanical ventilator for acute COVID-19 cases. We found that ARTe allowed our ventilator design to rapidly adapt to changes in the available components and to the evolving needs of Intensive Care Units (ICU) in the Americas.","output":"ARTe: Providing real-time multitasking to Arduino"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Agriculture remains the most dominant socioeconomic sector of the African economy, accounting for over 60% of total job opportunities, in the face of low productivity, minimal value addition capacities, and poor quality among others such that its global agricultural value-added hovers around 2%.

While there have been several reviews published on COVID-19 and population health disparities generallyincluding some with attention to HIVnone has focused on sexual health (ie, STI care, female sexual health, sexual behaviour). We have conducted a scoping review focused on sexual health (excluding reproductive health (RH), intimate partner violence (IPV) and gender-based violence (GBV)) in the COVID-19 era, examining sexual behaviours and sexual health outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review, compiling both peer-reviewed and grey literature, focused on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and COVID-19 was conducted on 15 September 2020. Multiple bibliographical databases were searched. Study selection conformed to Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. We only included English-language original studies. RESULTS: We found that men who have sex with men may be moving back toward pre-pandemic levels of sexual activity, and that STI and HIV testing rates seem to have decreased. There was minimal focus on outcomes such as the economic impact on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and STI care, especially STI care of marginalised populations. In terms of population groups, there was limited focus on sex workers or on women, especially womens sexual behaviour and mental health. We noticed limited use of qualitative techniques. Very few studies were in low/middle-income countries (LMICs). CONCLUSIONS: Sexual health research is critical during a global infectious disease pandemic and our review of studies suggested notable research gaps. Researchers can focus efforts on LMICs and under-researched topics within sexual health and explore the use of qualitative techniques and interventions where appropriate.","output":"Sexual health (excluding reproductive health, intimate partner violence and gender-based violence) and COVID-19: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that rooms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) present the potential for healthcare-associated transmission through aerosols containing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, data on the presence of these aerosols outside of patient rooms are limited. We investigated whether virus-containing aerosols were present in nursing stations and patient room hallways in a referral center with critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Eight National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health BC 251 2-stage cyclone samplers were set up throughout 6 units, including nursing stations and visitor corridors in intensive care units and general medical units, for 6 h each sampling period. Samplers were placed on tripods which held 2 samplers positioned 102 cm and 152 cm above the floor. Units were sampled for 3 days. Extracted samples underwent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for selected gene regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleocapsid and the housekeeping gene human RNase P as an internal control. RESULTS: The units sampled varied in the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients present on the days of sampling. Some of the units included patient rooms under negative pressure, while most were maintained at a neutral pressure. Of 528 aerosol samples collected, none were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the estimated limit of detection of 8 viral copies/m(3) of air. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 outside of patient rooms was undetectable. While healthcare personnel should avoid unmasked close contact with each other, these findings may provide reassurance for the use of alternatives to tight-fitting respirators in areas outside of patient rooms during the current pandemic.","output":"Bioaerosol Sampling for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a Referral Center with Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients MarchCMay 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acinetobacter pittii is widespread in the environment, and the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, to which it belongs, is a major cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia and bacteremia.

In practice, however, health inequalities still remain. Ideally we would define future public health having sufficient attention to minority groups and their specific needs. One of these groups is people with intellectual disabilities (ID), defined by severe limitations in adaptive and functional behaviour. As a result of these limitations, people with ID suffer from worse health, higher hospitalisation rates and higher premature mortality compared to people without ID. In reducing these health inequalities acquiring accurate information on disease epidemiology in people with ID compared to those without ID is crucial. However, this crucial information is still lacking. This workshop will dive into disease epidemiology in people with ID by highlighting different aspects of health and the difficulties that arise when researching people with ID. First, It has been proven difficult to identify ID in existing data sources. ID-diagnoses in medical records are not too reliable, physicians do not always recognise IDs, or people are embarrassed of their ID-diagnosis. By gaining information on received services or supports specifically for people with ID a more complete representation of the ID-population is gained. Second, prevalence rates on chronic diseases in people with ID are often inconsistent across the literature, probably due to different age and sex patterns of chronic diseases and chronic comorbidities compared to people without ID, but these patterns are often not taken into account. By reporting on chronic disease prevalence and comorbidity patterns in people with versus without ID, a novel insight is gained in comparative epidemiology of chronic diseases of people with and without ID. Third, although it is known that people with mild ID suffer more mental health disorders dan people with no ID, exact prevalence rates and data on the care provided to these people in mental health services is missing. A retrospect database study performed in Dutch mental health care gives insight in this knowledge gap, not only for those people whom are recorded with their mild ID in these mental health services, but also for those people who were not recorded as such. Fourth, the current pandemic of a novel infectious disease stresses the strong need for accurate knowledge of disease epidemiology, particularly concerning high-risk groups such as people with ID. A large-scale registration of COVID-19 in people with ID living in residential settings was developed in the Netherlands, to provide necessary insight in the medical impact of COVID-19 among people with ID and inform policy makers and care providers on specific risks and consequences of COVID-19 in the ID population as compared with the general population. KEY MESSAGES: Insight in disease epidemiology and disease care in people with intellectual disabilities compared to people without intellectual disabilities is crucial in reducing health inequalities. Although it is difficult to identify all people with intellectual disabilities in data sources, using multiple methods and data sources results in a more complete overview of this group of people.","output":"11.H.

It is highly populated and characterized by tropical climatic conditions. Although efforts towards malaria control in Ghana have had positive impacts, malaria remains in the top five diseases reported at healthcare facilities within the Greater Accra Region. To further accelerate progress, analysis of regionally generated data is needed to inform control and management measures at this level. This study aimed to examine the climatic drivers of malaria transmission in the Greater Accra Region and identify inter-district variation in malaria burden. Monthly malaria cases for the Greater Accra Region were obtained from the Ghanaian District Health Information and Management System. Malaria cases were decomposed using seasonal-trend decomposition, based on locally weighted regression to analyze seasonality. A negative binomial regression model with a conditional autoregressive prior structure was used to quantify associations between climatic variables and malaria risk and spatial dependence. Posterior parameters were estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. A total of 1,105,370 malaria cases were recorded in the region from 2015 to 2019. The overall malaria incidence for the region was approximately 47 per 1000 population. Malaria transmission was highly seasonal with an irregular inter-annual pattern. Monthly malaria case incidence was found to decrease by 2.3% (95% credible interval: 0.7C4.2%) for each 1 C increase in monthly minimum temperature. Only five districts located in the south-central part of the region had a malaria incidence rate lower than the regional average at >95% probability level. The distribution of malaria cases was heterogeneous, seasonal, and significantly associated with climatic variables. Targeted malaria control and prevention in high-risk districts at the appropriate time points could result in a significant reduction in malaria transmission in the Greater Accra Region.","output":"A Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Malaria in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana from 2015 to 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for one of the greatest public health challenges of our lifetime, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

METHODS We conducted a systematic search of the electronic databases Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and Web of Science from inception to August 2021 for original research studies of any design that described the use of paracetamol in the prenatal or neonatal (within the first four weeks of life) periods and examined the occurrence of neurodevelopmental, atopic or reproductive adverse outcomes at or beyond birth. RESULTS We identified 1313 unique articles and included 30 studies in the final review. Of all studies, 27 (90%), two (7%) and one (3%) were on the long-term safety of prenatal, neonatal and both prenatal and neonatal exposure, respectively.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was change in SARS-CoV-2 log viral load at day 11 (4 days). Nine prespecified secondary outcome measures were evaluated with comparisons between each treatment group and placebo, and included 3 other measures of viral load, 5 on symptoms, and 1 measure of clinical outcome (the proportion of patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, an emergency department [ED] visit, or death at day 29). Results Among the 577 patients who were randomized and received an infusion (mean age, 44.7 [SD, 15.7] years; 315 [54.6%] women), 533 (92.4%) completed the efficacy evaluation period (day 29). The change in log viral load from baseline at day 11 was -3.72 for 700 mg, -4.08 for 2800 mg, -3.49 for 7000 mg, -4.37 for combination treatment, and -3.80 for placebo. Compared with placebo, the differences in the change in log viral load at day 11 were 0.09 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.52; P = .69) for 700 mg, -0.27 (95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; P = .21) for 2800 mg, 0.31 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.76; P = .16) for 7000 mg, and -0.57 (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.14; P = .01) for combination treatment. Among the secondary outcome measures, differences between each treatment group vs the placebo group were statistically significant for 10 of 84 end points. The proportion of patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations or ED visits was 5.8% (9 events) for placebo, 1.0% (1 event) for 700 mg, 1.9% (2 events) for 2800 mg, 2.0% (2 events) for 7000 mg, and 0.9% (1 event) for combination treatment. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 9 patients (6 bamlanivimab, 2 combination treatment, and 1 placebo). No deaths occurred during the study treatment. Conclusions and Relevance Among nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, compared with placebo, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load at day 11; no significant difference in viral load reduction was observed for bamlanivimab monotherapy. Further ongoing clinical trials will focus on assessing the clinical benefit of antispike neutralizing antibodies in patients with COVID-19 as a primary end point.

This is a question of not just academic interest but real importance for peoples lives. After all, whether States abide by international lawand whether international law is fit for purposeis vitally important for everyone from refugees exposed to the virus in unsanitary detention centers to national leaders fighting disinformation campaigns and safeguarding vaccine supply chains. International law has been central to the worlds response to the pandemic from the starteven if the participants did not always realize it. International law, after all, required States to take certain actions to detect and prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Some governments responded quickly and effectively, significantly reducing the impact on their populations, but many others were far less successful. Many have made matters worse by responding to the virus in ways that exacerbated the toll on the most vulnerable populations, violating their international law obligations in the process. Moreover, some States have used the pandemic as an excuse for delaying elections or for denying arrested persons adequate legal representation. This Article examines the many ways in which COVID-19 is straining the rules and norms of international law. It considers the five main bodies of international law implicated by the pandemic: international humanitarian law, international human rights law, immigration and refugee law, international cyber law, and the rules and regulations of the World Health Organization. It outlines the obligations each body of law impose on States, and how those obligations apply during the current pandemic.

As we write, infection rates are at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary target of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 is the cellular receptor angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme\\\\2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predict that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results while finding additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and endangered aye\\\\aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs are endemic to Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of extinction globally, further understanding of the potential threat of COVID\\\\19 to their health should be a conservation priority.

Enoxaparin might contribute to clinical recovery in COVID-19 patients, both by reducing the risk of thrombosis with anticoagulant effect and avoiding the cytokine storm with its anti-inflammatory effect. In this study, the clinical results of prophylactic enoxaparin usage in COVID-19 patients in our hospital were investigated. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the patients who had hospitalized in our hospital with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 12 and April 17, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to their clinical status. Patients who were discharged to their home were in Group-I and were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) were in Group-II. Patients demographics and laboratory examinations were compared between the groups. Then the effect of LMWH treatment in the rate of ICU transfer was evaluated. RESULTS: There were 1216 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the study period. Increased age, levels of D-Dimer and fibrinogen and decreased hemoglobin, platelet, lymphocyte values were found to be statistically significantly risk factor for the need of ICU. Transfer rates of ICU were two times more in the patients who did not used enoxaparin and readmission after the discharge was higher in the patients who did not received enoxaparin in the hospital. CONCLUSION: Enoxaparin treatment in COVID-19 might be effective not only anticoagulant effect but also anti-inflammatory effect that decreased the risk cytokine storm. In the patients with COVID-19 disease, starting enoxaparin treatment in the earlier stage will decrease the risk of microthrombosis in vital organs and might improve the clinical outcomes.","output":"Aggressive Thromboprophylaxis Improves Clinical Process and Decreases the Need of Intensive Care Unit in Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health-Risk Behaviours (HRBs) are significant antecedent conditions of adverse health outcomes among adolescents, and their prevention requires an in-depth understanding of associated factors. Like any other behaviour, HRBs may be an outcome of a complex interplay between personal and situational factors that determines our responses. Among other factors, emotional tendencies, specific behavioural patterns, and psychosocial environment may be the significant factors working at different hierarchical positions within a system and guiding human behaviours, including HRBs. Previous studies have explored the role of these specific factors in developing and maintaining HRBs, but mainly among the adult population, and no conclusive results could be observed regarding their contribution to HRBs in adolescents. The present study explored the predictability of adolescents engagement in HRBs with regard to three representations of the mentioned factors, i.e., emotion regulation difficulties, perceived parenting practices and personality traits. A total of 723 (Males = 440) adolescents (M(age) = 16.05, SD = 1.1) provided relevant information on the standardized questionnaires. Structural equation modelling was applied to test the stated hypotheses. Analysis revealed that the adolescents who reported more difficulty regulating one's emotions, perceived parenting practice as maladaptive, scored high on neuroticism and low on conscientiousness, showed more engagement in HRBs than their counterparts. Further, the findings indicated that emotion regulation difficulties and perceived parenting practices are stronger predictors of HRBs than personality traits.

We reviewed the literature (January 2020CMarch 2021) to explore strategies to reduce these consequences. Antimicrobial stewardship programs were effective in controlling antibiotic use during past influenza epidemics and have also been shown to reduce healthcare-associated rates of CDI. Another potential strategy is the use of specific strains of probiotics shown to be effective for the prevention of AAD and CDI prior to the pandemic. During 2020, there was a paucity of published trials using these two strategies in COVID-19 patients, but trials are currently ongoing. A multi-strain probiotic mixture was found to be effective in reducing COVID-19-associated diarrhea in one trial.

It is critical, therefore, that we examine the impact of this stressful perinatal period on infants development, growth, and emotional functioning. Methods: We collected data from women (N= 295) over two time periods: once while they were pregnant (T1), and again at approximately one year postpartum (T2). At T1, participants reported on their levels of stress related to COVID-19, including the overall impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their daily life, and on their emotion regulation. At T2, participants reported on their infants temperament. Results: We conducted a hierarchical multiple regression predicting infant negative affect. In the first step, race, education, age, and income explained 6.3% of the variance in infant negative affect (F(10,268)=1.825, p=.058). In the second step, maternal emotion regulation explained an additional 1.3% of the variance in infant negative affect (F(1,267)=3.87, p=.050, =.118). Adding mothers reported impact of COVID-19 to the model explained an additional 1.8% of the variance in infant negative affect (F(1,266)= 5.38, p=.021, =.140), for a total of 5.4% of the variance explained. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that COVID-19-related stress is associated with infant negative affect more strongly than is maternal emotion regulation style. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to monitor pregnant women's levels of stress and distress during times of crisis in order to safeguard and mitigate against sub-optimal developmental trajectories of infant functioning.

Mongolia declared a state of emergency in January 2020 but no study was performed on public adherence to centralised measures and awareness of the pandemic in Mongolia. This study aimed to determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 in the general population, especially regarding the extent to which KAP has contributed to the control measures before local COVID-19 outbreaks. The study was conducted between July and October 2020, when the pandemic was limited to internationally imported cases. We adapted a structured KAP questionnaire that was used to survey residents of Wuhan, China, during the initial outbreak of the pandemic. Participants aged between 13 and 65 years (n=1324, mean age=39.7914.8), 73.2% were women, and 27.2% held a bachelor's degree or above. The results suggested that 81.9% of the participants had sufficient knowledge about the transmission, symptoms, treatment, and prevention of the disease. In the multiple linear regression, an increase in age and education contributed positively to a high knowledge score (p<0.05, p<0.001, respectively). The majority of the participants (96.2%-96.5%) had compliance with the measures to control COVID-19 spread with good practices (82.4%-93.1%) toward COVID-19 prevention. In the binary logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score was associated with a higher likelihood of optimistic attitudes and preventive practices (OR: 0.617-0.845). In conclusion, despite the sufficient knowledge toward the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population of Mongolia, a relatively low level of optimistic attitudes and appropriate practices compared to other populations may negatively impact preventing the outbreak in the society.

However, previous studies attempting to evaluate these spatial diffusion dynamics are limited. Using city as the research unit and spatial association analysis as the primary strategy, this study explored the changing primary risk factors impacting the spatial spread of COVID-19 across Chinese cities under various diffusion assumptions and throughout the epidemic stage. Moreover, this study investigated the characteristics and geographical distributions of high-risk areas in different epidemic stages. The results empirically indicated rapid intercity diffusion at the early stage and primarily intracity diffusion thereafter. Before countermeasures took effect, proximity, GDP per capita, medical resources, outflows from Wuhan and intercity mobility significantly affected early diffusion. With speedily effective countermeasures, outflows from the epicenter, proximity, and intracity outflows played an important role. At the early stage, high-risk areas were mainly cities adjacent to the epicenter, with higher GDP per capita, or a combination of higher GDP per capita and better medical resources, with more outflow from the epicenter, or more intercity mobility. After countermeasures were effected, cities adjacent to the epicenter, or with more outflow from the epicenter or more intracity mobility became high-risk areas.

As the infrastructure to restart endoscopy has been more clearly described, patient concerns regarding viral transmission during the procedure have been identified. Moreover, the efficacy of the measures in preventing transmission have not been clearly delineated. METHODS: We identified patients with pandemic-related procedure cancellations from 3/16/2020 to 4/20/2020. Patients were stratified into tier groups (1C4) by urgency. Procedures were performed using our hospital risk mitigation strategies to minimize transmission risk. Patients who subsequently developed symptoms or tested for COVID-19 were recorded. RESULTS: Among patients requiring emergent procedures, 57.14% could be scheduled at their originally intended interval. COVID-19 concerns represented the most common rescheduling barrier. No patients who underwent post-procedure testing were positive for COVID-19. No cases of endoscopy staff transmission were identified.

We selected some variables from the living conditions indicators that showed a strong correlation with infection rates. The composite variable 'socioeconomic status' included income, education and labour market attachment. 'Household density' included the proportion of people in cramped living conditions and multi-family households. We performed an unadjusted and adjusted standard multiple linear regression analysis of the impact of immigrant ratio, socioeconomic status and household density on infection rates. RESULTS: Immigrant ratio, socioeconomic status and household density were all associated with infection rates in the districts. Pearson's correlation coefficients (95 % CI) were 0.97 (0.93 to 0.99), -0.93 (-0.97 to -0.86) and 0.88 (0.77 to 0.98) respectively, all with p <0.001.

However, it is unclear how different cardiovascular comorbidities affect the mortality among patients with SARS-CoV-2. Methods This was a retrospective study of patients 18 years and older with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with polymerase chain reaction test at a public hospital in New York City between March 2020 and April 2021. Different cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease (CAD), and their effects on the patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for demographics and comorbidities. Results We identified 23,076 patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test;The rate of death was 3.0% (703 patients). Of those patients, 631 (89.8%) had hypertension, 266 (37.8%) had CAD, 104 (14.8%) had end-stage renal disease, 74 (10.5%) experienced a myocardial infarction (MI), 442 (62.9%) had diabetes, and 212 (30.2%) had heart failure. The adjusted odds of death was 2.34 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.59-3.44;p<0.001) for patients with hypertension, 1.43 (95% CI: 1.08-1.88;p<0.013) for patients with heart failure, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.73-1.29;p<0.843) for patients with CAD, 0.227 (95% CI: 0.146-0.351;p<0.001) for patients taking ACE inhibitors, 0.921 (CI: 0.702-1.208;p<0.550) for patients with diabetes, 1.207 (95% CI: 0.724-2.010;p<0.470) for patients with end stage renal disease, and 0.740 (95% CI: 0.431-1.270;<0.274) for patients who experience a MI.

Until now, there is no effective pharmaceutical treatment; conclusively it is important to evaluate the types of applied disinfectants in different areas against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. The aim of this review was to summarize the information about environmental disinfection for preventing of COVID-19. We performed a review of the science direct database to find articles providing information on disinfection used for SARS-CoV-2. The extracted results were given the original data on inactivation coronaviruses by disinfectants in different places of health care facilities. The final search recognized that five groups of disinfectants include: chlorine containing disinfectants, alcohol, UV irradiation, Hydrogen peroxide, and other disinfectant were used against SARS-CoV-2 in different environments. Among these groups, bleach (chlorine containing disinfectants) has the most applicability. Also, in many studies by using disinfectants with 62-71% ethanol can reduce coronavirus in contaminated areas. Furthermore, after the using of operating room for COVID-19 patients, hydrogen peroxide and UV irradiation should be used for 24 h before it can be used again. The povidone-iodine or the chlorhexidine, could be recommended when there is a risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination especially for open wounds. According to the different studies on SARS-CoV-2 disinfection, because of the SARS-CoV-2 can remain in the air and on surfaces, as well as observing individual disinfection guidelines in different hospital areas, disinfection of surfaces is necessary to decrease SARS-CoV-2 spreading.

While standard risk factors including age, obesity, and hypertension have shown good predictive performance, we show that the use of CpG DNA methylation information leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of 10-year T2D incidence risk. Whilst previous studies have been largely constrained by linear assumptions and the use of CpGs one-at-the-time, we have adopted a more flexible approach based on a range of linear and tree-ensemble models for classification and time-to-event prediction. Using the Generation Scotland cohort (n=9,537) our best performing model (Area Under the Curve (AUC)=0.880, Precision Recall AUC (PRAUC)=0.539, McFadden's R2=0.316) used a LASSO Cox proportional-hazards predictor and showed notable improvement in onset prediction, above and beyond standard risk factors (AUC=0.860, PRAUC=0.444 R2=0.261).

However, the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 infection is poorly understood. Previous studies established clinical and biological phenotypes among classical ARDS cohorts, with important therapeutic implications. The phenotypic profile of COVID-19 associated ARDS remains unknown. Methods: We used latent class modeling via a multivariate mixture model to identify phenotypes from clinical and biochemical data collected from 263 patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital intensive care unit with COVID-19-associated ARDS between March 13 and August 2, 2020. Findings: We identified two distinct phenotypes of COVID-19-associated ARDS, with substantial differences in biochemical profiles despite minimal differences in respiratory dynamics. The minority phenotype (class 2, n = 70, 266%) demonstrated increased markers of coagulopathy, with mild relative hyper-inflammation and dramatically increased markers of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., creatinine, troponin). The odds of 28-day mortality among the class 2 phenotype was more than double that of the class 1 phenotype (400% vs. 233%, OR = 22, 95% CI [12, 39]). Interpretation: We identified distinct phenotypic profiles in COVID-19 associated ARDS, with little variation according to respiratory physiology but with important variation according to systemic and extra-pulmonary markers. Phenotypic identity was highly associated with short-term mortality.

Astrocytes are the major target for MHV persistence. However, the mechanisms by which astrocytes survive MHV infection and permit viral persistence are not known. Here we performed DNA microarray analysis on differential gene expression in astrocyte DBT cells by MHV infection and found that the mRNA of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 was significantly decreased following MHV infection. This finding was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and BNip3-promoter-luciferase reporter system. Interestingly, infection with live and ultraviolet light-inactivated viruses equally repressed BNip3 expression, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression does not require virus replication and is mediated during cell entry. Furthermore, treatment of cells with chloroquine, which blocks the acidification of endosomes, significantly inhibited the repression of the BNip3 promoter activity induced by the acidic pH-dependent MHV mutant OBLV60, which enters cells via endocytosis, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression is mediated by fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes during entry. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence between nucleotides 262 and 550 of the 588-base-pair BNip3 promoter is necessary and sufficient for driving the BNip3 expression and that it contains signals that are responsible for MHV-induced down-regulation of BNip3 expression in DBT cells. These results may provide insights into the mechanisms by which MHV evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival, thereby allowing its persistence in the host astrocytes.","output":"Down-regulation of transcription of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 in cultured astrocytes by murine coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immune system is a complex and sophisticated biological system, spanning multiple levels of complexity, from the molecular level to that of tissue. Our current understanding of its function and complexity, of the heterogeneity of leukocytes, is a result of decades of concentrated efforts to delineate cellular markers using conventional methods of antibody screening and antigen identification. In mammalian models, this led to in-depth understanding of individual leukocyte subsets, their phenotypes, and their roles in health and disease. The field was further propelled forward by the development of single-cell (sc) RNA-seq technologies, offering an even broader and more integrated view of how cells work together to generate a particular response. Consequently, the adoption of scRNA-seq revealed the unexpected plasticity and heterogeneity of leukocyte populations and shifted several long-standing paradigms of immunology. This review article highlights the unprecedented opportunities offered by scRNA-seq technology to unveil the individual contributions of leukocyte subsets and their crosstalk in generating the overall immune responses in bony fishes. Single-cell transcriptomics allow identifying unseen relationships, and formulating novel hypotheses tailored for teleost species, without the need to rely on the limited number of fish-specific antibodies and pre-selected markers. Several recent studies on single-cell transcriptomes of fish have already identified previously unnoticed expression signatures and provided astonishing insights into the diversity of teleost leukocytes and the evolution of vertebrate immunity. Without a doubt, scRNA-seq in tandem with bioinformatics tools and state-of-the-art methods, will facilitate studying the teleost immune system by not only defining key markers, but also teaching us about lymphoid tissue organization, development/differentiation, cell-cell interactions, antigen receptor repertoires, states of health and disease, all across time and space in fishes. These advances will invite more researchers to develop the tools necessary to explore the immunology of fishes, which remain non-conventional animal models from which we have much to learn.","output":"RNA-Seq of Single Fish Cells C Seeking Out the Leukocytes Mediating Immunity in Teleost Fishes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 578 randomly selected health care workers (HCW) from Hospital Clinic de Barcelona was 11.2%. Methods. A follow-up survey one month after the baseline (April-May 2020) measured SARS-CoV-2 infection by real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and IgM, IgA, IgG and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by Luminex. Prevalence of infection was defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and/or antibody seropositivity. Results. The cumulative prevalence of infection at month 1 was 14.9% (84/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82/565) for IgM and/or IgG and/or IgA. We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection at baseline (501) and two participants seroreverted for IgM and/or IgG and/or IgA. Among seropositive participants at baseline, IgM and IgA levels generally declined at month 1 (antibody decay rates of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.40-0.60) and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.26-0.44)), respectively. Eight percent of the participants seroreverted for IgM and 11% for IgA. Subjects reporting COVID-19-like symptoms and laboratory and other technicians had higher risk of infection. The most frequent subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG2, followed by IgG3, with higher levels of IgG1, and only IgA1 but no IgA2 was detected. Conclusions. Our findings highlight the importance of a continuous and improved surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCW, particularly in high risk groups.

Besides being reactive, aggression can be goal-directed (proactive aggression). Our study presents a novel paradigm to investigate proactive aggression during competitive interactions. Sixty-seven healthy participants competed in two modified versions of the TAP against an ostensible opponent while skin conductance responses (SCRs) were recorded. During the proactive TAP (pTAP), only the participant could interfere with the ostensible opponent's performance by blurring the screen. In the reactive TAP (rTAP), the opponent repeatedly provoked the participant by blurring the screen of the participant, impeding their chance to win. In both versions, the blurriness levels chosen by the participant served as a measure of aggression (unprovoked in the pTAP and provoked in the rTAP). In the pTAP, trial-by-trial mixed model analyses revealed higher aggression with higher self-reported selfishness. SCRs decreased with increasing proactive aggression. An interaction effect between gender and proactive aggression for the SCRs revealed increased SCRs at higher aggression levels in females, but lower SCRs at higher aggression levels in males. In the rTAP, SCRs were not associated with reactive aggression but aggression increased with increasing provocation and especially after losing against the opponent when provoked. While males showed higher aggression levels than females when unprovoked, reactive aggression increased more strongly in females with higher provocation. Mean levels of aggression in both tasks showed a high positive correlation. Our results highlight that, despite being intercorrelated and both motivated by selfishness, proactive and reactive aggression are differentially influenced by gender and physiological arousal. Proactive aggression is related to lower physiological arousal, especially in males, with females showing the opposite association. Reactive aggressive behavior is a result of individual responses to provocation, to which females seem to be more sensitive.","output":"Proactive vs. Reactive Aggression Within Two Modified Versions of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO) is defined as \\"untouchable\\" by all specialists; no treatment is indicated because intervention risks (carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or endovascular treatment) are usually much more than benefits.(1,2) We report the case of a patient admitted to our hospital with an atherothrombotic ischemic stroke due to symptomatic acute ICAO, who developed a recurrent stroke with hemispheric hypoperfusion and was treated in the emergency department with ICAO revascularization after 60 days of occlusion finding. CASE DESCRIPTION D.G., a 62-year-old man, came to our attention for a transient episode of left weakness and hypoesthesia. The electrocardiogram revealed a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. CT angiography showed right ICAO; computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies with perfusion imaging revealed a severe hemispheric hypoperfusion. Full anticoagulation therapy was started, and antihypertensive therapy was reduced to help collateral circulation. Some weeks later, the patient was readmitted to the stroke unit for 2 episodes of left-hand weakness. Cerebral angiography confirmed right ICAO from the proximal tract to the siphon. After some days, the patient suffered a femoral hemorrhagic lesion, with active bleeding, and was treated with surgical intervention. On the following day, the patient presented with left hemiplegia with hemianesthesia (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score = 14). The patient was treated in the emergency department with a complex endovascular treatment with complete recanalization of ICAO by positioning 3 stents through the intravenous infusion of abciximab.

During the pandemic, patients with sports injuries were younger (median age 11 versus 13 years, P < 0.001) and had less delay in presentation (median 5 versus 11 days, P < 0.001). A higher proportion were White (66.9% versus 47.7%, P < 0.001), privately insured (63.4% versus 48.3%, P < 0.001), and seen at a nonurban location (63.4% versus 50.2%, P < 0.001). Most sports injuries during the pandemic were fractures (83.7%). Although 71.4% of all injuries in the prepandemic period occurred in the context of formal sports, only 15.2% were sustained in a formal athletic context in 2020 (P < 0.001). The frequency of surgical treatment was higher during the pandemic (14.8% versus 7.8%, P = 0.001), mainly because most of these injuries were fractures requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer sports injuries were seen in the outpatient setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of these injuries were fractures and occurred outside of organized sports settings. Patients were more likely to be White, privately insured, and seen at a nonurban location.","output":"Timeout?

Here, we tested whether a specific psychological belief-identification with all humanity-predicts cooperation with public health guidelines as well as helpful behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that peoples' endorsement of this belief-their relative perception of a connection and moral commitment to other humans-would predict their tendencies to adopt World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and to help others. To assess this, we conducted a global online study (N = 2537 participants) of four WHO-recommended health behaviors and four pandemic-related moral dilemmas that we constructed to be relevant to helping others at a potential cost to oneself. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) that included 10 predictor variables (demographic, contextual, and psychological) for each of five outcome measures (a WHO cooperative health behavior score, plus responses to each of our four moral, helping dilemmas). Identification with all humanity was the most consistent and consequential predictor of individuals' cooperative health behavior and helpful responding. Analyses showed that the identification with all humanity significantly predicted each of the five outcomes while controlling for the other variables (Prange < 10-22 to < 0.009). The mean effect size of the identification with all humanity predictor on these outcomes was more than twice as large as the effect sizes of other predictors. Identification with all humanity is a psychological construct that, through targeted interventions, may help scientists and policymakers to better understand and promote cooperative health behavior and help-oriented concern for others during the current pandemic as well as in future humanitarian crises.","output":"Identifying with all humanity predicts cooperative health behaviors and helpful responding during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyberchondria (CYB) is characterized by excessive online searching for medical information and is associated with increasing levels of distress, anxiety and interference with daily activities. As the use of digital devices and the Internet as a source of everyday information has increased, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic, so has CYB, becoming an object of interest to clinicians and researchers. The present review will provide an overview of the latest updates in CYB research. Emerging evidence draws attention to various vulnerability factors for developing CYB, including personal characteristics such as female gender, younger age, or a history of mental disorder, as well as engagement in particular forms of online behaviour such as increased use of social media, increased acceptance of online information, information overload. Additionally, recent studies suggest CYB may itself act as a mediating factor for increased COVID-19-related psychological burden. However, the data is still very sparse. Knowledge gaps include a universally accepted definition of CYB, severity thresholds to help differentiate non-pathological online health searches from CYB, as well as robustly evidence-based interventions.","output":"New challenges in facing Cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our paper examines the key determinants of COVID-19 vaccination coverage in India and presents an analytical framework to probe whether vaccine hesitancy, socioeconomic factors and multi-dimensional deprivations (MPI) play a role in determining COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Our exploratory analysis reveals that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has a negative and statistically significant impact on COVID-19 vaccination coverage. A percentage increase in vaccine hesitancy can lead to a decline in vaccination coverage by 30 percent. Similarly, an increase in the proportion of people living in multi-dimensional poverty reduces the COVID-19 vaccination coverage. A unit increase in MPI or proportion of people living in acute poverty leads to a mean decline in vaccination coverage by 50 percent. It implies that an increase in socioeconomic deprivation negatively impacts health outcomes, including vaccination coverage. We additionally demonstrated that gender plays a significant role in determining how access to digital technologies such as the internet impacts vaccine coverage and hesitancy. We found that, as males access to the internet increases, vaccination coverage also increases. This may be attributed to Indias reliance on digital tools (COWIN, AAROGYA SETU, Imphal, India) to allocate and register for COVID-19 vaccines and the associated digital divide (males have greater digital excess than females). Conversely, females access to the internet is statistically significant and inversely associated with coverage. This can be attributed to higher vaccine hesitancy among the female population and lower utilization of health services by females.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Vaccination Coverage in India: An Exploratory Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Antimicrobial resistance is currently considered the main risk to global health.

METHODS All types of designs and will be restricted to Latin American studies will be included in this systematic review. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, BVS (LILACS, BBO - bvsalud.org), IBECS (bases.bireme.br), Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases will be searched from 2013 to December 31, 2018 for all types of study designs that report microbial infection in endodontics and periodontics and their resistance and that define the microbiological methods used to identify microorganisms. The selection of articles for inclusion will be performed by 2 reviewers using predefined eligibility criteria. The Cochrane and ROBINS-I risk of bias assessment tools will be used to assess the methodological quality of randomized control trials. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale will be used to assess the quality of methodology in observational studies. The overall quality of evidence will be assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) using the same principles and domains applied in the quality assessment of prognostic studies. The heterogeneity of the findings will be assessed using both the  test and the I statistic. Sensitivity analysis will be performed by subgroup analyses and meta-regression to investigate the effect of study-level characteristics, such as age, gender, and methodological quality score, whenever possible. Publication bias across studies will be evaluated by visual inspection of the funnel plots and Begg's test for the results covered in 10 or more studies.

The Italian healthcare system is experiencing a stressful burden, especially in terms of intensive care assistance. In fact, the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 patients is represented by an acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, that in many cases, results in an acute respiratory distress syndrome and requires an invasive ventilator support. A precocious respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen should be avoided to limit the droplets air-dispersion and the healthcare workers contamination. The application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by means of a helmet can represent an effective alternative to recruit diseased alveolar units and improve hypoxemia. It can also limit the room contamination, improve comfort for the patients, and allow for better clinical assistance with long-term tolerability. However, the initiation of a CPAP is not free from pitfalls. It requires a careful titration and monitoring to avoid a delayed intubation. Here, we discuss the rationale and some important considerations about timing, criteria, and monitoring requirements for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring a CPAP treatment.","output":"Helmet CPAP to Treat Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure in Patients with COVID-19: A Management Strategy Proposal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the relationship between psychiatric comorbidity (anxiety and depression), somnolence, and quality of life, using validated scales in patients with epilepsy in real-life clinical practice and clinical and demographic variables. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted. Self-administered scales of anxiety disorders (GAD-7), depression (NDDI-E), somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)), and quality of life (QOLIE-31-P) in patients with epilepsy treated in the refractory epilepsy unit of a tertiary hospital were employed. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients, 44.3  17.4 years, 48.2% women, epilepsy duration 21.5  15.9 years, and number of antiepileptic drugs 1.9  1.2 were included. Severe anxiety was present in 14.3%, depression in 20.2%, and somnolence in 14.3% of patients. QOLIE-31-P score was 62.0  19.2. Depression and focal epilepsy (OR = 4.5[1.3, 20.7], p = 0.029), as well as anxiety and temporal lobe epilepsy (OR = 4.3 [1.0, 18.1], p = 0.044), were associated. Moreover, relationships between worse quality of life and higher scores from NDDI-E ( = ? 1.42, adjusted p = 0.006) and GAD-7 ( = ? 1.21, adjusted p = 0.006), especially in drug-resistant epilepsy ( = ? 8.08, adjusted p = 0.045) and female sex ( = ? 7.83, adjusted p = 0.034), were identified.

In this review, we applied data-driven approaches to evaluate the ability of each assay to identify potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 leads. Multitarget assays were found to show advantages in terms of accuracy and efficiency over single-target assays, whereas target-specific assays were more suitable for investigating compound mechanisms of action. Moreover, strict filtering with counter screens might be more detrimental than beneficial in identifying true positives.

Medical images such as chest X-rays and Computed Tomography scans are becoming one of the main leading clinical diagnosis tools in fighting against COVID-19, underpinned by Artificial Intelligence based techniques, resulting in rapid decision-making in saving lives. This article provides an extensive review of AI-based methods to assist medical practitioners with comprehensive knowledge of the efficient AI-based methods for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. Nearly all the reported methods so far along with their pros and cons as well as recommendations for improvements are discussed, including image acquisition, segmentation, classification, and follow-up diagnosis phases developed between 2019 and 2020.

METHODS: An analysis of Canadian respondents from the international EndoTrain survey, open from April 11 to May 2 2020 and distributed by program directors, trainees, and national and international gastroenterology societies representatives, was completed. The survey included questions on monthly endoscopy volume, personal protective equipment availability, trainee well-being and educational resources. The primary outcome was change in procedural volume during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary outcomes included trainees professional and personal concerns, anxiety and burnout. RESULTS: Thirty-four Canadian trainees completed the survey. Per month, participants completed a median of 30 esophagogastroduodenoscopies (interquartile range 16 to 50) prior to the pandemic compared to 2 (0 to 10) during the pandemic, 20 (8 to 30) compared to 2 (0 to 5) colonoscopies and 3 (1 to 10) compared to 0 (0 to 3) upper gastrointestinal bleeding procedures. There was a significant decrease in procedural volumes between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 time periods for all procedures (P < 0.001). Thirty (88%) trainees were concerned about personal COVID-19 exposure, 32 (94%) were concerned about achieving and/or maintaining clinical competence and 24 (71%) were concerned about prolongation of training time due to the pandemic.

This study aimed to explore the online oral health information seeking experience, to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of oral health, and to investigate the associations between online oral health information seeking experience and oral health KAP of participants. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. Three hundred and ninety-five university students participated in the study. Required data were gathered using two valid questionnaires eHIQ (e-Health Information Questionnaire) and Oral Health Knowledge, Attitude and Behavior Questionnaire. eHIQ was a 2-part instrument with 37 items. eHIQ-Part 1 includes 11 items related to general views of using the internet in relation to health. eHIQ-Part 2 includes 26 items related to the consequences of using specific health-related online sources. The second questionnaire includes 30 items as a combination of multiple-choice and yes/no type questions. The data were analyzed using the statistical analysis software SPSS version 20. Mean scores, standard deviation, and frequency distribution were obtained. Independent T-test, correlation coefficients and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Participants had good KAP of oral health. The between-group differences tests showed that oral health knowledge and attitudes were significantly different between gender and years of study groups, but the differences of oral health practices were significant only based on years of study.

While vaccination rates and side effects are well established in the general population, these are largely unknown in patients with brain tumours. The purpose of this study was to determine if brain tumour patients and their caregivers have received a COVID-19 vaccine, and explore their thoughts and opinions on these vaccines. METHODS: An anonymous 31-question online survey available in eight languages was conducted from June 30, 2021 to August 31, 2021. The survey was open to adult brain tumour patients over the age of 18 and included both categorical and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics and modified thematic analyses were performed for all questions as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 965 unique surveys were completed from 42 countries. The vast majority of both brain tumour patients and their caregivers have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (84.5% and 89.9%, respectively). No patient reported serious adverse events from any vaccine. Less than 10% of patients decided against receiving a vaccination against COVID-19, with the most common reason being concerns over the safety of the vaccine. Patients wanted more specific information on how COVID-19 vaccines might impact their future brain tumour treatment.

We performed a systematic review to determine how often published studies of VL report on video screen visualization. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus for interventional and observational studies in which a video laryngoscope equipped with a standard geometry blade was used for tracheal intubation. We excluded simulation based studies. Our primary outcome was data on video laryngoscope screen visualization. Secondary outcomes were explicit methodology for screen visualization. RESULTS: We screened 4838 unique studies and included 207 (120 interventional and 87 observational). Only 21 studies (10% of 207) included any data on video screen visualization by the proceduralist, 19 in a yes/no fashion only (ie, screened viewed or not) and 2 with detail beyond whether the screen was viewed or not. In 11 more studies, visualization patterns could be inferred based on screen availability and in 16 more studies, the methods section stated how screen visualization was expected to be performed without reporting data collection on how the proceduralist interacted with the video screen. Risk of bias was high in the majority of included studies. CONCLUSIONS: Published studies of VL, including many clinical trials, rarely include data on video screen visualization. Given the nuances of using a video laryngoscope, this is a critical deficiency, which largely prevents us from knowing the treatment effect of using a video laryngoscope in clinical practice.

Vitamin D deficiency has been postulated as a determinant of severity. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence relevant to vitamin D and COVID-19. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Regression modelling shows that more northerly countries in the Northern Hemisphere are currently (May 2020) showing relatively high COVID-19 mortality, with an estimated 4.4% increase in mortality for each 1 degree latitude north of 28 degrees North (P = 0.031) after adjustment for age of population. This supports a role for ultraviolet B acting via vitamin D synthesis. Factors associated with worse COVID-19 prognosis include old age, ethnicity, male sex, obesity, diabetes and hypertension and these also associate with deficiency of vitamin D or its response. Vitamin D deficiency is also linked to severity of childhood respiratory illness. Experimentally, vitamin D increases the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to ACE, thus increasing angiotensin II hydrolysis and reducing subsequent inflammatory cytokine response to pathogens and lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial evidence supports a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity but it is all indirect. Community-based placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation may be difficult. Further evidence could come from study of COVID-19 outcomes in large cohorts with information on prescribing data for vitamin D supplementation or assay of serum unbound 25(OH) vitamin D levels.

Patients with kidney failure, who often use ACEi/ARB, are at higher risk of more severe COVID-19. However, there are no data available on the association of ACEi/ARB use with COVID-19 severity in this population. Methods: Data were retrieved from the ERACODA database of kidney transplant and dialysis patients affected by COVID-19, between February 1 and October 1 2020, and had information on 28-day mortality. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the relation between ACEi/ARB use and 28-day mortality risk. Additionally, we studied the association of ACEi/ARB discontinuation with 28-day mortality. Results: We evaluated 1,511 patients, 459 kidney transplant recipients and 1,052 dialysis patients. At COVID-19 diagnosis, 189 (41%) of the transplant and 288 (27%) of the dialysis patients were on ACEi/ARB. In transplant, 88 (19%) and in dialysis patients 244 (23%) died within 28 days of initial presentation. In transplant and dialysis patients, there was no association between ACEi/ARB use and 28-day mortality in both crude and adjusted models (adjusted HR=1.12, 95%CI: 0.69-1.83 in transplant; 1.04, 95%CI: 0.73-1.47 in dialysis patients). Among transplant recipients, ACEi/ARB discontinuation was associated with higher mortality risk after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, but the association was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for COVID-19 severity (adjusted HR=1.36, 95%CI: 0.40-4.58). Among dialysis patients, ACEi/ARB discontinuation was not associated with mortality in any model. Similar results were obtained across subgroups when ACEi and ARB were studied separately and when other outcomes for COVID-19 severity were studied e.g., hospital admission, intensive care unit admission or need for ventilator support.

Aim of the study is to highlight the vulnerability of the aged amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic, and in the light of the recent international evidence, suggests what government could do to mitigate their vulnerability. METHODS: Data from the recently released (November 2019) 75th Round National Sample Survey (NSS), which was conducted from July 2017 to June 2018, across 8077 rural villages and 6181 urban wards was used for this study. Data collected from 555,115 individuals (rural: 325,232; urban: 229,232) included 42,762 elderly individuals (60 years or above). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used for the calculation. RESULTS: Of the total sample of elderly individuals, 27.7% reported suffering from an ailment in the last 15 days, whereas 8.5% had been hospitalized during the last 365 days. Among the elderly, hospitalization rate was higher in the urban areas (OR: 1.23), general social category (OR: 1.18), richest economic quintile (OR: 1.69), and among those living alone (OR: 2.40). Also, among the elderly, 64% of those in the scheduled tribe (social group) and 51% in the poorest economic quintile utilized public facilities for hospitalization. Cardiovascular ailments were the major cause for hospitalization (18.1%) and outpatient visit (32%) among the elderly. Ailments related to diabetes and hypertension constituted 55% of outpatient visit for the elderly. Only 18.9% of the elderly had health insurance though chances of facing catastrophic health expenditures were high among the elderly. 6.6% of elderly female and 1.6% male live alone, and 27.5% of age 80 years and above are immobile. 50% of male and 90% of female are financially dependent on others and more so in poorer economic quintiles. CONCLUSIONS: The vulnerability of India's elderly increases across economic levels, and other dimensions such as the place of residence, gender, social group (caste), marital status, living arrangements, surviving children, and economic dependence. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a greater risk of social isolation among the elderly, which may cause detrimental health impact.

Citizens aged 18 years and above were recruited by means of the snowball sampling method. ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and linear regression tests were used. RESULTS: Of the 2168 respondents, most were young adults (62.7%), females (62.4%), tertiary educated individuals (84%), non-health care workers (85.9%), and individuals who knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19 (75.2%). The mean score for knowledge was 10.0  1.52 (maximum score = 12); correct response rate for each question ranged from 54.2% to 99%. The mean score in terms of attitude was 1.3  0.85 (maximum score = 2); 68.7% respondents agreed that control over COVID-19 would finally be achieved; and 62.3% believed that Malaysia could conquer COVID-19.

The highest expression of ACE2 is found in the testes, whereas the prostate displays the highest expression of TMPRSS2. Given the increased severity of disease among older men with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we address the potential roles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in their contribution to the sex differences in severity of disease. We show that expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are overall comparable between men and women in multiple tissues, suggesting that differences in the expression levels of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in the lung and other non-sex-specific tissues may not explain the gender disparities in severity of SARS CoV-2.

Single-cell ICP-MS (SC-ICP-MS) is an emerging technology that allows for the rapid characterization and quantification of a metal analyte across a cell population in a single analysis. In this study, a new rapid and sensitive SC-ICP-MS method was developed to quantitatively study the interactions of AgNPs with yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method can quantify the cell concentration, silver concentration per cell, and profile the nanoparticle distribution in a yeast cell population. AgNP dosing time, concentration, and AgNP size were quantitatively evaluated for their effects on AgNP-yeast cell interactions. The results showed that the initial uptake of AgNPs was rapid and primarily driven by the mass of Ag per cell. The optimal dosing particle concentrations for highest uptake were approximately 1820, 1000, and 300 AgNPs/cell for 10, 20, and 40 nm AgNPs, respectively. Furthermore, this study also validated a washing method for the application to a microorganism for the first time and was used to quantitatively determine the amount of cell surfaceCadsorbed AgNPs and intracellular AgNPs. These results indicated that the mass (Ag in ag/cell) ratios of intracelluar vs cell surface-adsorbed AgNPs were similar for different AgNP sizes.

SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) can result in myocarditis. Protocols were developed to allow competitive athletes to safely return to play (RTP) following a COVID-19 infection, but the financial impact of these protocols is unknown. Our objective was to determine the differential cost of post-COVID-19 RTP protocols for competitive collegiate athletes. METHODS This multicenter retrospective cohort study of clinical evaluation of 295 athletes after COVID-19 infection was performed at 4 institutions with 3 RTP protocols. Costs were calculated using adjusted Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pricing. All athletes underwent electrocardiogram and clinical evaluation. A tiered approach performed cardiac imaging and biomarker analysis for major symptoms. A universal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) approach performed TTE and biomarkers for all athletes. A universal exercise stress echocardiogram (ESE) approach performed ESE and biomarkers for all athletes. RESULTS The cost per athlete was $632.51  651.80 ($44,908 total) in tiered group (n = 71), $1,072.30  517.93 ($87,928 total) in the universal TTE group (n = 82), and $1,357.38  757.05 ($192,748 total) in the universal ESE group (n = 142)(p < 0.001).

However, whether LLLT can couple angiogenesis and osteogenesis, and the underlying mechanisms during bone formation, remains largely unknown. METHODS: Mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) combined with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) grafts were implanted into C57BL/6 mice to evaluate the effects of LLLT on the specialized vessel subtypes and bone regeneration in vivo. Furthermore, human BMSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were co-cultured in vitro. The effects of LLLT on cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis were assessed. RESULTS: LLLT promoted the formation of blood vessels, collagen fibers, and bone tissue and also increased CD31(hi)EMCN(hi)-expressing type H vessels in mBMSC/BCP grafts implanted in mice. LLLT significantly increased both osteogenesis and angiogenesis, as well as related gene expression (HIF-1, VEGF, TGF-) of grafts in vivo and of co-cultured BMSCs/HUVECs in vitro. An increase or decrease of ROS induced by H(2)O(2) or Vitamin C, respectively, resulted in an increase or decrease of HIF-1, and a subsequent increase and decrease of VEGF and TGF- in the co-culture system. The ROS accumulation induced by LLLT in the co-culture system was significantly decreased when HIF-1 was inhibited with DMBPA and was followed by decreased expression of VEGF and TGF-. CONCLUSIONS: LLLT enhanced vascularized bone regeneration by coupling angiogenesis and osteogenesis. ROS/HIF-1 was necessary for these effects of LLLT. LLLT triggered a ROS-dependent increase of HIF-1, VEGF, and TGF- and resulted in subsequent formation of type H vessels and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. As ROS also was a target of HIF-1, there may be a positive feedback loop between ROS and HIF-1, which further amplified HIF-1 induction via the LLLT-mediated ROS increase. This study provided new insight into the effects of LLLT on vascularization and bone regeneration in bone tissue engineering.

We reviewed 3999 CTO PCIs performed in 3914 patients between 2012 and 2018 at 25 centers, 14% of whom had a history of PAD. We compared the clinical and angiographic characteristics and procedural outcomes of patients with versus without history of PAD. Patients with PAD were older (67  9 vs 64  10 years, P < .001) and had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. They also had more complex lesions as illustrated by higher Japanese CTO score (2.7  1.2 vs 2.4  1.3, P < .001). In patients with PAD, the final crossing technique was less often antegrade wire escalation (40% vs 51%, P < .001) and more often the retrograde approach (23 vs 20%, P < .001) and antegrade dissection/reentry (20% vs 16%, P < .001). Technical success was similar between the 2 study groups (84% vs 87%, P = .127), but procedural success was lower for patients with PAD (81% vs 85%, P = .015). The incidence of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events was higher among patients with PAD (3% vs 2%, P = .046).

There have been many general studies about the spread of the virus. In this study, new and accumulated confirmed cases (NCC and ACC), new and accumulated recovered cases (NRC and ARC), and new and accumulated deaths (ND and AD) were evaluated by geographical properties, meteorological parameters and air particulate matters between 3 April 2020 and 11 June 2020 within 15 provinces in Iran. Meteorological parameters, air particulate matters and COVID-19 data were collected from Iran Meteorological Organization, the Environmental Protection Agency and Aftabnews website, respectively. The results of the study show that provinces in dry lands (i.e., Kerman and South Khorasan) not only had low admission of NCC, ACC, ARC and AD but also presented lower rates of NCC, ACC and AD per 105 population. Air temperature showed positive and significant correlation with the number of COVID-19 cases. This is because of hot outdoor air especially in costal and equatorial regions that forces people to stay in closed environments with no ventilation and with closed-cycle air conditioners. Maximum air pressure was found to be the most frequent (66%) and significant parameter correlating with health outcomes associated with COVID-19. The most engaged province in this study was Khuzestan, while provinces in dry lands (i.e., Kerman and South Khorasan) showed low number of health endpoints associated with COVID-19. The highest rate of accumulated and new recovered cases per 105 population were also found in Khuzestan and Kerman provinces. North Khorasan also showed the worst rate of N&ARC/105 population.

The effects of SAH orders on the trauma population remains unknown. We hypothesized an increase in rates of penetrating trauma, gunshot wounds, suicide attempts, and domestic violence in the Southern California trauma population after the SAH order. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective analysis of all trauma patients presenting to 11 American College of Surgeons (ACS) Level I and II trauma centers spanning seven counties in California was performed. Demographic data, injury characteristics, clinical data, and outcomes were collected. Patients were divided into three groups based on injury date: before SAH from 1/1/2020-3/18/2020 (PRE), after SAH from 3/19/2020-6/30/2020 (POST), and a historical control from 3/19/2019-6/30/2019 (CONTROL). POST was compared to both PRE and CONTROL in two separate analyses. RESULTS: Across all time periods, 20,448 trauma patients were identified (CONTROL: 7,707, PRE: 6,022, POST: 6,719). POST had a significantly increased rate of penetrating trauma (13.0% vs. 10.3%, p<0.001 and 13.0% vs. 9.9%, p<0.001) and gunshot wounds (4.5% vs. 2.4%, p=0.002 and 4.5% vs. 3.7%, p=0.025) compared to PRE and CONTROL, respectively.

Pooled incidences of incidental and truly incidental GBC (GBC detected during histopathological examination without preoperative or intraoperative suspicion) were estimated using a random-effects model. The clinical consequences of truly incidental GBC were assessed. RESULTS Seventy-three studies (232 155 patients) were included. In low-incidence countries, the pooled incidence was 032 (95 per cent c.i. 025 to 042) per cent for incidental GBC and 018 (010 to 035) per cent for truly incidental GBC. Subgroup analysis of studies in which surgeons systematically examined the gallbladder revealed a pooled incidence of 004 (001 to 014) per cent.

Considerable attention has been paid to the burden COVID-19 has put on acute care hospitals, with numerous models projecting hospitalizations and ICU needs for the duration of the pandemic. However, less attention has been paid to where these patients may go if they require additional care following hospital discharge. As COVID-19 patients recover from severe infections, many of them require additional care. Yet with post-acute care facilities averaging 85% capacity prior to the pandemic and the significant potential for outbreaks, consideration of the downstream effects of the surge of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is critical. Here, we present a method for projecting COVID-19 post-acute care needs. Our model is designed to take the output from any of the numerous epidemiological models (hospital discharges) and estimate the flow of patients to post-acute care services, thus providing a similar surge planning model for post-acute care services. Using data from the University of Utah Hospital, we find that for those who require specialized post-acute care, the majority require either home health care or skilled nursing facilities. Likewise, we find the expected peak in post-acute care occurs about two weeks after the expected peak for acute care hospitalizations, a result of the duration of hospitalization. This short delay between acute care and post-acute care surges highlights the importance of considering the organization necessary to accommodate the influx of recovering COVID patients and protect non-COVID patients prior to the peak in acute care hospitalizations. We developed this model to guide policymakers in addressing the \\"aftershocks\\" of discharged patients requiring further supportive care; while we only show the outcomes for discharges based on preliminary data from the University of Utah Hospital, we suggest alternative uses for our model including adapting it to explore potential alternative strategies for addressing the surge in acute care facilities during future pandemic waves.","output":"Planning for the aftershocks: a model of post-acute care needs for hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant impact on the whole world.

For that purpose, sequences are preprocessed by feature extraction and the resulting feature vectors are analyzed by prototype-based classification to remain interpretable. In particular, we propose to use variants of learning vector quantization (LVQ) based on dissimilarity measures for RNA sequence data. The respective matrix LVQ provides additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations and, additionally, can be equipped with easy to realize reject options for uncertain data. Those options provide self-controlled evidence, i.e., the model refuses to make a classification decision if the model evidence for the presented data is not sufficient. This model is first trained using a GISAID dataset with given virus types detected according to the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic tree clustering. In a second step, we apply the trained model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus dataset. For these data, we can either assign a virus type to the sequences or reject atypical samples. Those rejected sequences allow to speculate about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences. Moreover, this rejection analysis improves model robustness.

The virus is composed of the spike, membrane and envelope. On physiological smell, odoriferous substances bind to proteins secreted by sustentacular cells in order to be processed by olfactory receptor neurons. Olfactory disorder is one of the main manifestations of COVID-19, however, research is still required to clarify the mechanism involved in SARS-CoV-2 induced anosmia. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to analyze current scientific evidence intended to elucidate the pathophysiological relationship between COVID-19 and the cause of olfactory disorders. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and ScienceDirect were used to compose this article. The research was conducted on November 24th, 2020. Original articles with experimental studies in human, animal and in vitro, short communications, viewpoint, published in the English language and between 2019 and 2020 were included, all related to the pathophysiological relationship between olfactory disorders and COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Both human cell receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are essential for the SARS-CoV-2 entrance. These receptors are mostly present in the olfactory epithelium cells, therefore, the main hypothesis is that anosmia is caused due to damage to non-neuronal cells which, thereafter, affects the normal olfactory metabolism. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging studies exhibit a relationship between a reduction on the neuronal epithelium and the olfactory bulb atrophy. Damage to non-neuronal cells explains the average recovery lasting a few weeks. This injury can be exacerbated by an aggressive immune response, which leads to damage to neuronal cells and stem cells inducing a persistent anosmia. Conductive anosmia is not sufficient to explain most cases of COVID-19 induced anosmia. CONCLUSION: Olfactory disorders such as anosmia and hyposmia can be caused by COVID-19, the main mechanism is associated with olfactory epithelium damage, targeting predominantly non-neuronal cells. However, neuronal cells can also be affected, worsening the condition of olfactory loss.","output":"Pathophysiological relationship between COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we analyse the effectiveness of demand- and supply-side fiscal policies in the small open economy of Slovenia. Simulating the SLOPOL10 model, an econometric model of the Slovenian economy, we analyse the effectiveness of various categories of public spending and taxes during the period 2020 to 2030, assuming that no crisis occurs. Our simulations show that those public spending measures that entail both demand- and supply-side effects are more effective at stimulating real GDP and increasing employment than pure demand-side measures. This is due to the fact that supply-side measures also increase potential and not only actual GDP. Measures which foster research and development and those which improve the education level of the labour force are particularly effective in this respect. Employment can also be stimulated effectively by cutting the income tax rate and the social security contribution rate, i.e. by reducing the tax wedge on labour income, which positively affects Slovenias international competitiveness. Successful stabilisation policies should thus contain a supply-side component in addition to a demand-side component. We also provide a first simulation of potential effects of the Covid-19 crisis on the Slovenian economy, which is modelled as a combined demand and supply shock.","output":"Demand-side or supply-side stabilisation policies in a small euro area economy: a case study for Slovenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Microvascular angina is a common cause of ischemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) and limited therapeutic options are available to those affected.

This is concerning and highlights the importance of finding innovative ways to help people to be physically active each day. Snacktivity? is a novel approach that aims to encourage people to do small, 2C5 min bouts of physical activity snacks throughout the whole day, such that they achieve at least 150 min of moderate intensity activity per week. However, before it can be recommended, there is a need to explore whether the concept is acceptable to the public. METHODS: A survey to assess the views of the public about Snacktivity? was distributed to adult patients registered at six general practices in the West Midlands, UK and to health care employees in the same region. RESULTS: A total of 5989 surveys were sent to patients, of which 558 were returned (9.3%). A further 166 surveys were completed by health care employees. A total of 85% of respondents liked the Snacktivity? concept. The flexibility of the approach was highly rated. A high proportion of participants (61%) reported that the ability to self-monitor their behaviour would help them to do Snacktivity? throughout their day. Physically inactive participants perceived that Snacktivity? would help to increase their physical activity, more than those who were physically active (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25C0.67). Approximately 90% of respondents perceived that Snacktivity? was easy to do on a non-working day compared to 60% on a working day. Aerobic activity snacks were preferred to those which were strength based. CONCLUSIONS: The Snacktivity? approach to promoting physical activity was viewed positively by the public and interventions to test the merits of such an approach now need to be developed and tested in a variety of everyday contexts.

Its impact on medical students education has also been profound. Here, we aimed to comprehensively determine the nature of this impact on their choice of specialty. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic from May to June 2021. Data collected from 1984 medical students were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the total sample, 810 (40.8%) respondents reported that the pandemic could affect their choice of specialty, with the majority being in the third year (n = 235). Across all class-years, the most common reason chosen was the inability to explore specialties of interest (n = 539, 66.5%). Another reason cited was the inability to support residency application (n = 175, 21.6%). A majority expressed concerns regarding enrollment in research activities. As high as 17.9% (n = 356) of the respondents admitted that they were trying to avoid specialty with frontline exposure to COVID-19, while 353 students (17.8%) were considering local training programs only. While examining certainty levels, of the 1174 (59.2%) students who reported not being affected by the pandemic, 924 (78.7%) had a weak certainty level. The majority were in the third (54.8%, n = 342) and fourth years (44.8%, n = 212). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first attempt to thoroughly examine the effect of COVID-19 on medical students choice of specialty. This effect unfurled in 4 out of 10 surveyed students. Many students reported concerns regarding the inability to explore medical specialties and the inadequacy of obtained clinical knowledge. However, a subsidiary effect was observed among students who were assertive about their choice of specialty. These findings shed new light on the exigency of establishing a career counseling framework designed to meet individual learner needs, thereby galvanizing their morale.

We therefore investigated their perceived usefulness, adherence and their predictors in representative online samples in eight countries (France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K., U.S.). Of the 7,658 participants, 77.4% rated governmental measures (highest: Germany, lowest: France) as useful and 91.7% reported adherence to them. Adherence was lowest in Russia and Poland, where people felt particularly left alone and not well supported, and in the U.S. and Sweden, where governments showed ambivalent attitudes towards the measures. The highest adherence was reported in countries with very high mortality (U.K., Spain, France) or very positively perceived government communication (Germany). Female gender, higher age, belonging to a risk group, being affected physically and mentally, perception of governmental communication as guided by the interests of people, feeling of being well informed and the level of positive mental health positively predicted both outcomes, while being affected economically negatively predicted both outcomes. Country-specific results are considered in the light of the protection motivation theory and the theory of planned behavior together with potential ways to improve active participation of the population. Overall, we recommend the governments and authorities to stress that each individual can contribute to the control of the COVID-19 situation by adherence to the measures in the public communication. Moreover, they should emphasize the risk of unconscious infection of older individuals by younger people, as well as the importance of physical activity for the protection of mental and physical health especially during the pandemic.","output":"Behavioral measures to fight COVID-19: An 8-country study of perceived usefulness, adherence and their predictors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While locomotive organ impairment among older people is attracting worldwide attention, this issue has not yet been widely investigated in Thailand.

The outcomes of treatment with methylprednisolone were estimated using inverse probability of treatment weights, based on a propensity score comprised of clinical and laboratory variables. Patients were followed up for 28 days. Data were analyzed from December 19, 2020, to July 22, 2021. EXPOSURES: Systemic methylprednisolone administered per the discretion of the treating physician. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcome was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation at 28 days.

However, in pre-clinical studies relying on disease models other than mice and primates, e.g., those underrepresented species for infectious diseases, it is less clear whether such afucosylated antibodies can demonstrate enhanced therapeutic index. This is because the orthologues of human FcRIIIA or mouse FcRIV from those species have not been well characterized. METHODS: We set up a luciferase-based ADCC assay with Jurkat reporter cells expressing FcRIIIA/FcRIV from human, mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig, ferret, rabbit, cat, dog, pig and monkey, and also produced human, mouse, hamster, rabbit and pig IgG from wild type and Fut8(?/?)

DESIGN We designed 4 focus groups to gather organizational perspectives on public health emergency response leadership development. Discussions were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed to synthesize key themes. SETTING Focus groups were convened at the 2019 Preparedness Summit (March 27-28) in St Louis, Missouri. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-three public health professionals from 9 Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Cooperative Agreement award recipient jurisdictions and 12 local health departments participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We examined the current availability, relevance, specificity, and utility of educational content and delivery modalities. Facilitators and barriers were identified as opportunities to improve training access. RESULTS Generic emergency management training is considered important and widely available but with limited application in public health practice. Existing leadership training opportunities in public health emergency response are limited and not widely known. While organizational support and accessible training facilitate participation, resource constraints (ie, funding, time, and staff) exist as key barriers. In addition, frequent staff turnover and attrition that result in loss of institutional knowledge likely hinder effective public health emergency responses. CONCLUSION Effective public health emergency response depends on capable leaders not only well versed in specialized technical disciplines and practices but also familiar with-or preferably fluent in-emergency management principles and functions. This study demonstrated that well-aimed training strategies and organizational planning are essential in developing public health emergency response leaders. Specifically, leadership development may accrue considerable benefit from a standardized training curriculum. In addition, scalable training programs developed through public, private, and academic partnerships may lessen resource demands on individual organizations to facilitate training access. Finally, training practicums (eg, mentoring, shadowing) may provide opportunities to facilitate active learning and preserve institutional knowledge through leadership transitions.","output":"Public Health Emergency Response Leadership Training: A Qualitative Assessment of Existing Educational Opportunities and Perceived Facilitators, Barriers, and Priorities in Professional Development."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is frequently found in discharged COVID-19 patients but its clinical significance remains unclear. The potential cause, clinical characteristics and infectiousness of the recurrent positive RT-PCR patients need to be answered. METHODS: A single-centered, retrospective study of 51 discharged COVID-19 patients was carried out at a designated hospital for COVID-19. The demographic data, clinical records and laboratory findings of 25 patients with recurrent positive RT-PCR from hospitalization to follow-up were collected and compared to 26 patients with negative RT-PCR discharged regularly during the same period. Discharged patients family members and close contacts were also interviewed by telephone to evaluate patients potential infectiousness. RESULTS: The titer of both IgG and IgM antibodies was significantly lower (p = 0.027, p = 0.011) in patients with recurrent positive RT-PCR. Median duration of viral shedding significantly prolonged in patients with recurrent positive RT-PCR (36.0 days vs 9.0 days, p = 0.000). There was no significant difference in demographic features, clinical features, lymphocyte subsets count and inflammatory cytokines levels between the two groups of patients. No fatal case was noted in two groups. As of the last day of follow-up, none of the discharged patients family members or close contact developed any symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low levels of IgG and IgM are more likely to have recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results and lead to a prolonged viral shedding.

Prior research on the effect of capitated payments on chronic disease management has shown mixed results. We assessed the patient, physician, and practice characteristics of practices with capitation as the majority of revenue, and evaluated the association of capitated reimbursement with quality of chronic disease care. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of visits in the United States National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) for patients with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our predictor was practice reimbursement type, classified as 1) majority capitation, 2) majority FFS, or 3) other reimbursement mix. Outcomes were quality indicators of hypertension control, diabetes control, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEi/ARB) use, and statin use. RESULTS: About 9% of visits were to practices with majority capitation revenue. Capitated practices, compared with FFS and other practices, had lower visit frequency (3.7 vs. 5.2 vs. 5.2, p = 0.006), were more likely to be located in the West Census Region (55% vs. 18% vs. 17%, p < 0.001), less likely to be solo practice (21% vs. 37% vs. 35%, p = 0.005), more likely to be owned by an insurance company, health plan or HMO (24% vs. 13% vs. 13%, p = 0.033), and more likely to have private insurance (43% vs. 25% vs. 19%, p = 0.004) and managed care payments (69% vs. 23% vs. 26%, p < 0.001) as the majority of revenue. The prevalence of controlled hypertension, controlled diabetes, ACEi/ARB use, and statin use was suboptimal across practice reimbursement types. Capitated reimbursement was not associated with differences in hypertension, diabetes, or CKD quality indicators, in multivariable models adjusting for patient, physician, and practice characteristics.

Several factors place resettled refugees at elevated risk for exposure to persons with COVID-19 or increased severity of COVID-19: being more likely to experience poverty and live in crowded housing, being employed in less protected, service-sector jobs, experiencing language and health care access barriers, and having higher rates of co-morbidities. In preparing for and managing COVID-19, resettled refugees encounter similar barriers to those of other racial or ethnic minority populations, which may then be exacerbated by unique barriers experienced from being a refugee. Key recommendations for resettlement and healthcare providers include analyzing sociodemographic data about refugee patients, documenting and resolving barriers faced by refugees, developing refugee-specific outreach plans, using culturally and linguistically appropriate resources, ensuring medical interpretation availability, and leveraging virtual platforms along with nontraditional community partners to disseminate COVID-19 messaging.","output":"Potential Impact of COVID-19 on Recently Resettled Refugee Populations in the United States and Canada: Perspectives of Refugee Healthcare Providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an arts in public health research team, artists may be undervalued as key research collaborators because of the difficulties in skillful integration of experts who possess not only different bodies of knowledge but also different ways of examining and valuing the world.

In this study, we inspected high-frequency mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and carried out systematic analyses of their overlay with inverted repeat (IR) loci and CpG islands. The main conclusion of our study is that SARS-CoV-2 hot-spot mutations are significantly enriched within both IRs and CpG island loci. This points to their role in genomic instability and may predict further mutational drive of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Moreover, CpG islands are strongly enriched upstream from viral ORFs and thus could play important roles in transcription and the viral life cycle. We hypothesize that hypermethylation of these loci will decrease the transcription of viral ORFs and could therefore limit the progression of the disease.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 hot-spot mutations are significantly enriched within inverted repeats and CpG island loci"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Karam, Ab Yazid, Khatibi, and Azam (2017) investigated the relationship between human resource management and management retention in aluminum industry.

AIM: To evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sexual functioning of individuals who declared no medical history of the COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A total of 1,356 participants filled out an Internet-based survey between June 1 and June 20, 2020. The data from these participants were analyzed to determine sexual functioning in terms of sexual intercourse frequency and sexual desire during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subgroups analyses were also performed, wherein the subgroups were developed according to the population density of the cities in which the participants lived to examine whether population density has any effect on the sexual functions of the participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people's sexual functioning. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 33.16  8.31 years. There was a statistically significant difference between the participants according to the decrease in the number of weekly sexual intercourses when they were compared in terms of smoking status, alcohol consumption, marital and parental status, being a health-care worker, having a regular sexual partner, and the working status during the COVID-19 pandemic (P < .05, for each). In the subgroup analyses, it was observed that there was a statistically significant difference between the groups for change in the number of sexual intercourses, the number of masturbations, and sexual desire during the COVID-19 pandemic (P < .05, for each).

However, the effect of metformin in ischemic stroke is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of metformin on ischemic stroke in mice and further explored the possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS Ninety-eight adult male CD-1 mice underwent 90-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Metformin (200 mg/kg) was administrated for up to 14 days. Neurobehavioral outcomes, brain infarct volume, inflammatory factors, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and AMPK signaling pathways were evaluated following tMCAO. Oxygen glucose deprivation was performed on bEND.3 cells to explore the mechanisms of metformin in inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways. RESULTS Infarct volume was reduced in metformin-treated mice compared to the control group following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Neurobehavioral outcomes were greatly improved in metformin-treated mice (P < 0.05). MPO+ cells, Gr1+ cells, MPO activity and BBB permeability were decreased after metformin administration (P < 0.05). In addition, metformin activated AMPK phosphorylation, inhibited NF-B activation, down-regulated cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-) and ICAM-1 expression following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Furthermore, metformin activated AMPK signaling pathway and alleviated oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced ICAM-1 expression in bEND.3 cells (P < 0.05). Compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor, eliminated this promotional effect. CONCLUSIONS Metformin down-regulated ICAM-1 in an AMPK-dependent manner, which could effectively prevent ischemia-induced brain injury by alleviating neutrophil infiltration, suggesting that metformin is a promising therapeutic agent in stroke therapy.","output":"Metformin attenuates blood-brain barrier disruption in mice following middle cerebral artery occlusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have prepared Zn and free-base porphyrins appended with a fac -Re(phen)(CO) 3 Br (where phen is 1,10-phenanthroline) at the meso position of the porphyrin, and performed photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using porphyrin-Re dyads in the presence of either triethylamine (TEA) or 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1 H -benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) as an electron donor.

However, due to a lack of sample size, comorbidity, insufficient validation, clinical examination, and a lack of big data configuration, there have been no well-explained bias-free AI investigations to establish the CVD/Stroke risk stratification in the PD framework. The study has two objectives: (i) to establish a solid link between PD and CVD/stroke; and (ii) to use the AI paradigm to examine a well-defined CVD/stroke risk stratification in the PD framework. The PRISMA search strategy selected 223 studies for CVD/stroke risk, of which 54 and 44 studies were related to the link between PD-CVD, and PD-stroke, respectively, 59 studies for joint PD-CVD-Stroke framework, and 66 studies were only for the early PD diagnosis without CVD/stroke link. Sequential biological links were used for establishing the hypothesis. For AI design, PD risk factors as covariates along with CVD/stroke as the gold standard were used for predicting the CVD/stroke risk. The most fundamental cause of CVD/stroke damage due to PD is cardiac autonomic dysfunction due to neurodegeneration that leads to heart failure and its edema, and this validated our hypothesis. Finally, we present the novel AI solutions for CVD/stroke risk prediction in the PD framework.

Available data suggest that COVID-19 case fatality rate varies temporally (as the epidemic progresses) and spatially (among countries).

Methods We used data on the temporal trajectory of case fatality rate provided by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and country-specific data on different metrics describing the incidence of known comorbidity factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation). We also compiled data on demography, economy and political regimes for each country. Findings We first showed that temporal trajectories of case fatality rate greatly vary among countries. We found no evidence for association between comorbidities and case fatality rate at the country level. Case fatality rate was negatively associated with number of hospital beds x1,000 inhabitants. We also report evidence suggesting an association between case fatality rate and the political regime, with democracies suffering from the highest mortality burden, compared to autocratic regimes.

Evidence for the utility of chest radiographs (CXRs) in this population is less robust. Our objectives were to develop a systematic approach for reporting likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXRs, to measure the interobserver variability of this approach and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CXRs compared to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHOD: Retrospective review of patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia who attended our emergency department and underwent both CXR and a RT-PCR were included. Two radiologists reviewed the CXRs, blind to the RT-PCR, and classified them according to a structured reporting template with five categories (Characteristic, High Suspicion, Indeterminate, Unlikely and Normal) which we devised.

In response to emergence of such DNAs in the cytosol, STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, and activates TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Activated TBK1 then phosphorylates STING at Ser365, generating an interferon regulatory factor 3-docking site on STING. How this reaction proceeds specifically at the TGN remains poorly understood. Here we report a cell-free reaction in which endogenous STING is phosphorylated by TBK1. The reaction utilizes microsomal membrane fraction prepared from TBK1-knockout cells and recombinant TBK1. We observed agonist-, TBK1-, ER-to-Golgi traffic-, and palmitoylation-dependent phosphorylation of STING at Ser365, mirroring the nature of STING phosphorylation in vivo. Treating the microsomal membrane fraction with sphingomyelinase or methyl--cyclodextrin, an agent to extract cholesterol from membranes, suppressed the phosphorylation of STING by TBK1.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the association between social media use, unhealthy lifestyles, and the risk of miscarriage among pregnant women in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 456 singleton pregnant women in mainland China were recruited during January and February 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics, history of previous health, social media use, and current lifestyles were collected at baseline, and we followed up about the occurrence of miscarriage. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the risk ratios (RRs) of miscarriage for women with different exposures to COVID-19Cspecific information. RESULTS: Among all the 456 pregnant women, there were 82 (18.0%) who did no physical activities, 82 (18.0%) with inadequate dietary diversity, 174 (38.2%) with poor sleep quality, and 54 (11.8%) spending >3 hours on reading COVID-19 news per day. Women with excessive media use (>3 hours) were more likely to be previously pregnant (P=.03), have no physical activity (P=.003), have inadequate dietary diversity (P=.03), and have poor sleep quality (P<.001). The prevalence of miscarriage was 16.0% (n=73; 95% CI 12.6%-19.4%). Compared with women who spent 0.5-2 hours (25/247, 10.1%) on reading COVID-19 news per day, miscarriage prevalence in women who spent <0.5 hours (5/23, 21.7%), 2-3 hours (26/132, 19.7%), and >3 hours (17/54, 31.5%) was higher (P<.001). Miscarriage prevalence was also higher in pregnant women with poor sleep quality (39/174, 22.4% vs 34/282, 12.1%; P=.003) and a high education level (66/368, 17.9% vs 7/88, 8.0%; P=.02). In the multivariable model, poor sleep quality (adjusted RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.24-3.44; P=.006), 2-3 hours of media use daily (adjusted RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.02-2.97; P=.04), and >3 hours of media use daily (adjusted RR 2.56, 95% CI 1.43-4.59; P=.002) were associated with miscarriage.

Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in over 86.7 million cases and over 1.87 million deaths worldwide (WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard). Coronavirus spike glycoproteins assist in entry and infection of cells by binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Because of this, they are the main target for antibodies and inhibitors (Walls et al., 2020). There are many different strains of coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Although these are both ?-coronaviruses that bind to the ACE2 receptor through a spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be less deadly but more easily transmissible than SARS-CoV-1 (Fani et al., 2020). We hypothesized that the variations in the structure of the spike proteins in different strains cause these different characteristics. In order to understand the structural differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 spike proteins, we compared their structures by aligning them using PyMOL, a molecular visualization system. We observed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike proteins have differences in their structure. We will study these to identify their significance.

Although a growing number of studies have examined the effects of macroprudential policy on credit growth, few empirical studies have analyzed its effect on the probability of a banking crisis. Does macroprudential policy actually affect the probability of a banking crisis? Do other macroeconomic policies matter for the effectiveness of macroprudential policy? To answer these questions, this paper empirically investigates the effect of macroprudential policy on the probability of a banking crisis and its relationship with other macroeconomic policies. Specifically, using data on 65 countries from 2000 to 2016, we employ a probit model to analyze the effect of changes in the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on crisis probability. Our results show that macroprudential policy is effective in changing the probability of a banking crisis via a credit channel and that its effectiveness depends on other macroeconomic policies. Changes in the LTV ratio are found to be effective in influencing the probability of a banking crisis in countries that have inflation targeting frameworks, floating exchange rate regimes, and/or no capital controls. Our results underscore the importance of policy coordination among different government bodies to design an appropriate macroprudential policy, especially in the current context of the Covid-19 crisis.","output":"Macroprudential policy and the probability of a banking crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose - The paper aims to construct a simple tourism sector development index reacting to crises occurrences. Methodology - Paper is two-folded, theoretical background with literature overview and empirical part based on the DEA method. Instead of using a vast number of different individual indicators measuring countries' tourism performance, it is more appropriate to use one composite index to depict complex tourism development issues in a particular country. The composite index proposed in this paper TSDI, was developed using DEA encompassing tourism soundness and macroeconomic data. Findings - We are especially interested in index values in the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic crises relatively to the previous and following year. Therefore, the data time series include the annual data of selected truisms soundness factors from 2016 to 2020. The paper has three hypotheses dealing with simple tourism sector development index (TSDI) values during crises and the correlation of this calculated index to The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) and The Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). Contribution - The paper may offer some basic policy recommendations for policymakers as it may be applied as a relatively simple tool for professionals to assess future crises or economic shocks implications on the tourism sector. The TDSI proposed in this paper can point at the differences in countries' responses to crises shock that could be influenced by government policies aimed at tourism sector development.

METHODS: Parents of children ages 4-12 in San Francisco with BMI&#8805;85th percentile measured at a clinic visit at an FQHC or academic practice from January 1st to March 15th, 2020 were eligible to participate. Parents completed a survey reporting on child health behaviors and household food insecurity prior to and since the start of the pandemic. Survey items were abstracted from validated surveys with adaptations. Regression models evaluated associations between food insecurity and dietary intake variables. RESULTS: Most participants (n=145) were publicly insured (90%), Latino (77%), and spoke Spanish at home (70%). Parents perceived that child mean daily non-academic screen time was higher during the pandemic compared to before (3.8 hours vs 1.6 hours). Mean daily physical activity was reported to be lower compared to prior to the pandemic (1 hour vs 1.8 hours). On average, reported bedtime shifted 1.6 hours later. Food insecurity increased significantly, but was not associated with intake of fruits, vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, or foods with added sugar during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Parents of children with overweight or obesity in San Francisco perceive increased child screen time, decreased physical activity and later bedtimes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We found optimal protection from subsequent injury following short, repetitive sequences of preconditioning insult. We subsequently used hybridization array and microRNA sequencing to characterize microRNA signatures of protective IPC and of IRI. These approaches identified a profile of microRNA changes consequent on IRI, that were limited by prior IPC. To localize these signals within the kidney, we used laser capture microdissection and RT-qPCR to measure microRNA abundance in nephron segments, pinpointing microRNA changes principally to glomeruli and proximal tubules. Our data describe a unique microRNA signature for IRI in the rat kidney. Pulsatile IPC reduces kidney damage following IRI and diminishes this microRNA signal.

Specificity was assessed against non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Clinical sensitivity and correlation with cell culture infectivity was assessed using the Abbott PanBio COVID-19 Ag test. Results Nineteen kits consistently detected SARS-CoV-2 antigen equivalent to 1.3x10^6 copies/mL (5.8x10^3 TCID50/mL). Specificity for all kits was 100%.

We compared prevalence from testing done in schools to community prevalence estimates from statistical models. We compared cumulative incidence for school-associated cases to all cases reported to the city.

As nations grapple with the question of how to regain normality without unnecessarily endangering lives or healthcare systems, some scientists have argued for policies to encourage or compel the use of face coverings in community (non-clinical) settings, despite acknowledged gaps in the evidence base for the effectiveness of such a measure. This commentary has two objectives. First, in the face of strong arguments that face coverings are a commonsense intervention, with negligible downsides, that can only do good, we make the case for caution in changing policy. Many seemingly benign public health interventions have the potential to cause harm, and that harm is often socially differentiated. We present five arguments for caution in policy change. Second, we reflect on the wider implications of the increasingly overt approaches to policy advocacy taken by some scientists. Drawing from the theory of post-normal science, we argue that the scienceCpolicy interface in the case of face coverings has taken a surprisingly traditional form, falling short of interdisciplinary integration and failing to incorporate insights of the full range of relevant experts and affected stakeholders.

The shock index (SI) is defined as the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure. It is a tool used for predicting the prognosis of critically ill and injured patients. In this study, we have discussed the relationship between SI and cardiac arrest in the ED. METHODS: Patients who experienced cardiac arrest in the ED were classified into two groups, SI  0.9 and < 0.9, according to their triage vital signs. The association between SI  0.9 and in-hospital mortality was analyzed in five different etiologies of cardiac arrest, including hypoxia, cardiac cause, bleeding, sepsis, and other metabolic problems. RESULTS: In total, 3,313 patients experienced cardiac arrest in the ED. Among them, 1,909 (57.6%) had a SI of 0.9. The incidence of SI  0.9 in the five etiologies was 43.5% (hypoxia), 58.1% (cardiac cause), 56.1% (bleeding), 58.0% (sepsis), and 65.5% (other metabolic problems). SI was associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5C1.8).

Individual caries risk assessment can be conducted to evaluate the presence or absence of single factors, or using multivariate models, a combination of factors. The subject has been extensively studied, but no previous research has compared whether a more elaborate and individualized method of caries risk benefits the patient than more straightforward strategies. Thus, this protocol evaluates the efficacy of two risk assessment methods for caries control in children, a simplified method based on caries experience evaluation and a multivariate method described in the literature. METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-treatment trial protocol. Two groups will be tested for two forms of caries risk assessment: an individualized and detailed multivariate method based on the guidelines of the Caries Care International 4D and another simplified process, based only on caries experience in primary and/or permanent dentition, considering the presence of decayed, missing and filled teeth using the DMFT/dmft index. Participants will be children aged 8 to 11 years, followed up at 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome will be a composite outcome representing the number of tooth surfaces requiring operative intervention (account variable). In addition, the ShapiroCWilk normality test and Student's t-test will be performed. A multivariate analysis using negative binomial regression will compare groups in the intention-to-treat population, considering a two-tailed significance level of 5%. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized clinical trial aiming to compare dental caries-related treatment and follow-up based on a detailed, multivariate and individualized assessment of caries risk in school-age children to a simpler risk assessment strategy based on caries experience.

However, using NPS or OPS as specimens has apparent drawbacks, e.g. the collection procedures for NPS or OPS specimens can be uncomfortable to some people and may cause sneezing and coughing which in turn generate droplets and/or aerosol particles that are of risk to healthcare workers, requiring heavy use of personal protective equipment. There have been recent studies indicating that self-collected saliva specimens can be used for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 and provides more comfort and ease of use for the patients. Here we report the performance of QuantiVirus&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 test using saliva as the testing specimens with or without pooling. METHODS: Development and validation studies were conducted following FDA-EUA and molecular assay validation guidelines. Using SeraCare Accuplex SARS-CoV-2 reference panel, the limit of detection (LOD) and clinical performance studies were performed with the QuantiVirus&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 test. For clinical evaluation, 85 known positive and 90 known negative clinical NPS samples were tested. Additionally, twenty paired NPS and saliva samples collected from recovering COVID-19 patients were tested and the results were further compared to that of the Abbott m2000 SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay. Results of community collected 389 saliva samples for COVID-19 screening by QuantiVirus&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 test were also obtained and analyzed. Additionally, testing of pooled saliva samples was evaluated. RESULTS: The LOD for the QuantiVirus&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 test was confirmed to be 100-200 copies/mL. The clinical performance studies using contrived saliva samples indicated that the positive percentage agreement (PPA) of the QuantiVirus&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 test is 100% at 1xLOD, 1.5xLOD and 2.5xLOD. No cross-reactivity was observed for the QuantiVirus&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 test with common respiratory pathogens. Testing of clinical samples showed a positive percentage agreement (PPA) of 100% (95% CI: 94.6% to 100%) and a negative percentage agreement (NPA) of 98.9% (95% CI: 93.1% to 99.9%). QuantiVirus&#8482; SARS CoV-2 test had 80% concordance rate and no significant difference (p = 0.13) between paired saliva and NPS specimens by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Positive test rate was 1.79% for 389 saliva specimens collected from local communities for COVID-19 screening. Preliminary data showed that saliva sample pooling up to 6 samples (1:6 pooling) for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible (sensitivity 94.8% and specificity 100%). CONCLUSION: The studies demonstrated that the QuantiVirus&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 test has a LOD of 200 copies/mL in contrived saliva samples. The clinical performance of saliva-based testing is comparable to that of NPS-based testing. Pooling of saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible. Saliva based and high-throughput QuantiVirus&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 test offers a highly desirable testing platform during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Saliva as a testing specimen with or without pooling for SARS-CoV-2 detection by multiplex RT-PCR test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case report describes a high school athlete with palpitation, myalgia, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion after SARS-CoV-2 infection with evidence of myocarditis by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), but echocardiography and troponin were normal This case is unusual as the standard cardiac tests recommended by the American Heart Association for sports clearance, including ECG, echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers, were normal Still, she continued to be symptomatic after mild COVID-19 The CMR was performed to evaluate her unexplained palpitation and showed patchy myocardial edema two months after her initial SARS-CoV-2 infection In this case, the diagnosis of myocardial involvement would be missed by normal echocardiograms and cardiac bio-markers without CMR Because acute myocarditis is a risk factor for sudden death in competitive athletes, pediatric cardiologists should consider performing additional tests such as cardiac MRI in symptomatic COVID-19 patients, even if cardiac biomarkers and echocardiograms are normal","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Myocarditis in a High School Athlete after COVID-19 and Its Implications for Clearance for Sports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the recent technological advances in microelectronics, wireless communication, machine learning (ML), and decision-making process, Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has become the most promising technology.

METHODS: Quantitative questionnaires were prepared and distributed between May 27 and June 11, 2020. A 29-question survey targeting patients with cancer was distributed electronically via cancer support organizations. Cross-sectional data from a selected weekday at a radiation oncology department were also analyzed. In addition, a 25-question survey was distributed to 168 physicians employed by a comprehensive cancer center. RESULTS: In total, we have analyzed 468 patients and 101 physicians responses. Among responding patients, 310 were undergoing active treatment and 158 were in follow-up care. Both patients and physicians reported no experiences with video consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic, but 15% of patients stated that they missed telemedicine services that would include a video call. Overall, 30.6% of patients expressed interest in more frequent usage of telemedicine and 23.3% would start using it. Sixty-seven percent of radiation oncologists expressed interest in more frequent usage of telemedicine, and 14% would use it similarly as in the past. For patients treated with radiation therapy (RT), 59.9% and 63.4% of the responding patients acknowledged that video consultations would be an important addition to medical care during RT course or after the completion of RT, respectively. Comparably, 61.1% and 63.9% of radiation oncologists believed video consultations would be useful or extremely useful for patients undergoing RT or for patients in the follow-up setting, respectively.

In this study, we evaluated potential toxic effects of TiO(2)NPs exposure on lungs as well as the development of asthma through the ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model of asthma. Furthermore, we also investigated the associated toxic mechanism. TiO(2)NPs caused pulmonary toxicity by exacerbating the inflammatory response, indicated by an increase in the number and level of inflammatory cells and mediators, respectively. OVA-induced asthma exposed mice to TiO(2)NPs led to significant increases in inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and airway hyperresponsiveness compared with those in non-exposed asthmatic mice. This was also accompanied by increased inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus production in the lung tissues. Additionally, TiO(2)NPs decreased the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and the expressions of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), phospho-apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, Bcl2-associated X, and cleaved-caspase 3 were escalated in the lungs of asthmatic mice compared with those in non-exposed asthmatic mice. These responses were consistent with in vitro results obtained using human airway epithelial cells. TiO(2)NPs treated cells exhibited an increase in the mRNA and protein expression of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor- with an elevation of TXNIP signaling compared to non-treated cells. Moreover, pathophysiological changes induced by TiO(2)NP treatment were significantly decreased by TXNIP knockdown in airway epithelial cells. Overall, TiO(2)NP exposure induced toxicological changes in the respiratory tract and exacerbated the development of asthma via activation of the TXNIP-apoptosis pathway. These results provide insights into the underlying mechanism of TiO(2)NP-mediated respiratory toxicity.","output":"Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Exacerbate Allergic Airway Inflammation via TXNIP Upregulation in a Mouse Model of Asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of remdesivir compared to other existing therapies (SoC) in Turkey to treat COVID-19 patients hospitalized with < 94% saturation and low-flow oxygen therapy (LFOT) requirement. METHODS: We compared remdesivir as the treatment for COVID-19 with the treatments in the Turkish treatment guidelines. Analyses were performed using data from 78 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with SpO(2) < 94% who received LFOT in a tertiary healthcare facility. COVID-19 episode costs were calculated for 78 patients considering the cost of modeled remdesivir treatment in the same group from the payers perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated for remdesivir versus the SoC for the population identified. For Turkey, a reimbursement threshold value between USD 8599 (1  per capita gross domestic productGDP) and USD 25.797 (3  GDP) per QALY was used. RESULTS: In the remdesivir arm, the length of hospital stay (LOS) was 3 days shorter than the SOC. The low ventilator requirement in the remdesivir arm was one factor that decreased the QALY disutility value. In patients who were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) from the ward, the mean LOS was 17.3 days (SD 13.6), and the mean cost of stay was USD 155.3/day (SD 168.0), while in patients who were admitted to ICU at baseline, the mean LOS was 13.1 days (SD 13.7), and the mean cost of stay was USD 207.9/day (SD 133.6). The mean cost of episode per patient was USD 3461.1 (SD 2259.8) in the remdesivir arm and USD 3538.9 (SD 3296.0) in the SOC arm. Incremental QALYs were estimated at 0.174. Remdesivir treatment was determined to be cost saving vs. SoC. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir, which results in shorter LOS and lower rates of intubation requirements in ICU patients than existing therapies, is associated with higher QALYs and lower costs, dominating SoC in patients with SpO(2) < 94% who require oxygen support.

Coronavirus disease 2019 and preeclampsia have overlapping clinical features and are therefore challenging to differentiate. Since pregnant women are not routinely tested for coronavirus disease 2019, it is prudent to test for it among patients presenting with preeclampsia or eclampsia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old female, a Munda, gravida 1 para 0, at 36 weeks and 5 days of amenorrhea presented to Mal Super Specialty Hospital as a referral in a semiconscious state after a severe attack of tonicCclonic seizures. Detailed history from the husband was insignificant except for a persistent cough for the last 7 days. She had denied any visual changes, headaches, or vaginal discharge. Physical examination revealed tachycardia (150 beats per minute), elevated blood pressure (187/111 mmHg), tachypnea (36 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Routine coronavirus disease 2019 rapid test was positive, and urine dipstick was +3. Additional tests revealed leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. Chest radiograph revealed prominent interstitial markings, and a bedside transabdominal ultrasonography showed a live single intrauterine fetus in cephalic presentation with normal cardiac activity and movements. A diagnosis of a prime gravida with eclampsia and coronavirus disease 2019 was made. She was managed with intravenous labetalol; she had already received a loading dose of intravenous magnesium sulfate, and we administered two maintenance doses during monitoring. Within an hour of admission, she had a spontaneous rupture of the amniotic membranes, with meconium-stained liquor (grade 2), and the fetal heart rate (148 beats per minute) was reassuring. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery of a live male newborn. Shortly after delivery, she developed slight respiratory distress and significant fluid overload that was managed with furosemide. Coronavirus disease 2019 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test came back negative for the neonate and positive for the mother. She was shifted to the coronavirus disease 2019 treatment unit, and her contact with the child was limited.

Spontaneous muscle hematomas (SMH) often occur in the rectus sheath or gluteal muscles. Risk factors include trauma, increased abdominal pressure, anticoagulation, and hypertension. We describe two cases of non-iatrogenic SMH in therapeutically anticoagulated COVID-19 patients. Case Report: 1. 64 year old Caucasian male with ARDS due to COVID-19 was treated with mechanical ventilation, proning, methylprednisolone, tocilizumab (TOZ), and azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine. Right popliteal-posterior tibial vein DVT led to full anticoagulation (FA) with enoxaparin. Later the hemoglobin dropped (12.2 to 6.1 g/dl). Imaging showed SMH in the left posterolateral chest wall and gluteus minimus requiring blood transfusions and cessation of FA. D-dimer was 1.2  g/ml. A week later, imaging showed increased hematoma size in the left chest wall and right gluteal area. After hemoglobin stabilized, he was started on DVT prophylaxis. He required tracheostomy/PEG tube and placement in a long term acute care (LTAC) facility where he had decannulation and PEG tube removal. Patient recovered fully and is home with normal function. 2. 27 year old Caucasian female with sepsis due to COVID-19 was treated with mechanical ventilation, dexamethasone, TOZ, convalescent plasma, colchicine, and remdesivir. D-dimer was 1.6  g/ml and FA was started with enoxaparin. After intubation, hemoglobin dropped (11-6.9 g/dl). Imaging showed SMH in left biceps and pectoralis. Decreased radial pulse and increased capillary refill time with enlarging forearm hematoma prompted arterial US and CT angiogram. No flow was seen in the distal left upper extremity. Fasciotomy of the left forearm and carpal tunnel was performed with adequate perfusion of radial and ulnar arteries. Debridement was required for the non-viable flexor carpi radialis, flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus. Patient was extubated and did well thereafter. Discussion: Thrombosis contributes much to the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In a recent Veterans Health Administration study, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and cerebral ischemia/infarction comprised 9.3% of these patients. Despite the study's limitations, HESACOVID has shown that therapeutic enoxaparin is associated with fewer days on the ventilator and large reductions in D-dimer levels. Monitoring for SMH should be routinely performed on these patients. Research on optimal anticoagulation is necessary to assess the risk/benefit in this population. The bleeding risks are however less likely to cause mortality or disability as compared to the coagulation problems.","output":"Intramuscular Hematomas and Compartment Syndrome - An Inevitable Consequence in the COVID-19 Saga"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During March 27CJuly 14, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions National Healthcare Safety Network extended its surveillance to hospital capacities responding to COVID-19 pandemic.

This is in line with the indications of the 2007 EU Charter of Leipzig which calls for integrated planning strategies between rural and urban, small, medium, large, and metropolitan areas. Therefore, an ecological multidisciplinary approach to the territory, using the concept of ecology proposed by the 1950s by Dioxiadis, is suggested, concept then taken up by Appold and Kasarda in the early 1990s. And it is the key word of the Encyclical Laudato Sii for the Care of the Common House of Pope Francis 2015 which refers to the principles of the 1992 Rio Conference based on the centrality of human ecology and on the alliance between man and nature, which in 1995 Scandurra had requested in Lambiente delluomo (The Environment of Man). The phenomenological, from the Greek world phenomenon, is the methodological keystone of the paper. The well-being of the person and of the communities must be the objective of those who deal with the development of the territory. Rural areas in this sense can offer great opportunities, generated today by the many technological innovations, both tangible and intangible, potentially available. However, this should not overshadow the need for links that facilitate access to these areas. One of the important positive effects of the presence in rural areas is the reduction of hydrogeological risk thanks to the presence and daily maintenance of them. Among the aspects that raise questions that are difficult to answer is the risk that the more accessible an area becomes, the more there is a threat of its loss of uniqueness.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of COVID-19 on the thyroid gland among COVID-19 survivors by comparing them with healthy subjects. METHODS: Adult COVID-19 survivors who were managed and followed up in the Infectious Disease clinic were asked to participate in this study. COVID-19 survivors were recruited via a convenience sampling and those who agreed to participate in this study were seen by endocrinologists for assessments. The blood tests were obtained for thyroid antibodies and thyroid function tests. Thyroid ultrasonography (USG) was done by the same physician. The ellipsoid formula was used for the calculation of thyroid gland volume. RESULTS: 64 adult COVID-19 survivors and 70 control subjects were enrolled in the study. The COVID-19 survivors were evaluated at median 5.7 months (IQR: 4C6.5) (range: 2C7 months) after acute infection. The mean thyroid gland volume was significantly lower in COVID-19 survivors (10.3  3.4 mL) than in the controls (14  5.3 mL) (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between the groups. Among the twelve patients who had thyroid function evaluated in acute COVID-19, fT3 values were lower in acute COVID-19 than at the time of USG evaluation (3.04  0.41 vs 3.47  0.31 pg/mL), (p = 0.02). Among COVID-19 survivors, mild TSH elevation was detected in 4 (6.2%) patients and all of the other COVID-19 survivors (93.7%) were euthyroid. CONCLUSIONS: At 6 months after acute COVID, COVID-19 survivors had smaller thyroid gland volume than healthy controls, and only a few of the COVID-19 survivors had abnormal thyroid function.","output":"The potential impact of COVID-19 on thyroid gland volumes among COVID-19 survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tools and training for responding to diseases such as avian flu must relocate to countries where infections are most likely to emerge, says Jeremy Farrar.","output":"Shift expertise to where it matters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High winter mortality (28 per cent) in female Jersey calves (<one month) characterised by mild hepatopathy and enteropathy was investigated.

Thus far, there have been some implementations of artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to develop epidemiology curve for a specific country.

In this paper, the AI method called genetic programming (GP) algorithm is utilized to develop a symbolic expression (mathematical equation) which can be used for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. with high accuracy. The GP algorithm is utilized on the publicly available dataset that contains the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for each U.S. state to obtain the symbolic expression for the estimation of the number of the aforementioned patient groups. The dataset consists of the latitude and longitude of the central location for each state and the number of patients in each of the goal groups for each day in the period of 22nd January 2020-3rd December 2020. The obtained symbolic expressions for each state are summed up to obtain symbolic expressions for estimation of each of the patient groups (confirmed, deceased and recovered). These symbolic expressions are combined to obtain the symbolic expression for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. The obtained symbolic expressions for the estimation of the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for each state achieved R2 score in the ranges 0.9406-0.9992, 0.9404-0.9998 and 0.9797-0.99955, respectively.

The current approach to prevent airborne disease transmission is an extraoral aerosol suction unit: a stand-alone vacuum module with a segmented arm and cup. Despite the need for disease control in dental offices, these units are rarely seen due to the loud noise produced by vacuum, bulky size, and high cost. This paper describes the aerodynamic design optimization of an affordable, 3D printable, Extraoral Vacuum Aerosol Cup (EVAC) that can be directly connected to existing standard 7/16 central vacuum high-volume evacuator (HVE) valves used for intraoral saliva absorption in a dental office. These HVEs are typically unsuitable for extraoral suction due to their low vacuum force. However, they can be used for extraoral suction, if the cup attachment is aerodynamically optimized for maximum suction efficiency. Fifteen different designs of EVAC are proposed and their suction processes were simulated with computational fluid dynamics. Droplets of various sizes are released to mimic the droplets produced during dental operation. The suction performances of EVACs with different sizes and shapes were compared to find out the designs with optimal performance. Prototypes of the optimized EVAC are 3D printed and tested at a dental office. Development and manufacturing of such a device will largely reduce the COVID-19 infection risk, thus improving the safety protection for both patients and doctors at dental offices.

A simulator is developed in the Unity game engine capable of producing synthetic PIR motion sensor data by detecting simulated occupants. The accuracy of the simulator is tested by replicating a real-world meeting room inside the simulator and conducting an experiment where a set of choreographed movements are performed in the simulated environment as well as the real room. In 34 out of 50 tested situations, the output from the simulated PIR sensors is comparable to the output from the real-world PIR sensors. The developed simulator is also used to study how a PIR sensors output changes depending on where in a room a motion is carried out. Through this, the relationship between sensor output and spatial position of a motion is discovered to be highly non-linear, which highlights some of the difficulties associated with mapping PIR data to occupancy count.","output":"Synthetic Generation of Passive Infrared Motion Sensor Data Using a Game Engine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK Pain is one of the most common symptoms in children who access the Pediatric Emergency Room (PER).

Although more than 100 ongoing trials are testing their efficacy, CQ and HCQ are being used widely in clinical practice, exposing COVID-19 patients to potentially significant cardiac adverse effects. Objective To systematically review the literature and estimate the risk of cardiac toxicity in patients receiving CQ or HCQ for COVID-19. Data Sources A systematic search was conducted on May 27, 2020 of Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase (1974+), Ovid Medline (1946+ including epub ahead of print, in-process & other non-indexed citations), Scopus (1970+) and Web of Science (1975+) and preprint servers (Medrvix and ResearchSquare) and manual search of references lists. Study Selection Studies that included COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without azithromycin, were included as follows: (1) COVID-19 patient population, (2) the study included more than 10 patients receiving either one of the medications, (3) reported electrocardiographic changes and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Data Extraction and Synthesis Study characteristics and endpoints incidence were extracted. Due to the very low incidence of torsades de pointes (TdP) and other endpoints (rare events), the arcsine transformation was used to obtain a pooled estimate of the different incidences using a random-effects meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses were used to assess whether the incidence of different endpoints significantly varied by multiple study-level variables specified a priori. Main Outcomes and Measures Pooled Incidence of: (1) change in QTc value from baseline [a?] 60 ms, (2) QTc [a?] 500 ms, (3) the composite of endpoint 1 and 2, (4) TdP arrhythmia or ventricular tachycardia (VT) or cardiac arrest, (5) discontinuation of treatment due to drug-induced QT prolongation or arrhythmias. Results A total of 19 studies with a total of 5652 patients were included. All included studies were of high methodological quality in terms of exposure ascertainment or outcome assessment. Among 2719 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, only two episodes of TdP were reported; the pooled incidence of TdP arrhythmia or VT or cardiac arrest was 3 per 1000, 95% CI (0-21), I2=96%, 18 studies with 3725 patients. Among 13 studies of 4334 patients, the pooled incidence of discontinuation of CQ or HCQ due to prolonged QTc or arrhythmias was 5%, 95% CI (1-11), I2=98%. The pooled incidence of change in QTc from baseline of [a?] 60 ms was 7%, 95% CI (3-14), I2=94% (12 studies of 2008 patients). The pooled incidence of QTc [a?] 500 ms was 6%, 95% CI (2-12), I2=95% (16 studies of 2317 patients). Among 11 studies of 3127 patients, the pooled incidence of change in QTc from baseline of [a?] 60 ms or QTc [a?] 500 ms was 9%, 95% CI (3-17), I2=97%. Mean/median age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, concomitant QT prolonging medications, ICU care, and severity of illness in the study populations explained between-studies heterogeneity. Conclusions and Relevance Treatment of COVID-19 patients with CQ or HCQ is associated with a significant risk of drug-induced QT prolongation, which is a harbinger for drug-induced TdP/VT or cardiac arrest. CQ/HCQ use resulted in a relatively higher incidence of TdP as compared to drugs withdrawn from the market for this particular adverse effect. Therefore, these agents should be used only in the context of randomized clinical trials, in patients at low risk for drug-induced QT prolongation, with adequate safety monitoring.","output":"The Cardiac Toxicity of Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-regression Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created many challenges for health care providers.

Following the start of clinical triage (May-Oct 2020), 36 of 54 (67%) patients were triaged as 'very urgent'. 17 of 54 (31%) patients were triaged as 'urgent'. 1 patient was not prioritised as their barium swallow suggested a diagnosis of achalasia which was later found to be an oesophageal malignancy (referral to endoscopy 95 days). There was no significant difference in referral to endoscopy time in 2020 (Mar-Oct) [mean 45 days, SD 40.2] compared to 2019 [mean 41.6 days, SD 26.7] (mean difference 3.4 days p=0.55). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a 28.5% reduction in GI cancer diagnoses. This worrying reduction in cancer detection will need to be ameliorated by an increase in endoscopy capacity. Radiological investigations were utilised more during this period to assess suspected GI cancer referrals. 98% of cancer patients were appropriately prioritised as very urgent or urgent based on clinical triage, and radiological investigations aided in triage. There was no significant difference in referral to endoscopy time. We highlight that achalasia diagnosed on barium swallow should always visualised directly, even with curtailed endoscopy capacity.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on endoscopic cancer detection at a single-centre in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Mainland France has been seriously affected by the Covid-19 epidemic, which has brought significant and unexpected morbidity and mortality. Precarious people cared for in accommodation centers are particularly at risk of infection because of collective housing, their dependence on the support system and therefore their difficulty in applying barrier measures. These populations are also subject to a risk of more severe infections or a delay in seeking treatment. This study aims to identify the factors associated with SARS-CoV2 infection in the most vulnerable populations in Marseille. Methods: : The sample on which the study was carried out consists of association users, whether or not presenting a symptomatology suggestive of Covid-19, and routinely treated between March 2020 and May 2020. Through univariate and multivariate analyzes, we studied the influence of several variables on morbidity attributable to SARS-CoV2. Results: : 64 participants were enrolled in the study with 29 cases and 35 control subject. Median age was 21.16 years old with a younger age in the case group (p < 0.005). Sex ratio was 7. Risk factors of SARS-CoV2 in multivariate analysis were living in a shared apartment and a low compliance for distancing measure. Participants presented frequent mental health problems such as anxiety. Conclusions: : The allocation of housing to structures involved with the most precarious people appears to be a decisive factor in the fight against the spread of SARS-CoV2 and therefore deserves more attention from public authorities.","output":"Factors Associated with SARS-CoV2 Infection and Care Pathways Among the Most Vulnerable Populations Living in Marseille: A Case Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Although the new coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) affects predominantly the respiratory system, concomitant liver manifestations are common among COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this study was to describe and analyse the characteristics of work-related COVID-19 in Croatian HCWs. Study participants were HCWs who contacted their occupational physician between 1 May 2020 and 12 November 2020 with a request for the registration of COVID-19 as an occupational disease. All participants filled out our online Occupational COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers Questionnaire. The study included 59 HCWs (median age 45.0, interquartile range 36.0C56.0 years). Most (78 %) were nurses or laboratory technicians, and almost all (94.9 %) worked in hospitals. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three clusters of COVID-19-related symptoms: 1) elevated body temperature with general weakness and fatigue, 2) diarrhoea, and 3) headache, muscle and joint pain, anosmia, ageusia, and respiratory symptoms (nasal symptoms, burning throat, cough, dyspnoea, tachypnoea). Almost half (44.6 %) reported comorbidities. Only those with chronic pulmonary conditions were more often hospitalised than those without respiratory disorders (57.1 % vs. 2.5 %, respectively; P=0.001). Our findings suggest that work-related COVID-19 among Croatian HCWs is most common in hospital nurses/laboratory technicians and takes a mild form, with symptoms clustering around three clinical phenotypes: general symptoms of acute infection, specific symptoms including neurological (anosmia, ageusia) and respiratory symptoms, and diarrhoea as a separate symptom.

Methods: : The study participants were 3 rd year students ( n = 43) at a private mid-sized medical school located in a South Korean suburb on a four-year medical program. Educational intervention was implemented to enhance student clinical performance. Students engaged in learning activities that intended to promote their self-directed learning abilities and clinical performances using e-learning resources. Intervention was conducted for the duration of six months during the 3 rd year and its effectiveness was investigated by comparing student performances in OSCEs in a pre- and post- comparison format and also by comparing them with national scores. In addition, student perceptions of the impact of e-learning on their OSCE performances were assessed using a questionnaire, which included 36 items that elicited student perceptions of their experiences of e-learning and readiness for e-learning. Results: : Student OSCE scores improved significantly after educational intervention in all domains of clinical competencies assessed and for total scores ( p < 0.001). Furthermore, students achieved higher OSCE scores than national average scores in the post-test, whereas they had performed lower than national average scores in the pre-test.

We report our institution's experience treating AT-IVC using endovascular methods. METHODS A 10-year retrospective review of patients presenting with symptomatic IVC thrombosis between the years 2005 and 2014 was performed. Demographic data, treatment modalities, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-five patients (44% men) underwent treatment for acute (<2 weeks) symptomatic IVC thrombosis. Presenting symptoms included pain and limb swelling in 23 (92%), motor dysfunction in 16 (64%), sensory loss in 14 (56%), and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 2 (8%) patients. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens was present in 5 patients, a history of malignancy was identified in 7 patients, and 21 patients had an IVC filter at presentation (Trapease 12, G2X 3, Option 2, Eclipse 2, Meridian 2). Four patients had a documented hypercoagulable state, 21 patients underwent venous angioplasty, and 7 (28%) patients underwent venous stenting of the IVC or iliofemoral veins. Significant (>50% luminal gain) angiographic resolution of venous thrombus was achieved in all 25 patients. Twenty-one (84%) patients reported moderate-to-complete symptomatic improvement immediately after completion of the procedures. Two patients had a clinically symptomatic PE and 1 patient underwent an above-knee amputation secondary to venous gangrene. Other complications included 6 minor bleeding complications (2 local hematoma, 4 hematuria) all of which resolved spontaneously. There were 2 major bleeding complications (1 disseminated intravascular coagulation, 1 retroperitoneal hematoma). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of AT-IVC, regardless of etiology, is safe and effective with excellent short-term clinical results.

Commonly recommended exercises to optimize the use of respiratory muscles during speech, such as diaphragmatic breathing, are unlikely to be intensive enough to induce respiratory changes and impact vocal function. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of adding a targeted intervention, respiratory muscle strength training, to voice exercises in a sample of patients with presbyphonia. METHODS/DESIGN: In this prospective, randomized-controlled trial, 12 participants received either (1) vocal function exercises (VFE), (2) VFE combined with inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST), or (3) VFE combined with expiratory muscle strength training (EMST). Data collected prior to and following 4 weekly intervention sessions included respiratory measures (pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength) and voice measures (videostroboscopy, acoustic, auditory-perceptual, aerodynamic, and self-assessment measures). RESULTS: Participants who received IMST improved their voice quality during connected speech (smoothed cepstral peak prominence and ratings of overall voice quality) and their scores on the three self-assessment questionnaires with large to very large within-group effect sizes (|d| = 0.82-1.61). In addition, participants in the IMST group reduced their subglottal pressure with a large effect size (d = -0.92). Participants who received EMST improved their maximum expiratory strength and smoothed cepstral peak prominence with large effect sizes (d = 0.80 and 0.99, respectively) but had limited improvements in other outcomes. Participants who received only VFE decreased their amount of vocal fold bowing, improved their voice quality on a sustained vowel (amplitude perturbation quotient), and improved their Glottal Function Index score with large effect sizes (|d| = 0.74-1.00). CONCLUSION: Preliminary data indicate that adding IMST to voice exercises may lead to the greatest benefits in patients with presbyphonia by promoting improved subglottal pressure control as well as increasing air available for phonation, resulting in improved self-assessment outcomes.","output":"Respiratory Muscle Strength Training to Improve Vocal Function in Patients with Presbyphonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of chronic liver disease in humans, is the focus of intense research efforts worldwide. Yet structural data on the viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are scarce, in spite of their essential role in the viral life cycle. To obtain more information, we developed an efficient production system of recombinant E2 ectodomain (E2e), truncated immediately upstream its trans-membrane (TM) region, using Drosophila melanogaster cells. This system yields a majority of monomeric protein, which can be readily separated chromatographically from contaminating disulfide-linked aggregates. The isolated monomeric E2e reacts with a number of conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies, binds the soluble CD81 large external loop and efficiently inhibits infection of Huh7.5 cells by infectious HCV particles (HCVcc) in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it adopts a native conformation. These properties of E2e led us to experimentally determine the connectivity of its 9 disulfide bonds, which are strictly conserved across HCV genotypes. Furthermore, circular dichroism combined with infrared spectroscopy analyses revealed the secondary structure contents of E2e, indicating in particular about 28% -sheet, in agreement with the consensus secondary structure predictions. The disulfide connectivity pattern, together with data on the CD81 binding site and reported E2 deletion mutants, enabled the threading of the E2e polypeptide chain onto the structural template of class II fusion proteins of related flavi- and alphaviruses. The resulting model of the tertiary organization of E2 gives key information on the antigenicity determinants of the virus, maps the receptor binding site to the interface of domains I and III, and provides insight into the nature of a putative fusogenic conformational change.","output":"The Disulfide Bonds in Glycoprotein E2 of Hepatitis C Virus Reveal the Tertiary Organization of the Molecule"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effectiveness and potential immunosuppressive effects of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids in the lungs of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients are undefined.

METHODS: An observational single-center study of prospective cohort of patients presenting to the ED during the early COVID-19 pandemic with respiratory symptoms and a CBC drawn within 4.5 hours of initial vital signs. A sample of this blood was aliquoted for performance of the ISI, and patients were followed for clinical outcomes. The study required no patient-centered activity beyond standard of care and treating clinicians were unaware of study enrollment and ISI test results. MAIN FINDINGS: 282 patients were included. The ISI ranges 0.1 to 10.0, with three interpretation bands indicating risk of adverse outcome: low (green), 0.1C4.9; intermediate (yellow), 5.0C6.2; and high (red), 6.3C10.0. Of 193 (68.4%) tested for SARS-CoV-2, 96 (49.7%) were positive. The ISI resulted in 182 (64.5%) green, 54 (18.1%) yellow, and 46 (15.6%) red band patients. Green band patients had a 1.1% (n = 2) 3-day mortality, while yellow and red band had 3.7% (n = 2, p > .05) and 10.9% (n = 5, p < .05) 3-day mortalities, respectively. Fewer green band patients required admission (96 [52.7%]) vs yellow (44 [81.5%]) and red (43 [93.5%]).

Elevated IL-6 levels have been identified in several severe disorders such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and most recently, COVID-19. The biological activity of IL-6 relies on interactions with its specific receptor, IL-6R, including the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R) and the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Thus, inhibition of the interaction between these two proteins would be a potential treatment for IL-6 related diseases. To date, no orally available small-molecule drug has been approved. This study focuses on finding potential small molecules that can inhibit protein-protein interactions between IL-6 and its receptor IL-6R using its crystal structure (PDB ID: 5FUC). First, two pharmacophore models were constructed based on the interactions between key residues of IL-6 (Phe74, Phe78, Leu178, Arg179, Arg182) and IL-6R (Phe229, Tyr230, Glu277, Glu278, Phe279). A database of approximately 22 million compounds was screened using 3D-pharmacophore models, molecular docking models, and ADMET properties. By analyzing the interactive capability of successfully docked compounds with important amino acids, 12 potential ligands were selected for further analysis via molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the stability of the complexes, the high interactions rate of each ligand with the key residues of IL-6/IL-6R, and the low binding free energy calculation, two compounds ZINC83804241 and ZINC02997430, were identified as the most potential IL-6 inhibitor candidates.

Methods: People with lifetime EDs (n = 32) were recruited through social media from May to June 2020 during a period of strict infection control measures in the United Kingdom (i.e., lockdown, social distancing). They completed open-ended questions in an online anonymous questionnaire that invited them to reflect on how various aspects of their lives have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, including ED symptoms and coping strategies. Responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Most respondents reported that their ED worsened or resurfaced. Isolation, low mood, anxiety, lack of structure, disruption to routines, and media/social media messages around weight and exercise seemed to contribute to this. There was a clear sense that individuals struggled with which aspects of psychological distress to prioritize, i.e., mood vs. ED cognitions and behaviors, particularly as attempts to cope with one often exacerbated the other.

Methods: Using data from 01/01/2019 to 31/05/2020 (weeks 1-22), influenza hospitalizations were identified using ICD-10-GM codes J10-J11. We estimated changes in the number of influenza hospitalizations using a difference-in-differences model including variables for age group (<18, 18-44, 45-64, 65-79, 80+), gender, week, year, and outbreak status (interaction variable between year 2020 and week 12 or later).

Here, we report that acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) represents a critical mitochondrial signal to regulate aging through the chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase complex (NuRD) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Upon mitochondrial stress, the impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle results in a decreased level of citrate, which accounts for reduced production of acetyl-CoA and consequently induces nuclear accumulation of the NuRD and a homeodomain-containing transcription factor DVE-1, thereby enabling decreased histone acetylation and chromatin reorganization. The metabolic stress response is thus established during early life and propagated into adulthood to allow transcriptional regulation for life-span extension. Furthermore, adding nutrients to restore acetyl-CoA production is sufficient to counteract the chromatin changes and diminish the longevity upon mitochondrial stress.

In addition to its broad antiviral activity, GRFT is stable at high temperature and at a broad pH range, displays little toxicity and immunogenicity, and is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. Native GRFT is a domain-swapped homodimer that binds to viral envelope glycoproteins and has displayed mid-picomolar activity in cell-based anti-HIV assays. Previously, we have engineered and analyzed several monomeric forms of this lectin (mGRFT) with anti-HIV EC(50) values ranging up to 323 nM. Based on our previous analysis of mGRFT, we hypothesized that the orientation and spacing of the carbohydrate binding domains GRFT were key to its antiviral activity. RESULTS: Here we present data on engineered tandem repeats of mGRFT (mGRFT tandemers) with antiviral activity at concentrations as low as one picomolar in whole-cell anti-HIV assays. mGRFT tandemers were analyzed thermodynamically, both individually and in complex with HIV-1 gp120. We also demonstrate by dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy that mGRFT tandemers do not aggregate HIV virions. This establishes that, although the intra-virion crosslinking of HIV envelope glycoproteins is likely integral to their activity, the antiviral activity of these lectins is not due to virus aggregation caused by inter-virion crosslinking. CONCLUSIONS: The engineered tandemer constructs of mGRFT may provide novel and powerful agents for prevention of infection by HIV and other enveloped viruses.

Nevertheless, we do not know if improvements in health conditions at older ages have followed postponements of death. Previous studies in Spain show a stable trend in years lived in ill health in the past. In this paper we investigate changes between 2006, 2012 and 2017 in life expectancy with and without disease at age 65 in Spain and, for the first time, in Spanish regions, which have autonomous powers of health planning, public health and healthcare. Results show that, at the country level, disease-free life expectancy reduced between 2006 and 2017 in Spain. This was explained by an expansion of most diseases except for some cardiovascular and respiratory chronic conditions. However, at the regional level the evolution was different, especially regarding each disease and sex. First, regional differences reduced between 2006 and 2012 but largely widened in 2017, suggesting that not all regions had the same ability to recover after the 2008 financial crisis that caused government cuts to health services. Second, regional analysis also highlighted diverging trends by sex. While men experienced expansion of morbidity in most regions, women experienced a compression in about half of them, ending up with women showing higher disease-free life expectancies than men in 9 out of the 17 regions considered. This study, then, calls attention to the importance of focusing the analysis of health surveillance to more disaggregated levels, more in accordance with the level of health management, as regional trends showed heterogeneity in the prevalence of diseases and different progresses in the relationship between sexes.","output":"Trends in disease-free life expectancy at age 65 in Spain: Diverging patterns by sex, region and disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article focuses on Care Quality Commission was established in 2009 to regulate and inspect health and social care services in England and duty to give sometimes damning assessments on how individual healthcare institutions are performing make it an organisation that is feared rather than loved.","output":"Coronavirus-driven innovation and inspiration from the CQC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac surgeons during this pandemic crisis have a responsibility to ensure that essential elective cardiac operations are provided at their centers to the public, at the same time, they have to face administrative demands as well as the infection prevention guidelines and restrictions to protect themselves and their patients.

We analyzed the published (pre)-clinical evidence. METHODS: preclinical: comparison of in vitro tests with validated host cell models to determine viral infectivity. Clinical: efficacy, proportion of users protected against virus (compared with non-users) and safety associated with trypsin/glycerol. RESULTS: preclinical data showed that exogenous trypsin enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and syncytia formation in host models, while culture passages in trypsin presence induce spike protein mutants. The manufacturer claims >98% SARS-CoV-2 deactivation, although clinically irrelevant as based on a tryptic viral digest, inserting trypsin inactivation before host cells exposure. Efficacy and safety were not adequately addressed in clinical studies or leaflets (no COVID-19 data). Protection was obtained among 9-39% of users, comparable to or lower than placebo-treated or non-users. Several potential safety risks (tissue digestion, bronchoconstriction) were identified.

Patients in Arm 1 were treated with 3 monthly laser sessions, which were started after 1 month of topical oxymetazoline cream. Thirty subjects continued with the study, and 25 subjects (Arm 1: 14, Arm 2: 11) completed the 6-month follow-up. With photographic comparison to baseline images, efficacy endpoints were based on clinical on-site grading by both the investigator and the patient, using the grading tools for CEA, Global Aesthetic Improvement (GAI) assessment, vessel size improvement, and subject self-assessment. These scales were assessed at baseline and/or at each clinical follow-up at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. Subject satisfaction as well as post-treatment immediate response and treatment-associated pain scores were also evaluated. RESULTS Statistically significant improvement in CEA was seen in both arms at the 1-, 2-, and 3-month post-baseline visits (P < 0.01). Only Arm 1 presented statistically significant improvement in CEA (P < 0.001) at 6 months post baseline with a mean score of 1.6 (almost clear-mild) compared with 3.2 at baseline. Arm 1 showed significantly greater mean vessel size improvement at 3 months (P < 0.01) and 6 months (P < 0.05) post baseline compared to Arm 2. Significantly greater improvement (P < 0.05) in the investigator GAI score was reported at the 2- and 6-month follow-ups compared with Arm 2.

RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, up to a million times higher than that of their hosts. Virus mutagenic capability depends upon several factors, including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nucleic acids, as SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp). Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability, thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. Methods. We analyzed 220 genomic sequences from the GISAID database derived from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide from December 2019 to mid-March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was obtained from the GenBank database. Genomes alignment was performed using Clustal Omega. Mann-Whitney and Fisher-Exact tests were used to assess statistical significance.Results. We characterized 8 novel recurrent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, located at positions 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881. Mutations in 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 positions are predominantly observed in Europe, whereas those located at positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 are exclusively present in North America. We noticed that the 14408 mutation, emerged for the first time in Europe in mid-February 2020, is present in the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene sequence. Viruses with RdRp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [range: 2-5], otherwise they have a median of 1 mutation [range: 0-3] (p value < 0.001). Conclusions. These findings suggest that the virus is evolving and European, North American and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern. The contribution of the mutated RdRp to this phenomenon needs to be investigated. To date, several drugs targeting RdRp enzymes are being employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Some of them have a predicted binding moiety in a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp hydrophobic cleft, which is adjacent to the 14408 mutation we identified. Consequently, it is important to study and characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp mutation in order to assess possible drug-resistance viral phenotypes. It is also important to recognize whether the presence of some mutations might correlate with different SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.","output":"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutation hot spots include a novel RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Federated learning (FL) is an emerging promising privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm and has raised more and more attention from researchers and developers. FL keeps users' private data on devices and exchanges the gradients of local models to cooperatively train a shared Deep Learning (DL) model on central custodians. However, the security and fault tolerance of FL have been increasingly discussed, because its central custodian mechanism or star-shaped architecture can be vulnerable to malicious attacks or software failures. To address these problems, Swarm Learning (SL) introduces a permissioned blockchain to securely onboard members and dynamically elect the leader, which allows performing DL in an extremely decentralized manner. Compared with tremendous attention to SL, there are few empirical studies on SL or blockchain-based decentralized FL, which provide comprehensive knowledge of best practices and precautions of deploying SL in real-world scenarios.

For each publication included, the following data were collected: title and abstract, year of publication, type of article, number and type of individuals examined. The selected publications were also categorized based on PMCT findings, histopathological results, the comparison between PMCT and histopathological findings, cause of death and proposed role of PMCT during the pandemic. Results : A total of 20 publications were included, mostly case reports (9/20). All cases examined included adults. The most frequent PMCT pattern in positive cases was diffuse mixed densities with prevalence of consolidations (pattern 1) (54%). In 97% of the cases where a comparison between PMCT and histological results was performed, a correspondence was found. In 82% of the cases the principal cause of death was COVID-19 pneumonia.

The results of this SLR showed that frameworks such as that of UNESCO could guide institutions to fast-track the development of educational strategies for post-crisis, COVID-19 implementation. Also, findings suggest an increase in the use of ICTs in learning environments, which will encourage organizations like UNESCO to develop plans and projects, such as the ICT framework further.

However, their role in the environmental dissemination of bacterial antibiotic resistance and the extent of their impact on the environment are not yet clear. Qinghai Lake is one of the most important breeding and stopover ground for the migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway. Here, we investigated the bacterial antibiotic resistance in the environment and among the migratory birds around the lake. The results of culture-based analysis of bacterial antibiotic resistance, quantitative PCR and metagenomic sequencing indicate that migratory birds are one major source of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the environment around Qinghai Lake. Network analysis reveals the co-occurrence patterns of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacterial genera. Genetic co-localization analysis suggests high co-selection potential (with incidence of 35.8%) among different ARGs, but limited linkage (with incidence of only 3.7%) between ARGs and biocide/metal resistance genes (BMRGs). The high genetic linkage between ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) is still largely confined to the bacterial community in migratory birds (accounting for 96.0% of sequencing reads of MGE-linked ARGs), which indicates limited horizontal transfer of ARGs to the environment. Nevertheless, the antibiotic resistance determinants carried by migratory birds and their specific genetic properties (high co-selection and mobility potential of the ARGs) remind us that the role of migratory birds in the environmental dissemination of bacterial antibiotic resistance deserves more attention.","output":"Migratory birds-one major source of environmental antibiotic resistance around Qinghai Lake, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the added value of the use of upper arm length (UAL) along with mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) to diagnose and estimate the prevalence of wasting in comparison to current WHO standard and other MUAC-based methods. DESIGN: UAL and usual anthropometric measurements were collected during a national cross-sectional nutritional survey. Children were classified into three upper arm length groups (UALGs): UALG1, UALG2 and UALG3 according to the following UAL limits: 150, 151C180 and 181 mm, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the best MUAC cut-off for each group using weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) as a reference standard. Wasting prevalence, sensitivity and specificity of all diagnostic methods were compared. SETTING: This study was conducted in Mauritania. PARTICIPANTS: National representative sample of children from 6 to 59 months old. RESULTS: In total, 12 590 children were included in the study. Wasting prevalence was 16.1%, 5.0% and 12.5% when diagnosed by WHZ <?2, MUAC <125 mm and MUACCUALG methods, respectively. Using the MUACCUALG method increased the sensitivity for wasting diagnosis from 17.98% with MUAC <125 mm to 39.43% with MUACCUALG. The specificity decreased from 97.49% with MUAC <125 mm to 92.71% with MUACCUALG.

This review examines the evidence for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2, the risk of transmission from asymptomatic patients, and the specific risks associated with aerosol-generating procedures. Protective measures, such as minimization of aerosols and use of personal protective equipment in the setting of treating asymptomatic patients, are also reviewed. SOURCE: We examined the published literature as well as Societal guidelines. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: There is evidence that a proportion of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 have detectable viral loads prior to exhibiting symptoms, or without ever developing symptoms. The degree of risk of transmission from asymptomatic patients to healthcare providers will depend on the prevalence of disease in the population, which is difficult to assess without widespread population screening. Aerosol-generating procedures increase the odds of viral transmission from infected symptomatic patients to healthcare providers, but transmission from asymptomatic patients has not been reported. Techniques to minimize aerosolization and appropriate personal protective equipment may help reduce the risk to healthcare workers in the operating room. Some societal guidelines recommend the use of airborne precautions during aerosol-generating procedures on asymptomatic patients during the coronavirus disease pandemic, although evidence supporting this practice is limited. CONCLUSION: Viral transmission from patients exhibiting no symptoms in the operating room is plausible and efforts to reduce risk to healthcare providers include reducing aerosolization and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, the feasibility of which will vary based on geographic risk and equipment availability.","output":"Asymptomatic carriage and transmission of SARS-CoV-2: What do we know?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Available COVID-19 mortality indices are limited to acute inpatient data. Using nationwide medical administrative data available prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection from the US Veterans Health Administration (VA), we developed the VA COVID-19 (VACO) 30-day mortality index and validated the index in two independent, prospective samples. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We reviewed SARS-CoV-2 testing results within the VA between February 8 and August 18, 2020. The sample was split into a development cohort (test positive between March 2 and April 15, 2020), an early validation cohort (test positive between April 16 and May 18, 2020), and a late validation cohort (test positive between May 19 and July 19, 2020). Our logistic regression model in the development cohort considered demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), and pre-existing medical conditions and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) derived from ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Weights were fixed to create the VACO Index that was then validated by comparing area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the early and late validation cohorts and among important validation cohort subgroups defined by sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region. We also evaluated calibration curves and the range of predictions generated within age categories. 13,323 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median age: 63 years; 91% male; 42% non-Hispanic Black). We observed 480/3,681 (13%) deaths in development, 253/2,151 (12%) deaths in the early validation cohort, and 403/7,491 (5%) deaths in the late validation cohort. Age, multimorbidity described with CCI, and a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease were independently associated with mortality-no other individual comorbid diagnosis provided additional information. The VACO Index discriminated mortality in development (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77-0.81), and in early (AUC = 0.81 95% CI: 0.78-0.83) and late (AUC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78-0.86) validation. The VACO Index allows personalized estimates of 30-day mortality after COVID-19 infection. For example, among those aged 60-64 years, overall mortality was estimated at 9% (95% CI: 6-11%). The Index further discriminated risk in this age stratum from 4% (95% CI: 3-7%) to 21% (95% CI: 12-31%), depending on sex and comorbid disease. CONCLUSION: Prior to infection, demographics and comorbid conditions can discriminate COVID-19 mortality risk overall and within age strata. The VACO Index reproducibly identified individuals at substantial risk of COVID-19 mortality who might consider continuing social distancing, despite relaxed state and local guidelines.","output":"Development and validation of a 30-day mortality index based on pre-existing medical administrative data from 13,323 COVID-19 patients: The Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Assessing the psychological status and fatigue of frontline staff exposed to COVID-19 in China.

Because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, we also aimed to gain more evidence about exposure to several respiratory tract pathogens. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified in MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane between 2009 and 8 December 2020. The protocol was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42019107265). An additional quality assessment was applied according to the Equator network guidelines.

The mechanism that human antibodies may uncover the antigenic viral peptide epitopes hidden by sugar coat are unknown. In this study, we analyzed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein secreted from BTI-Tn-5B1-4 cells, by trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometry analysis. We acquired MS/MS spectrums for glycopeptides of all 22 predicted N-glycosylated sites. We further analyzed the surface accessibility of Spike proteins according to Cryo-EM and homolog-modeled structures, and available antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-1. The results showed that all 22 N-glycosylated sites of SARS-CoV-2 are modified by high-mannose type of N-glycans. MS/MS fragmentation clearly established the glycopeptide identities.

The latter provide a structural scaffold for viral replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) and help to sequester RTC components from recognition by cellular factors involved in antiviral host responses. There is increasing evidence that plus-strand RNA (+RNA) virus replication, including RO formation and virion morphogenesis, affects cellular lipid metabolism and critically depends on enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and processing. Here, we investigated the role of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in coronavirus replication using a low-molecular-weight nonpeptidic inhibitor, pyrrolidine-2 (Py-2). The inhibition of cPLA2 activity, which produces lysophospholipids (LPLs) by cleaving at the sn-2 position of phospholipids, had profound effects on viral RNA and protein accumulation in human coronavirus 229E-infected Huh-7 cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that DMV formation in infected cells was significantly reduced in the presence of the inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that (i) viral RTCs colocalized with LPL-containing membranes, (ii) cellular LPL concentrations were increased in coronavirus-infected cells, and (iii) this increase was diminished in the presence of the cPLA2 inhibitor Py-2. Py-2 also displayed antiviral activities against other viruses representing the Coronaviridae and Togaviridae families, while members of the Picornaviridae were not affected. Taken together, the study provides evidence that cPLA2 activity is critically involved in the replication of various +RNA virus families and may thus represent a candidate target for broad-spectrum antiviral drug development.IMPORTANCE Examples of highly conserved RNA virus proteins that qualify as drug targets for broad-spectrum antivirals remain scarce, resulting in increased efforts to identify and specifically inhibit cellular functions that are essential for the replication of RNA viruses belonging to different genera and families. The present study supports and extends previous conclusions that enzymes involved in cellular lipid metabolism may be tractable targets for broad-spectrum antivirals. We obtained evidence to show that a cellular phospholipase, cPLA2, which releases fatty acid from the sn-2 position of membrane-associated glycerophospholipids, is critically involved in coronavirus replication, most likely by producing lysophospholipids that are required to form the specialized membrane compartments in which viral RNA synthesis takes place. The importance of this enzyme in coronavirus replication and DMV formation is supported by several lines of evidence, including confocal and electron microscopy, viral replication, and lipidomics studies of coronavirus-infected cells treated with a highly specific cPLA2 inhibitor.","output":"Inhibition of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 Impairs an Early Step of Coronavirus Replication in Cell Culture."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing reduces the risk of people becoming infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). When passengers are transported from an airport terminal to an airplane using apron buses, safe social distancing during pandemic times reduces the capacity of the apron buses and has led to the practice of airlines keeping the middle seats of the airplanes unoccupied. This article adapts classical boarding methods so that they may be used with social distancing and apron buses. We conduct stochastic simulation experiments to assess nine adaptations of boarding methods according to four performance metrics. Three of the metrics are related to the risk of the virus spreading to passengers during boarding. The fourth metric is the time to complete boarding of the two-door airplane when apron bus transport passengers to the airplane. Our experiments assume that passengers advancing to their airplane seats are separated by an aisle social distance of 1 m or 2 m. Numerical results indicate that the three variations (adaptations) of the Reverse pyramid method are the best candidates for airlines to consider in this socially distanced context. The particular adaptation to use depends on an airlines relative preference for having short boarding times versus a reduced risk of later boarding passengers passing (and thereby possibly infecting) previously seated window seat passengers. If an airline considers the latter risk to be unimportant, then the Reverse pyramid C Spread method would be the best choice because it provides the fastest time to board the airplane and is tied for the best values for the other two health risk measures.","output":"Evaluation of Boarding Methods Adapted for Social Distancing When Using Apron Buses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the spatial clustering of COVID-19 case fatality risks in the districts of Bangladesh and to explore the association of sociodemographic indicators with these risks. STUDY DESIGN: Ecological study. STUDY SETTING: Secondary data were collected for a total of 64 districts of Bangladesh. METHODS: The data for district-wise COVID-19 cases were collected from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh from March 2020 to June 2020. Socioeconomic and demographic data were collected from National Census Data, 2011. Retrospective spatial analysis was conducted based on district-wise COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh. Global Morans I was adopted to find out the significance of the clusters. Furthermore, generalised linear model was conducted to find out the association of COVID-19 cases with sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Total 87 054 COVID-19 cases were included in this study. The epidemic hotspots were distributed in the 11 most populous cities. The most likely clusters are primarily situated in the central, south-eastern and north-western regions of the country. High-risk clusters were found in Dhaka (Relative Risk (RR): 5.22), Narayanganj (RR: 2.70), Chittagong (RR: 1.69), Munshiganj (RR: 2.31) Coxs Bazar (RR: 1.63), Faridpur (RR: 1.65), Gazipur (RR: 1.33), Bogra (RR: 1.35), Khulna (RR: 1.22), Barishal (RR: 1.07) and Noakhali (RR: 1.06). Weekly progression of COVID-19 cases showed spatially clustered by Morans I statistics (p value ranging from 0.013 to 0.436). After fitting a Poisson linear model, we found a positive association of COVID-19 with floating population rate (RR=1.542, 95% CI 1.520 to 1.564), and urban population rate (RR=1.027, 95% CI 1.026 to 1.028).

This study aimed to compare the characteristics and treatment outcomes in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion relative to the existence or nonexistence of underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-two patients with acute basilar artery occlusion underwent multimodal endovascular therapy. All patients underwent stent-retriever thrombectomy as a first-line endovascular therapy. Patients with underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis underwent additional intracranial angioplasty and stent placement. The clinical and imaging characteristics and treatment outcomes were retrospectively analyzed and compared between patients with and without intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. RESULTS Underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis was identified at the occlusion site in 15 patients (24.1%). Occlusion in the proximal segment of the basilar artery was more common in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (60% versus 6.4%, P < .001), whereas occlusion in the distal segment was more common in those without it (91.5% versus 26.7%, P < .001). Bilateral thalamic infarction on a pretreatment DWI was less common in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (0% versus 27.7%, P = .027) compared with those without it. There were no significant differences in the rates of successful revascularization, favorable outcome, symptomatic hemorrhage, and mortality between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis was not uncommon in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion. The occlusion segment of the basilar artery and the presence or absence of bilateral thalamic infarction on a pretreatment DWI might be helpful for predicting underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion.

India, also emerged as the vaccine powerhouse producer, initiating the worlds one of the largest vaccination drives since January 16, 2021, with two vaccines named, BBV-152(COVAXINTM) and AZD1222 (COVISHIELDTM). Breakthrough cases are reported from all over the globe for all kinds of vaccines. This is the investigation report into the outbreak of breakthrough covid infections at one of the medical colleges in Rural India unraveled in early October 2021. This report underscores the role of covid appropriate behavior along with vaccination and the role of IgG in evaluating immunity generated through vaccination. Objective: The study objective was to 1. Clinically characterize the recent breakthrough infection of Covid-19 (SARS- CoV-2) infection among (students) vaccinated in BKL Walawalkar Rural Medical College. 2. To evaluate Covid appropriate behavior, (CAB) in cases and controls. 3. To evaluate Covid anti spike IgG in the cases in comparison with the control Methods A total of 74 students studying at BKL Walawalkar Rural Medical College and vaccinated for Covid were included in the study. RT-PCR diagnosis was done from 5 to 10 October 2021. The breakthrough infection in the cases was characterized using self-assessment questionnaires in comparison to the controls. The cases were assessed clinically and also using biochemical parameters. Both cases and controls were also assessed for their adherence to covid appropriate behavior using a separate semi-quantitative questionnaire and scoring system. Results In our study, out of the total subjects, 50% of Covaxin recipients had experienced vaccine breakthrough infection and 20% of Covishield recipients experienced breakthrough infection. Also, 6 out of the 35 cases were asymptomatic, and the rest were either having mild symptoms. None of them required any hospitalization or O2 therapy. The CAB score was lower in the cases when compared to controls. All the vaccine recipients are seroconvert. Anti-spike IgG antibodies titers are dynamic over time and across the clinically distinct groups. Irrespective of varying IgG titer, the vaccine protects against severity and possibly mortality. Conclusion The need for better awareness of covid appropriate methods as an alternative to and additive to vaccination is necessary to control the transmission of Covid infection and decrease the disease severity. Vaccines are effective against preventing severe disease and possibly mortality. The use of serum anti-spike covid IgG is restricted to know the status of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion.

To add to this, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened delivery of TB care across the globe. As a global community, we have committed to end the TB epidemic by 2030. The World Health Organization has framed a strategy to achieve this goal which consists of three pillars namely i) integrated patient-centred care and prevention, ii) bold policies and systems and iii) intensified research and innovation. An analysis of the performance of national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) across the globe against the ten priority indicators recommended for monitoring the end TB strategy show that there are huge gaps at every step in the cascade of care of TB patients. In our view, these gaps reflect suboptimal implementation of existing strategies known to be efficacious and operational research (OR) is one of the best available tools to plug the gaps. In this paper, we define what operational research is and how it differs from other kinds of research. We also share our views and experiences about how operational research can be used by NTPs to identify implementation gaps and their reasons, and develop and test possible solutions - which are then integrated to make changes to policy and practice and eventually improve programme outcomes. OR can be defined as research into interventions, strategies and tools which produces practical useable knowledge that can be used to enhance the quality, coverage, effectiveness and efficiency of disease control programmes, health services or health systems in which the research is conducted. The key steps in integrating operational research in the NTPs include: i) securing political commitment reflected by inclusion of OR in the national strategic plans of NTPs and earmarked funding, ii) having a critical mass of dedicated and trained human resources in OR within the NTP, iii) setting research priorities and steering the direction of research in the country, iv) using output-oriented models of capacity building such as the Structured Operational Research Training Initiative (SORT IT) model and building communities of practice, v) harnessing existing capacity in the country by forging partnerships with academia, vi) NTP-led nationwide, multicentre OR studies, vii) providing access to anonymized patient and programme surveillance data, vii) creating a forum for evidence dissemination and fostering policy change and ix) monitoring and accountability. In conclusion, ending the TB epidemic will not be possible without new tools (diagnostics, drugs, vaccines) and a multi-sectoral response involving stakeholders beyond the health ministry, including private providers, patients and communities. However, timely conduct of operational research to fine-tune programme implementation and ensuring proper deployment of new tools will be equally crucial to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions and ultimately contribute towards ending TB.","output":"What is operational research and how can national tuberculosis programmes in low- and middle-income countries use it to end TB?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The performance of a full-scale (500 m(3)) sulfidogenic synthesis gas fed gas-lift reactor treating metal- and sulfate-rich wastewater was investigated over a period of 128 weeks. After startup, the reactor had a high methanogenic activity of 46 Nm(3)h(?1). Lowering the carbon dioxide feed rate during the first 6 weeks gradually lowered the methane production rate. Between weeks 8 and 93, less than 1% of the hydrogen supplied was used for methanogenesis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments showed that the archaeal community decreased in diversity but did not disappear completely. After the carbon dioxide feed rate increased in week 88, the methane production rate also increased, confirming that methane production was carbon dioxide limited. Even though lowering the carbon dioxide feed appeared to affect part of the sulfate-reducing community, it did not prevent achieving the desired rates of sulfate reduction. The average sulfate conversion rate was 181 kg?h(?1) for the first 92 weeks. After 92 weeks, the sulfate input rate was increased and from week 94 to 128, the average weekly sulfate conversion rate was 295 kgh(?1) (SD  87). Even higher sulfate conversion rates of up to 400 kgh(?1) could be sustained for weeks 120C128.

Technological change is central to development, but it is a public good that the market economy does not provide efficiently. Providing it requires the implementation of public policies aimed at technological innovation and dissemination. Reducing the technological gradient is therefore a major part of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Pan American Health Organizations 2018-2030 Sustainable Health Agenda for the Americas.

Clinical assessments for hallucinations and delusions were completed for 191 adults (95% of the original sample) in the follow-up study. Elevated perceptual aberrations at age 18 predicted increased levels of hallucinations, delusions, and total psychotic symptoms in midlife as well as psychotic illness. The associations between baseline perceptual aberrations and later psychotic symptoms were not accounted for by general nonspecific psychopathology factors such as anxiety or depression present at age 18. Early detection of subtle, nonpsychotic forms of perceptual disturbance may aid in identifying individuals at increased risk for nonaffective psychosis outcomes in adulthood.

Thus, a pooling approachwhere samples are mixed and tested as single poolsis an attractive strategy to rapidly detect APO-infected in these epidemiological scenarios. Materials and Methods: This study was done at different pandemic periods between May 28 and August 31 2020 in 153 closed or semi-closed institutions in the Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina). We setup pooling strategy in two stages: first a pool-testing followed by selective individual-testing according to pool results. Samples included in negative pools were presumed as negative, while samples from positive pools were re-tested individually for positives identification. Results: Sensitivity in 5-sample or 10-sample pools was adequate since only 2 Ct values were increased with regard to single tests on average. Concordance between 5-sample or 10-sample pools and individual-testing was 100% in the Ct  36.

An indirect immunofluoresence assay (IFA) and an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) used for detection of anti-C. burnetii antibodies in humans were adapted, verified for use on feline serum, and compared. Cat serum samples (n=712) were tested with IFA from four subpopulations [cattery-confined breeding cats, pet cats, feral cats and shelter cats]. The proportions of seropositive cats were; cattery-confined breeding cats (35/376, 9.3%), pets (2/198, 1%), feral cats (0/50), shelter cats (0/88). The significant variables in C. burnetii seropositivity were cattery-confined breeding cat subpopulation and sterilisation status, with infected cats 17.1 (CI 4.2-70.2; P<0.001) times more likely to be cattery-confined breeding cats and 6.00 (CI 2.13-16.89; P<0.001) times more likely to be entire than sterilised.

Materials and MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study at the University Hospital Centre Split, Croatia, that included 245 COVID-positive individuals that died from April 8, 2020, to January 25, 2021. From the hospital database, we extracted data on their blood groups, demographics, and pre-existing comorbidities. To compare findings with the general population, we used information from collected blood group donations (n = 101357) and statistical reports of non-COVID deaths from 2019 (n = 4968). ResultsThe proportion of males was significantly higher in analyzed subjects than in non- COVID deaths from 2019 (63.7% vs. 48.9%, P < 0.001), while the proportion of older individuals did not differ (P = 0.8). The most common pre-existing diseases were hypertension (59.6%), diabetes (37.1%), heart failure (28.8%), digestive disorder (26.5%), and solid tumor (21.6%). The ABO distribution in the deceased and donors group showed statistically significant differences, with the higher prevalence of A/AB group and lower prevalence of 0, but with individual differences significant only for AB and non-AB groups. There was a significantly reduced proportion of females within the deceased with group 0 (P = 0.014) and a higher proportion of AB individuals with coronary heart disease (P = 0.024), while other differences were not significant. ConclusionThe study confirmed a higher risk of death in male individuals. The lower proportion of type 0 in deceased individuals was more pronounced in females, implying that group 0 is not necessarily an independent protective factor. Among analyzed comorbidities, coronary heart disease was identified as a potential risk factor for AB individuals.","output":"ABO and Rh blood groups, demographics, and comorbidities in COVID-19 related deaths: a retrospective study in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic is not new in the history of humanity.

Veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the U.S. use real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for animal testing, and many are certified for testing human samples, so ensuring laboratories have sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 testing methods is a critical component of the pandemic response. In 2020, the FDA Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN) led the first round of an Inter-Laboratory Comparison (ILC) Exercise to help laboratories evaluate their existing real-time RT-PCR methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2. The ILC1 results indicated that all participating laboratories were able to detect the viral RNA spiked in buffer and PrimeStore molecular transport medium (MTM). The current ILC (ILC2) aimed to extend ILC1 by evaluating analytical sensitivity and specificity of the methods used by participating laboratories to detect three SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta)). ILC2 samples were prepared with RNA at levels between 10 to 10,000 copies per 50 L MTM. Fifty-seven sets of results from 45 laboratories were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed according to the principles of ISO 16140-2:2016. The results showed that over 95% of analysts detected the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in MTM at 500 copies or higher for all three variants. In addition, 81% and 92% of the analysts achieved a Level of Detection (LOD95eff. vol.) below 20 copies in the assays with nucleocapsid markers N1 and N2, respectively. The analytical specificity of the evaluated methods was over 99%.

Health systems are being strengthened and programs are being developed to address this burden, often building on HIV care strategies and infrastructure or through integrated care models. HIV remains a stigmatized condition and the role of HIV stigma in the provision of NCD care is not well understood. METHODS We conducted a scoping literature review of both peer reviewed and grey literature to identify evidence of the role of HIV stigma in the NCD-care continuum (prevention, diagnosis, care seeking, retention in care, and adherence to treatment of NCDs). We searched PsychInfo and Pubmed and conducted additional searches of programmatic reports and conference abstracts. Included studies were published in English within the past decade and examined HIV-related stigma as it relates to NCD-care or to integrated NCD-and HIV-care programs. RESULTS Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Findings suggest: fear of disclosure, internalized shame and embarrassment, and negative past experiences with or negative perceptions of health care providers negatively influence engagement with NCD care; HIV stigma can adversely affect not only people living with HIV in need of NCD care, but all NCD patients; some NCDs are stigmatized in their own right or because of their association with HIV; integrating NCD and HIV care can both reduce stigma for people living with HIV and a present a barrier to access for NCD care. CONCLUSION Due to the dearth of available research and the variability in initial findings, further research on the role of HIV stigma in the NCD-care continuum for people living with HIV is necessary.

Objective: To evaluate the association between receipt of unemployment insurance, including a $600/wk federal supplement between April and July, and food insecurity among people who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used difference-in-differences analysis of longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of US adults residing in low- and middle-income households (ie, <$75a?000 annual income) who lost work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were from 15 waves of the Understanding Coronavirus in America study (conducted April 1 to November 11, 2020). Exposure: Receipt of unemployment insurance benefits. Main Outcomes and Measures: Food insecurity and eating less due to financial constraints, assessed every 2 weeks by self-report. Results: Of 2319 adults living in households earning less than $75a?000 annually and employed in February 2020, 1119 (48.3%) experienced unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic and made up our main sample (588 [53.6%] White individuals; mean [SD] age 45 [15] years; 732 [65.4%] women). Of those who lost employment, 415 (37.1%) reported food insecurity and 437 (39.1%) reported eating less due to financial constraints in 1 or more waves of the study. Among people who lost work, receipt of unemployment insurance was associated with a 4.3 (95% CI, 1.8-6.9) percentage point decrease in food insecurity (a 35.0% relative reduction) and a 5.7 (95% CI, 3.0-8.4) percentage point decrease in eating less due to financial constraints (a 47.8% relative reduction). Decreases in food insecurity were larger with the $600/wk supplement and for individuals who were receiving larger amounts of unemployment insurance.

Materials and methods. Standardized valid psycho-diagnostic methods, the author's questionnaire (A. Hudimova, 2021), correlation and factor analyses were used to identify young web users' patterns of social media involvement during the forced self-isolation. Results. The results show that during the global COVID-19 pandemic, young web users give preference for passive social media use rather than for communication. The obtained results showed an expansion in the time spent via social media by young web users. It was found that the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by the participants' experience of negative emotions and fears of the unknown (r = .204;p &lt;.01). It is substantiated that increasing immersion of young web users in social media is a kind of strategy to escape from bad thoughts (r = .271;p &lt;.01). Significantly, it is stated that uncontrolled use of social media causes sleep disorders during isolation (r = .444;p &lt;.01). Conclusions. The study proves that young people spend almost all day online due to the obsessive pattern of social media involvement and/or procrastination, which often provokes withdrawal syndrome upon the attempt to distract from them. The lack of controlled time spending on social media during self-isolation provokes an exacerbation of anxiety, apathy, depressed mood, and a sense of isolation from social reality.

To understand the host response to this pathogen, we investigated the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from SARS patients, and compared with healthy controls. RESULTS: The number of differentially expressed genes was found to be 186 under stringent filtering criteria of microarray data analysis. Several genes were highly up-regulated in patients with SARS, such as, the genes coding for Lactoferrin, S100A9 and Lipocalin 2. The real-time PCR method verified the results of the gene array analysis and showed that those genes that were up-regulated as determined by microarray analysis were also found to be comparatively up-regulated by real-time PCR analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This differential gene expression profiling of PBMCs from patients with SARS strongly suggests that the response of SARS affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response, rather than a specific immune response against a viral infection, as we observed a complete lack of cytokine genes usually triggered during a viral infection. Our study shows for the first time how the immune system responds to the SARS infection, and opens new possibilities for designing new diagnostics and treatments for this new life-threatening disease.","output":"Expression profile of immune response genes in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 130 million people are in constant need of humanitarian assistance due to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and conflicts, among other factors. These health crises can compromise the resilience of healthcare systems, which are essential for achieving the health objectives of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). During a humanitarian health crisis, rapid and informed decision making is required. This is often challenging due to information scarcity, limited resources, and strict time constraints. Moreover, the traditional approach to digital health development, which involves a substantial requirement analysis, a feasibility study, and deployment of technology, is ill-suited for many crisis contexts. The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies and social media platforms in the past decade, such as Twitter, has created a new paradigm of massive information and misinformation, in which new technologies need to be developed to aid rapid decision making during humanitarian health crises. OBJECTIVE Humanitarian health crises increasingly require the analysis of massive amounts of information produced by different sources, such as social media content, and, hence, they are a prime case for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help identify relevant information and make it actionable. To identify challenges and opportunities for using AI in humanitarian health crises, we reviewed the literature on the use of AI techniques to process social media. METHODOLOGY We performed a narrative literature review aimed at identifying examples of the use of AI in humanitarian health crises. Our search strategy was designed to get a broad overview of the different applications of AI in a humanitarian health crisis and their challenges. A total of 1459 articles were screened, and 24 articles were included in the final analysis. RESULTS Successful case studies of AI applications in a humanitarian health crisis have been reported, such as for outbreak detection. A commonly shared concern in the reviewed literature is the technical challenge of analyzing large amounts of data in real time. Data interoperability, which is essential to data sharing, is also a barrier with regard to the integration of online and traditional data sources. Human and organizational aspects that might be key factors for the adoption of AI and social media remain understudied. There is also a publication bias toward high-income countries, as we identified few examples in low-income countries. Further, we did not identify any examples of certain types of major crisis, such armed conflicts, in which misinformation might be more common. CONCLUSIONS The feasibility of using AI to extract valuable information during a humanitarian health crisis is proven in many cases. There is a lack of research on how to integrate the use of AI into the work-flow and large-scale deployments of humanitarian aid during a health crisis.","output":"Humanitarian health computing using artificial intelligence and social media: A narrative literature review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the importance of reinforced concrete structures for modern society, damage assessment during the entire life-cycle of such structures has become a special interest in non-destructive testing. Using embedded ultrasound sensors in combination with other measurement methods, numerical modeling and self-made data collectors, tailored specifically for monitoring tasks, the German research group DFG FOR CoDA aims to investigate and develop novel methods for damage detection and rapid model updating in reinforced concrete structures. In the first stage of the project, besides the development of custom-built, low-cost data collectors, ultrasonic transducers are embedded in a large, reinforced concrete specimen on a BAM test site near Berlin. In this experiment, the influence of changing environmental conditions (mainly temperature) on the ultrasound signal is investigated using coda-wave interferometry. The results show a correlation between changes in temperature and ultrasonic velocity. Such changes must be taken into consideration in a long-term monitoring setup to distinguish between reversible and permanent changes. By correcting the data using a linear relation between concrete temperature and velocity change to remove the seasonal trends and by low-pass filtering the data to remove daily variations can remove most of the temperature influence on the ultrasound measurements.","output":"Towards Monitoring of Concrete Structures with Embedded Ultrasound Sensors and Coda Waves C First Results of DFG for CoDA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate runoff forecasting plays a vital role in water resource management. Therefore, various forecasting models have been proposed in the literature. Among them, the decomposition-based models have proved their superiority in runoff series forecasting. However, most of the models simulate each decomposition sub-signals separately without considering the potential correlation information. A neoteric hybrid runoff forecasting model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), convolution neural networks (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) called VMD-CNN-LSTM, is proposed to improve the runoff forecasting performance further. The two-dimensional matrix containing both the time delay and correlation information among sub-signals decomposing by VMD is firstly applied to the CNN. The feature of the input matrix is then extracted by CNN and delivered to LSTM with more potential information. The experiment performed on monthly runoff data investigated from Huaxian and Xianyang hydrological stations at Wei River, China, demonstrates the VMD-superiority of CNN-LSTM to the baseline models, and robustness and stability of the forecasting of the VMD-CNN-LSTM for different leading times.","output":"Runoff forecasting model based on variational mode decomposition and artificial neural networks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the links between corruption and compliance with social distancing during COVID-19 pandemic in America Both theory and empirical eviden","output":"Shelter in Place?

However, with increasing levels of immunity through vaccination and natural infection the evolutionary pressure will switch towards immune escape. Here we present phylogenetic relationships and lineage dynamics within England (a country with high levels of immunity), as inferred from a random community sample of individuals who provided a self-administered throat and nose swab for rt-PCR testing as part of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. From 9 to 27 September 2021 (round 14) and 19 October to 5 November 2021 (round 15), all lineages sequenced within REACT-1 were Delta or a Delta sub-lineage with 44 unique lineages identified. The proportion of the original Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was found to be increasing between September and November 2021, which may reflect an increasing number of sub-lineages which have yet to be identified. The proportion of B.1.617.2 was greatest in London, which was further identified as a region with an increased level of genetic diversity. The Delta sub-lineage AY.4.2 was found to be robustly increasing in proportion, with a reproduction number 15% (8%, 23%) greater than its parent and most prevalent lineage, AY.4. Both AY.4.2 and AY.4 were found to be geographically clustered in September but this was no longer the case by late October/early November, with only the lineage AY.6 exhibiting clustering towards the South of England. Though no difference in the viral load based on cycle threshold (Ct) values was identified, a lower proportion of those infected with AY.4.2 had symptoms for which testing is usually recommend (loss or change of sense of taste, loss or change of sense of smell, new persistent cough, fever), compared to AY.4 (p = 0.026). The evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the mutation rate, was found to be slowing down during the study period, with AY.4.2 further found to have a reduced mutation rate relative to AY.4. As SARS-CoV-2 moves towards endemicity and new variants emerge, genomic data obtained from random community samples can augment routine surveillance data without the potential biases introduced due to higher sampling rates of symptomatic individuals.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 lineage dynamics in England from September to November 2021: high diversity of Delta sub-lineages and increased transmissibility of AY.4.2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent events involving the global coronavirus pandemic have focused attention on vaccination strategies. While tremendous advances have been made in subcutaneous and intramuscular vaccines during this time, one area that has lagged in implementation is mucosal immunization. Mucosal immunization provides several potential advantages over subcutaneous and intramuscular routes, including protection from localized infection at the site of entry, clearance of organisms on mucosal surfaces, induction of long-term immunity through establishment of central and tissue resident memory cells and the ability to shape regulatory responses. Despite these advantages, significant barriers remain to achieving effective mucosal immunization. The epithelium itself provides many obstacles to immunization and the activation of immune recognition and effector pathways that lead to mucosal immunity has been difficult to achieve.

We aim to inform how best to maintain effective KE practices and processes in a digital-first world. Interpersonal trust and relationships are pivotal to effective knowledge exchange; thus, removing these dimensions risks losing aspects of social learning, informal and meaningful discussions, and personal connections that affect how we interpret and respond to subtle affective and social cues. For KE practitioners, lack of in-person interactions risks internal KE coordination and relevance of KE work, and diminished ability to predict and respond to user needs. However, the accelerated digital adoption has increased reach and accessibility for diverse people to exchange knowledge, and enables more frequent and rapid response to issues and events by virtually gathering diverse people almost instantly. The acceleration in digital innovation and culture has thus resulted in new tools and diversified approaches for the KE toolbox to inform decisions and practices. The long-term sustainability and effectiveness of digital KE depend on two interconnected factors: addressing the persistence of the digital divide and peoples abilities to make and maintain meaningful social connections in the absence of regular face-to-face contact. We thus offer three considerations to guide KE efforts and initiative in a digital-first world: (1) consider both digital divide and equity; (2) revisit user needs and preferences for KE to address the diversity of users, and (3) leverage the diversification of KE approaches and innovations.","output":"Promises and pitfalls of digital knowledge exchange resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused significant health and economic havoc around the globe. One of the early agents targeted for repurposing to treat and prevent COVID-19 was hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, HCQ is evaluated for its potential role in decreasing mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and medRxiv databases using combinations of the terms COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, hydroxychloroquine, and mortality.

Studies were excluded if they were of poor methodological quality, were not based in the inpatient setting, or did not have available data to assess the primary outcome of death between patients treated with HCQ versus standard of care. Once the final dataset was compiled, a meta-analysis using the random-effects model was performed. Our search identified 14 studies involving 24,780 patients of whom 12,707 patients were on HCQ alone or in combination with other adjuvant therapies.

We used next-generation RNA sequencing and [(18)F]FDG PET-CT data, collected at diagnosis, week 4, and week 24, from 75 successfully cured PTB patients, with the [(18)F]FDG activity as a surrogate for lung inflammation. Our linear mixed-effects models required that for each individual the slope of the line of [(18)F]FDG data in the outcome and the slope of the peripheral blood transcript expression data correlate, i.e., the slopes of the outcome and explanatory variables had to be similar. Of 10,295 genes that changed as a function of time, we identified 639 genes whose expression profiles correlated with decreasing [(18)F]FDG uptake levels in the lungs. Gene enrichment over-representation analysis revealed that numerous biological processes were significantly enriched in the 639 genes, including several well known in TB transcriptomics such as platelet degranulation and response to interferon gamma, thus validating our novel approach. Others not previously associated with TB pathobiology included smooth muscle contraction, a set of pathways related to mitochondrial function and cell death, as well as a set of pathways connecting transcription, translation and vesicle formation. We observed up-regulation in genes associated with B cells, and down-regulation in genes associated with platelet activation. We found 254 transcription factor binding sites to be enriched among the 639 gene promoters. In conclusion, we demonstrated that of the 10,295 gene expression changes in peripheral blood, only a subset of 639 genes correlated with inflammation in the lungs, and the enriched pathways provide a description of the biology of resolution of lung inflammation as detectable in peripheral blood. Surprisingly, resolution of PTB inflammation is positively correlated with smooth muscle contraction and, extending our previous observation on mitochondrial genes, shows the presence of mitochondrial stress.

This creates moral distress and injury due to constraints they have encountered, such as limited resources. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to develop and show the feasibility of digital platforms (a virtual reality and a mobile platform) to understand the causes and ultimately reduce the moral distress of health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This will be a prospective, single cohort, pre- and posttest study examining the effect of a brief informative video describing moral distress on perceptual, psychological, and physiological indicators of stress and decision-making during a scenario known to potentially elicit moral distress. To accomplish this, we have developed a virtual reality simulation that will be used before and after the digital intervention for monitoring short-term impacts. The simulation involves an intensive care unit setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, and participants will be placed in morally challenging situations. The participants will be engaged in an educational intervention at the individual, team, and organizational levels. During each test, data will be collected for (1) physiological measures of stress and after each test, data will be collected regarding (2) thoughts, feelings and behaviors during a morally challenging situation, and (3) perceptual estimates of psychological stress. In addition, participants will continue to be monitored for moral distress and other psychological stresses for 8 weeks through our Digital intervention/intelligence Group mobile platform. Finally, a comparison will be conducted using machine learning and biostatistical techniques to analyze the short- and long-term impacts of the virtual reality intervention. RESULTS: The study was funded in November 2020 and received research ethics board approval in March 2021. The study is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This project is a proof-of-concept integration to demonstrate viability over 6 months and guide future studies to develop these state-of-the-art technologies to help frontline health care workers work in complex moral contexts. In addition, the project will develop innovations that can be used for future pandemics and in other contexts prone to producing moral distress and injury. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using digital platforms to understand the continuum of moral distress that can lead to moral injury. Demonstration of feasibility will lead to future studies to examine the efficacy of digital platforms to reduce moral distress.

The area under the curve (95% CI) for distinguishing septic shock from NIC using CitH3 was 0.76 (0.65C0.86). CitH3 was positively correlated with PAD2 and PAD4 concentrations and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Scores [total score (r = 0.36, p < 0.0001)]. The serum levels of CitH3 at 24 h (p < 0.01) and 48 h (p < 0.05) were significantly higher in the septic patients that did not survive. CONCLUSION: CitH3 is increased in patients with septic shock. Its serum concentrations correlate with disease severity and prognosis, which may yield vital insights into the pathophysiology of sepsis.

We also investigated the associations between mask wearing hesitancy and various factors. METHODS: We surveyed a sample (convenience sampling) of 5 groups of people: general population, people with epilepsy, people with diabetes mellitus (DM), people with cardiac problems, and people with psychiatric problems. The survey included 4 general questions (age, sex, education, and medical/psychiatric problem) and 4 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-specific questions (contracting COVID-19, relatives with COVID-19, wearing a face mask while in crowded places, and the frequency of daily hand washings). RESULTS: A total of 582 people (153 people with epilepsy, 127 patients with DM, 98 people with cardiac problems, 96 patients with psychiatric disorders, and 108 healthy individuals) participated. Twenty-eight (4.8%) people expressed that they do not wear a face mask when at crowded places. A lower education and less frequent daily hand washings had associations with mask wearing hesitancy.

Collecting properly randomized data, however, can be challenging, so modern statistical methods, including propensity score reweighting, aim to enable valid inferences when random sampling is not feasible. We put forth an approach for making inferences based on available data from a source population that may differ in composition in unknown ways from an eventual target population. Whereas propensity scoring requires a separate estimation procedure for each different target population, we show how to build a single estimator, based on source data alone, that allows for efficient and accurate estimates on any downstream target data. We demonstrate, theoretically and empirically, that our target-independent approach to inference, which we dub universal adaptability, is competitive with target-specific approaches that rely on propensity scoring. Our approach builds on a surprising connection between the problem of inferences in unspecified target populations and the multicalibration problem, studied in the burgeoning field of algorithmic fairness. We show how the multicalibration framework can be employed to yield valid inferences from a single source population across a diverse set of target populations.","output":"Universal adaptability: Target-independent inference that competes with propensity scoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, as the number of patients increases.

High-volume evacuators (HVEs) and extraoral vacuum aspirators (EOVAs) reduce such particles. However, there is limited data on their efficacy. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of HVE and EOVA in reducing aerosols and droplets during ultrasonic scaling procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three ultrasonic scaling simulations were conducted on mannequins: 1. saliva ejector (SE) was used alone (control); 2. SE was used in combination with HVE; and 3. SE was used in combination with HVE and EOVA. Paper filters were placed on the operator's and assistant's face shields and bodies, and the contamination of aerosols and droplets was measured by counting blue spots on the paper filters. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All data were analyzed for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The differences between each method were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA, followed by a posthoc test. The differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05 RESULT: Using HVE and EOVA reduced aerosols and droplets better than using SE alone or SE and HVE: the posthoc test for contamination revealed a significant difference (p < 0.01). The assistant was subjected to greater contamination than the operator during all three ultrasonic scaling procedures. CONCLUSION The usage of HVE and EOVA significantly reduced aerosols and droplets compared with using SE solely. Using these techniques together could prevent the transmission of airborne disease during dental cleanings, especially COVID-19. Further studies of aerosol-reducing devices are still needed to ensure the safety of dental workers and patients.","output":"The Efficacy of High-Volume Evacuators and Extraoral Vacuum Aspirators in Reducing Aerosol and Droplet in Ultrasonic Scaling Procedures during the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 can result in severe lung injury.

Monocytes and macrophages are the most enriched immune cell types in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and appear to have a central role in the pathogenicity of the disease. These cells adapt their metabolism upon infection and become highly glycolytic, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication. The infection triggers mitochondrial ROS production, which induces stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) and consequently promotes glycolysis.

While other causes of pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI) respond to fluid infusion, HRS does not. HRS incidence is 5% in children with chronic liver conditions before liver transplantation. Type 1 HRS is an acute and rapidly progressive form that often develops after a precipitating factor, including gastrointestinal bleeding or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, while type 2 is considered a slowly progressive form of kidney failure that often occurs spontaneously in chronic ascites settings. HRS pathogenesis is multifactorial. Cirrhosis causes portal hypertension; therefore, stasis and release of vasodilator substances occur in the hepatic vascular bed, leading to vasodilatation of splanchnic arteries and systemic hypotension. Many mechanisms seem to work together to cause this imbalance: splanchnic vasodilatation; vasoactive mediators; hyperdynamic circulation states and subsequent cardiac dysfunction; neuro-hormonal mechanisms; changes in sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, and vasopressin. In patients with AKI and cirrhosis, fluid expansion therapy needs to be initiated as soon as possible and nephrotoxic drugs discontinued. Once HRS is diagnosed, pharmacological treatment with vasoconstrictors, mainly terlipressin plus albumin, should be initiated. If there is no response, other options can include surgical venous shunts and kidney replacement therapy. In this regard, extracorporeal liver support can be a bridge for liver transplantation, which remains as the ideal treatment.

Our study sought to explore patient perceptions of the influence of SDOH on their COVID-19 infection experience and COVID-19 transmission within their communities. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study of patients in a North Carolina health care systems registry who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 2020 through February 2021. All patients addresses across six counties served were geo-referenced and analyzed by Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify population-dense outbreaks of COVID-19 (hotspots). Spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed to identify census area clusters of white, Black and Hispanic populations, based on the 2019 American Community Survey dataset. Patients were identified by a randomized computer-generated sampling method. After informed consent, patients participated in semi-structured phone interviews in English or Spanish based on patient preference by trained bilingual researchers. Each interview was evaluated using a combination of deductive and inductive content analysis to determine prevalent themes related to COVID-19 knowledge and diagnosis, disease experience, and the impact of SDOH. Results: The 10 patients interviewed from our COVID-19 hotspots were of equal distribution by sex, and predominantly Black (70%), ages 22-70 years (IQR 45-62 years), and presented to the ED for evaluation (70%). The respondents were more frequently publicly insured (50% medicaid/medicare;vs 30% uninsured;vs 20% private). The interviews demonstrated themes surrounding the experience and impact of COVID-19. The perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 and knowledge of how to prevent infection varied greatly among our sample, and could be in part explained by SDOH such as their occupation, living conditions and mode of transportation. The experiences of COVID-19 testing, diagnosis, isolation and medical treatment were most influenced by the timing of infection in relation to the study period. For example, in the early months of the pandemic, the knowledge of isolation requirements and available support systems seemed to have negatively impacted the ability to isolate and follow public health guidance, as well as the support mechanisms provided by employers during this period. Communication of infection status once diagnosed varied greatly, with some voicing feelings of shame, and others advocating for sharing of infection experiences to change community behaviors. Suggestions for how to improve the COVID-19 response included improving communication and enforcing public health guidelines, including raising awareness for vulnerable populations on topics like expected symptoms, financial support, increasing testing, and vaccination delivery.

According to ambidexterity theory, whether they are successful in this primarily depends on their leaders and how they manage the tension between the use of current knowledge (exploitation) and the search for new knowledge (exploration). Through unique top-down and bottom-up pathways, they thus influence the innovation outcome of a school. However, it is so far unclear whether these assumptions are correct. Using data from a panel of principals who are representative of Germany and were surveyed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we therefore investigate if and how school leaders adapted to the turbulent environment caused by the pandemic and evaluate the extent to which this had an impact on their schools innovations in teaching and instruction. The results demonstrate that principals exploration activities increased markedly during the pandemic, while their exploitation activities decreased noticeably. Further, a focus on the use and refinement of existing knowledge in comparatively predictable (pre-COVID-19) environments harmed principals readiness to explore new knowledge in increasingly uncertain environments. Nevertheless, exploitation had positive consequences for the innovativeness of schools, and exploration goes along with more radical innovations in teaching and instruction. Our research suggests that schools that innovatively addressed the COVID-19 pandemic had school leaders who were able to quickly shift between the two modes of exploitation and exploration. A capacity to transition seamlessly between these modes of thinking and working thus appears to be vital for the longevity of schools.","output":"Innovating teaching and instruction in turbulent times: The dynamics of principals exploration and exploitation activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To analyze and predict the effect of coronavirus infection on hematopoietic system and potential intervention drugs, and explore their significance for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS The gene expression omnibus (GEO) database was used to screen the whole genome expression data related with coronavirus infection. The R language package was used for differential expression analysis and KEGG/GO enrichment analysis. The core genes were screened by PPI network analysis using STRING online analysis website. Then the self-developed apparent precision therapy prediction platform (EpiMed) was used to analyze diseases, drugs and related target genes. RESULTS A database in accordance with the criteria was found, which was derived from SARS coronavirus. A total of 3606 differential genes were screened, including 2148 expression up-regulated genes and 1458 expression down-regulated genes. GO enrichment mainly related with viral infection, hematopoietic regulation, cell chemotaxis, platelet granule content secretion, immune activation, acute inflammation, etc. KEGG enrichment mainly related with hematopoietic function, coagulation cascade reaction, acute inflammation, immune reaction, etc. Ten core genes such as PTPRC, ICAM1, TIMP1, CXCR5, IL-1B, MYC, CR2, FSTL1, SOX1 and COL3A1 were screened by protein interaction network analysis. Ten drugs with potential intervention effects, including glucocorticoid, TNF- inhibitor, salvia miltiorrhiza, sirolimus, licorice, red peony, famciclovir, cyclosporine A, houttuynia cordata, fluvastatin, etc. were screened by EpiMed plotform. CONCLUSION SARS coronavirus infection can affect the hematopoietic system by changing the expression of a series of genes.

As novel variants emerge, understanding their likelihood of suppression by population antibody repertoires has become increasingly important. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 polyclonal antibody response in a large population of clinically well\\\\characterized patients after mild and severe COVID\\\\19 using a panel of microarrayed structurally folded and unfolded SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 proteins, as well as sequential peptides, spanning the surface spike protein (S) and the receptor\\\\binding domain (RBD) of the virus. RESULTS: S\\\\ and RBD\\\\specific antibody responses were dominated by immunoglobulin G (IgG), mainly IgG(1), and directed against structurally folded S and RBD and three distinct peptide epitopes in S2. The virus neutralization activity of patients sera was highly correlated with IgG antibodies specific for conformational but not sequential RBD epitopes and their ability to prevent RBD binding to its human receptor angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Twenty percent of patients selectively lacked RBD\\\\specific IgG. Only immunization with folded, but not with unfolded RBD, induced antibodies against conformational epitopes with high virus\\\\neutralizing activity. Conformational RBD epitopes required for protection do not seem to be altered in the currently emerging virus variants.

Here, we estimate the reduction in relative risk for confirmed infection and severe COVID-19 provided by the booster dose. Methods: 1,144,690 individuals aged 60y and older who were eligible for a booster dose were followed between July 30 and August 22, 2021. We defined dynamic cohorts where individuals initially belong to the 'non-booster' cohort, leave it when receiving the booster dose and join the 'booster' cohort 12 days later. Rates of infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes per person-days at risk were compared between the cohorts using Poisson regression, adjusting for possible confounding factors. Results: Twelve days or more after the booster dose we found an 11.4-fold (95% CI: [10.0, 12.9]) decrease in the relative risk of confirmed infection, and a >10-fold decrease in the relative risk of severe illness. Under a conservative sensitivity analysis, we find {approx}5-fold protection against confirmed infection.

Exuberant or dysregulated inflammation can impair gas exchange and underlies many instances of lung disease. An important driver of inflammation in the lung is the interferon (IFN) response. Type I IFNs are antiviral cytokines that induce a large range of proteins that impair viral replication in infected cells. This cell-intrinsic action plays a crucial role in protecting the lungs from spread of respiratory viruses. However, type I IFNs have also recently been found to be central to the initiation of lung inflammatory responses, by inducing recruitment and activation of immune cells. This helps control virus burden but can cause detrimental immunopathology and contribute to disease severity. Furthermore, there is now increasing evidence that type I IFNs are not only induced after viral infections but also after infection with bacteria and fungi. The pro-inflammatory function of type I IFNs in the lung opens up the possibility of immune modulation directed against this antiviral cytokine family.

An estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was achieved by screening an unselected cohort of pregnant women. Of interest was the number of unreported cases. METHODS: Upon admission to hospital, patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 by a specific real-time PCR and antibodies determined by a specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum by ELISA. The SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was estimated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method, the group comparison with Fischer's exact test. RESULTS: From 6 April to 13 May 2020, 234 pregnant women were admitted to the Department of Obstetrics. A total of 225 (96.2%) SARS-CoV-2 PCRs were carried out and all remained negative. Specific IgG antibodies were detected in one (0.6%) of 180 (76.9%) antibody tests performed. The interval estimate of the period prevalence thus results in a 95% confidence interval between 0-1.7%. For 96 households with children, the period prevalence is 0-3.8%, which does not differ from the 0-4.8% for 76 households without children (p=1.00). DISCUSSION: This is the first report on the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence of an unselected sample of pregnant women in Germany.

Moreover, survivors after the initial bleeding are often subject to secondary brain injuries and delayed cerebral ischemia, further increasing the risk of a poor outcome. In recent years, the reninCangiotensin system (RAS) has been proposed as a target pathway for therapeutic interventions after brain injury. The RAS is a complex system of biochemical reactions critical for several systemic functions, namely, inflammation, vascular tone, endothelial activation, water balance, fibrosis, and apoptosis. The RAS system is classically divided into a pro-inflammatory axis, mediated by angiotensin (Ang)-II and its specific receptor AT(1)R, and a counterbalancing system, presented in humans as Ang-(1C7) and its receptor, MasR. Experimental data suggest that upregulation of the Ang-(1C7)/MasR axis might be neuroprotective in numerous pathological conditions, namely, ischemic stroke, cognitive disorders, Parkinsons disease, and depression. In the presence of SAH, Ang-(1C7)/MasR neuroprotective and modulating properties could help reduce brain damage by acting on neuroinflammation, and through direct vascular and anti-thrombotic effects. Here we review the role of RAS in brain ischemia, with specific focus on SAH and the therapeutic potential of Ang-(1C7).","output":"Angiotensin-(1C7) as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study focuses on public attention to major events, which has become an important topic in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the background of the global transmission of COVID-19, this study discusses the relationship between information shock and sustainable development, which is rarely mentioned before. By developing an appropriate theoretical model, we discuss how the level of public attention changes over time and with the severity of events. Then we use data on the daily clicks on a popular Chinese medical website to indicate public attention to the pandemic. Our analysis shows that, in the first half of 2020, the level of public attention is closely related to the scale of domestic transmission. The marginal effect of the domestic cases in the first wave is 1% to 0.217%. After the pandemic was largely under control in China, people still followed the latest news, but the scale of public attention to regional transmission diminished. And when the pandemic quickly and severely worsened in other countries, people in China were very attentive, that is, public attention increased. The time interval of social reaction we calculate is fairly stable, with a value of between 0 and 5 most of the time. The average time interval from January 2020 to May 2021 ranges from 1.76 days to 1.94 days, depending on the choice of model and parameters. This study suggests that raising public participation in dealing with the crisis over the long term would be enhanced in China by media encouragement to pay more attention to small-scale regional transmission and the course of the pandemic in other countries.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Only patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), who had a cup-disc ratio (CDR) of 0.9 or a near total cupping on maximum tolerated medical therapy for at least 4 weeks and yet could not meet the target IOP were included. Target IOP was defined as 12 mm Hg. A total of 30 patients were enrolled. All patients in study cohort were started on E/D Ripasudil BD. Patients were followed up at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and then monthly for 6 months for their best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), disc changes (slit lamp biomicroscopy), perimetry, and retinal nerve fibre layer analysis using optical coherence tomography (OCT-RNFL). RESULTS: Mean pre-treatment IOP on five drugs was 18.3  2.1 mm Hg (range 14 to 22mmHg) on maximally tolerated medical therapy. At 1 week follow-up, mean post-treatment IOP was 15.1  1.7 mm Hg (range 12 to 18mmHg) and at 2 week follow-up, mean post-treatment IOP was 12.5  1.9 mmHg (range 10 to 16mmHg). Thus, target IOP 12mmHg was attained in 28 patients at 2 weeks. This target IOP was maintained throughout the 6 months of follow-up period.

To reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses on patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) we devised and evaluated a multi-tiered infection control strategy with the goal of preventing nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV2 and other RVIs across a large healthcare campus. METHODOLOGY: From January-June 2020, a multi-tiered infection control strategy was implemented across a healthcare campus in Singapore, comprising the largest acute tertiary hospital as well as four other subspecialty centres, with more than 10,000 HCWs. Drawing on our institutions experience with an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, this strategy included improved patient segregation and distancing, and heightened infection prevention and control (IPC) measures including universal masking. All symptomatic patients were tested for COVID-19 and common RVIs. RESULTS: A total of 16,162 admissions campus-wide were screened; 7.% (1155/16162) tested positive for COVID-19. Less than 5% of COVID-19 cases (39/1155) were initially detected outside of isolation wards in multi-bedded cohorted wards. Improved distancing and enhanced IPC measures successfully mitigated onward spread even amongst COVID-19 cases detected outside of isolation. COVID-19 rates amongst HCWs were kept low (0.13%, 17/13066) and reflected community acquisition rather than nosocomial spread.

OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to assess hospital cancer registrars' perceptions of (1) the use of and quality of hospital cancer registry data for care coordination and other purposes;(2) the availability of all needed data for complete hospital cancer registry data collection;and (3) the data collection of COVID-19 effects on cancer patients. METHODS: A survey was sent to hospital-based members of Cancer Registrars of Illinois between April and June 2020. Survey questions focused on current use and quality of hospital cancer registry data for care coordination as well as items related to COVID-19's effect on cancer patients. The focus of this study was hospital-based registrars, as they are the individuals collecting data directly from primary patient records. RESULTS: While hospital cancer registry data are being used for many purposes including continuity of care, this study found that providers are not using hospital cancer registry data to its fullest extent. It was also found that hospital cancer registrars have collected valuable data on the impact that COVID-19 has had on cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Care coordination between providers is especially important for cancer patients who may see multiple providers and visit several facilities. This study found that the hospital cancer registry database contains extremely useful data for cancer patients and practitioners. Further, it was found that the hospital cancer registry is a source of valuable information regarding the impact that COVID-19 has had on cancer patients.","output":"Exploring Cancer Registrars' Perceptions of the Quality and Use of Cancer Registry Data for Care Coordination and Other Purposes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"пƼѧͬҽѧԺͬҽԺڷҽԺϢʵʩĹ,һ\\"ƽ̨\\"ʵϵͳĿٲ,ͬʱѾͬҽԺ3ԺʹõϵͳΪ˴Ĳֹؼ,޷ֲҽԺ,ʵַҽԺͬҽԺ3ԺͬƷҽ һ,ϵͳ,ƷҽԺҵ,͹״׻ߵļ ͨһϵϢٴ,߷ҽԺЧʵͬʱ,ҽݾҽԺƽ̨ļйܿ,ʵĿѧЧ","output":"COVID-19 Patients Treatment in the Cabin Hospital Based on Informationization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Container shipping makes significant contribution to the global economy and is confronted with various hazards and risks especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054, M(age) = 16.68, standard deviation = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3 weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. RESULTS: For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.","output":"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

Methods We propose a novel, integrative, and neural network-based literature-based discovery (LBD) approach to identify drug candidates from PubMed and other COVID-19-focused research literature. Our approach relies on semantic triples extracted using SemRep (via SemMedDB). We identified an informative and accurate subset of semantic triples using filtering rules and an accuracy classifier developed on a BERT variant. We used this subset to construct a knowledge graph, and applied five state-of-the-art, neural knowledge graph completion algorithms (TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, and STELP) to predict drug repurposing candidates. The models were trained and assessed using a time slicing approach and the predicted drugs were compared with a list of drugs reported in the literature and evaluated in clinical trials. These models were complemented by a discovery pattern-based approach. Results Accuracy classifier based on PubMedBERT achieved the best performance (F1 = 0.854) in classifying semantic predications. Among five knowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed others (MR = 0.923, Hits@1 = 0.417). Some known drugs linked to COVID-19 in the literature were identified, as well as others that have not yet been studied. Discovery patterns enabled identification of additional candidate drugs and generation of plausible hypotheses regarding the links between the candidate drugs and COVID-19. Among them, five highly ranked and novel drugs (paclitaxel, SB 203580, alpha 2-antiplasmin, metoclopramide, and oxymatrine) and the mechanistic explanations for their potential use are further discussed. Conclusion We showed that a LBD approach can be feasible not only for discovering drug candidates for COVID-19, but also for generating mechanistic explanations.

BACKGROUND: The currently used DES present certain features that have been linked separately to their better performance in terms of efficacy and safety. METHODS: First-in-man, prospective and multicenter study including patients treated with ihtDEStiny stent undergoing OCT examination at 9 months follow up. The ihtDEStiny stent is a sirolimus eluting stent with an oval shape ultrathin struts (68 m) and an abluminal coating of a fluoropolymer containing the antiplatelet agent triflusal. Primary endpoint was the percentage of obstruction of the in-stent volume by the neointima. RESULTS: In 58 patients (63 lesions) in-stent late lumen loss was 0.11  0.23 mm (95% CI 0.05-0.16) with only in 6% of stents being > 0.5 mm and in-segment binary stenosis was 1.6%.

Combating antimicrobial resistant microbes (AMR) requires coordinated international efforts that incorporate new conventional antibiotic development as well as development of alternative drugs with antimicrobial activity, management of existing antimicrobials, and rapid detection of AMR pathogens. Areas covered: This manuscript discusses some conventional strategies to control microbial resistance. The main purpose of the manuscript is to present information on specific herbal medicines that may serve as good treatment alternatives to conventional antimicrobials for infections sensitive to conventional as well as resistant strains of microorganisms. Expert commentary: Identification of potential new antimicrobials is challenging; however, one source for potential structurally diverse and complex antimicrobials are natural products. Natural products may have advantages over other post-germ theory antimicrobials. Many antimicrobial herbal medicines possess simultaneous antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal and/or antiviral properties. Herbal products have the potential to boost host resistance to infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Antimicrobial broad-spectrum activity in conjunction with immunostimulatory properties may help to prevent microbial resistance to herbal medicine. As part of the efforts to broaden use of herbal medicines to treat microbial infections, pre-clinical and clinical testing guidelines of these compounds as a whole should be implemented to ensure consistency in formulation, efficacy and safety.","output":"Phytotherapy as an alternative to conventional antimicrobials: combating microbial resistance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION : Acute kidney injury is a common occurrence in patients with sepsis and portends a high mortality as well as increased morbidity with numerous sequelae including the development of chronic kidney disease. Currently, there are no specific therapies that either prevent AKI or hasten its recovery. Thus, clinicians typically rely on management of the underlying infection, optimization of hemodynamic parameters as well as avoidance of nephrotoxins to maximize outcomes. AREAS COVERED : Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of sepsis as well as how these pathways may interact to lead to acute kidney injury have opened the door to the development of new, targeted therapies. This review focuses on the operative pathways in sepsis that have been identified as critical in leading to acute kidney injury and associated therapeutic agents that target these pathways. EXPERT OPINION : Despite increased understanding of the pathogenesis of sepsis, development of effective therapeutics to decrease the incidence of AKI have lagged. This is likely due to the complex pathophysiology with overlapping pathways and need for multiple therapies guided by specific biomarkers. Biomarkers that detail operative pathways may be able to guide the institution of more specific therapies with the hope for improved outcomes.","output":"Recent advances in the pharmacological management of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to present the case of a patient in whom a chopstick, which had been in the duodenum for 10 years, was finally removed by endoscopy.

An early lockdown is beneficial not only to slow down the spread of the disease, but creates beneficial habit formation (such as social distancing, developing hygienic habits) that persists even after the lockdown is lifted. Against this benefit of an early lockdown, there is a cost from loss of information about the virulence and spread of the disease in the population in addition to a direct cost to the economy. Based on the prior probability of the disease being virulent, we characterize the timing, intensity and duration of a lockdown with the above mentioned tradeoffs. Specifically, we show that as the precision of learning goes up, a government tends to delay the imposition of lockdown.

Importantly, some of these WHO-endorsed tests can detect Mycobacterial gene mutations associated with anti-TB drug resistance, allowing for tailoring of effective TB treatment. Currently, a wide array of molecular tests for TB detection is being developed and evaluated, and while some are intended for reference laboratory use, others are being aimed at the point-of-care and peripheral healthcare settings. Notably, there is an emergence of molecular tests designed, manufactured, and rolled out in high TB burden countries, some of which are explicitly aimed for near-patient placement.

However, uncertainty remained regarding the effect of AD itself and comorbidities (e.g., allergic diseases, cataract surgery) on RRD occurrence in a large, population-based paediatric population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed the 12-year National Health Insurance Service database (2002C2013) covering the entire Korean population to estimate the association between AD and RRD in people aged under 20 years. RESULTS: We identified 3142 RRD patients, and matched 18,852 controls (six controls to each RRD patient); therefore, we included 21,994 peoples under aged 20 years in the analyses. AD was more prevalent in the RRD group (329 patients, 10.47%) than the control group (1043 patients, 5.53%; P < 0.001), and so were severe AD (153 patients [4.87%] and 223 patients [1.18%], respectively; P < 0.001). In conditional logistic regression analysis, AD was associated with RRD (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.93C1.87) even after adjusting for allergic conditions, connective tissue disease, uveitis, and cataract surgery.

High test specificity is critical for keeping the size of the quarantine population manageable. Moving the largest classes online is also crucial for controlling both the size of outbreaks and the number of students in quarantine. Increased residential exposure can significantly impact the size of an outbreak, but it is likely more important to control non-residential social exposure among students.

Nevertheless, current evidence on the risk and benefits of continuing oncological treatment of cancer patients during the pandemic remains insufficient.

We conducted a retrospective study using a prospectively maintained database of patients admitted to our hospital between 25 February 2020 and 9 April 2020 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients with a history or current oncological disease were included in this study. Sixteen oncological patients (30.2%) died during hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that age (Odds ratio [OR]: 1.17, p = 0.009), diabetes (OR: 15.05, p = 0.028) and active oncological disease (OR 13.60, p = 0.015) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.

Models exist predicting COVID-19 diagnosis, but significant concerns exist regarding methodology and generalisability. AIM: To generate the first COVID-19 diagnosis risk score for use at the time of hospital admission using the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) checklist. DESIGN: A multivariable diagnostic prediction model for COVID-19 using the TRIPOD checklist applied to a large single-centre retrospective observational study of patients with suspected COVID-19. METHODS: 581 individuals were admitted with suspected COVID-19; the majority had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (420/581, 72.2%). Retrospective collection was performed of electronic clinical records and pathology data. RESULTS: The final multivariable model demonstrated AUC 0.8535 (95% confidence interval (0.8121C0.8950). The final model used 6 clinical variables that are routinely available in most low and high resource settings. Using a cut-off of 2, the derived risk score has a sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 86.8%. At COVID-19 prevalence of 10% the model has a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Our risk score is intended for diagnosis of COVID-19 in individuals admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. The score is the first developed for COVID-19 diagnosis using the TRIPOD checklist. It may be effective as a tool to rule out COVID-19 and function at different pandemic phases of variable COVID-19 prevalence.

Eligible patients had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of 30 to less than 300, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 to less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, and diabetic retinopathy, or they had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300 to 5000 and an eGFR of 25 to less than 75 ml per minute per 1.73 m2. All the patients were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade that had been adjusted before randomization to the maximum dose on the manufacturer's label that did not cause unacceptable side effects. The primary composite outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was kidney failure, a sustained decrease of at least 40% in the eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes. The key secondary composite outcome, also assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure.

All pediatric patients in the age group of 0C16 years were included in the study. The practicing field of referring clinicians was noted along with the maximum information that could be collected from the referral letter and were thus assessed for the quality, accuracy, and timely referral. RESULTS: Out of 77 referrals received in the study period, six referral letters neither had any mention of the designation of the referring clinician nor any specific diagnosis or details. Thus, only 71 patients were included for further study. The referring clinicians were mainly ophthalmologists, pediatricians, general practitioners (GPs), and others (cardiologists, neurologists). Maximum patients were referred by ophthalmologists (76%) but visual acuity was noted only for 30% of these patients. Almost half of the referral diagnosis was accurate.

Although epigenetic disorders are considered a sign of cell carcinogenesis and malignant events that affect tumor progression and drug resistance, in view of the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications, clinicians believe that associated mechanisms can be a key target for cancer prevention and treatment. In contrast, epidemiological and preclinical studies indicated that the epigenome is constantly reprogrammed by intake of natural organic compounds and the environment, suggesting the possibility of utilizing natural compounds to influence epigenetics in cancer therapy. Flavonoids, although not synthesized in the human body, can be consumed daily and are common in medicinal plants, vegetables, fruits, and tea. Recently, numerous reports provided evidence for the regulation of cancer epigenetics by flavonoids. Considering their origin in natural and food sources, few side effects, and remarkable biological activity, the epigenetic antitumor effects of flavonoids warrant further investigation.

However, auscultation is a subjective practice and interpretations vary widely between users. The digitization of auscultation acquisition and interpretation is a particularly promising strategy for diagnosing and monitoring infectious diseases such as Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) where automated analyses could help decentralise care and better inform decision-making in telemedicine. This protocol describes the standardised collection of lung auscultations in COVID-19 triage sites and a deep learning approach to diagnostic and prognostic modelling for future incorporation into an intelligent autonomous stethoscope benchmarked against human expert interpretation. METHODS: A total of 1000 consecutive, patients aged &#8805; 16 years and meeting COVID-19 testing criteria will be recruited at screening sites and amongst inpatients of the internal medicine department at the Geneva University Hospitals, starting from October 2020. COVID-19 is diagnosed by RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab and COVID-positive patients are followed up until outcome (i.e., discharge, hospitalisation, intubation and/or death). At inclusion, demographic and clinical data are collected, such as age, sex, medical history, and signs and symptoms of the current episode. Additionally, lung auscultation will be recorded with a digital stethoscope at 6 thoracic sites in each patient. A deep learning algorithm (DeepBreath) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine classifier will be trained on these audio recordings to derive an automated prediction of diagnostic (COVID positive vs negative) and risk stratification categories (mild to severe). The performance of this model will be compared to a human prediction baseline on a random subset of lung sounds, where blinded physicians are asked to classify the audios into the same categories. DISCUSSION: This approach has broad potential to standardise the evaluation of lung auscultation in COVID-19 at various levels of healthcare, especially in the context of decentralised triage and monitoring.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of ACT in forensic pathology by examining discrepancy rates between ACT scans and autopsy findings in cases of deceased individuals with traumatic intracranial haemorrhages and assess factors associated with discrepancies. METHODS: Eighty-five cases of ACT and autopsy reports from 01 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 from the Polokwane Forensic Pathology Laboratory, South Africa, were analysed retrospectively. Using Cohens kappa statistics, measures of agreement and resultant discrepancy rates were determined. Also, the discrepancy patterns for each identified factor was also analysed. RESULTS: The discrepancy rate between ACT and autopsy detection of haemorrhage was 24.71% while diagnostic categorisation of haemorrhage was 55.3%. Classification discrepancy was most observed in subarachnoid haemorrhages and least observed in extradural haemorrhages. A markedly reduced level of consciousness, hospital stay beyond two weeks and three or fewer years of doctors experience contributed to classification discrepancies. CONCLUSION: Ante-mortem computed tomography should be used only as an adjunct to autopsy findings.

Children who live and work on the streets have not only had socio-economic problems but also educational medical problems, etc. It is a social truth that these children are the most affected disadvantaged group in the battle of pandemic. In this context, especially before and after pandemic, how the life is affected and the change that it brings is very remarkable. However, the detrimental effect on the negativity in societal terms is inevitable. In this study, children living, working, and being forced to work in the streets are defined cognitively, their status quo in the society, their form of life, their educational, medical, criminal, and family cultural relationships are described;evaluation of pandemic processs influences on the new normal, the social change and transformation in regarding to human and child rights are discussed. ? 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Covid-19 aspect of poverty: Children living and working on the street"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1The Omicron variant of concern (VOC) is a rapidly spreading variant of SARS-CoV-2 that is likely to overtake the previously dominant Delta VOC in many countries by the end of 2021. We estimated the transmission dynamics following the spread of Omicron VOC within Danish households during December 2021. We used data from Danish registers to estimate the household secondary attack rate (SAR). Among 11,937 households (2,225 with the Omicron VOC), we identified 6,397 secondary infections during a 1-7 day follow-up period. The SAR was 31% and 21% in households with the Omicron and Delta VOC, respectively. We found an increased transmission for unvaccinated individuals, and a reduced transmission for booster-vaccinated individuals, compared to fully vaccinated individuals. Comparing households infected with the Omicron to Delta VOC, we found an 1.17 (95%-CI: 0.99-1.38) times higher SAR for unvaccinated, 2.61 times (95%-CI: 2.34-2.90) higher for fully vaccinated and 3.66 (95%-CI: 2.65-5.05) times higher for booster-vaccinated individuals, demonstrating strong evidence of immune evasiveness of the Omicron VOC. Our findings confirm that the rapid spread of the Omicron VOC primarily can be ascribed to the immune evasiveness rather than an inherent increase in the basic transmissibility.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC Transmission in Danish Households"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine the analytical performance of Novel VITROS BRAHMS Procalcitonin Immunoassay on VITROS 3600 and correlation with BRAHMS PCT sensitive KRYPTOR reference method.

Furthermore, most of the works are focused on a very particular place or application and we strive to attain a more general model, resorting to data from different countries. In particular, we compare Great Britain and Israel, two highly different scenarios in terms of vaccination plans and social structure.

METHODS: The present study deals with Jasminum officinale L. leaves extract (JOLE) as a reducing and capping agent for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by the green pathway. Phenolic profile of the extract was evaluated using HPLC-PDA/MS/MS technique. Jasminum officinale L. leaves extract silver nanoparticles (JOLE-AgNPs) were characterized by ultraviolet light (UV), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta potential and X-ray diffraction (XRD). JOLE-AgNPs were examined for their cytotoxic activities by neutral red uptake assay (NRU) against bladder (5637) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. RESULTS: HPLC-PDA/MS/MS tentatively identified 51 compounds of different chemical classes. UV spectra showed absorption peak at max = 363 nm. The biosynthesized AgNPs were predominantly spherical in shape with an average size of 9.22 nm by TEM. The face cubic center (fcc) nature of silver nanoparticles was proved by XRD diffractogram. JOLE-AgNPs exhibited high cytotoxic activity against 5637 and MCF-7 cell lines compared to the cytotoxic activities of JOLE with IC(50) of 13.09 g/mL and 9.3 g/mL, respectively.

Most of the existing work in this domain has focused on settings that assume perfectly accurate sampling approaches, which is seldom true in practical data science. Here we introduce the first known approach to support estimation in the presence of sampling artifacts and errors where each sample is assumed to arise from a Poisson repeat channel which simultaneously captures repetitions and deletions of samples. The proposed estimator is based on regularized weighted Chebyshev approximations, with weights governed by evaluations of so-called Touchard (Bell) polynomials. The supports in the presence of sampling artifacts are calculated using discretized semi-infite programming methods. The estimation approach is tested on synthetic and textual data, as well as on GISAID data collected to address a new problem in computational biology: mutational support estimation in genes of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. In the later setting, the Poisson channel captures the fact that many individuals are tested multiple times for the presence of viral RNA, thereby leading to repeated samples, while other individual's results are not recorded due to test errors. For all experiments performed, we observed significant improvements of our integrated methods compared to those obtained through adequate modifications of state-of-the-art noiseless support estimation methods.","output":"Support Estimation with Sampling Artifacts and Errors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herbivores are a main driver of ecosystem patterns and processes in semi-arid savannas, with their effects clearly observed when they are excluded from landscapes.

These exclosures vary from very small (1 m2) to relatively large (almost 900 ha), from short-term (single growing season) to long-term (e.g. some of the exclosures were erected more than 60 years ago), and are located on different geologies and across a rainfall gradient. We provide a summary of the history and specifications of various exclosures. This is followed by a systematic overview of mostly peer-reviewed literature resulting from using KNP exclosures as research sites. These 75 articles cover research on soils, vegetation dynamics, herbivore exclusion on other faunal groups and disease. We provide general patterns and mechanisms in a synthesis section, and end with recommendations to increase research outputs and productivity for future exclosure experiments. Conservation Implications: Herbivore exclosures in the KNP have become global research platforms, that have helped in the training of ecologists, veterinarians and field biologists, and have provided valuable insights into savanna dynamics that would otherwise have been hard to gain.

Ethnobiology and ethnomedicine-centred research has moved at the (partially artificial and fictitious) interface between nature and culture and has investigated human consumption of wild foods and wild animals, as well as the use of wild animals or their parts for medicinal and other purposes, along with the associated knowledge, skills, practices, and beliefs. Little attention has been paid, however, to the complex interplay of social and cultural reasons behind the increasing pressure on wildlife. The available literature suggest that there are two main drivers that enhance the necessary conditions for infectious diseases to cross the species barrier from wild animals to humans: (1) the encroachment of human activities (e.g., logging, mining, agricultural expansion) into wild areas and forests and consequent ecological disruptions; and, connected to the former, (2) the commodification of wild animals (and natural resources in general) and an expanding demand and market for wild meat and live wild animals, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In particular, a crucial role may have been played by the bushmeat-euphoria and attached elitist gastronomies and conspicuous consumption phenomena.

These perceptual changes coincided with an increase in vocal intensity and harmonics-to-noise ratio, but decrease in relative fundamental frequency offset 10. As expected, men and women differed in measures related to fundamental frequency and vocal tract length. CONCLUSION Healthcare professionals wearing masks reported greater vocal symptoms post-workday compared to pre-workday. These symptoms coincided with acoustic changes previously related to vocal effort; however, the degree of change was considered mild.

In recent available literature, most of the studies were done to estimate the burden of psychiatric problems among general population due to this pandemic, Therefore, this study was planned to assess depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance among Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Materials and Methods A hospital-based, cross-sectional study was done from June 2020 to August 2020 among 100 COVID-19 patients who were admitted and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Assessment of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance were done by patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale, generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI), respectively. Results In this study, 73% were males and 27% were females. The mean age of the patients in present study was 42.90  16.33 years. This study reveals that depression was in 27%, anxiety in 67%, and sleep disturbance in 62% of patients. Depression and anxiety were found significantly associated with presence of comorbidity and severity of illness (p &lt; 0 0.05). The association of sleep disturbance with severity of illness was also found statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion The risk of psychological stress is high in COVID-19 patients. The psychological problems among COVID-19 patients are commonly related to the consequences of disease, and severity and contagiousness of the disease.

OBJECTIVE To create a simple decision-tree algorithm for OC exploration and decompression in the endonasal endoscopic surgery for planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sella meningiomas. METHODS We identified a consecutive series of 8 planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sella meningiomas resected endonasally. \\"Late\\" OC exploration and decompression was performed in 4 of 8 patients. The extent of resection, visual outcome, and complications were recorded. RESULTS Five patients had OC invasion on magnetic resonance imaging. Endoscopic inspection did not reveal additional OC invasion. The OC was opened bilaterally in 2 patients and unilaterally in 2 patients. Gross total resection was achieved in 6 of 7 patients in whom it was the goal. Vision improved in 3 patients (3 of 3 OCs opened) and was stable in 4 (1 of 4 OCs opened). In 1 patient, the bitemporal hemianopsia improved, but there was unilateral deterioration (no OC invasion) because the tumor was extremely adherent to 1 optic nerve. After an average follow-up of 20.9 months, all patients had an Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 5, and there were no cerebrospinal fluid leaks. CONCLUSION Exploration and decompression of the OC are feasible, safe, and important to optimize visual outcome and to minimize recurrence in planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sella meningiomas resected endonasally. It may not be important to open the canal early during surgery because tumor debulking can be performed without manipulating the optic nerves.

Although these tests are commonly used, their predictive validity has not yet been established. PURPOSE To determine the strength of association between hop testing and RTS, knee reinjury, subjective report of knee function, and posttraumatic knee osteoarthritis (PTOA) after primary ACLR. Secondarily, to determine whether hop testing is able to predict a favorable result on the same outcome variables. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS A systematic, computer-assisted literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed when conducting and reporting this review. Primary outcome variables for this review were self-report of knee function, return to preinjury level of activity, presence of reinjury, and presence of PTOA. The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence tool was used to assess the level of evidence for each included study. Quality assessment of each included study was performed through use of a modified Downs and Black scale. Available metrics were tabulated based on outcome variables. RESULTS Overall, 21 studies (4476 patients) met inclusion for this review. The majority of evidence (95.2%) was of moderate to high methodologic quality. The most commonly associated outcome measure was the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.20 to 0.60. The strength of association between the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and hop testing ranged from -0.10 to 0.62 in 4 studies. In all, 10 studies examined the relationship between hop testing and RTS, with variable association statistics reported. No meaningful association was found between hop testing and knee reinjury in 2 studies. Worse preoperative hop testing was associated with PTOA in 1 study. CONCLUSION Hop testing appears to possess fair association to subjective report of knee function measured by the KOOS and IKDC and a patient's ability to RTS after ACLR. Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between hop testing and PTOA and knee reinjury.

METHODS: Participants (n=3207, aged 2-90 years), enrolled from a previously established nationwide serosurveillance study, provided a self-collected fingerstick blood sample and completed a questionnaire (median inclusion date 3 April 2020). IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity. RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18-39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2-17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others. Anosmia/ageusia was the most discriminative symptom between seropositive (53%) and seronegative persons (4%, p<0.0001). Antibody concentrations in seropositive persons were significantly higher in those with fever or dyspnoea in contrast to those without (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In the midst of the first epidemic wave, 2.8% of the Dutch population was estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, that is, 30 times higher than reported. This study identified independent groups with increased odds for seropositivity that may require specific surveillance measures to guide future protective interventions internationally, including vaccination once available.","output":"Nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and identification of risk factors in the general population of the Netherlands during the first epidemic wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Karaman is a new and developing city in Turkey's economy is developing and the industry.

BLRR data are consistent with next-generation sequencing results for reporting HDR (R2 = 0.9722) and NHEJ (R2 = 0.919) events. Moreover, BLRR analysis allows longitudinal tracking of HDR and NHEJ activities in cells, and enables detection of DSB repairs in xenografted tumours in vivo. Using the BLRR system, we observed a significant difference in the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing with guide RNAs only 1-10 bp apart. Moreover, BLRR analysis detected altered dynamics for DSB repair induced by small-molecule modulators. Finally, we discovered HDR-suppressing functions of anticancer cardiac glycosides in human glioblastomas and glioma cancer stem-like cells via inhibition of DNA repair protein RAD51 homolog 1 (RAD51).

We introduce an approach of iterative network hypothesis reduction from time-series data in which increasingly complex features of the dynamic expression of individual, pairs, and entire collections of genes are used to infer functional network models that can produce the observed transcriptional program. The culmination of our work is a computational pipeline, Iterative Network Hypothesis Reduction from Temporal Dynamics (Inherent Dynamics Pipeline), that provides a priority listing of targets for genetic perturbation to experimentally infer network structure. We demonstrate the capability of this integrated computational pipeline on synthetic and yeast cell-cycle data. Author Summary In this work we discuss a method for identifying promising experimental targets for genetic network inference by leveraging different features of time series gene expression data along a chained set of previously published software tools. We aim to locate small networks that control oscillations in the genome-wide expression profile in biological functions such as the circadian rhythm and the cell cycle. We infer the most promising targets for further experimentation, emphasizing that modeling and experimentation are an?Corresponding author: breschine.cummins@montana.edu essential feedback loop for confident predictions of core network structure. Our major offering is the reduction of experimental time and expense by providing targeted guidance from computational methods for the inference of oscillating core networks, particularly in novel organisms.","output":"Experimental Guidance for Discovering Genetic Networks through Iterative Hypothesis Reduction on Time Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The systematic screening of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals is a powerful tool for controlling community transmission of infectious disease on college campuses. Faced with a paucity of testing in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities developed molecular diagnostic laboratories focused on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing on campus and in their broader communities. We established the UC Santa Cruz Molecular Diagnostic Lab in early April 2020 and began testing clinical samples just five weeks later. Using a clinically-validated laboratory developed test (LDT) that avoided supply chain constraints, an automated sample pooling and processing workflow, and a custom laboratory information management system (LIMS), we expanded testing from a handful of clinical samples per day to thousands per day with the testing capacity to screen our entire campus population twice per week. In this report we describe the technical, logistical, and regulatory processes that enabled our pop-up lab to scale testing and reporting capacity to thousands of tests per day.","output":"A method for campus-wide SARS-CoV-2 surveillance at a large public university"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Background Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce. We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities. Methods We abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 33:1). 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate. The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age. Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68%]), hypertension (16 [34%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49%]). Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]), cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]). All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities. Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]). Interpretation Disease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities. Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent definition.

Contact tracing is of paramount importance when dealing with a pandemic, as it allows for rapid identification of cases based on the information collected from infected individuals about other individuals they may have had recent contact with. Advances in digital technology have enabled devices such as mobile phones to be used in the contract-tracing process. However, there is a potential risk of users' personal information and sensitive data being stolen should hackers be in the near vicinity of these devices. Thus, there is a need to develop privacy-preserving apps. Meanwhile, privacy policies that outline the risk associated with the use of contact-tracing apps are needed, in formats that are easily readable and comprehensible by the public. To our knowledge, no previous study has examined the readability of privacy policies of contact-tracings apps. Therefore, we performed a readability analysis to evaluate the comprehensibility of privacy policies of 7 contact-tracing apps currently in use. The contents of the privacy policies of these apps were assessed for readability using Readability Test Tool, a free web-based reliability calculator, which computes scores based on a number of statistics (ie, word count and the number of complex words) and indices (ie, Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, and Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook index). Our analysis revealed that explanations used in the privacy policies of these apps require a reading grade between 7 and 14, which is considerably higher than the reading ability of the average individual. We believe that improving the readability of privacy policies of apps could be potentially reassuring for users and may help facilitate the increased use of such apps.","output":"COVID-19 Contact-Tracing Apps: Analysis of the Readability of Privacy Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the summer of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to spread around the world, institutions of higher education were faced with three options in terms of their teaching modality for fall 2020: resume in-person education, switch to online delivery, or adopt a hybrid approach. This observational research study aims to tease out the variables that explain the decisions announced in summer 2020 by various colleges and universities in the United States for their planned instruction for fall 2020. We propose and test eight hypotheses related to the decision. The study found statistical confirmation that universities with higher financial stability and/or prestige tended to select the online delivery option, while lower financial stability/prestige showed a preference to stay with in-person delivery. We also found public institutions were more likely to go online than private ones. Additionally, we found statistical support for our hypotheses that universities located in Republican leaning states and also those with a religious affiliation would prefer the in-person modality. The results also confirmed our hypothesis that universities offering a higher percentage of humanities degrees would have a greater probability of choosing the in-person modality. Interestingly, we did not find statistical support for our hypothesis that the level of COVID spread in the geographical area of a university's location would affect its decision. ?

The study aimed to assess the traditional knowledge and use of medicinal plants to treat various ailments by Algerian traditional healers. Forty traditional healers were face-to-face interviewed in three different Algerian areas (West, Kabylia, and Sahara). The data collected were analyzed using quantitative indices such as fidelity level (FL) and informant consensus factor (F(IC)). A total of 167 species belonging to 70 families were recorded. Lamiaceae (13%), Asteraceae (13%), Apiaceae (7%), and Rosaceae and Fabaceae (5% each) were the most cited families. The survey revealed that leaves were the most used parts of the plants (29%). Furthermore, decoction (35%), raw (24%), and infusion (19%) were the common modes for the remedies preparation. Here, 15% of the total species were newly reported as medicinal plants. Besides, it was reported for the first time a total of 47 new therapeutic uses for 20 known plant species. Of 17 ailments categories, cancer was presented by 44 species, showing the highest F(IC) of 0.46. Marrubium vulgare L., Artemisia herba-alba Asso., Zingiber officinale Roscoe., and Juniperus phoenicea L. recorded the maximum fidelity value of 100%. Therefore, our study reveals strong ethnomedicinal knowledge shared by local populations living in the three regions studied.

There was a linear relationship between FAV concentration and relative fluorescence intensity over the range 40-280 ng/mL with limit of detection of 9.44 ng/mL and quantitation limit of 28.60 ng/mL. The method was successfully implemented for determination of FAV in its pharmaceutical formulation with mean % recovery of 99.26  0.87.

This makes small states vulnerable and raises the question if specific policies can be implemented to offset the drawbacks of their small size and to increase resilience. We address this question in this paper, thereby focusing on the role of connectivity C between states, organisations, parties, or otherwise C in understanding a countrys vulnerability and resilience. Here policies are interpreted as institutions in the sense of Douglass C. North (1990), i.e. as humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interaction. We focus on the Caribbean area, which is characterised by a wide variety of small states, each with its own set of rules and regulations. Within this area, we concentrate on the relationship between three Dutch Caribbean islands, i.e., Aruba, Cura?ao, and Sint Maarten, on the one hand, and the Netherlands, the former colonizer, on the other hand. As a first step we have measured the economic vulnerability and resilience of 17 Caribbean island states, both dependent and independent, employing the theoretical framework proposed by Lino Briguglio. The outcomes show that the three Dutch island states are performing comparatively well, although there are individual differences. We provide a first effort to explain this outcome in terms of the continuing interest of the three island states to keep their ties to the former colonizer viable. Here the presence of systemic interest as shown by the stakeholders appears to be a most important variable.

We aimed to investigate whether a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool can expedite diagnosis and treatment of SSI after emergency abdominal surgery. This single-blinded randomised control trial (NCT02704897) enroled adult emergency abdominal surgery patients in two tertiary care hospitals. Patients were randomised (1:1) to routine postoperative care or additional access to a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool for 30-days postoperatively. Patient-reported SSI symptoms and wound photographs were requested on postoperative days 3, 7, and 15. The primary outcome was time-to-diagnosis of SSI (Centers for Disease Control definition). 492 patients were randomised (smartphone intervention: 223; routine care: 269). There was no significant difference in the 30-day SSI rate between trial arms: 21 (9.4%) in smartphone vs 20 (7.4%, p = 0.513) in routine care. Among the smartphone group, 32.3% (n = 72) did not utilise the tool. There was no significant difference in time-to-diagnosis of SSI for patients receiving the intervention (?2.5 days, 95% CI: ?6.6?1.6, p = 0.225). However, patients in the smartphone group had 3.7-times higher odds of diagnosis within 7 postoperative days (95% CI: 1.02?13.51, p = 0.043). The smartphone group had significantly reduced community care attendance (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34?0.94, p = 0.030), similar hospital attendance (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.28?1.96, p = 0.577), and significantly better experiences in accessing care (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.17?3.53, p = 0.013). Smartphone-delivered wound follow-up is feasible following emergency abdominal surgery. This can facilitate triage to the appropriate level of assessment required, allowing earlier postoperative diagnosis of SSI.","output":"Remote diagnosis of surgical-site infection using a mobile digital intervention: a randomised controlled trial in emergency surgery patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Letter, we investigate the effects of single derivative mixing in massive bosonic fields. In the regime of large mixing, we show that this leads to striking changes of the field dynamics, delaying the onset of classical oscillations and decreasing, or even eliminating, the friction due to Hubble expansion. We highlight this phenomenon with a few examples. In the first example, we show how an axionlike particle can have its number abundance parametrically enhanced. In the second example, we demonstrate that the QCD axion can have its number abundance enhanced allowing for misalignment driven axion dark matter all the way down to f_{a} of order astrophysical bounds. In the third example, we show that the delayed oscillation of the scalar field can also sustain a period of inflation. In the last example, we present a situation where an oscillating scalar field is completely frictionless and does not dilute away in time.","output":"Scalars Gliding through an Expanding Universe."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breast cancer has historically been a disease for which immunotherapy was largely unavailable. Recently, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has demonstrated efficacy, including longer progression-free survival and increased overall survival in subsets of patients. Based on clinical benefit in randomized trials, ICIs in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of some patients with advanced/metastatic TNBC have been approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), expanding options for patients. Ongoing questions remain, however, about the optimal chemotherapy backbone for immunotherapy, appropriate biomarker-based selection of patients for treatment, the optimal strategy for immunotherapy treatment in earlier stage disease, and potential use in histological subtypes other than TNBC. To provide guidance to the oncology community on these and other important concerns, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a clinical practice guideline (CPG). The expert panel drew upon the published literature as well as their clinical experience to develop recommendations for healthcare professionals on these important aspects of immunotherapeutic treatment for breast cancer, including diagnostic testing, treatment planning, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and patient quality of life (QOL) considerations.
