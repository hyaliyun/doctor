Deep-learning artificial intelligent (AI) methods have the potential to help improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for reading portable CXRs. PURPOSE: The study aimed at developing an AI imaging analysis tool to classify COVID-19 lung infection based on portable CXRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Public datasets of COVID-19 (N = 130), bacterial pneumonia (N = 145), non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia (N = 145), and normal (N = 138) CXRs were analyzed. Texture and morphological features were extracted. Five supervised machine-learning AI algorithms were used to classify COVID-19 from other conditions. Two-class and multi-class classification were performed. Statistical analysis was done using unpaired two-tailed t tests with unequal variance between groups. Performance of classification models used the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: For the two-class classification, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 100%, 100%, and 100% for COVID-19 vs normal; 96.34%, 95.35% and 97.44% for COVID-19 vs bacterial pneumonia; and 97.56%, 97.44% and 97.67% for COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia. For the multi-class classification, the combined accuracy and AUC were 79.52% and 0.87, respectively. CONCLUSION: AI classification of texture and morphological features of portable CXRs accurately distinguishes COVID-19 lung infection in patients in multi-class datasets.

We describe SARS-CoV-2 testing and positivity in 6 large geographically and demographically diverse cohorts of PWH and PWoH in the United States. SETTING: The Corona-Infectious-Virus Epidemiology Team (CIVET) comprises five clinical cohorts within a health system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA; Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States, Rockville, MD; University of North Carolina Health, Chapel Hill, NC; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Veterans Aging Cohort Study) and one interval cohort (MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study). METHODS: We calculated the proportion of patients SARS-CoV-2 tested and the test positivity proportion by HIV status from March 1 to December 31, 2020. RESULTS: The cohorts ranged in size from 1,675 to 31,304 PWH and 1,430 to 3,742,604 PWoH. The proportion of PWH who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (19.6%-40.5% across sites) was significantly higher than PWoH (14.8%-29.4%) in the clinical cohorts. However, among those tested, the proportion of patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was comparable by HIV status; the difference in proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positivity ranged from 4.7% lower to 1.4% higher. CONCLUSION: Although PWH had higher testing proportions compared with PWoH, we did not find evidence of increased positivity in 6 large, diverse populations across the United States.

BACKGROUND Although there is extensive literature investigating the clinical effectiveness of ERP, little is known regarding its cost-effectiveness. METHODS A systematic literature search identified all relevant articles published between 1997 and 2012 that performed an economic evaluation of ERP for colorectal surgery. Studies were included only if their ERP included all 5 of the key components (patient information, preservation of GI function, minimization of organ dysfunction, active pain control, and promotion of patient autonomy). Quality assessment was performed using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria instrument (scored 0-19; high quality  12). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated if sufficient data were provided, using difference in length of stay and overall complication rates as effectiveness measures. RESULTS Of a total of 263 unique records identified (253 from databases and 10 from other sources), 10 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included for full qualitative synthesis. Overall quality was poor (mean quality 7.8). Eight reported lower costs for ERP. The majority (8 of 10) of studies were performed from an institutional perspective and therefore did not include costs related to changes in productivity and other indirect costs (eg, caregiver burden). Five studies provided enough information to calculate ICERs, of which ERP was dominant (less costly and more effective) in all cases for reduction in length of stay and was dominant or potentially cost-effective in 4 and questionable (no difference in costs nor effectiveness) in 1 for reduction in overall complications. CONCLUSIONS The quality of the current evidence is limited but tends to support the cost-effectiveness of ERP.

The primary aim of this study was to identify risks for breastfeeding/pumping cessation with neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants' mothers who smoke or live with individuals who smoke, using a novel survival-analytic approach. METHODS/DESIGN Mothers (N = 360) were recruited for a secondhand smoke prevention intervention during infants' NICU hospitalizations and followed for ~6 months after infant discharge. Data were obtained from medical records and participant self-report/interviews. RESULTS The sample was predominantly ethnic/racial minorities; mean age was 26.8 (SD = 5.9) years. One-fifth never initiated breastfeeding/pumping (n = 67; 18.9%) and mean time-to-breastfeeding cessation was 48.1 days (SD = 57.2; median = 30.4 [interquartile range: 6.0-60.9]). Education, length of stay, employment, race/ethnicity, number of household members who smoke, and readiness-to-protect infants from tobacco smoke were significantly associated with breastfeeding cessation. Further, infants fed breast milk for 4 months had 42.7% more well-child visits (p < 0.001) and 50.0% fewer respiratory-related clinic visits (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION One-quarter of infants admitted to NICUs will be discharged to households where individuals who smoke live; we demonstrated that smoking-related factors were associated with mothers' breastfeeding practices.

The study aimed to demonstrate such an effectiveness in the alteration of the epidemic curves from theory to practice. METHODS: The empirical data on the daily reported COVID-19 cases were extracted from open source. A computer simulation design in conjunction with the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) type model was applied to evaluating confinement measures in Italy with adjustment for underreported cases; isolation and quarantine in Taiwan; and NPIs and vaccination in Israel. RESULTS: In Italy scenario, the extents of confinement measures were 34% before the end of March and then scaled up to 70% after then. Both figures were reduced to 22-69% after adjusting for underreported cases. Approximately 44% of confinement measures were implemented in the second surge of pandemic in Italy. Fitting the observational data on Taiwan assuming the initial outbreak similar to Wuhan, China, 44% of isolation and quarantine were estimated before March 23rd, 2020. Isolation and quarantine were scaled up to 90% and at least 60% to contain community-acquired outbreaks from March 24th, 2020 onwards. Given 15% monthly vaccination rate from December 2020 in Israel, the effectiveness estimates of reducing the infected toll were 36%, 56%, and 85% for NPIs alone, vaccination alone, and both combined, respectively. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated how various NPIs stamp out and delay the epidemic curve of COVID-19.

Coinfections with 2 viruses were observed in 36 patients (11.5%). Twenty-two patients (37.9%) infected with HBoV had a coinfection. Bronchiolitis was frequently diagnosed in patients who tested positive for RSV, PIV-3, or rhinovirus, whereas influenza A, PIV-1, and HCoV-NL63 were commonly found in patients with croup. The age distributions of patients with viral infections differed; notably, RSV was responsible for 77% of LRTIs that occurred in infants 3 months old. The number of hMPV infections peaked between February and April, whereas the number of HCoV-NL63 infections peaked between April and May. Conclusions. This study describes the features of LRTIs associated with newly identified viruses in children, compared with those associated with known viruses.

The sensing technology is highly scalable and could be integrated to a pulse oximeter probe for increased patient comfort. A tonometric cuff-less mechatronic system is used to apply pressure on the fingertip for (i) measuring oscillometric blood pressure, (ii) recording arterial waveform and for (iii) constructing central blood pressure (CBP) waveform. Clinical study on volunteers (n = 33) was performed against a commercially available arm cuff device yielding systolic and diastolic readings ((meanSD) mmHg) of (-0.9  7.3) mmHg and (-3.3  6.6) mmHg respectively. The results comply with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for non-invasive blood pressure monitors.

Most business studies are conceptual or surveys of damage. The main purpose of the paper is to extend the forthcoming stream that tests firm performance by examining it during COVID-19. We examine the sales growth of 1298 US manufacturers during COVID-19 compared to their pre-COVID-19 baselines. Riskier firms with higher R&D intensities performed better during COVID-19, especially when cash-to-inventory levels were low. This study is among the first to empirically identify actionable predictors of firm performance during COVID-19 via a quantitative analysis of strategies and performance outcomes. Understanding what type of firms perform at higher levels during COVID-19 will help decision makers make more informed decisions moving forward. Employing ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to test our hypotheses, our findings suggest that R&D intensive firms should pivot tactically regarding current asset management, if needed, but not strategically, while prioritizing inventory versus cash retention. The positive effect of inventory versus cash extends theory by suggesting a new boundary condition related to pandemics that reverses the positive link between cash and performance found during crises with more conventional levels of turbulence. Our most important contribution, however, is practical, via the testing of predictors that can help firms during COVID-19. For example, we found that firms with higher levels of operating risk experienced 60 percent more sales growth than risk-averse firms. This knowledge that risk-taking predicted performance during COVID-19 (especially when coupled with a focus on R&D intensity and inventory level) may encourage those that can adopt less risk-averse strategies, while others focus on tactical adjustments or mitigative measures during COVID-19 and future black swan events.","output":"The Effect of Risk, R&D Intensity, Liquidity, and Inventory on Firm Performance during COVID-19: Evidence from US Manufacturing Industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both scientific authorities and governments of nations worldwide were found lacking in their COVID-19 response and management, resulting in significant distrust by the general public in 2020.

The aim of this chapter is to doctrinally examine the adequacy of existing legal and policy frameworks concerning IDPs in Ethiopia. This chapter examines whether the existing national frameworks adequately protects IDPs, and if not, what gaps exist. This chapter argues that while existing domestic legal and policy frameworks contain elements relevant to protection of IDPs, they are not comprehensive and do not comprehensively respond to the specific needs and vulnerabilities of IDPs. This chapter makes the point that the absence of an adequate domestic legal and policy framework for protection of IDPs underlines the importance of domesticating the Kampala Convention.","output":"The Adequacy of Law and Policy Frameworks on Internal Displacement in Ethiopia: A Critical Appraisal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Based on the increasing incidence of smell and taste dysfunction among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, such issues have been considered an early symptom of infection. However, few studies have investigated the type of taste components that are most frequently affected in COVID-19 patients. This study investigated the difference in frequencies of the types of taste component disorders among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods In this retrospective, single-center, observational study, patients' background characteristics, clinical course, laboratory and radiological findings, and details on taste and/or smell disorders were collected and analyzed from medical records. Patients A total of 227 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, among whom 92 (40.5%) complained of taste disorders. Results Multiple types of taste disorders (hypogeusia/ageusia and hypersensitivity, or hypersensitivity and changing tastes) were reported in 10 patients. In particular, 23 patients reported hypersensitivity to at least 1 type of taste, and 2 patients complained of a bitter taste on consuming sweet foods. Impairment of all taste components was found in 48 patients (52.2%). The most frequent taste disorder was salty taste disorder (81 patients, 89.0%). Hypersensitivity to salty taste was most frequently observed (19 patients, 20.9%). Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 develop multiple types of taste disorders, among which salty taste disorder was the most frequent, with many patients developing hypersensitivity to salty taste. As smell and taste are subjective senses, further studies with the combined use of objective examinations will be required to confirm the findings.","output":"Multiple Types of Taste Disorders Among Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 social isolation upon aspects of emotional and social cognitive function.

Measures included two questionnaires probing levels of social isolation, anxiety levels, as well as five neuropsychological tasks assessing emotional and social cognition. Reduced positive bias in emotion recognition was related to reduced contact with friends, household size and communication method during social isolation. In addition, reduced positive bias for attention to emotional faces was related to frequency of contact with friends during social isolation. Greater cooperative behaviour in an ultimatum game was associated with more frequent contact with both friends and family during social isolation.

These tasks are challenging and require an integrated knowledge of the complex processes that regulate gene expression and, ultimately, protein functionality in vivo, the effects of mutations/polymorphisms and the different sources of interindividual phenotypic variability. A remarkable example of our advances in these challenging tasks is the highly polymorphic CYP2D6 gene, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the metabolization of many of the most marketed drugs (including SARS-Cov-2 therapies such as hydroxychloroquine). Since the introduction of simple activity scores (AS) over 10 years ago, its ability to establish genotypeCphenotype correlations on the drug metabolizing capacity of this enzyme in human population has provided lessons that will help to improve this type of score for this, and likely many other human genes and proteins.

METHODS A549 cells were treated with influenza virus replicative intermediate dsRNA, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), or HADC small interfering RNA (siRNA). The changes in the cellular IL-6 promoter activities were detected by dual-luciferase assay, and IL-6 mRNA and protein expressions in the cells were determined using real-time RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS Influenza virus replicative intermediate dsRNA obviously up-regulated IL-6 expression in the cells. HDAC inhibitor TSA significantly enhanced the activity of IL-6 promoter and increased IL-6 mRNA expression in A549 cells, and HDAC3 may play an important role in this process. HDAC inhibitor TSA and DNMT inhibitor DAC showed no synergic effect in regulating IL-6 expression.

Overall, parents held mixed, though generally positive, attitudes toward childrens storytelling robots. In their estimation, these robots would outperform screen-based technologies for childrens story time. However, the robots potential to adapt and to express emotion caused some parents to feel ambivalent about the robots, which might hinder their adoption. We found three predictors of parental acceptance of these robots: context of use, perceived agency, and perceived intelligence. Parents speculation revealed an uncanny valley of AI: a nonlinear relation between the human likeness of the artificial agents mind and affinity for the agent.

Medical teachers quickly adapted with synchronous (i.e., online classes), and asynchronous (i.e., video-and other materials-based learning) method of delivering the content to the students. Aim: We aimed to explore the comparative preference of face-to-face lecture, synchronous, and asynchronous learning among Indian undergraduate medical students. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional nation-wide online survey in JulyCAugust 2020 with a snowball sampling technique. We collected response from undergraduate medical students who had attended both online classes and video-and other materials-based learning. Preference on the three modes of learning (namely, face-to-face lecture, online synchronous, and asynchronous) was recorded in a 10 point Likert-type scale. Obtained responses were statistically compared by analysis of variance with a P < 0.05 to be statistically significant. Results: A total of 695 (female = 304 (43.74%), male = 391 (56.26%)) entries were analyzed. Overall, traditional face-to-face lecture class was the most preferred method (8.68 1.49) followed by asynchronous (6.33  2.22) learning and then online classes (5.22  2.55, P < 0.0001). Perceived attention, interest, scope of learning, and possibility of interaction with the teachers were highest in face-to-face lecture. The scope of taking notes from all three modes was equal but the scope of formative assessment was highest with synchronous learning. The distraction was highest with asynchronous learning.

BACKGROUND In randomized controlled trials, erenumab demonstrated efficacy for migraine prevention in patients with 4 prior ineffective prophylactic migraine therapies. The \\"Migraine prevention with AimoviG: Informative Canadian real-world study\\" (MAGIC) assessed real-world effectiveness of erenumab in Canadian patients with migraine. METHODS MAGIC was a prospective open-label, observational study conducted in Canadian patients with chronic migraine (CM) and episodic migraine (EM) with two to six categories of prior ineffective prophylactic therapies. Participants were administered 70 mg or 140 mg erenumab monthly based on physician's assessment. Migraine attacks were self-assessed using an electronic diary and patient-reported outcome questionnaires. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects achieving 50% reduction in monthly migraine days (MMD) after the 3-month treatment period. RESULTS Among the 95 participants who mostly experienced two (54.7%) or three (32.6%) prior categories of ineffective prophylactic therapies and who initiated erenumab, treatment was generally safe and well tolerated; 89/95 (93.7%) participants initiated treatment with 140 mg erenumab. At week 12, 32/95 (33.7%) participants including 17/64 (26.6%) CM and 15/32 (48.4%) EM achieved 50% reduction in MMD while 30/86 (34.9%) participants including 19/55 (34.5%) CM and 11/31 (35.5%) EM achieved 50% reduction in MMD at week 24.

During a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a timely surveillance method is urgently needed to track the impact on public mental health. OBJECTIVE: This brief systematic review focused on the efficiency and quality of data collection of studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched the PubMed database using the following search strings: ((COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2)) AND ((Mental health) OR (psychological) OR (psychiatry)). We screened the titles, abstracts, and texts of the published papers to exclude irrelevant studies. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of each research paper. RESULTS: Our search yielded 37 relevant mental health surveys of the general public that were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, as of July 10, 2020. All these public mental health surveys were cross-sectional in design, and the journals efficiently made these articles available online in an average of 18.7 (range 1-64) days from the date they were received. The average duration of recruitment periods was 9.2 (range 2-35) days, and the average sample size was 5137 (range 100-56,679). However, 73% (27/37) of the selected studies had Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scores of <3 points, which suggests that these studies are of very low quality for inclusion in a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The studies examined in this systematic review used an efficient data collection method, but there was a high risk of bias, in general, among the existing public mental health surveys. Therefore, following recommendations to avoid selection bias, or employing novel methodologies considering both a longitudinal design and high temporal resolution, would help provide a strong basis for the formation of national mental health policies.","output":"Efficiency and Quality of Data Collection Among Public Mental Health Surveys Conducted During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral mucosa could be the first site infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Cthe causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new paramyxovirus from pteropid bats, Cedar virus (CedPV), which shares significant features with the known henipaviruses. The genome size (18,162 nt) and organization of CedPV is very similar to that of HeV and NiV; its nucleocapsid protein displays antigenic cross-reactivity with henipaviruses; and it uses the same receptor molecule (ephrin- B2) for entry during infection. Preliminary challenge studies with CedPV in ferrets and guinea pigs, both susceptible to infection and disease with known henipaviruses, confirmed virus replication and production of neutralizing antibodies although clinical disease was not observed. In this context, it is interesting to note that the major genetic difference between CedPV and HeV or NiV lies within the coding strategy of the P gene, which is known to play an important role in evading the host innate immune system. Unlike HeV, NiV, and almost all known paramyxoviruses, the CedPV P gene lacks both RNA editing and also the coding capacity for the highly conserved V protein.

The changes included an extended layoff between March and July as well as a shortened preseason. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the incidence and epidemiology of MLB injuries in the abbreviated 2020 season compared with prior seasons. We hypothesized that there was an increase in the overall injury rate in the 2020 season compared with the 2018-2019 seasons and that it equally affected all body regions. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: The MLB transactions database was queried to find players who had been placed on the injury list between 2018 and 2020. Injuries were categorized into upper extremity, lower extremity, spine/core, and other injuries. Incidence per 1000 athlete-exposures was calculated for the prior 2 seasons (2018-2019) and for the 2020 season separately. Incidence for each category was also calculated separately for pitchers and fielders. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and confidence intervals were used to compare injury rates in 2018-2019 versus 2020. The z test for proportions was used to determine significant differences between injury incidences. RESULTS: In 2020, the overall incidence rate per 1000 athlete-exposures was almost twice the rate compared with the 2 seasons before COVID-19 (8.66 vs 5.13; IRR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.53-1.87]; P < .001). Injury incidence increased similarly in 2020 for both pitchers (IRR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.47-1.91]; P < .001) and fielders (IRR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.45-1.96]; P < .001). Increases in injury incidence were seen in the upper extremity, spine/core, and other injury categories; however, the incidence of the lower extremity did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in injury incidence for both pitchers and fielders in 2020. Injury rates increased in anatomic zones of the upper extremity and spine/core but were not significantly changed in the lower extremity. The overall increase in injury rate suggests that irregular or insufficient sport-specific preparation prior to the start of the season placed athletes at a greater risk of injury when play resumed.","output":"Injury Rates in Major League Baseball During the 2020 COVID-19 Season"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with mental health of older adults during the pandemic and to provide strategies to mitigate their psychosocial impact in the elderly.

A main drawback of using IEX for NOM removal is the production of spent IEX regeneration brine, a polluting waste that is expensive to discharge. In this work, we studied ceramic nanofiltration as a treatment for the spent NOM-rich brine, with the aim to reduce the volume of this waste and to recycle salt. Compared to polymeric nanofiltration, the fouling was limited. When NOM is rejected and concentrated, a clean permeate with the regeneration salt (NaCl) could be produced and reused in the IEX regeneration process. Bench scale studies revealed that NOM could be effectively separated from the NaCl solution by steric effects. However, the separation of NaCl from other salts present in the brine, such as Na2SO4, was not sufficient for reuse purposes. The low sulphate rejection was mainly due to the low zeta potential of the membrane at the high ionic strength of the brine. The permeate of the ceramic nanofiltration should be treated further to obtain a sodium chloride quality that can be recycled as a regenerant solution for ion exchange.

The public were advised to avoid unnecessary hospital attendances and health professionals were advised to avoid aerosol-generating procedures wherever possible. The authors hypothesised that these measures would result in a reduction in the number of patients presenting to hospital with acute appendicitis and alter treatment choices. METHODS: A multicentred, prospective observational study was undertaken during April 2020 to identify adults treated for acute appendicitis. Searches of operative and radiological records were performed to identify patients treated during April 2018 and April 2019 for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were treated for acute appendicitis pre-lockdown compared with 64 patients treated during lockdown. Patients treated during the pandemic were more likely to have a higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (p = 0.049) and to have delayed their presentation to hospital (2 versus 3 days, p = 0.03). During the lockdown, the use of computed tomography (CT) increased from 36.3% to 85.9% (p < 0.001), the use of an antibiotic-only approach increased from 6.2% to 40.6% (p < 0.001) and the rate of laparoscopic appendicectomy reduced from 85.3% to 17.2% (p < 0.001). The negative appendicectomy rate decreased from 21.7% to 7.1% during lockdown (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with a decreased incidence of acute appendicitis and a significant shift in the management approach. The increased use of CT allows the identification of simple appendicitis for conservative treatment and decreases the negative appendicectomy rate.","output":"Where have all the appendicectomies gone?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To compare the patterns of 18 physical and mental health comorbidities between people with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) and people without diabetes and how these change by age, gender and deprivation over time between 2004 and 2014. Also, to develop a metric to identify most prevalent comorbidities in people with T2D. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Primary and secondary care, England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 108 588 people with T2D and 528 667 comparators registered in 391 English general practices. Each patient with T2D aged 16 years between January 2004 and December 2014 registered in Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD practices was matched to up to five comparators without diabetes on age, gender and general practice. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of 18 physical and mental health comorbidities in people with T2D and comparators categorised by age, gender and deprivation. Odds for association between T2D diagnosis and comorbidities versus comparators. A metric for comorbidities with prevalence of 5% and/or odds 2 in patients with T2D. RESULTS: Overall, 77% of patients with T2D had 1 comorbidity and all comorbidities were more prevalent in patients with T2D than in comparators. Across both groups, prevalence rates were higher in older people, women and those most socially deprived. Conditional logistic regression models fitted to estimate (OR, 95% CI) for association between T2D diagnosis and comorbidities showed that T2D diagnosis was significantly associated with higher odds for all conditions including myocardial infarction (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.46); heart failure (OR 2.12, 1.84 to 2.43); depression (OR 1.75, 1.62 to 1.89), but non-significant for cancer (OR 1.12, 0.98 to 1.28). In addition to cardiovascular disease, the metric identified osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, anxiety, schizophrenia and respiratory conditions as highly prevalent comorbidities in people with T2D. CONCLUSIONS: T2D diagnosis is associated with higher likelihood of experiencing other physical and mental illnesses. People with T2D are twice as likely to have cardiovascular disease as the general population. The findings highlight highly prevalent and under-reported comorbidities in people with T2D. These findings can inform future research and clinical guidelines and can have important implications on healthcare resource allocation and highlight the need for more holistic clinical care for people with recently diagnosed T2D.","output":"Eleven-year multimorbidity burden among 637 255 people with and without type 2 diabetes: a population-based study using primary care and linked hospitalisation data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"and accurate prediction of clean energy can supply an important reference for governments to formulate social and economic development policies. This paper begins with the logistic equation which is the whitening equation of the Verhulst model, introduces the Riccati equation with constant coefficients to optimize the whitening equation, and establishes a grey prediction model (CCRGM(1,1)) based on the Riccati equation. This model organically combines the characteristics of the grey model, and flexibly improves the modelling precision. Furthermore, the nonlinear term is optimized by the simulated annealing algorithm. To illustrate the validation of the new model, two kinds of clean energy consumption in the actual area are selected as the research objects. Compared with six other grey prediction models, CCRGM(1,1) model has the highest accuracy in simulation and prediction. Finally, this model is used to predict the nuclear and hydroelectricity energy consumption in North America from 2019 to 2028. The results predict that nuclear energy consumption will keep rising in the next decade, while hydroelectricity energy consumption will rise to a peak and subsequently fall back, which offers important information for the governments of North America to formulate energy measures.","output":"A novel riccati equation grey model and its application in forecasting clean energy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antiviral interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) are possibly responsible for the high tolerance of bats to zoonotic viruses.

In order to conservatively control infectious diseases, controlling the use of physical space was the most reliable method, but the strength and limitations of non-face-to-face classes began to become clear in architecture education due to physical restrictions for one year. For the efficient use of architectural educational spaces in the post-COVID 19 era, it is necessary to prepare a plan for use according to the social distancing stage. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the areas suitable for online space and the areas in which physical spaces should be used in architectural education, and then derive a plan that can effectively utilize the physical education space according to the social distancing stage. Interviews and surveys were conducted with 99 students and instructors in the Department of Architecture at Chungbuk National University, and through IPA analysis, it was intended to derive problems and utilization plans for architectural education after the COVID 19. As a result of the study, the problem of communication was one of the biggest problems in the practical education, and in the use of the practice space, the satisfaction of the process requiring physical space was the lowest.

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive mechanically ventilated adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and initiated on anticoagulation from February 1 ( st ) to May 31 ( st ) , 2020. The primary endpoint was 14-day mortality. Secondary endpoints included 30-day mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, major bleeding, and new thromboembolic event. Results: Of the 121 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, 33 in the therapeutic-dose group and 34 patients in the prophylactic-dose group were included in the final analysis. The therapeutic-dose group had a decreased 14-day mortality compared to the prophylaxis dose group (9.1% vs 41.2%, p=0.004). In addition, 30-day mortality was also lower in the therapeutic anticoagulation group (24.2% vs. 52.9%, p=0.024).

METHODS: A qualitative study design was adopted and the data was collected in stages between July and September 2019using an in-depth interview approach. The purposive and convenient sampling strategy was used to recruit the study participants. Sample size was limited by using the saturation point criteria. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 35 stakeholders including 13 physicians, 12 pharmacists and 10 patients participated in the study. The findings of the study were classified into five key themes and seven subthemes. The five themes included, impact of medicine shortages on patients, patients practices in response to medicine shortages, influence of medicines shortages on medical practice or pharmaceutical business, barriers to solutions for medicines shortages, and suggestions to assuage the impact of medicine shortages.This study showed that the medicine shortages had significant clinical and financial impact on patients. Patients opted for a number of risk-prone practices to avoid treatment disruption during shortages. An array of pharmaceutical market, medicines quality and patient related factors refrain physicians to switch from brand name medicine to generics and lead to ineffective management of medicines shortages.

BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG) or alum (Algel). METHODS: We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152 at 11 hospitals across India. Healthy adults aged 18-55 years who were deemed healthy by the investigator were eligible. Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one of three vaccine formulations (3 g with Algel-IMDG, 6 g with Algel-IMDG, or 6 g with Algel) or an Algel only control vaccine group. Block randomisation was done with a web response platform. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered on day 0 (the day of randomisation) and day 14. Primary outcomes were solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events at 2 h and 7 days after vaccination and throughout the full study duration, including serious adverse events. Secondary outcome was seroconversion (at least four-fold increase from baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated by intracellular staining and ELISpot. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04471519). FINDINGS: Between July 13 and 30, 2020, 827 participants were screened, of whom 375 were enrolled. Among the enrolled participants, 100 each were randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups, and 75 were randomly assigned to the control group (Algel only). After both doses, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported by 17 (17%; 95% CI 105-261) participants in the 3 g with Algel-IMDG group, 21 (21%; 138-305) in the 6 g with Algel-IMDG group, 14 (14%; 81-227) in the 6 g with Algel group, and ten (10%; 69-236) in the Algel-only group. The most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain (17 [5%] of 375 participants), headache (13 [3%]), fatigue (11 [3%]), fever (nine [2%]), and nausea or vomiting (seven [2%]). All solicited adverse events were mild (43 [69%] of 62) or moderate (19 [31%]) and were more frequent after the first dose. One serious adverse event of viral pneumonitis was reported in the 6 g with Algel group, unrelated to the vaccine. Seroconversion rates (%) were 879, 919, and 828 in the 3 g with Algel-IMDG, 6 g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 g with Algel groups, respectively. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in a subset of 16 participants from both Algel-IMDG groups. INTERPRETATION: BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses.

The onset of pandemic influenza viruses might be attributed to various ambient meteorological factors including temperature, relative humidity (Rh), and PM(1) concentrations, etc. The study aims to explore the correlation between the seasonality of pandemic influenza and these factors. METHODS: We recruited pediatric patients aged from 0 to 18 years who were diagnosed with influenza A or B from July 1st, 2017 to June 30th, 2019 in Shanghai Childrens Medical Centre (SCMC). Ambient meteorological data were collected from the Shanghai Meteorological Service (SMS) over the same period. The correlation of influenza outbreak and meteorological factors were analyzed through preliminary Pearsons r correlation test and subsequent time-series Poisson regression analysis using the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM). RESULTS: Pearsons r test showed a statistically significant correlation between the weekly number of influenza A outpatients and ambient meteorological factors including weekly mean, maximum, minimum temperature and barometric pressure (P < 0.001), and PM(1) (P < 0.01). While the weekly number of influenza B outpatients was statistically significantly correlated with weekly mean, maximum and minimum temperature (P < 0.001), barometric pressure and PM(1) (P < 0.01), and minimum Rh (P < 0.05). Mean temperature and PM(1) were demonstrated to be the statistically significant variables in the DLNM with influenza A and B outpatients through time-series Poisson regression analysis. A U-shaped curve relationship was noted between the mean temperature and influenza A cases (below 15 C and above 20 C), and the risks increased for influenza B with mean temperature below 10 C. PM(1) posed a risk after a concentration of 23 ppm for both influenza A and B. High PM(1), low and the high temperature had significant effects upon the number of influenza A cases, whereas low temperature and high PM(1) had significant effects upon the number of influenza B cases. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that mean temperature and PM(1) were the primary factors that were continually associated with the seasonality of pediatric pandemic influenza A and B and the recurrence in the transmission and spread of influenza viruses.","output":"The association between the seasonality of pediatric pandemic influenza virus outbreak and ambient meteorological factors in Shanghai"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The progressive development in online healthcare monitoring may facilitate better service for recovered patients from some pandemic diseases like the novel Covid-19 and even in well-known diseases such as cancer, heart attack, and many more.

The purpose of this study was to compare downstream medical utilization-based outcomes (costs, visits, recurrent episodes) after an initial diagnosis of patellofemoral pain based on pre-injury utilization of opioids. METHOD A total of 85,7880 consecutive patients were followed for a full 12 months before and 24 months after an initial diagnosis of patellofemoral pain (January 2009 to December 2013). Data were sourced from the Military Health System Data Repository, a single-payer closed government system. Opioid prescription fills were identified, and medical visits and costs were calculated for all knee-related medical care, to include recurrence rates in the 2-year surveillance period. RESULTS A relatively small number of individuals filled an opioid prescription in the year prior (n = 1746; 2.0%); however, these individuals had almost twice the mean costs of knee-related medical care ($1557 versus %802) and medical visits (8.4 versus 4.0). Patients with prior opioid use were more likely to have at least 1 recurrent episode of knee pain (relative risk 1.58, 95% CI 1.51, 1.65) with a higher mean number of episodes of knee pain (1.5 vs 1.8). The use of opioids with higher risk of misuse or dependency (Schedule II or III) resulted in greater medical costs (for any reason) and recurrent episodes of knee pain compared to the use of opioids in a lower risk category (Schedule IV). CONCLUSIONS Prior opioid utilization was associated with a greater number of recurrent episodes of knee pain and higher downstream medical costs compared with individuals without prior opioid use. For individuals with prior opioid utilization, opioids with higher risk of misuse or dependency (Schedule II or III) resulted in greater medical costs (for any reason) and recurrent episodes compared to the use of lower-risk opioids (Schedule IV). Key Points ? Patients with prior opioid use had much greater knee-related medical costs compared to patients without prior opioid use. ? Patients with prior opioid use were more likely to have additional episodes of knee pain in the following 2 years compared to patients without prior opioid use. ? Prior opioid use has predicted higher costs and poor outcomes after surgery, but this is the first study to confirm similar findings in non-surgical patients.","output":"The influence of prior opioid use on healthcare utilization and recurrence rates for non-surgical patients seeking initial care for patellofemoral pain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate psychological distress among infectious disease (ID) physicians during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the Republic of Korea.

A two-wave longitudinal survey with the general population in mainland China in mid-2020 found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, internet and social media use intensity promoted the adoption of nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical antipandemic measures. The first wave of data (n = 1014) showed that the more intensively people used the internet/social media, the more they perceived the threat of the pandemic, and took more nonpharmaceutical preventive measures (e.g., wearing masks, maintaining social distance, and washing hands) as a result. The second wave (n = 220) showed firstly the predicted relationship between internet/social media use intensity and the perceived threat of the pandemic and the adoption of nonpharmaceutical preventive measures by cross-lagged analysis; secondly, the predictive effect of internet/social media use on the adoption of pharmacological measures (i.e., willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19) and the mediating role of perceived pandemic threat were verified.

The present study was performed in an attempt to improve the specificity of current commercial rotavirus and adenovirus EIAs without significant loss of sensitivity by optimizing the cut-off value. A collective of 174 stool samples obtained from children suffering from acute gastroenteritis was tested. Electron microscopy (EM) and PAGE were used as reference methods for rotavirus detection. For the evaluation of the adenovirus kits, virus isolation in cell culture and the polymerase chain reaction served as reference standards. The highest sensitivity for rotavirus and adenovirus detection was achieved by the Ridascreen(R) Rotavirus and Ridascreen Adenovirus. However, the Ridascreen(R) Rotavirus and Ridascreen Adenovirus produced the highest number of false-positive results (n = 9) for each rotavirus and adenovirus detection. Cross-reactivities to coronaviruses and reoviruses were observed with the rotavirus antigen EIAs. For Rotazyme II, Ridascreen Rotavirus and Ridascreen Adenovirus, the specificity could be markedly increased without loss of sensitivity by doubling the cut-off value. For the alternative immunoassays, which were overall more specific, it was not possible to significantly decrease the rate of false-positive results without impairment of sensitivity by raising the cut-off value. In conclusion, at least for some rotavirus and adenovirus antigen EIAs, the cut-off value set by the manufacturer may not permit an optimal differentiation between true-positive and -negative samples. By raising the cut-off value from 50 to 100%, the specificity of two rotavirus antigen and one adenovirus antigen EIA can be improved markedly without significant loss of sensitivity.","output":"Improvement of the specificity of enzyme immunoassays for the detection of rotavirus and adenovirus in fecal specimens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Noise is one of the fastest growing and most ubiquitous type of environmental pollution, with prevalence in cities The COVID-19 confinement in 2020 in Colombia led to a reduction in human activities and their associated noise We used this unique opportunity to measure the impacts of noise on urban soundscapes, and explore the effects of urbanization intensity independently of human activity We launched a community science initiative inviting participants to collect audio recordings from their windows using smartphones Recordings were taken during severe mobility restrictions (April), and during a period of lightened restrictions (MayCJune) From the data collected, we measured changes in sound pressure levels (SPL), acoustic structure (soundscape spectro-temporal characteristics), and human perception between the two periods A 12% increase in human activities had a detectable acoustic footprint, with a significant increase of SPL (2 15 dB, 128% increase), a shift towards dominance of low-frequency broadband signals, and a perceived dominance of human-made over wildlife sounds Measured changes in SPL and acoustic structure were directly proportional to urbanization;however, perception of these changes was not This gap may be associated with a masking effect generated by noise or a disconnect of humans from nature in large cities The mobility restrictions created a chance to better understand the impacts of urbanization and human activities on the soundscape, while raising public awareness regarding noise pollution effects on people and wildlife Information analyzed here might serve in urban planning in developing countries where urban expansion is occurring in a rapid, unplanned fashion","output":"Listening to cities during the COVID-19 lockdown: How do human activities and urbanization impact soundscapes in Colombia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo O presente estudo tem como objetivo estimar o impacto da COVID-19 na mortalidade de idosos institucionalizados no Brasil Foram estimados nmeros de bitos pela doen?a para o Pas, Unidades da Federao e Regi?es, com base nas estimativas calculadas e efetuadas neste trabalho do percentual de bitos de idosos que ocorreriam em instituies de longa permanncia de acordo com os totais Essa estimativa foi baseada em informaes disponveis para uma srie de pases O percentual ponderado foi de 44,7% Estimaram-se 107 538 bitos de idosos nestas instituies no Brasil em 2020, por COVID-19 S?o previstos maiores nmeros de bitos na Regi?o Sudeste (48 779 bitos), seguida da Regi?o Nordeste (28 451 bitos);S?o Paulo  a Unidade da Federao que na estimativa ser mais afetada (24 500 bitos) Fica claro o forte impacto da COVID-19 na populao idosa residente em instituies de longa permanncia para idosos As estimativas ultrapassam para o pas 100 mil idosos, potencialmente os mais frgeis e vulnerveis, e s?o baseadas em nmero de bitos totais conservador, tendo em vista outras estimativas e a situao alarmante de crescimento dos nmeros de bitos no Brasil The COVID-19 pandemic poses difficulties for long-term care institutions for the elderly, with increased mortality rates for the residents This study aims to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on mortality of institutionalized elderly in Brazil Estimates of the percentage of elderly deaths occurring in care homes were calculated for Brazil, States and Regions using estimates for the total number of deaths The estimation was based upon information available for other countries The weighted percentage was 44 7% and 107,538 COVID-19 deaths were estimated for the elderly in these institutions in Brazil in 2020 Higher numbers of deaths were expected in the Southeast Region (48,779 deaths), followed by the Northeast Region (28,451 deaths);S?o Paulo was the most affected State (24,500 deaths) The strong impact of COVID-19 on the elderly population living in long-term care facilities is clear Estimates for the country exceeded 100,000 elderly people, potentially the most fragile and vulnerable, and are based upon a conservative number of total deaths, in view of other estimates and the alarming situation of death growth in Brazil from COVID-19","output":"Estimates of the impact of COVID-19 on mortality of institutionalized elderly in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Excessive fructose intake is associated with the increased risk of mental illness, such as depression, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.

Here, we found that chronic stress aggravated these pathological changes and promoted the development of depressive-like behaviors in FruD mice. In detail, the decreased number of newborn neurons, mature neurons and neural stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampus of FruD mice was worsened by chronic stress. Furthermore, chronic stress exacerbated the damage of BBB integrity with the decreased expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin-5 and occludin in brain vasculature, overactivated microglia and increased neuroinflammation in FruD mice. These results suggest that high fructose intake combined with chronic stress leads to cumulative negative effects that promote the development of depressive-like behaviors in mice. Of note, SCFAs could rescue hippocampal neurogenesis decline, improve BBB damage and suppress microglia activation and neuroinflammation, thereby ameliorate depressive-like behaviors of FruD mice exposed to chronic stress.

We sought to evaluate the prognostic role of estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV), a marker of arterial stiffness which reflects overall arterial integrity and aging, in risk stratification of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study, analyzed a total population of 1671 subjects consisting of 737 hospitalized COVID-19 patients consecutively recruited from two tertiary centers (Newcastle cohort: n = 471 and Pisa cohort: n = 266) and a non-COVID control cohort (n = 934). Arterial stiffness was calculated using validated formulae for ePWV. ePWV progressively increased across the control group, COVID-19 survivors and deceased patients (adjusted mean increase per group 1.89 m/s, P < 0.001). Using a machine learning approach, ePWV provided incremental prognostic value and improved reclassification for mortality over the core model including age, sex and comorbidities [AUC (core model + ePWV vs. core model) = 0.864 vs. 0.755]. ePWV provided similar prognostic value when pulse pressure or hs-Troponin were added to the core model or over its components including age and mean blood pressure (p < 0.05 for all). The optimal prognostic ePWV value was 13.0 m/s. ePWV conferred additive discrimination (AUC: 0.817 versus 0.779, P < 0.001) and reclassification value (NRI = 0.381, P < 0.001) over the 4C Mortality score, a validated score for predicting mortality in COVID-19 and the Charlson comorbidity index.

Since its spread in humans, secondary host jumps of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to multiple domestic and wild populations of mammals have been documented. Understanding the extent of adaptation to these animal hosts is critical for assessing the threat that the spillback of animal-adapted SARS-CoV-2 into humans poses. We compare the genomic landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from animal species to that in humans, profiling the mutational biases indicative of potentially different selective pressures in animals. We focus on viral genomes isolated from mink (Neovison vison) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for which multiple independent outbreaks driven by onward animal-to-animal transmission have been reported. We identify five candidate mutations for animal-specific adaptation in mink (NSP9_G37E, Spike_F486L, Spike_N501T, Spike_Y453F, ORF3a_L219V), and one in deer (NSP3a_L1035F), though they appear to confer a minimal advantage for human-to-human transmission. No considerable changes to the mutation rate or evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted from circulation in mink and deer thus far. Our findings suggest that minimal adaptation was required for onward transmission in mink and deer following human-to-animal spillover, highlighting the generalist nature of SARS-CoV-2 as a mammalian pathogen.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals and potential host adaptation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite recent achievements in vaccines, antiviral drugs, and medical infrastructure, the emergence of COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to humans worldwide. Most countries are well connected on a global scale, making it nearly impossible to implement perfect and prompt mitigation strategies for infectious disease outbreaks. In particular, due to the explosive growth of international travel, the complex network of human mobility enabled the rapid spread of COVID-19 globally. OBJECTIVE: South Korea was one of the earliest countries to be affected by COVID-19. In the absence of vaccines and treatments, South Korea has implemented and maintained stringent interventions, such as large-scale epidemiological investigations, rapid diagnosis, social distancing, and prompt clinical classification of severely ill patients with appropriate medical measures. In particular, South Korea has implemented effective airport screenings and quarantine measures. In this study, we aimed to assess the country-specific importation risk of COVID-19 and investigate its impact on the local transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: The country-specific importation risk of COVID-19 in South Korea was assessed. We investigated the relationships between country-specific imported cases, passenger numbers, and the severity of country-specific COVID-19 prevalence from January to October 2020. We assessed the country-specific risk by incorporating country-specific information. A renewal mathematical model was employed, considering both imported and local cases of COVID-19 in South Korea. Furthermore, we estimated the basic and effective reproduction numbers. RESULTS: The risk of importation from China was highest between January and February 2020, while that from North America (the United States and Canada) was high from April to October 2020. The R0 was estimated at 1.87 (95% CI 1.47-2.34), using the rate of &#945;=0.07 for secondary transmission caused by imported cases. The Rt was estimated in South Korea and in both Seoul and Gyeonggi. CONCLUSIONS: A statistical model accounting for imported and locally transmitted cases was employed to estimate R0 and Rt. Our results indicated that the prompt implementation of airport screening measures (contact tracing with case isolation and quarantine) successfully reduced local transmission caused by imported cases despite passengers arriving from high-risk countries throughout the year. Moreover, various mitigation interventions, including social distancing and travel restrictions within South Korea, have been effectively implemented to reduce the spread of local cases in South Korea.","output":"Risk Assessment of Importation and Local Transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea: Statistical Modeling Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in children is usually mild but some are susceptible to a Kawasaki disease (KD)-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in the convalescent stage, posing a need to differentiate the phenotype, susceptibility, autoimmunity, and immunotherapy between KD and MIS-C, particularly in the upcoming mass vaccination of COVID-19. Patients with MIS-C are prone to gastrointestinal symptoms, coagulopathy, and shock in addition to atypical KD syndrome with fever, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, and/or cardiovascular events. MIS-C manifests KD-like symptoms that alert physicians to early recognize and adopt the KD treatment regimen for patients with MIS-C. MIS-C linked to COVID-19 teaches us infection-associated autoimmune vasculitis and vice versa. Studies on genetic susceptibility have identified certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and toll-like receptor (TLR) associated with KD and/or COVID-19. Certain HLA subtypes, such as HLA-DRB1 and HLA-MICA A4 are associated with KD. HLA-B*46:01 is proposed to be the risk allele of severe COVID-19 infection, and blood group O type is a protective factor of COVID-19. The autoimmune vasculitis of KD, KD shock syndrome (KDSS), or MIS-C is mediated by a genetic variant of HLA, Fc?3R, and/or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) resulting in hyperinflammation with T helper 17 (Th17)/Treg imbalance with augmented Th17/Th1 mediators: interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, inducible protein-10 (IP-10), Interferon (IFN?3), and IL-17A, and lower expression of Treg-signaling molecules, FoxP3, and transforming growth factor (TGF-?). There are certain similarities and differences in phenotypes, susceptibility, and pathogenesis of KD, KDSS, and MIS-C, by which a physician can make early protection, prevention, and precision treatment of the diseases. The evolution of immunotherapies for the diseases has shown that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) alone or combined with corticosteroids is the standard treatment for KD, KDSS, and MIS-C. However, a certain portion of patients who revealed a treatment resistance to IVIG or IVIG plus corticosteroids, posing a need to early identify the immunopathogenesis, to protect hosts with genetic susceptibility, and to combat Th17/Treg imbalance by anti-cytokine or pro-Treg for reversal of the hyperinflammation and IVIG resistance.

This study presents a preliminary validation of the fear of the COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) using a sub-Saharan African population from Nigeria. METHODS: Three hundred and eighty-nine people responded from a total of 1000 invitees. The participants were requested to fill a web-based (Google forms) FCV-19S questionnaire. The responses, together with their socio-demographic data, were analysed using descriptive statistics and a confirmatory factor analysis.

The focus lies on a particular model, developed in the late 1920s through a collaboration of the former field-epidemiologists and medical officer, Wade Hampton Frost, and the biostatistician and population ecologist Lowell Reed. Other than former approaches to epidemic theory in mathematical formula, the Reed-Frost epidemic theory was materialised in a simple mechanical analogue: a box with coloured marbles and a wooden trough. The article reconstructs how the introduction of this mechanical model has reshaped epidemiological reasoning by shifting the field from purely descriptive to analytical practices. It was not incidental that the history of this model coincided with the foundation of epidemiology as an academic discipline, as it valorised and institutionalised new theoretical contributions to the field. Through its versatility, the model shifted the fields focus from mono-causal explanations informed by bacteriology, eugenics or sanitary perspectives towards the systematic consideration of epidemics as a set of interdependent and dynamic variables.","output":"A box, a trough and marbles: How the Reed-Frost epidemic theory shaped epidemiological reasoning in the 20th century"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relaxation and diffusion NMR measurements offer an approach to studying rotational and translational motion of molecules non-invasively, and they also provide chemical resolution complementary to NMR spectra.

This so-called ultrafast Laplace NMR approach shortens the experiment time to a fraction and makes even single-scan experiments possible. Single-scan experiments, in turn, significantly facilitate the use of nuclear spin hyperpolarization methods to boost sensitivity. The ultrafast Laplace NMR method is also applicable with low-field, mobile NMR instruments, and it can be exploited in many disciplines.

METHODS: Between November 2015 and September 2016, Veterans with incident stage I, II, or III CRC completed a mailed survey to assess perceived barriers to recommended care. Participants who reported difficulty with transportation to or from CRC care appointments were categorized as experiencing transportation barriers. We assessed pairwise correlations between transportation barriers, transportation-related factors (e.g., mode of travel), and chaotic lifestyle (e.g., predictability of schedules), and used logistic regression to examine the association between the reporting of transportation difficulties, distance traveled to the nearest Veterans Affairs (VA) facility, and life chaos. RESULTS: Of the 115 Veterans included in this analysis, 18% reported experiencing transportation barriers. Distance to the VA was not strongly correlated with the reporting of transportation barriers (Spearmans  = 0.12, p = 0.19), but chaotic lifestyle was both positively and significantly correlated with experiencing transportation barriers (Spearmans  = 0.22, p = 0.02). Results from the logistic regression model modestly supported the findings from the pairwise correlations, but were not statistically significant.

An induced-fit mechanism is usually taken by these polymerases upon NTP/dNTP substrate binding, leading to active site closure and formation of a phosphodiester bond. In viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, the post-chemistry translocation is stringently controlled by a structurally conserved motif, resulting in asymmetric movement of the template-product duplex. This perspective focuses on viral RdRP NAC and related mechanisms that have not been structurally clarified to date. Firstly, RdRP movement along the template strand in the absence of catalytic events may be relevant to catalytic complex dissociation or proofreading. Secondly, pyrophosphate or non-cognate NTP-mediated cleavage of the product strand 3-nucleotide can also play a role in reactivating paused or arrested catalytic complexes. Furthermore, non-cognate NTP substrates, including NTP analog inhibitors, can not only alter NAC when being misincorporated, but also impact on subsequent NACs. Complications and challenges related to these topics are also discussed.","output":"Within and Beyond the Nucleotide Addition Cycle of Viral RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This study aimed to evaluate psychological distress of persons in quarantine and compare the same with a group of persons, who are currently in lockdown Methodology Forty-four persons in quarantine and 45 subjects currently in lockdown were evaluated on Depression Anxiety Stress Scale II Results About three-fourth (77 3%) of the participants in the quarantine group and one-third (37 8%) in the comparator group had depression About one fourth (22 7%) in the quarantine group and one-third (35 6%) in the lockdown group had anxiety Conclusion The present study suggests that lockdown and being in quarantine are associated with significantly higher psychiatric morbidity, especially anxiety","output":"Psychological Morbidity among People in Quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Lipid droplets (LDs) present in land plants serve as an essential energy and carbon reserve for seed germination and seedling development. Oleosins, the most abundant structural proteins of LDs, comprise a small family involved in LD formation, stabilization and degradation. Despite their importance, our knowledge on oleosins is still poor in Euphorbiaceae, a large plant family that contains several important oil-bearing species. RESULTS To uncover lineage-specific evolution of oleosin genes in Euphorbiaceae, in this study, we performed a genome-wide identification and comprehensive comparison of the oleosin family in Euphorbiaceae species with available genome sequences, i.e. castor bean (Ricinus communis), physic nut (Jatropha curcas), tung tree (Vernicia fordii), Mercurialis annua, cassava (Manihot esculenta) and rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), and a number of five, five, five, five, eight and eight members were found, respectively. Synteny analysis revealed one-to-one collinear relationship of oleosin genes between the former four (i.e. castor bean, physic nut, tung tree and M. annua) as well as latter two species (i.e. cassava and rubber tree), whereas one-to-one and one-to-two collinear relationships were observed between physic nut and cassava, reflecting the occurrence of one recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) in the last common ancestor of cassava and rubber tree. The presence of five ortholog groups representing three previously defined clades (i.e. U, SL and SH) dates back at least to the Malpighiales ancestor, because they are also conserved in poplar (Populus trichocarpa), a tree having experienced one Salicaceae-specific recent WGD. As observed in poplar, WGD was shown to be the main driver for the family expansion in both cassava and rubber tree. Nevertheless, same retention patterns of WGD-derived duplicates observed in cassava and rubber tree are somewhat different from that of poplar, though certain homologous fragments are still present in rubber tree. Further transcriptional profiling revealed an apparent seed-predominant expression pattern of oleosin genes in physic nut, castor bean and rubber tree. Moreover, structure and expression divergence of paralogous pairs were also observed in both cassava and rubber tree. CONCLUSION Comparative genomics analysis of oleosin genes reported in this study improved our knowledge on lineage-specific family evolution in Euphorbiaceae, which also provides valuable information for further functional analysis and utilization of key members and their promoters.","output":"Genomic insights into lineage-specific evolution of the oleosin family in Euphorbiaceae."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates how a CEO's early-life experience of the Great Chinese Famine affects corporate accounting conservatism.

GCOs have been shown to precede consolidations. Quantitative characterization of these regions using radiomics can facilitate accurate diagnosis, disease progression and response to treatment. However, according to the knowledge of the author, regional CT radiomics analysis of COVID-19 patients has not been carried out. This study aims to address these by determining the radiomics features that can characterize each of the regions separately and can distinguish the regions from each other. Methods: 44 radiomics features were generated with four quantization levels for 23 CT slice of 17 patients. Two approaches were the implemented to determine the features that can differentiate between lung regions: 1) Z-score and correlation heatmaps and 2) one way ANOVA for finding statistically significantly difference (p<0.05) between the regions. Radiomics features that show agreement for all cases (Z-score, correlation and statistical significant test) were selected as suitable features. The features were then tested on 52 CT images. Results: 10 radiomics features were found to be the most suitable among 44 features. When applied on the test images, they can differentiate between GCO, consolidation and pleural effusion successfully and the difference provided by these 10 features between three lung regions are statistically significant. Conclusion: The ten robust radiomics features can be useful in extracting quantitative data from CT lung images to characterize the disease in the patient, which in turn can help in more accurate diagnosis, staging the severity of the disease and allow the clinician to plan for more successful personalized treatment for COVID-19 patients. They can also be used for monitoring the progression of COVID-19 and response to therapy for clinical trials.","output":"Determination of Robust Regional CT Radiomics Features for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the last months and following the implementation of containment measures in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses radically decreased in Liege AIDS Reference Center, Belgium.

MethodsNational online longitudinal survey. As part of a June 2020 survey, participants (n=1370) were asked In your life, have you experienced any positive effects from the COVID-19 pandemic (yes/no), with a free-text explanation if yes, and also completed the WHO-Five well-being index. Differences were explored by demographic variables. Free-text responses were thematically coded. Results960 participants (70%) reported experiencing at least one positive effect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living with others (p=.045) and employment situation (p<.001) at baseline (April), were associated with experiencing positive effects. Individuals working for pay from home were more likely to experience positive effects compared to those who were not working for pay (aOR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.32, 0.63, p<.001), or who were working for pay outside the home (aOR=0.40, 95%CI: 0.28, 0.58, p<.001). Age and education were not associated with positive effects when controlling for employment and household numbers. There was an overall effect of gender (p=.001), where those identifying as female were more likely than males (aOR=1.62, 95%CI: 1.25, 2.09) to report experiencing a positive effect. 54.2% of participants reported a sufficient level of wellbeing, 23.2% low wellbeing and a further 22.6% very low wellbeing. Of those experiencing positives, 945/960 (98%) provided an explanation. The three most common themes were Family time (33%), Work flexibility (29%), and Calmer life (19%). ConclusionA large proportion of surveyed Australians reported positive effects resulting from changes to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Enhancing these aspects may build community resilience to cope with future pandemic responses.

METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter, descriptive study included 83 patients with CRS from three hospitals in Wuhan. RESULTS: In COVID-19 patients with CRS, the fatality rate was even higher in CRRT group (P=0.005). However, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, neutrophil counts, and D-dimer decreased after CRRT (P<0.05). Results of Lasso model showed that tracheotomy (? -1.31) and convalescent plasma (? -1.41) were the protective factors.

We aimed to identify the relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy theories, general attitudes towards vaccines, current COVID-19 vaccine factors and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Methods: The present research is a multi-province cross-sectional study design. Survey data was collected in May and June 2021 (n=4905) in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec. Multivariate ordinal regression models were used to assess the association between vaccine hesitant profiles and COVID-19 conspiracy theories, general attitudes towards vaccines, and specific factors pertaining to COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Participants were aged 18 to 40 years and 59% were women. Individuals with low income, low educational attainment, and/or who are unemployed were more likely to be vaccine hesitant. COVID-19 conspiracy theory beliefs and general attitudes towards vaccines are significantly associated with greater hesitancy for the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine factors including pro-vaccine actions and opinions of friends and family and trust in scientists and government are associated with less vaccine hesitancy. Conclusion: Conspiracy theories are distinct from criticism and concerns regarding the vaccine. Nevertheless, poverty, low level of education and distrust are associated with higher odds of being vaccine hesitant .

The spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19 has led to a forced and rapid transition of educational institutions, including law universities, to distance learning, which has become its predominant and even exclusive form in some periods. The research purpose is to study the features of the transition from traditional to distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the opinions of students and teachers at a law university. Materials and methods. The survey was attended by the teaching staff and students of Kutafin Moscow State Law University. In June 2020, eighty (80) teachers and sixty-five (65) students and in December 2020 - one hundred and thirty (130) teachers and four hundred and sixty-three (463) students took part in the survey. The survey was conducted remotely using Google Forms. Methods of mathematical statistics were used: descriptive methods (percentages, graphical data presentation), Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Research results. The forced large-scale transition of practicing lawyers to the work with digital technologies in the context of the spread of coronavirus infection revealed the lack of digital competencies in many of them and demonstrated the need to prepare law students for future work in the digital environment. A two-stage survey of teachers and students at a law university made it possible to reveal a significant change in attitudes towards the electronic educational environment and distance learning technologies. An improvement in the quality of education in the second period was noted by 43.0% of students and 41.5% of teachers. Due to the transition to learning with the use of distance learning technologies, teachers began to communicate more often with students and colleagues (r = 0.203;p < 0.05), as a result of which the emotional perception of the educational process in many teachers changed for the better (r = 0.236;p < 0.01). Discussion and conclusion. Learning with the use of distance learning technologies allows students to form new digital competencies that are necessary and in demand in the modern world.

Lipid messengers constitute one of the four major classes of second messengers. The hydrolysis of two main classes of lipids, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, generate parallel profiles of lipid second messengers: phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) versus ceramide, ceramide-1-phosphate, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, respectively. In this review, we examine the mechanisms by which these lipid second messengers modulate aldosterone production at multiple levels. Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone responsible for maintaining fluid volume, electrolyte balance, and blood pressure homeostasis. Primary aldosteronism is a frequent endocrine cause of secondary hypertension. A thorough understanding of the signaling events regulating aldosterone biosynthesis may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. The cumulative evidence in this literature emphasizes the critical roles of PA, DAG, and sphingolipid metabolites in aldosterone synthesis and secretion. However, it also highlights the gaps in our knowledge, such as the preference for phospholipase D-generated phosphatidic acid or diacylglycerol, as well as the need for further investigation to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which these lipid second messengers regulate optimal aldosterone production.","output":"THE ROLE OF LIPID SECOND MESSENGERS IN ALDOSTERONE SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and study aims The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine medical care due to uncertainty regarding the risk of viral spread.

Telemedicine (TM) offers invaluable support to patient follow-up, guaranteeing the prompt availability of a team of experts for persons with epilepsy (PWE) widely distributed across the country. Although many health institutions have endorsed the use of TM, robust data on effectiveness, safety and costs of TM applied to epilepsy are lacking. TELEmedicine for EPIlepsy Care (TELE-EPIC) will evaluate the effectiveness of video consultation (VC) via TM compared with usual care (UC) for the monitoring of PWE (TELE-EPIC_RCT). Moreover, TELE-EPIC will apply an innovative Volumetric Absorptive Microsampling (VAMS) device for quantitation of ASM through finger prick blood sampling as an alternative to venipuncture sampling (TELE-EPIC_VAMS). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: TELE-EPIC_RCT is a multicentre, open, pragmatic two-arm randomised controlled trial prospectively including adult and paediatric outpatients with established diagnosis of epilepsy consecutively attending the Epilepsy Centres of Bologna and Rome, respectively. The primary outcome is the non-inferiority of VC on seizure control compared with UC after an 18-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are adherence to treatment, ASM-related adverse events, quality of life, mood disorders, patient and caregiver satisfaction, safety and costs. TELE-EPIC_VAMS is a cross-validation study for blood ASM quantitation through a novel, VAMS-based device, comparing (1) VAMS versus plasma samples (reference standard method); and (2) nurse-collected versus self-collected blood by VAMS device.

This is particularly important for preterm infants who are highly susceptible to intestinal dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We hypothesized that HMO supplementation of infant formula (IF) improves intestinal function, bacterial colonization and NEC resistance immediately after preterm birth, as tested in a preterm pig model. Mixtures of HMOs were investigated in intestinal epithelial cells and in preterm pigs (n=112) fed IF supplemented without (CON) or with a mixture of four HMOs (4-HMO) or >25 HMOs (25-HMO, 5-10 g/L given for 5 or 11 days). The 25-HMO blend decreased cell proliferation and both HMO blends decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-8 secretion in IPEC-J2 cells, relative to control (P<.05). All HMOs were found in urine and feces of HMO-treated pigs, and short-chain fatty acids in the colon were higher in HMO vs. CON pigs (P<.05). After 5 days, NEC lesions were similar between HMO and CON pigs and 25-HMO increased colon weights (P<.01). After 11 days, the 4-HMO diet did not affect NEC (56 vs. 79%, P=.2) but increased dehydration and diarrhea (P<.05) and expression of immune-related genes (IL10, IL12, TGF, TLR4; P<.05).

Longer-term exposure to HMOs may be required to improve the immature intestinal function in formula-fed preterm neonates.","output":"Human milk oligosaccharide effects on intestinal function and inflammation after preterm birth in pigs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the new coronavirus infection, is becoming increasingly important in clinical and epidemiological contexts. Despite this, there are significant complexities in the implementation of viral load quantitative measurement into clinical practice due to the limited approaches to its assessment. The aim of this work was to develop an approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral load analysis by the value of sample threshold cycles (Ct) relative to the Ct of the internal control sample obtained in routine PCR diagnostics of the COVID-19, and to use this approach for quantitative monitoring of viral load in patients with first positive SARS-CoV-2 test from the Irkutsk region. Materials and methods. Using regression models based on the least squares method, an approach to determine the number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 1 ml of nasopharyngeal secretion was developed. The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal samples obtained from 1370 patients from Irkutsk and Angarsk with primary diagnosed positive PCR result in the period from July 1 to November 10, 2020. Results. A tenfold increase in the average monthly viral load among patients in September-October 2020 was revealed. We assume that the change in the epidemiological pattern of the spread of the new coronavirus infection during this period is associated with an increase in the number of contacts in the population due to the school year beginning. Higher viral loads are observed in populations at risk for COVID-19 - among healthcare workers and adults/elderly patients. Conclusion. The development of a standardized quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples can be a predictive clinical marker and a reliable tool for improving COVID-19 surveillance using the proposed approach to assess average viral load in a local population. ? 2021 Acta Biomedica Scientifica.

Point-of-care molecular diagnostics, which often lack the complete functionality of their high throughput laboratory counterparts, are particularly susceptible to this type of disruption, which can result in false negative results. To address this challenge, we have developed a robust Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification assay with single tube multiplexed multi-target redundancy and an internal amplification control. A convenient and cost-effective target specific fluorescence detection system allows amplifications to be grouped by signal using adaptable probes for pooled reporting of SARS-COV-2 target amplifications or differentiation of the Internal Amplification Control. Over the course of the pandemic, primer coverage of viral lineages by the three redundant sub-assays has varied from assay to assay as they have diverged from the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate sequence, but aggregate coverage has remained high for all variant sequences analyzed, with a minimum of 97.4% (Variant of Interest: Eta). In three instances (Delta, Gamma, Eta), a high frequency mismatch with one of the three sub-assays was observed, but overall coverage remained high due to multi-target redundancy. When challenged with extracted human samples the multiplexed assay showed 100% sensitivity for samples containing greater than 30 copies of viral RNA per reaction, and 100% specificity. These results are further evidence that conventional laboratory methodologies can be leveraged at the point-of-care for robust performance and diagnostic stability over time.","output":"Multiplex Target-Redundant RT-LAMP for Robust Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Using Fluorescent Universal Displacement Probes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Previous studies suggested a potential link of maternal thyroid dysfunction with adverse neurocognitive outcomes and impaired development of internal organs in offspring.

The resultant heightened anxiety among these patients may negatively affect adherence to therapy and treatment-related outcome. We aimed to assess whether the adoption of precautionary measures provided by the medical team led to a reduction in COVID-19-related anxiety and, consequently, to successful execution of treatment plans. Methods: All adult hemato-oncology patients actively treated or being followed-up at the outpatient service at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center between March 25 and May 3, 2020, were invited to answer a questionnaire that focused on their anxiety and adherence to treatment following new measures to reduce risk of infection during the first COVID-19 outbreak. Results: One hundred and fifty patients (representing 24% of those being approached), average age 67 years, 52% male, and 57% undergoing antineoplastic therapy, responded to the survey. The introduction of precautionary measures resulted in a significant reduction in anxiety level in all patients, irrespective of age, sex, or treatment status. Attendance to scheduled visits in day care and outpatient clinics remained unchanged. Adherence to planned blood and imaging tests were 81% and 73%, respectively, and 93% of the patients were satisfied with their medical care. Thirty-two percent of patients used telemedicine.

Ub is highly conserved across eukaryotes, whereas ISG15 is only present in vertebrates and shows substantial sequence diversity. Prior attempts to address the effect of ISG15 diversity on viral protein-ISG15 interactions have focused on only a single species ISG15 or a limited selection of nairovirus OTUs. To gain a more complete perspective of OTU-ISG15 interactions, we biochemically assessed the relative activities of 14 diverse nairovirus OTUs for 12 species ISG15 and found that ISG15 activity is predominantly restricted to particular nairovirus lineages reflecting, in general, known virus-host associations. To uncover the underlying molecular factors driving OTUs affinity for ISG15, X-ray crystal structures of Kupe virus and Ganjam virus OTUs bound to sheep ISG15 were solved and compared to complexes of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Erve virus OTUs bound to human and mouse ISG15, respectively. Through mutational and structural analysis seven residues in ISG15 were identified that predominantly influence ISG15 species specificity among nairovirus OTUs. Additionally, OTU residues were identified that influence ISG15 preference, suggesting the potential for viral OTUs to adapt to different host ISG15s.

In Spain, the state of alarm was established from March 15 to June 20, 2020. Usually this fact decreased people's mobility and physical activity, in addition to producing or exacerbating psychological disorders. Our aim was to determine the influence that this condition had over the short-term ponderal results of patients undergoing laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy from May 2019 to May 2020. METHODS: Case-control study for comparing the percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight lost (%TWL) of patients that underwent a VG during the last year, so they were affected by lockdown in April and part of March 2020 (group 1), to the %EWL and %TWL of a control group (group 2), obtained from our previous series.

Many antibody tests have been evaluated in hospitalised rather than community based COVID-19 cases. Virtus Respiratory Research Ltd (Virtus) has developed its own quantitative IgM and IgG SARS CoV-2 antibody assay. We report its validation and performance characteristics and compare its performance with the Abbott Architect and Roche Elecsys assays in community COVID cases. MethodsWe developed a quantitative antibody test to detect IgM and IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein (the Virtus test) and validated this test in 107 \\"true positive\\" sera from 106 community-managed and 1 hospitalised COVID-19 cases and 208 \\"true negative\\" serum samples. We validated the Virtus test against a neutralising antibody test. We determined sensitivities of the Abbott test in the 107 true positive samples and the Roche test in a subset of 75 true positive samples. ResultsThe Virtus quantitative test was positive in 93 of 107 (87%) community cases of COVID-19 and both IgM and IgG levels correlated strongly with neutralising antibody titres (r=0.75 for IgM, r=0.71 for IgG, P<0.0001 for both antibodies). The specificity of the Virtus test was 98.6% for low level antibody positives, 99.5% for moderate positives and 100% for high or very high positives. The Abbott test had a sensitivity of 68%. In the 75 sample subset, the Virtus test was positive in 91%, the Roche test in 69%. ConclusionsThe Abbott and Roche tests had sensitives of 68% and 69% respectively in this community set of COVID-19 sera, while the Virtus test had sensitivities of 87% and 91% in the same sample sets. The strong positive correlation with virus neutralization suggests a positive Virtus quantitative antibody test is likely predictive of protective against recurrent COVID-19.

We present our experience of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transplant patients in one of the most affected parts of the UK with direct comparison to waitlisted patients. METHODS A single-center prospective study of symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive waitlisted and transplant patients was undertaken to compare these groups and assess clinical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 60 consecutive symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were identified with 32 active waitlisted patients and 28 functioning renal transplants. Demographics were similar. The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in the waitlisted group was 9.9% compared to 1.9% in renal transplant patients (P < 0.001). Immunosuppression did not influence initial symptomology. Fifteen percent of patients in the waitlisted and 32% in the transplant groups died (P = 0.726). Mortality as proportion of total waitlisted (321 patients) and transplant population (1434 patients) of our centre was 1.5% and 0.6% (P < 0.001), respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) at 48 h and peak CRP were associated with mortality in both groups while quick sequential organ failure assessment score at 48 h (P = 0.036) was associated with mortality for transplant patients. CONCLUSIONS Incidence of COVID-19 is higher in the waitlisted population but transplant patients have more severe disease, reflected by higher mortality. CRP at 48 h can be used as a predictive tool.

Twenty-nine physical educators (female = 21, male = 8) completed the program. Paired sample t tests were used to determine the efficacy of the program in improving assessment accuracy from pretest to posttest. Associations between posttest scores assessed which factors predicted success within the program addressing feasibility. Program completion resulted in significantly better posttest assessment scores among participants. Guided practice attempts and average scores on guided practice tests correlated most strongly and positively with posttest scores. The assessment training program increased the assessment competency of physical educators. Guided practice and using practice tests best predicted participant learning.

The dual primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival, each tested sequentially in patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 1 or more, in the intention-to-treat population, and in patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 10 or more. The combined positive score is defined as the number of PD-L1-staining cells divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, multiplied by 100. All results are from the protocol-specified first interim analysis. RESULTS In 548 patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 1 or more, median progression-free survival was 10.4 months in the pembrolizumab group and 8.2 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 0.77; P<0.001). In 617 patients in the intention-to-treat population, progression-free survival was 10.4 months and 8.2 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P<0.001). In 317 patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 10 or more, progression-free survival was 10.4 months and 8.1 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.77; P<0.001). Overall survival at 24 months was 53.0% in the pembrolizumab group and 41.7% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.81; P<0.001), 50.4% and 40.4% (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.84; P<0.001), and 54.4% and 44.6% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.84; P = 0.001), respectively. The most common grade 3 to 5 adverse events were anemia (30.3% in the pembrolizumab group and 26.9% in the placebo group) and neutropenia (12.4% and 9.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Progression-free and overall survival were significantly longer with pembrolizumab than with placebo among patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer who were also receiving chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab.

Design/methodology/approach This study applies the asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (A-MF-DFA) method of Cao et al. (2013) to identify A-MF and MENA stock market efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings The results show strong evidence of different patterns of MF during upward and downward trends. Inefficiency is higher during upward trends than during downward trends in most of the stock markets in the whole sample period, and the opposite is true during financial crises. The Turkish stock market is the least inefficient during upward and downward trends. A-MF intensifies with an increase in scales. The evolution of excessive A-MF for MENA stock returns is heterogeneous. Most of the stock markets are more inefficient during a pandemic crisis than during an oil crash and other financial crises. However, the inefficiency of the Saudi Arabia and Qatar stock markets is highly sensitive to oil price crashes. Overall, the level of inefficiency varies across market trends, scales and stock markets and over time. The findings of this study provide investors and policymakers with valuable insights into efficient investment strategies, risk management and financial stability. Originality/value This paper first explores A-MF in the MENA emerging stock markets. The A-MF analysis provides useful information to investors regarding asset allocation, portfolio risk management and investment strategies during bullish and bearish market states. In addition, this paper examines A-MF under different turbulent periods, such as the GFC, the ESDC, the 2014-2016 oil crash and the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Multifractality during upside/downside trends in the MENA stock markets: the effects of the global financial crisis, oil crash and COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, a mass of patients showing symptoms of a pneumonia-like disease of unknown origin emerged in Wuhan, China.

Here, we show that both Apol9 isoforms (Apol9b and Apol9a) inhibit replication of Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) but not replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), or infection by a lentiviral vector. Apol9 genes are strongly expressed in mouse liver and, to a lesser extent, in pancreas, adipose tissue and intestine. Their expression is increased by type I interferon and viral infection. In contrast to genuine apolipoproteins that are involved in lipid transport, ApoL9 has an intracytoplasmic localization and does not seem to be secreted. The cytoplasmic localization of ApoL9 is in line with the observation that ApoL9 inhibits the replication step of TMEV infection. In contrast to human ApoL6, ApoL9 did not sensitize cells to apoptosis, in spite of the presence of a conserved putative BH3 domain, required for antiviral activity. ApoL9a and b isoforms interact with cellular prohibitin 1 (Phb1) and prohibitin 2 (Phb2) and this interaction might contribute to ApoL9 antiviral activity. Knocking down Phb2 slightly increased TMEV replication, irrespective of ApoL9 overexpression. The antiviral activity of prohibitins against TMEV contrasts with the pro-viral activity of prohibitins observed for VSV and reported previously for Dengue 2 (DENV-2), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and influenza H5N1 viruses. ApoL9 is thus an example of ISG displaying a narrow antiviral range, which likely acts in complex with prohibitins to restrict TMEV replication.","output":"The Interferon-Inducible Mouse Apolipoprotein L9 and Prohibitins Cooperate to Restrict Theilers Virus Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction. A fast diagnosis is crucial for patient management. Proteins that are synthesized during the inflammatory response can be used as biomarkers, helping in a rapid clinical assessment or an early diagnosis of infection. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers of inflammation for the diagnosis and prognosis of infection in patients with suspected sepsis. METHODS: In total 406 episodes were included in a prospective cohort study. Plasma was collected from all patients with suspected sepsis, for whom blood cultures were drawn, in the emergency department (ED), the department of infectious diseases, or the haemodialysis unit on the first day of a new episode. Samples were analysed using a 92-plex proteomic panel based on a proximity extension assay with oligonucleotide-labelled antibody probe pairs (OLink, Uppsala, Sweden). Supervised and unsupervised differential expression analyses and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to search for inflammatory proteins that were different between patients with viral or bacterial sepsis and between patients with worse or less severe outcome. RESULTS: Supervised differential expression analysis revealed 21 proteins that were significantly lower in circulation of patients with viral infections compared to patients with bacterial infections. More strongly, higher expression levels were observed for 38 proteins in patients with high SOFA scores (> 4), and for 21 proteins in patients with worse outcome. These proteins are mostly involved in pathways known to be activated early in the inflammatory response. Unsupervised, hierarchical clustering confirmed that inflammatory response was more strongly related to disease severity than to aetiology. CONCLUSION: Several differentially expressed inflammatory proteins were identified that could be used as biomarkers for sepsis. These proteins are mostly related to disease severity. Within the setting of an emergency department, they could be used for outcome prediction, patient monitoring, and directing diagnostics.

Diagnostics is one area where biotechnology has been critical. Diagnostic tests play a vital role in managing a viral threat by facilitating the detection of infected and/or recovered individuals. From the perspective of what information is provided, these tests fall into two major categories, molecular and serological. Molecular diagnostic techniques assay whether a virus is present in a biological sample, thus making it possible to identify individuals who are currently infected. Additionally, when the immune system is exposed to a virus, it responds by producing antibodies specific to the virus. Serological tests make it possible to identify individuals who have mounted an immune response to a virus of interest and therefore facilitate the identification of individuals who have previously encountered the virus. These two categories of tests provide different perspectives valuable to understanding the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Within these categories, different biotechnological approaches offer specific advantages and disadvantages.

METHODS: Single center retrospective designed observational study conducted in Ankara City Hospital. Patients who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020 and June 1, 2020 in COVID-19 inpatient clinics with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the study. An inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for multiple treatment groups approach was used to balance the differences in several variables on admission. RESULTS: Among 2441 patients hospitalized with diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period, 824 were eligible for the analysis. Median age of patients was 42 (18-93 years). Among all, 347 (43.2%) of the patients had mild disease, 470 (56.8%) had pneumonia. Propensity scores ranged from 0.1841 to 0.9381 in the HCQ group, from 0.03643 to 0.29885 in the favipiravir group, and from 0.03542 to 0.56184 in the HCQ plus favipiravir group. After IPTW for multiple treatment groups was applied, all the covariates in the planned propensity score had weighted standardized effect sizes below 10% which were ranged from 0.005 to 0.092. Multivariate analysis of treatment effect (adjusted effect of treatment) was indicated that there is no statistically significant difference between HCQ, favipiravir, and HCQ plus favipiravir treatment. After using combination of SMOTE and Bootstrap resampling approach, we found no statistically significant difference between HCQ and HCQ plus favipiravir groups in terms of ICU admission. However, compared with the HCQ group, ICU admission rate was statistically significantly higher in the favipiravir group. We obtained the similar results after the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ with or without favipiravir treatment is associated with reduced risk of ICU admission compared to favipiravir alone in mild to moderate COVID-19 adult patients.","output":"Comparing ICU Admission Rates of Mild/Moderate COVID-19 Patients Treated with Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine plus Favipiravir"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy limits population protection from SARS-CoV (coronavirus disease [COVID-19]).

Recent studies of viral transmission have used genome sequence data to evaluate the number of particles transmitted between hosts, and the role of selection as it operates during the transmission process. However, the interpretation of sequence data describing transmission events is a challenging task. We here present a novel and comprehensive framework for using short-read sequence data to understand viral transmission events, designed for influenza virus, but adaptable to other viral species. Our approach solves multiple shortcomings of previous methods for this purpose; for example, we consider transmission as an event involving whole viruses, rather than sets of independent alleles. We demonstrate how selection during transmission and noisy sequence data may each affect naive inferences of the population bottleneck, accounting for these in our framework so as to achieve a correct inference. We identify circumstances in which selection for increased viral transmission may or may not be identified from data. Applying our method to experimental data in which transmission occurs in the presence of strong selection, we show that our framework grants a more quantitative insight into transmission events than previous approaches, inferring the bottleneck in a manner that accounts for selection, both for within-host virulence, and for inherent viral transmissibility. Our work provides new opportunities for studying transmission processes in influenza, and by extension, in other infectious diseases.","output":"A novel framework for inferring parameters of transmission from viral sequence data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concern of viral transmission during otolaryngological procedures by means of droplets/saliva.

CD137 was originally described as a surface molecule present on activated T and NK cells and detected on hypoxic endothelial cells and inflamed blood vessels, but its function on lymphatic endothelial cells remains unclear. We investigated the relationships among CD137, lymphangiogenesis and macrophages, which are involved in interstitial fibrosis. Similar to other chronic inflammatory diseases, we found lymphangiogenesis and expression of CD137 in the renal tissue of patients with IgA nephropathy. CD137-positive lymphatic vessels were involved in the development process of IgA nephropathy and positively correlated with serum creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, serum uric acid, and urinary 24 h total protein. The expression of these indicators was negatively correlated with eGFR, plasma albumin, and HB. In mouse models of UUO, we verified that CD137 expression was significantly elevated during lymphangiogenesis and that its ligand CD137L was released by macrophages after VEGF-C stimulation in the kidney. In vitro, recombinant CD137L significantly enhanced LEC proliferation, migration and tube formation, and these effects were inhibited by CD137 siRNA. Mechanistically, the CD137L interaction with CD137 induced the transition from LC3-I to LC3-II and the expression of Atg5, Atg7, Atg12 and p62 proteins by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to promote autophagy. Knockdown of Atg5 and Atg7 blocked CD137L-induced autophagy. Thus, we propose that CD137L secretion by macrophages interacts with CD137 on lymphatic endothelial cells to prompt lymphangiogenesis in the kidney, which further drives fibrogenic responses. Our findings suggest that inhibition of the CD137-CD137L pathway is a novel therapeutic approach for obstructive nephropathy.","output":"CD137L-macrophage induce lymphatic endothelial cells autophagy to promote lymphangiogenesis in renal fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assess the economic and health costs of COVID and policy responses to COVID Based on initial estimates of health and economic costs, social distancing policies were justified, but these estimates now seem too high because of learning by doing Significant differences in mortality rates across US states and countries can be explained by population density, climate, exposure, and policy Regions that were able to contain the disease early have seen fewer deaths and lower economic losses Some developing countries initially imposed drastic, costly measures, perhaps motivated by political economy We also find that there has been underinvestment in prevention and mitigation that could have reduced the cost of adaptation and suggest that there is a lesson for climate change policies","output":"The political economy of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurotropic and neuroinvasive capabilities of coronaviruses have been described in humans.

The interspecies transmission of this zoonotic virus and mutated variants are aided by exposure dynamics of infected aerosols, fomites and intermediate reservoirs. The spike in the first, second and third waves of coronavirus confirms that herd immunity is not yet reached and everyone including livestock is still vulnerable to the infection. Of serious concern are the communitarian nature of agrarians in the livestock sector, aerogenous spread of the virus and attendant cytocidal effect in permissive cells following activation of pathogen recognition receptors, replication cycles, virulent mutations, seasonal spike in infection rates, flurry of reinfections and excess mortalities that can affect animal welfare and food security.

It is still controversial which antibodies are the most sensitive and specific, and which can be detected earliest after infection. Here, we evaluated the results of serological tests of anti-SARS-CoV-2 N and S Abs in Japan. METHODS: Symptomatic COVID-19 patients (n = 84) and control patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 93) were recruited at Tokyo National Hospital. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 N and S Abs were measured by commercial electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. RESULTS: The fraction of patients positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 N and S Abs was highest >14 days after symptom onset. The frequency of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S Ab positivity at this time (80.4%) tended to be slightly but not significantly lower than anti-SARS-CoV-2 N Ab positivity (84.8%). Optimized cut-off levels for anti-SARS-CoV-2 N and S Ab positivity were lower than the manufacturer's recommended cut-off levels. Using multiple linear regression analyzes with anti-SARS-CoV-2 N and S Abs, we created an Ab-index with high sensitivity.

Its antiparasitic effect is that of a schizontocide and is explained by rapid uptake by parasitized erythrocytes and interaction with a component of hemoglobin degradation resulting in formation of free radicals. It has been shown to exhibit a high clinical cure rate. Previous animal safety studies with Qinghaosu derivatives revealed dose-dependent neurotoxicity with movement disturbances and neuropathic changes in the hindbrain of intramuscularly treated dogs, rats and monkeys. Such effects have not been seen in man. The objective of our present studies was to compare the effects of high levels of AM administered to dogs p.o. versus i.m. In a pilot study 20 mg/kg/day of AM was given i.m. to groups of 3 male Beagle dogs for 5 and 30 days, respectively. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were noted in some individual dogs from test day 23 on. One dog had to be sacrificed pre-term. Hematologic findings indicated a hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Microscopic examination demonstrated neuropathic changes only at 30 days, but not at 5 days. The animals had neuronal and secondary axonal damage, most prominent in the cerebellar roof, pontine and vestibular nuclei, and in the raphe/paralemniscal region. The affected neurons showed loss of Nissl substance, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, shrinkage of the nucleus and in advanced stages scavenging by microglia. In a subsequent experiment, AM was administered to groups of 4 male and 4 female dogs, respectively, at 8 daily doses of 0, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg i.m., or 0, 50, 150 and 600 mg/kg p.o. Neurologic signs were seen at high i.m. doses only. In most animals they were inconspicuous and consisted of reduced activity with convulsions seen in single dogs shortly before death. Neuronal damage occurred in all animals at 40 and 80 mg/kg following i.m. treatment. At 20 mg/kg minimal effects occurred in 5/8 dogs only, indicating that this level was close to tolerated exposure. No comparable lesions were observed after oral administration. Both i.m. and p.o. exposure at high dose levels was associated with a prolongation of mean QT interval of ECG, suggesting slowing of repolarization of the myocardium. Individual data indicated that in 1 of 4 females at 80 mg/kg i.m. this prolongation was above the 25 % level considered as threshold for concern. After intramuscular administration pharmacokinetics indicated peak plasma levels of AM at 2 to 4 hours post-dose, slow elimination and a tendency to accumulate after repeated administration. Only low levels of the major metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), were found. AM levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were < 10 % of plasma levels. After oral administration AM concentrations were considerably lower than after i.m. administration. The concentration of DHA was high on day 1 but almost nil on day 7 indicating its fast inactivation in dogs. Two hours after the 8(th) oral administration neither AM nor DHA was detected in CSF which may explain the absence of neurotoxicity in dogs after oral administration of AM.","output":"Differential effects of orally versus parenterally administered qinghaosu derivative artemether in dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the causes for cardiac arrest in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients.

Despite aggressive campaigns to maintain PA at home, the country has seen a tremendous decrease in child physical fitness over the past several months as self-isolation measures have been mandated by national authorities. These trends prompted researchers to create a method of tracking and communicating government decisions which have a direct impact on child physical activity, fitness and overall health (i.e., the SLOfit Barometer). The research team assembled experts for consultation on creation of the SLOfit Barometer after processing preliminary data on 20,000 schoolchildren which found the greatest decline in child physical fitness since systematic testing began more than 30 years ago. Only 2 months of self-isolation erased over 10 years of hard-fought health gains acquired from national public health policies and PA interventions. This crisis in child fitness requires integrated community participation and a robust public health policy response, and with the SLOfit Barometer acting as a national bellwether system, it is envisioned that policy makers and the public will advocate for bold, progressive actions to combat this national health emergency.

Outpatient environments, where radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy cancer treatments typically take place, have largely been excluded from research. This study was conducted to understand provision of treatment and support and experiences of care for people with dementia undergoing cancer treatment in the outpatient setting. Materials and methods: Using observation, interviews and document analysis, data were collected to scrutinise the cultural environment of ambulatory care, comprising the physical fabric of the care setting; interactions, behaviours and perceptions of those in the care setting; and the organizational, clinical and interactional processes involved in care delivery. The study was conducted in the outpatient oncology departments of two large teaching hospitals in England between January 2019-July 2021. Results: Data were gathered from a wide range of sources, including 15 hours of observation, and interviews with patients (n=2), caregivers (n=7) and staff (n=20). Evidence from this study suggests the cultural environment of the outpatient care setting reflects and supports the standardised processing of people for cancer treatment. Dementia introduces a wider set of care requirements not catered for by this standardised treatment model and associated processes. Data showed the needs of patients with dementia could be addressed most effectively when individualised, as opposed to standardised care, was offered. Conclusion: There is work to be done in outpatient cancer services to ensure responsiveness to individual patient need. This could be achieved by having an established way (or ways) of eliciting needs, preferences and expectations, a belief that a person's needs and expectations are legitimate, and that effort should be made to address them, with the ability to accommodate these needs and expectations.

The first line of innate immunological defense against particles are myeloid-lineage phagocytes, namely macrophages and neutrophils, which recognize/internalize the particles, release inflammatory mediators, undergo programmed/unprogrammed death, and recruit/activate other leukocytes to clear the particles and resolve inflammation. However, immunogenic cell death and release of damage-associated molecules, collectively referred to as danger signals, coupled with failure to efficiently clear dead/dying cells, can elicit unresolved inflammation, accumulation of self-antigens, and adaptive leukocyte recruitment/activation. Collectively, these events can promote loss of immunological self-tolerance and onset/progression of autoimmunity. This review discusses critical molecular mechanisms by which exogenous particles (i.e., silica, asbestos, carbon nanotubes, titanium dioxide, aluminum-containing salts) and endogenous particles (i.e., monosodium urate, cholesterol crystals, calcium-containing salts) may promote unresolved inflammation and autoimmunity by inducing toxic responses in myeloid-lineage phagocytes with emphases on inflammasome activation and necrotic and programmed cell death pathways. A prototypical example is occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica, which is etiologically linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other human autoimmune diseases. Importantly, airway instillation of SLE-prone mice with crystalline silica elicits severe pulmonary pathology involving accumulation of particle-laden alveolar macrophages, dying and dead cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic debris, and neutrophilic inflammation that drive cytokine, chemokine, and interferon-regulated gene expression. Silica-induced immunogenic cell death and danger signal release triggers accumulation of T and B cells, along with IgG-secreting plasma cells, indicative of ectopic lymphoid tissue neogenesis, and broad-spectrum autoantibody production in the lung. These events drive early autoimmunity onset and accelerate end-stage autoimmune glomerulonephritis. Intriguingly, dietary supplementation with -3 fatty acids have been demonstrated to be an intervention against silica-triggered murine autoimmunity. Taken together, further insight into how particles drive immunogenic cell death and danger signaling in myeloid-lineage phagocytes and how these responses are influenced by the genome will be essential for identification of novel interventions for preventing and treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases associated with these agents.","output":"Centrality of Myeloid-Lineage Phagocytes in Particle-Triggered Inflammation and Autoimmunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe COVID-19 is characterized by an excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, resulting in acute lung injury and development of ARDS.

This scoping review maps the studies conducted to date that address questions about pediatric safety and effectiveness of vaccines administered during pregnancy and provides a knowledge base for evaluating the use of RWD to study this issue. METHODS The scoping review was conducted following a published protocol. Methods included an electronic search of PubMed and Embase, screening of titles and abstracts by two reviewers, and double extraction of data for summary and synthesis. Studies that reported on pregnant women and the effectiveness or safety outcomes in their infants were included. RESULTS Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria of the scoping review protocol using RWD to assess safety or effectiveness of influenza or pertussis vaccinations administered to pregnant women with respect to pregnancy, infant or child outcomes. Detailed information about data sources, linkage of maternal and infant data, and operational definitions for gestational age were largely absent from the majority of studies raising concerns about reproducibility and validity of study findings. CONCLUSIONS A body of literature is available from which to plan and design future studies of vaccination in pregnant women using RWD.

Aim of the study was to investigate SARS-COV2 global and Italian web search amount made through a reliable information source during 2019-20 SARS-COV2 epidemic. METHODS: From December 15th, 2019 to February 23rd, 2020, we used Google Trends to analyze global changes in the volume of searches about Coronavirus in relation to reliable sources: World Health Organization, WHO and the Italian equivalents of Ministry of Health and National Institute of Health. Primary searches and associated queries (AQs) were analyzed by nation and Italian Region. RESULTS: Global interest on Coronavirus progressively rose from mid-January, with 2 peaks on days 28th and 31st, fell on February 20th and rose again until day 23rd. WHO searches fluctuated with no clear pattern but increased on January 26th and February 3rd. 'WHO' term was among the most frequent Coronavirus AQs and viceversa. Singapore, Italy and New Zealand were the most interested nations in Coronavirus, while China was at first place in Coronavirus+WHO searches. In Italy from January 21st interest in Coronavirus gradually increased, with peaks on days 28th and 31st and a higher peak on February 21st. The other terms showed a fluctuating trend, with peaks on January 31st for WHO and Ministry of Health and on February 21st for all of them. Coronavirus was most frequently AQ to Italy and China, while AQs for the other terms were Coronavirus and WHO official website. The most interested Italian Regions for Coronavirus and Coronavirus+WHO were Lazio and Friuli Venezia-Giulia, respectively.

We therefore elected to investigate factors that may influence the long-term patency of these covered side branches. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the long-term patency of side branches covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device at our institution during treatment of intracranial aneurysms with at least 6 months of conventional angiography follow-up. Procedural and anatomic factors that might influence the fate of covered side branches were explored. RESULTS One hundred forty-eight Pipeline Embolization Device treatments in 137 patients met the inclusion criteria. In 217 covered side branches, 29 (13.4%) were occluded on follow-up, and 40 (18.4%) were stenotic. All stenoses and occlusions were asymptomatic. In the entire cohort and in the largest subset of ophthalmic arteries, a smaller Pipeline Embolization Device diameter was associated with branch vessel occlusion (P = .001, P = .013). When we considered stenotic and occluded side branches together, smaller Pipeline Embolization Device size (P = .029) and administration of intraprocedural abciximab (P = .03) predicted side branch stenosis/occlusion, while anterior choroidal branch type (P = .003) was a predictor of gross side branch patency. CONCLUSIONS A smaller Pipeline Embolization Device diameter is associated with delayed side branch stenosis/occlusion following Pipeline Embolization Device treatment, likely due to the higher metal density of smaller caliber devices.

Early detection of COVID-19 infections is important for patient treatment and for controlling the epidemic. However, many countries/regions suffer from a shortage of nucleic acid testing (NAT) due to either resource limitations or epidemic control measures. The exact number of infective cases is mostly unknown in counties/regions with insufficient NAT, which has been a major issue in predicting and controlling the epidemic. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to quantitatively identify the influences of insufficient detection on the COVID-19 epidemic. We extend the classical SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infections-recovered) model to include random detections which are described by Poisson processes. We apply the model to the epidemic in Guam, Texas, the Virgin Islands, and Wyoming in the United States and determine the detection probabilities by fitting model simulations with the reported number of infected, recovered, and dead cases. We further study the effects of varying the detection probabilities and show that low level-detection probabilities significantly affect the epidemic; increasing the detection probability of asymptomatic infections can effectively reduce the the scale of the epidemic.

COVID-19 is a disease with symptoms that range from fever and breathing difficulty to acute respiratory distress and death, critically affecting older patients and people with previous comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract, which it then uses to reach several organs. The immune system of infected patients has been demonstrated to suffer important alterations, such as lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, excessive amounts of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages, especially in the lungs, and cytokine storms, which may contribute to its severity and difficulty of establishing an effective treatment. Even though no specific treatment is currently available, several studies have been investigating potential therapeutic strategies, including the use of previously approved drugs and immunotherapy.

The benefit of WALANT for foot and ankle surgeries is less clear, especially in patients with multiple comorbities. The primary aim of this study was to compare post-operative pain levels in patients undergoing ankle fracture fixation. Secondary objectives included comparison of intra-operative patient experiences, clinical outcomes, and patient satisfaction 1-year post-procedure. METHOD: 129 patients presenting with ankle fractures were enrolled in a multicenter randomised control trial from February 2016 to January 2020. Patients with medial malleolar, lateral malleolar, bimalleolar or trimalleolar fractures received either WALANT (62 patients) or spinal anaesthesia (67 patients). A 5ml solution of 0.9% saline and 2% lidocaine with 1: 100,000 adrenaline was used for WALANT. RESULTS: Compared to patients who received spinal anaesthesia, those in the WALANT group experienced less post-operative discomfort and were more satisfied 1-year post-procedure (p-value = 0.003). Surgical outcomes were similar for both groups. Cost analysis revealed that WALANT is significantly more economical.

Although the impact of acid suppression on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is unknown thus far, previous data revealed that pH 3 impairs the infectivity of the similar severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1. Thus, we aimed to determine whether use of PPIs increases the odds for acquiring coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among community-dwelling Americans. METHODS: From May 3 to June 24, 2020, we performed an online survey described to participating adults as a national health survey. A multivariable logistic regression was performed on reporting a positive COVID-19 test to adjust for a wide range of confounding factors and to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Of 53,130 participants, 3,386 (6.4%) reported a positive COVID-19 test. In regression analysis, individuals using PPIs up to once daily (aOR 2.15; 95% CI, 1.90C2.44) or twice daily (aOR 3.67; 95% CI, 2.93C4.60) had significantly increased odds for reporting a positive COVID-19 test when compared with those not taking PPIs. Individuals taking histamine-2 receptor antagonists were not at elevated risk. DISCUSSION: We found evidence of an independent, dose-response relationship between the use of antisecretory medications and COVID-19 positivity; individuals taking PPIs twice daily have higher odds for reporting a positive test when compared with those using lower-dose PPIs up to once daily, and those taking the less potent histamine-2 receptor antagonists are not at increased risk. These findings emphasize good clinical practice that PPIs should only be used when indicated at the lowest effective dose, such as the approved once-daily label dosage of over-the-counter and prescription PPIs.

Here we present homozygosity to the CD55 c.596C>T; p.Ser199Leu variant, which was previously described as the Cromer Dr(a?) genotype, in two Bukharan Jewish CD55-deficiency patients with variable disease severity. We confirm that this missense variant causes aberrant splicing and deletion of 44 bp in exon 5, leading to premature termination and low expression of the CD55 protein. Furthermore, Patient 1 exhibited a mildly abnormal B cell immunophenotyping profile. By population screening we established that this variant is highly prevalent in the Bukharan Jewish population, with a carrier frequency of 1:17, suggesting that many similar patients are un- or mis-diagnosed. The phenotypic variability, ranging from abdominal pain when eating a high-fat diet to the full CD55-deficiency phenotype, is likely related to modifiers affecting the proportion of the variant that is able to escape aberrant splicing. Establishing the diagnosis of CD55-deficiency in a timely manner, even in patients with milder symptoms, may have a critical effect on their management and quality-of-life since treatment with the complement inhibitor eculizumab is highly effective in ameliorating disease manifestations.

However, their immunogenicity in immunocompromised Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients is less clear. We performed an observational prospective study of 96 MM patients (pts) treated at our centre, aimed at assessing the humoral and cell-mediated immune (CMI) response following the full immunization schedule. To this aim, we measured serum levels of neutralizing IgG anti Spike-protein (IgG anti S-RBD) at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the 2 nd dose of vaccination, using the electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) platform (Elecsys? Anti-sars-Cov-2 ECLIA assay) and evaluated CMI response in terms of pts with a SARS-CoV-2 specific IFN T cell response by IGRA (Interferon-Gamma Release Assays) test at 3 and 12 months after 2 nd dose. A concentration level of IgG anti S-RBD 0.80 U/ml was considered a seropositive result. Herein, we report preliminary data on the development of humoral response in 96 MM pts who reached the first study timepoint (1 month after 2 nd dose), compared to 54 health-care workers as controls. At vaccination, the median age of the 96 patients (51 males/45 females) was 66.5 (range 47-83) years. The median number of previous lines of therapy was 1 (range 1-11) and only 7 (7.3%) pts were not receiving active treatment. 44.8% (n=43) pts had relapse/refractory MM. Among 72 (75%) transplant-eligible pts, 63 patients had previously received autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) with a median time between ASCT and vaccine of 31 (range 3-274) months. 70 (72.9%) pts had received immunomodulatory drugs (IMIDs) containing regimens, 30 (31.3%) proteasome inhibitors (PIs), 11 (11.5%) IMIDs + PIs, 32 (33.3%) anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD38 moAbs). 33 (34.4%) pts were in lenalidomide (R) maintenance therapy. At vaccination, 67 (68.8%) pts were in VGPR or higher, 18 (18.7%) in PR and 11 (11.3%) in SD or PD. Immunoparesis (1 uninvolved Ig below lower level limit) was observed in 78 (88.6%) pts, of whom 59 (67.1%) showed a reduction of two Ig classes. All pts had completed the 2 planned doses of BNT162b2 (40.6%) or mRNA1273 (59.4%) vaccine 3 or 4 weeks apart, respectively. Control cohort (n=54; median age of 51 [range 40-66] years) received mRNA vaccine during the same period. People with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive IgG anti S-RBD or anti-nucleocapsid N antibody titer before vaccines) were excluded from the analysis. At 1 month post 2 nd dose, (median 30 days, IQR 28-32) seropositive response rate to vaccination was 91.7% (n=88) for MM pts vs 100% for controls, p=0.05; the median IgG anti S-RBD titer was 435 (range 0.4-2500) vs 1040.5 U/ml (range 160-2500), respectively; p=0.008. No difference in the rate of seropositive response between those who received the 2 type of vaccines was found (p=0.09). Pts with response level  CR had a median antibody (Ab) titer (1242 U/ml, range 0.4-2500) significantly higher than those with CR (221.5 U/ml, range 0.4- 2500), p<0.001. Pts receiving PI (median Ab titer 156; range 0.4- 2500) and anti-CD38 MoAbs (median titer 265 U/ml; 0.4- 2500) containing regimens had a lower Ab titer than all the other pts (p=0.003 and p<0.001, respectively). Median Ab titer was higher in pts who received ASCT vs others (1042, range 0.4- 2500 vs 160 U/ml, range 228-2500, p<0.001) and in pts receiving R maintenance (1681.2, range 0.4-2500 vs 529.5 U/ml, range 0.4-2500, p<0.001). In pts with 2-Ig immunoparesis, the median Ab titer was 272 (range 0.4-2500) vs 2500 U/ml (range 228-2500) for no immunoparesis (p= 0.0037). A distribution analysis of the Ab titer revealed a significant correlation between better humoral response and hematological response  CR (p<0.001), being in first-line treatment (p=0.039), having received ASCT (p=0.001) and receiving R maintenance (p=0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed  CR [OR 2.54, 95% CI 93-756], being in first line treatment [OR 2.10, CI 22-722] and R maintenance therapy [OR 4.53, CI 484-1233] as independent predictors of better humoral response at 1 month after 2 nd vaccine dose. In conclusion, mRNA vaccines provided a high seropositivity rate in pts in active MM treatment, with a better humoral response in pts achieving CR, those who received ASCT and receiving R maintenance. Immunoparesis was confirmed to be an unfavourable factor for the development of humoral response, as well as treatment with anti-CD-38 moAbs.

We have, with the concept of VerifyMed, developed a decentralized service for work history and competence verification, as a means to increase trust in the virtual interaction between a patient and a caregiver, mitigate administrative burden, and provide patient-reported outcomes seamlessly for health professionals. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to validate the use case of a decentralized credentials service for health care professionals in Norway. We also aimed to evaluate the proof-of-concept of VerifyMed, a blockchain-based credential service for health care professionals. METHODS: A qualitative approach was applied with data collection through 9 semistructured interviews and 2 focus groups (one with 4 participants and the other with 5 participants). The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used as a part of the interviews. Data were analyzed through the principles of systematic text condensation. The recruitment of participants ended when it was concluded that the data had reached saturation. RESULTS: The following 5 themes were identified from the interviews and focus groups: (1) the need for aggregated storage of work- and study-related verification, (2) trust in a virtual health care environment, (3) the potential use of patient feedback, (4) trust in blockchain technology, and (5) improvements of the VerifyMed concept. The SUS questionnaire gave a score of 69.7. CONCLUSIONS: This study has validated the need for a decentralized system where health care professionals can control their credentials and, potentially, their reputation. Future work should update the VerifyMed system according to this input. We concluded that a decentralized system for the storage of work-related verifiable credentials could increase trust in a virtualized health care system.","output":"Medical Students Perceptions of a Blockchain-Based Decentralized Work History and Credentials Portfolio: Qualitative Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the era of the Schengen Area (at least in the days before Covid-19), travel from Munich to Bozen/Bolzano or Ljubljana to Trst/Trieste is a decidedly unremarkable, albeit beautiful, adventure.

Although this disease is still increasing exponentially day by day, early diagnosis of this disease is very important to reduce the death rate and to reduce the prevalence of this pandemic. Since there are sometimes human errors by physicians in the diagnosis of this disease, using computer-aided diagnostic systems can be helpful to get more accurate results. In this paper, chest X-ray images have been examined using a new pipeline machine vision-based system to provide more accurate results. In the proposed method, after preprocessing the input X-ray images, the region of interest has been segmented. Then, a combined gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features have been extracted from the processed images. Finally, an improved version of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the Red Fox Optimization algorithm is employed for the classification of the images based on the features. The proposed method is validated by performing to three datasets and its results are compared with some state-of-the-art methods.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS We leveraged a two-center prospective study of 1298 kidney transplant candidates and 521 recipients (May 2014 to March 2020). Symptom scores (0-100) at evaluation and admission for transplantation were calculated using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short-Form Survey, where lower scores represent greater burden, and burden was categorized as very high: 0.0-71.0; high: 71.1-81.0; medium: 81.1-91.0; and low: 91.1-100.0. We estimated adjusted waitlist mortality risk (competing risks regression), change in symptoms between evaluation and transplantation (n=190), and post-transplantation symptom score trajectories (mixed effects models). RESULTS At evaluation, candidates reported being moderately to extremely bothered by fatigue (32%), xeroderma (27%), muscle soreness (26%), and pruritus (25%); 16% reported high and 21% reported very high symptom burden. Candidates with very high symptom burden were at greater waitlist mortality risk (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 2.62). By transplantation, 34% experienced an increased symptom burden, whereas 42% remained unchanged. The estimated overall symptom score was 82.3 points at transplantation and 90.6 points at 3 months (10% improvement); the score increased 2.75 points per month (95% confidence interval, 2.38 to 3.13) from 0 to 3 months, and plateaued (-0.06 points per month; 95% confidence interval, -0.30 to 0.18) from 3 to 12 months post-transplantation. There were early (first 3 months) improvements in nine of 11 symptoms; pruritus (23% improvement) and fatigue (21% improvement) had the greatest improvements.

Methods for estimating the mask-wearing ratio on the basis of image analysis have been reported. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on both methodologies and datasets. Most recent reports straightforwardly propose estimating the ratio by applying conventional object detection and classification methods. It is feasible to use regression-based approaches to estimate the number of people wearing masks, especially for congested scenes with tiny and occluded faces, but this has not been well studied. A large-scale and well-annotated dataset is still in demand. In this paper, we present two methods for ratio estimation that leverage either a detection-based or regression-based approach. For the detection-based approach, we improved the state-of-the-art face detector, RetinaFace, used to estimate the ratio. For the regression-based approach, we fine-tuned the baseline network, CSRNet, used to estimate the density maps for masked and unmasked faces. We also present the first large-scale dataset, the \`\`NFM dataset,'' which contains 581,108 face annotations extracted from 18,088 video frames in 17 street-view videos.

We conducted this study to assess the impact of a MAMS programme on antimicrobial use in a tertiary teaching hospital in Shanghai. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital in Shanghai. The MAMS programme involved multifaceted interventions consisting of a quality premium with financial incentives, antibiotic restriction, audit and feedback, and education. Data were extracted from the electronic medical records of inpatients to analyse monthly and annual antibiotic consumption and the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions during 2017-2020. Segmented regression analysis of the interrupted time series was used to contrast antimicrobial use during 2019-2020, with non-MAMS data from the 2017-2018 period as the historical control. RESULTS: With MAMS implementation, antibiotic consumption decreased from 63.3 (59.3, 67.2) defined daily doses (per 100 patient-days (PD) to 43.3 (39.0, 49.8) s/1PD (P<0.001), and the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions decreased from 44.8% (44.1%, 45.4%) to 43.3% (42.2%, 44.3%) (P<0.001). Segmented regression models suggested a reduction in antibiotic consumption (coefficient = -12.537, P<0.001) and indicated a downward trend in the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions (coefficient =-0.165, P=0.049). Neither antibiotic consumption nor the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions was influenced by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that MAMS plays an important role in reducing antibiotic use and is not affected by special circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required.

Methods: Adult MG patients were randomly recruited to participate. The survey consisted of self-designed questionnaires and the revised 15-item Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MGQOL15r). Participation was strictly voluntary and remained anonymous. Results: A total of 214 adult MG patients (84 males and 130 females) gave valid replies. There were 49.53% patients reported they had the fear of COVID-19 outbreak at different levels. And female patients had a significant higher level of fear to COVID outbreak (p=0.009). It was found that the adult MG patients are more likely to be influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic compared to the general population. During the COVID-19 outbreak, 36.45% patients reported they got an improvement of MG disease severity. 57.01% patients reported they felt no change. 6.54% patients reported their condition got worse. The average of MGQOL15r score was 7.386.22. The higher level of the fear of COVID-19 outbreak, the higher score of MGQOL15r (p=0.029), the poorer quality of life. 96.73% patients hoped the specialist physicians could provide online consult.

In Malawi, pyrethroid-treated LLINs with and without the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) were distributed to control malaria. This study investigated the blood-feeding patterns of malaria vectors and whether LLINs containing pyrethroid and PBO led to a reduction of human blood feeding than those containing only pyrethroids. METHODS: Mosquitoes were sampled inside houses from May 2019 through April 2020 by aspiration, pyrethrum spray catch, and light trap methods in two sites. One site (Namanolo, Balaka district) had LLINs containing only pyrethroids whereas the other (Ntaja, Machinga district) had LLINs with both pyrethroids and PBO. Anopheles species, their blood-meal host, and infection with Plasmodium falciparum were determined using PCR methods. RESULTS: A total of 6585 female Anopheles were sampled in 203 houses. Of these, 633 (9.6%) were blood-fed mosquitoes comprising of 279 (44.1%) Anopheles arabiensis, 103 (16.3%) Anopheles gambiae 212 (33.5), Anopheles funestus, 2 (0.3%), Anopheles parensis and 37 (5.8%) were unidentified Anopheles spp. Blood meal hosts were successfully identified for 85.5% (n = 541) of the blood-fed mosquitoes, of which 436 (81.0%) were human blood meals, 28 (5.2%) were goats, 11 (2.0%) were dogs, 60 (11.1%) were mixed goat-human blood meals, 5 (0.9%) were dogChuman, and 1 was a mixed dog-goat. Human blood index (fraction of blood meals that were humans) was significantly higher in Namanolo (0.96) than Ntaja (0.89). Even though human blood index was high, goats were over-selected than humans after accounting for relative abundance of both hosts. The number of infectious Anopheles bites per person-year was 44 in Namanolo and 22 in Ntaja. CONCLUSION: Although LLINs with PBO PBO may have reduced human blood feeding, access to humans was extremely high despite high LLIN ownership and usage rates in both sites. This finding could explain persistently high rates of malaria infections in Malawi. However, this study had one village for each net type, thus the observed differences may have been a result of other factors present in each village.

Patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and metabolic-dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) appear to be at higher risk for severe manifestations like acute respiratory distress syndrome, especially in the youngest decades. Our aim was to examine whether patients with imaging-defined MAFLD and/or with increased non-invasive liver fibrosis scores (FIB-4) are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, using a machine learning model. Methods. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 672 patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia between February the 28th 2020 and May the 1st 2021. Hepatic steatosis was detected by ultrasound or computed tomography (CT), whereas FIB-4 score was used to define the risk of advanced liver fibrosis. We used a machine learning (ML) model to evaluate the risks of both in-hospital death and prolonged hospitalizations (>28 days), considering MAFLD, a set of blood tests (hepatic profile;HP), and the FIB-4 score, either separately and together. Results. Three hundred-thirty-three (49.6% of total) had imaging-defined MAFLD. The accuracy in predicting in-hospital death in the whole sample was 0.709 for the HP alone, and 0.721 for HP+FIB-4 combined together;in the 55-to-75 age subgroup, the accuracies were respectively 0.842 and 0.855 for HP alone and HP+FIB-4 together. In the MAFLD subgroup, the accuracy in predicting death was 0.739 considering HP alone, and 0.772 when considering HP+FIB-4 together;whereas in the MAFLD 55-to-75 years cohort, the accuracies were respectively 0.825 for HP and 0.833 for HP+FIB-4. Similar results were obtained both in the entire cohort and in MAFLD patients when considering the accuracy in predicting prolonged hospitalization (>28 days). Conclusions. In our cohort of COVID-19 patients, the presence of a worse HP and a higher FIB-4 correlated with a higher risk of death and prolonged hospitalization, regardless of the presence of MAFLD.

Prospectively each suspect's response is collected and assessed for self-reported comfort level. The provider's experience with each suspect and virological outcomes recorded separately. The sample adequacy was compared based on swab types and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 1008 COVID-19 suspects were considered for comparison of various outcomes. Dacron and flocked Nylon swab sticks are used for taking 530 and 478 samples, respectively. Suspects who underwent the procedure using Nylon swabs were six times more likely to have pain/discomfort compared to when Dacron swab was used (Adj RR (95% CI: 6.76 (3.53 to 13, p=0.0001))).

Here, we extend those findings by uncovering the crucial role of resident pro-inflammatory B and T cells in sustaining tonsillar hypertrophy and hyperplasia by producing TNF and IL17, respectively, in ex vivo cultures. Additionally, we detected prominent levels of expression of CD1d by tonsillar stratified as well as reticular epithelium, which have not previously been reported. Furthermore, we evidenced the hypertrophy of germinal centers (GC) and the general hyperplasia of B lymphocytes within the tissue and the lumen of the crypts. Of note, such B cells resulted mainly (IgG/IgM)+ cells, with some IgA+ cells located marginally in the follicles.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective multicentre analysis of the rates of PCI for the treatment of ACS within the period 2 months pre and post the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Ireland, as well as comparing PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with the corresponding period in 2019. During the 2020 COVID-19 period (29 FebruaryC30 April 2020), there was a 24% decline in PCI for overall ACS (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.76; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88; p<0.001), including a 29% reduction in PCI for non-ST-elevation ACS (IRR 0.71; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88; p=0.002) and an 18% reduction in PCI for STEMI (IRR 0.82; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.01; p=0.061), as compared with the 2020 pre-COVID-19 period (1 JanuaryC28 February 2020). A 22% (IRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93; p=0.005) reduction of PCI for STEMI was seen as compared with the 2019 reference period. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant reduction in PCI procedures for the treatment of ACS since the COVID-19 outbreak in Ireland. The reasons for this decline are still unclear but patients need to be encouraged to seek medical attention when cardiac symptoms appear, in order to avoid incremental cardiac morbidity and mortality due to a reduction in coronary revascularisation for the treatment of ACS.","output":"Impact on percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndromes during the COVID-19 outbreak in a non-overwhelmed European healthcare system: COVID-19 ACS-PCI experience in Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study investigated the protective efficacy of a formalin-inactivated infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccine derived from the field strain KP729422, which exhibits low S1 spike protein sequence homology (77.1-79.8%) with the currently used vaccine strains in Egypt. Two-week-old, specific-pathogen-free chickens were subcutaneously inoculated with a single dose of the vaccine containing 106.7 50% embryo infective dose (EID50) of the inactivated virus. At 6 weeks of age, the chickens were challenged with 104 EID50 of the same virus strain via the oculonasal route. In comparison with the unvaccinated challenged group, the vaccinated chickens had significantly higher IBV-neutralizing antibody titers and exhibited efficient protection against challenge on the basis of tracheal ciliary activity. However, the challenge virus was recovered from the kidneys and tracheas of these chickens at rates of 40% and 60%, respectively. These findings suggest that a single application of the vaccine may provide sufficient clinical and respiratory protection, but may not ensure complete protection against infection by the challenge virus.","output":"Protection conferred by a vaccine derived from an inactivated Egyptian variant of infectious bronchitis virus: a challenge experiment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Given that Swedish authorities have been widely viewed as having practiced an unusual approach to the COVID-19 pandemic and given that Sweden is notable for a low incidence of trauma, we wanted to learn how the pandemic may have affected the number of trauma admissions in Sweden. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the Swedish trauma registry (Svenska Traumaregistret). The study period was March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. As a basis for comparison, the record for the same time during the previous year, 2019 was used. RESULTS: During the four months of the first wave of COVID-19, 2020 there was a decline of 24.2% in the total number of trauma patients in Sweden. There was no significant change in 30-day mortality rates, 4.7% 2019 and 5.1% 2020, (p = 0.30). The number of injuries per patient was higher during the pandemic 3.8 injuries 2019 and 4.1 injuries 2020 (p = 0.02). The NISS 6, 2019 and 8, 2020 was higher during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: As a consequence of what were seen by many as all too lenient actions taken to deal with COVID-19 in Sweden during spring 2020, there was still a reduction in trauma admissions most likely due to an adherence to the voluntary recommendations, the reduction was not as prominent as what was seen in many countries with harsher restrictions and lockdowns.","output":"A cohort study of trauma patients in Sweden during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic: a small reduction in trauma admissions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The aim of the study was to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with or without respiratory alkalosis, and analyze the relationship of respiratory alkalosis and the outcome of adult coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.","output":"Association Between Respiratory Alkalosis and the Prognosis of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been classified as a Pandemic by WHO, announced on March 11, 2020.

Associations between company transparency scores with company size (large vs non-large), location (US vs non-US) and sponsored product type (drug vs biologic) were also examined.Results26% of products (16/62) had publicly available results for all clinical trials supporting their FDA approval and 67% (39/58) had public results for trials in patients by 6 months after their FDA approval;58% (32/55) were FDAAA compliant. Large companies were significantly more transparent than non-large companies (overall median transparency score of 95% (IQR 91C100) vs 59% (IQR 41C70), p<0.001), attributable to higher FDAAA compliance (median of 100% (IQR 88C100) vs 57% (0C100), p=0.01) and better data sharing (median of 100% (IQR 80C100) vs 20% (IQR 20C40), p<0.01). No significant differences were observed by company location or product type.ConclusionsIt was feasible to apply the GPS transparency measures and ranking tool to non-large companies and biologics. Large companies are significantly more transparent than non-large companies, driven by better data sharing procedures and implementation of FDAAA trial reporting requirements.

METHODS: Pooled rate of each of the rs713598, rs1726866, rs10246939, and PAV/AVI polymorphisms of the TAS2R38 gene was obtained in different countries using a systematic review methodology and its relationship with the mortality of COVID-19. Data were analyzed by the comprehensive meta-analysis software and SPSS. RESULTS: There was only a significant reverse Pearson correlation in death counts and PAV/AVI ratio, p = 0.047, r = ?0.503. Also, a significant reverse correlation of PAV/AVI ratio and death rate was seen, r = ?0.572 p = 0.021. rs10246939 ratio had a significant positive correlation with death rate, r = 0.851 p = 0.031. Further analysis was not significant. Our results showed that the higher presence of PAV allele than AVI, and a higher rate of G allele than A in rs10246939 polymorphism in a country, could be associated with lower COVID-19 mortality. While assessing all three polymorphisms showed a huge diversity worldwide. CONCLUSION: Due to extraoral activities of bitter taste receptor genes, especially in mucosal immunity, this gene seems to be a good candidate for future studies on COVID-19 pathophysiology.

The main screening method used for detecting COVID-19 infection is the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, the main screening methods for SARS-CoV-2 are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT). While CTs provide greater diagnostic accuracy, CXRs are more readily available and enable rapid triaging of patients in the most affected areas. Since CXR imaging is typically carried out as part of a standard procedure for patients with a respiratory complaint, it represents an ideal complement to RT-PCR testing. For this reason, much effort is ongoing into the development of Artificial Intelligence diagnostic systems based on Neural Networks (NN) that can aid radiologists in accurately interpreting CXRs in SARS-CoV-2 cases. Here we present CXR-Net, a two-module pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Module I is based on Res-CR-Net, a type of NN originally developed for the semantic segmentation of microscopy images (doi: 10.1088/2632-2153/aba8e8), which can process images of any size, retaining the original resolution of the input images in the feature maps of all layers and in the final output. Module I was trained on a dataset of 6395 Antero/Posterior CXRs with radiologist annotated lung contours to generate accurate masks of the lungs that overlap the heart and large vasa, and are minimally influenced by regions of consolidation or other texture alterations due to underlying pathologies. Module II is a hybrid convnet in which the first convolutional layer with learned coefficients is replaced by a layer with fixed coefficients provided by the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST). A particular advantage of this hybrid net is the removal of deep network instabilities associated with adversarial images (noise or small deformations in the input images that are visually insignificant, but that the network does not reduce correctly, leading to incorrect classification). This net converges more rapidly than an end-to-end learned architecture, does not suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients, and prevents overfitting, leading to better generalization. Module II takes as inputs the patients' CXRs and corresponding lung masks calculated by Module I, and produces as outputs a class assignment (Covid or non-Covid) and high resolution heat maps that identify the SARS associated lung regions. In preliminary work, CXR-Net was tested on a small dataset of CXRs from non-Covid and RT-PCR confirmed Covid patients acquired at HFHS Hospital in Detroit.","output":"Using CXR-Net to detect COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tau protein in vitro can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS); however, observations of this phase transition in living cells are limited.

Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag and performed a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) using the AmpdirectTM 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit as needed. The results obtained from each detection test were compared accordingly. Results There were 304 nasopharyngeal samples and 114 saliva samples were positive in the Lumipulse?

The treatment options for MS have increased greatly in recent years with the development of several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and the advent of immune reconstitution therapy (IRT). IRTs are administered in short-dosing periods to produce long-term effects on the immune system. Treatment with an IRT is based on the 3Rs: reduction, repopulation, and reconstitution of lymphocytes, which leads to restoration of immune effector functions. Cladribine tablets represent a selective, high-efficacy, oral form of IRT for patients with MS that targets lymphocytes and spares innate immune cells. Patients require only two weekly treatment courses, with each course comprising two treatment weeks, in Years 1 and 2; therefore, cladribine tablets are associated with a lower monitoring burden than many other DMTs, while short dosing periods can help to improve adherence. This review provides an overview of IRT and offers the clinicians perspective on the current MS treatment landscape, with a focus on practical advice for the management of patients undergoing treatment with cladribine tablets based on the most recent evidence available, including risks associated with COVID-19 and recommendations for vaccination in patients with MS.","output":"Cladribine Tablets for RelapsingCRemitting Multiple Sclerosis: A Clinicians Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"-","output":"Letter to the editor regarding article \\"Oguz Topal I, Kara Polat A, Zindanc? ?, et al.

PARTICIPANTS Overall 13 ophthalmologists participated following a surgical simulation session on goniotomy using the goniotomy blade at the 2019 Canadian Ophthalmological Society annual meeting. METHODS A 17-question survey to assess the face and content validity of the model was given immediately following the surgical simulation session on goniotomy using the goniotomy blade. Responses to each survey question were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1) strongly agree to (5) strongly disagree. RESULTS Respondents rated statements regarding the model with a median response of 1 (Strongly Agree) to 3 (Neither agree or disagree). Mann-Whitney U nonparametric analysis revealed no significant difference in responses between instructor vs. non-instructor or between prior experience vs. no prior experience for any of the survey statements. The model received highest survey ratings for utility in training residents, acquisition of surgical skills, accessibility, and higher likelihood of success with the procedure than theory and observation alone. Lowest ratings were for realism of the model compared to a human cadaveric eye. CONCLUSION Our results suggest the SimulEYE KDB model is a reasonably cost-effective solution for simulating angle-based surgeries.

Evidence is rapidly emerging on the epidemiology of COVID-19, and its impact on individuals and potential burden on health services and society. Between 10C35% of people with COVID-19 may experience post-acute long Covid. This currently equates to between 8,129 and 28,453 people in Scotland. Some of these people will require rehabilitation to support their recovery. Currently, we do not know how to optimally configure community rehabilitation services for people with long Covid. Methods: This national survey aimed to provide a detailed description of current community rehabilitation provision for people with long Covid in Scotland. We developed, piloted, and conducted a national electronic survey of current community rehabilitation service provision for people presenting with long Covid symptomatology. Our sample were the Allied Health Professions Directors of all 14 territorial NHS Health Boards in Scotland. Fixed response and narrative data were analysed descriptively. Results: Responses were received from all respondents (14/14), enabling a national picture to be gained. Almost all Health Boards (13/14) currently deliver rehabilitation for people with long Covid within pre-existing services. Fatigue (11/14) and respiratory conditions (9/14) were the two most common presenting problems of patients. Most long Covid community rehabilitation services are delivered through a combination of face-to-face and digital contact (13/14). Conclusions: Community rehabilitation for people with long Covid is an emerging reality. This survey provides a national picture of current community rehabilitation for people with long Covid. We do not know how community rehabilitation can be optimally delivered for this population. This is vital as community rehabilitation services were already under pressure prior to the emergence of COVID-19.

All patients received 96 mL of 320 mg I/mL contrast medium at the rate of 3.2 mL. The iodine dose required to enhance 1 HU of the aorta at the arterial phase and that of liver parenchyma at portal venous phase per BSA were calculated (EUBSA) and evaluated the relationship with BSA. Those per BW were also calculated (EUBW) and evaluated. Estimated enhancement values (EEVs) of the aorta and liver parenchyma with two protocols for dose decision based on BSA and BW were calculated and patient-to-patient variability was compared between two protocols using the Levene test. RESULTS The mean of EUBSA and EUBW were 0.0621 g I/m2/HU and 0.00178 g I/kg/HU for the aorta, and 0.342 g I/m2/HU and 0.00978 g I/kg/HU for the liver parenchyma, respectively. In the aortic enhancement, EUBSA was almost constant regardless of BSA, and the mean absolute deviation of the EEV with the BSA protocol was significantly lower than that with the BW protocol (P<.001), although there was no significant difference between two protocols in the hepatic parenchymal enhancement (P=.92).

Other molecular modelling methods such as molecular dynamics and combined quantum mechanics with molecular mechanics have also been successfully used to predict the properties of estrogens and xenoestrogens. Among published works, a great number also focused on the application of different types of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analyses to examine estrogen's structures and activities. Although the interactions between estrogens and xenoestrogens with various proteins are the most commonly studied, other aspects such as penetration of estrogens through lipid bilayers or their ability to adsorb on different materials are also explored using theoretical calculations. Apart from molecular mechanics and statistical methods, quantum mechanics calculations are also employed in the studies of estrogens and xenoestrogens. Their applications include computation of spectroscopic properties, both vibrational and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and also in quantum molecular dynamics simulations and crystal structure prediction.

In Ireland, current policy initiatives call for expanding the capacity for advanced nurse practitioners to meet healthcare needs in community settings. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE Further assessment data were required from stakeholders to inform graduate nursing education to prepare advanced practice nurses to fulfil increasingly complex healthcare needs. The practice doctorate approach included review of literature, current policy and assessment with interviews, dialogue and the development of working relationships with policymakers, academics and practitioners. DISCUSSION The current state and future vision of graduate nursing education are evolving. A force field analysis identified promoting and restraining factors to the desired state of development of the primary care advanced practice role. Relationship building with stakeholders and sharing of expertise was key to engage academia and policymakers to address identified restraining forces. Short-term outcomes included development of collaborative relationships between practice, academia and policymakers, curricular development for the primary care nurse practitioner and intentionally shared dissemination to promote community graduate nursing education.

Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all adult patients admitted to the acute care floors with COVID-19 respiratory failure. We used a run chart to quantify the frequency of prone positioning over time. For the subset of patients assisted by a dedicated physical therapy team, we compared oxygen before and after positioning. Our initiative consisted of four separate interventions: (1) nursing, physical therapy, physician, and patient education; (2) optimization of supply management and operations; (3) an acute care prone positioning team; and (4) electronic health record optimization. Results From March 9, 2020 to August 26, 2020, 176/875 (20.1%) patients were placed in prone position. Among these, 43 (24.4%) were placed in prone position by the physical therapy team.

Most research on the effectiveness of KT strategies has focused on individual strategies, i.e., those directly targeting the modification of allied health professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, for example. In general, these strategies are moderately effective in changing practices (maximum 10% change). Effecting change in organizational contexts (e.g., change readiness, general and specific organizational capacity, organizational routines) is part of a promising new avenue to service quality improvement through the implementation of evidence-based practices. The objective of this study will be to identify why, how, and under what conditions organizational KT strategies have been shown to be effective or ineffective in changing the (a) knowledge, (b) attitudes, and (c) clinical behaviors of allied health professionals in traumatology settings. METHODS This is a realist review protocol involving four iterative steps: (1) Initial theory formulation, (2) search for Evidence search, (3) knowledge extraction and synthesis, and (4) recommendations. We will search electronic databases such as PubMed, Embase, CINHAL, Cochrane Library, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. The studies included will be those relating to the use of organizational KT strategies in trauma settings, regardless of study designs, published between January 1990 and October 2020, and presenting objective measures that demonstrate change in allied health professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and clinical behaviors.

This fact adds a level of complexity that makes these systems prone to a noticeable worsening of their performance. Thus, their capabilities have to be upgraded to address these new requirements. Furthermore, this problem is even more challenging when the information comes from human individuals and their interactions through language. This issue happens more easily and forcefully in the specific domain of Sentiment Analysis, where feelings and opinions of humans are in constant evolution. In this context, systems are trained with an enormous corpus of textual content, or they include an extensive set of words and their related sentiment values. These solutions are usually static and generic, making their manual upgrading almost unworkable. In this paper, an automatic and interactive coaching architecture is proposed. It includes a ML framework and a dictionary-based system both trained for a specific domain.

RESULTS The PCT and CRP levels in the COVID-19 group were statistically lower than those in the CAP group (p < 0.05), but IL-6 was not statistically different between the two groups (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences existed in IL-6 and CRP when comparing the COVID-19 subgroups of the critical type, severe type, and ordinary type (p < 0.05). However, there was no clinical meaning in the evaluation of the difference in PCT levels among the three subgroups with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS PCT and CRP could be used as indicators in the differentiation between COVID-19 and CAP, but IL-6 was of little significance in the differentiation.

RESULTS: Of 178 patients, only 46 (27%) patients underwent any form of chest imaging. Thirteen (28%) of 46 imaged patients had positive chest X-rays (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) chest findings, with 8 (62%) of the 13 patients suggesting pneumonia or multifocal pneumonia, 3 (23%) patients having acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 2 (15%) patients demonstrating left sided pleural effusions thought to be the result of ruptured appendicitis unrelated to their COVID-19 diagnosis.

We found that increasingly entangled daily routines lead to close multi-species households where dog owners conceptualize technology as having a role to support them in giving care to their dogs. When confronted with the role of technology across various activities, only chores like cleaning up after our dogs lead to largely positive considerations, while activities that benefit us like walking together lead to largely negative considerations. For other activities, whether playing, training, or feeding, attitudes remain diverse. In general, across all activities both a nightmare scenario of technology taking the human's role and in doing so disentangling the human-dog bond, as well as a dream scenario of technology augmenting our abilities arise. We argue that the current trajectory of digital technology for pets towards allowing dog owners to interact with their dogs while away (feeding, playing, and so on) is an example of this nightmare scenario becoming reality, and that it is important to redirect this trajectory to one of technology predominantly supporting us in becoming better and more informed caregivers.","output":"On the role of technology in human-dog relationships: a future filled with dreams or nightmares?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Functional (psychogenic) movement disorders (FMDs) are conditions in which affected patients develop abnormal movements that are incongruous with known, organic, movement disorders, often associated with psychological stressors.

In this study, we investigated 11 microsatellite (MS) markers in the MHC-B region of chicken populations from four countries: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Korea, and Nigeria. The MS markers were divided into two sets. Set 1 included five novel MS markers, which we assessed using 192 samples from 21 populations. Set 2 included six previously reported markers, which we assessed using 881 samples from 29 populations. The Set 1 MS markers had lower polymorphism (polymorphic information content (PIC) < 0.5) than the Set 2 markers (PIC = 0.4C0.9). In all populations, the LEI0258 marker was the most polymorphic, with a total of 38 alleles (PIC = 0.912, expected heterozygosity (H(e)) = 0.918). Local populations from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nigeria had higher allele diversity and more haplotypes for Set 2 MS markers than Korean and commercial populations. The Sri Lankan Karuwalagaswewa village population had the highest MHC diversity (mean allele number = 8.17, H(e) = 0.657), whereas the white leghorn population had the lowest (mean allele number = 2.33, H(e) = 0.342). A total of 409 haplotypes (89 shared and 320 unique), with a range of 4 (Rhode Island red) to 46 (Karuwalagaswewa village (TA)), were identified. Among the shared haplotypes, the B21-like haplotype was identified in 15 populations. The genetic relationship observed in a neighbour-joining tree based on the D(A) distance agreed with the breeding histories and geographic separations. The results indicated high MHC diversity in the local chicken populations. The difference in the allelic pattern among populations presumably reflects the effects of different genotypes, environments, geographic variation, and breeding policies in each country.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a survey with IM attendings and trainees at a large academic medical center in Western Pennsylvania. We used descriptive statistics to characterize attitudes towards medication abortion provision, including the belief that it is within their scope of practice and interest in future provision, and to explore perceived barriers to provision. We used logistic regression models to assess factors associated with each of these attitudes. RESULTS: Of 397 eligible attendings and trainees, 121 (30%) completed the survey. Among those surveyed, 44% believed medication abortion is within the scope of practice of IM PCPs with trainees and female-identifying providers being significantly more likely to believe medication abortion is within their scope of practice compared to attending physicians and male physicians (60% vs 30%, p < 0.01 and 53% vs 31%, p = 0.01, respectively). Similarly, 43% endorsed interest in future provision, with trainees (67% vs 23%, p < 0.001) and female providers (54% vs 27%, p = 0.002) being more likely to express interest. The most cited barriers to provision included limited training in residency (70%) and low familiarity with abortion medications (57%). CONCLUSIONS: Many IM providers- particularly trainees- believe medication abortion is within their scope of practice and would like to provide this care. Interventions are needed to provide education and assistance complying with state and federal regulations to enable safe and efficient medication abortion provision by IM providers.

METHODS: Mechanically ventilated ARDS patients undergoing lung computed tomography and ultrasound were enrolled. Twelve fields, were evaluated. LUS score was graded from 0 (normal) to 3 (consolidation) according to B-lines extent. Total and regional LUS score as the sum of the four ventral (LUS(V)), intermediate (LUS(I)) or dorsal (LUS(D)) fields, were calculated. Based on lung CT, ARDS morphology was defined as (1) focal (loss of aeration with lobar distribution); (2) non-focal (widespread loss of aeration or segmental loss of aeration distribution associated with uneven lung attenuation areas), and diagnostic accuracy of LUS in discriminating ARDS morphology was determined by AU-ROC in training and validation set of patients. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with ARDS (25 training set and 22 validation set) were enrolled. LUS(TOT), LUS(V) and LUS(I) but not LUS(D) score were significantly lower in focal than in non-focal ARDS morphologies (p < .01). The AU-ROC curve of LUS(TOT), LUS(V), LUS(I) and LUS(D) for identification of non-focal ARDS morphology were 0.890, 0.958, 0.884 and 0.421, respectively.

At 6 inches, the mean sound intensity was 99.4, 96.4, and 64.5 dBA for the Stryker 840, 986, and QCR, respectively. Statistically significant differences in sound intensity between Stryker and QCR saws were noted under all testing scenarios (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS None of the cast saws produced intensities exceeding recommended standards for a single exposure or intensities reaching occupational hazard levels. The QCR saw was significantly quieter than both the Stryker 840 and 986 under all scenarios. The need for a recommendation of mandatory usage of hearing protection for patients and office personal could not be demonstrated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Cast saw noise is common in orthopaedic clinics. Our study demonstrates sound levels from commercially available saws do not reach occupational hazards but are sufficiently high that practical methods to reduce intensity may be warranted.","output":"Cast saw noise does not reach occupational hazard levels."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older age is characterized by more positive and less negative emotional experience. Recent work by Carstensen et al. (2020) demonstrated that the age advantages in emotional experience have persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In two studies, we replicated and extended this work. In Study 1, we conducted a large-scale test of the robustness of Carstensen and colleagues' findings using data from 23,350 participants in 63 countries. Our results confirm that age advantages in emotions have persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Study 2, we directly compared the age advantages before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a within-participants study (N = 4,370). We found that the age advantages in emotions decreased during the pandemic. These findings are consistent with theoretical proposals that the age advantages reflect older adults' ability to avoid situations that are likely to cause negative emotions, which is challenging under conditions of sustained unavoidable stress.","output":"Sustained Stress Reduces the Age Advantages in Emotional Experience of Older Adults: Commentary on Carstensen et al.

Subsequent societal discourse, however, has at times arguably protested the full protection and treatment of older people from COVID-19, potentially contributing to internalized ageism. To date, how older people interpret age-related pandemic messaging and discourse has not been explored. This study examined older adults perspectives of age-related COVID-19 messaging and societal discourse, as well as their perceptions of vulnerability, using a social constructionism framework. Adults age 65 to 89 years participated in semi-structured interviews about their thoughts and experiences with ongoing pandemic-related public messaging. Preliminary analysis suggests that participant perspectives of COVID-19 messaging are situated along a continuum of concern associated with contracting the virus. While some, for example, describe minimal concern, others express being fearful. Individual perceptions of safety appear to be informed, in part, by the presence or absence of an underlying health condition. Individual approaches to media criticism and consumption, personal risk-taking thresholds, financial stability, and social connectedness also appear to influence how the participants perceive pandemic-related messaging. Findings suggest the framing of COVID-19 and pandemic protocols, as well as the medias sensationalization of age-related issues, can impact older peoples perceived vulnerability of contracting the virus. Future research is needed to understand the long-term implications of ongoing pandemic-related messaging on older adults experiences of aging, as well as the consequences such messaging could pose to for their health and social behaviors.","output":"Exploring the Impact of Age-Related COVID-19 Messaging on Internalized Ageism in Older Adulthood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous betaherpesvirus that frequently causes morbidity and mortality in individuals with insufficient immunity, such as transplant recipients, AIDS patients, and congenitally infected newborns. Several antiviral drugs are approved to treat HCMV infections. However, resistant HCMV mutants can arise in patients receiving long-term therapy. Additionally, side effects and the risk to cause birth defects limit the use of currently approved antivirals against HCMV. Therefore, the identification of new drug targets is of clinical relevance. Recent work identified DNA-damage binding protein 1 (DDB1) and the family of the cellular cullin (Cul) RING ubiquitin (Ub) ligases (CRLs) as host-derived factors that are relevant for the replication of human and mouse cytomegaloviruses. The first-in-class CRL inhibitory compound Pevonedistat (also called MLN4924) is currently under investigation as an anti-tumor drug in several clinical trials. Cytomegaloviruses exploit CRLs to regulate the abundance of viral proteins, and to induce the proteasomal degradation of host restriction factors involved in innate and intrinsic immunity. Accordingly, pharmacological blockade of CRL activity diminishes viral replication in cell culture. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge concerning the relevance of DDB1 and CRLs during cytomegalovirus replication and discuss chances and drawbacks of CRL inhibitory drugs as potential antiviral treatment against HCMV.","output":"Cellular Cullin RING Ubiquitin Ligases: Druggable Host Dependency Factors of Cytomegaloviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"@#An outbreak of new infectious disease caused by novel coronavirus COVID- 19started in China last yearwhich mainly leads to pulmonary injuries.

Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies that explored pre-existing CVD and its traditional risk factors as risk factors of severe COVID-19 (defined as death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission). We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data (&#8805;10 cases of severe COVID-19). Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted meta-regression analyses. Results: Of the 661 publications identified in our search, 25 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 76,638 COVID-19 patients including 11,766 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR >~5 in >60-65 versus <50 years. Three studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors robustly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (10 studies; pooled RR = 1.73, [95% CI 1.50-2.01]), hypertension (8 studies; 2.87 [2.09-3.93]), diabetes (9 studies; 3.20 [2.26-4.53]), and CVD (10 studies; 4.97 [3.76-6.58]). RR for male sex was likely to be independent of age. For the other three factors, meta-regression analyses suggested confounding by age. Only four studies reported multivariable analysis, but most of them showed adjusted RR ~2 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD. No study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Despite the potential for confounding, these results suggest that hypertension, diabetes, and CVD are independently associated with severe COVID-19 and, together with age and male sex, can be informative for predicting the risk of severe COVID-19.","output":"The Relationship of COVID-19 Severity with Cardiovascular Disease and Its Traditional Risk Factors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predicting the functional sites of a protein from its structure, such as the binding sites of small molecules, other proteins or antibodies sheds light on its function in vivo.

Effective predictive markers are needed to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from CAP in the current pandemic conditions. Copeptin, a 39-aminoacid glycopeptide, is a C-terminal part of the precursor pre-provasopressin (pre-proAVP). The activation of the AVP system stimulates copeptin secretion in equimolar amounts with AVP. This study aims to determine serum copeptin levels in patients with CAP and COVID-19 pneumonia and to analyze the power of copeptin in predicting COVID-19 pneumonia. The study consists of 98 patients with COVID-19 and 44 patients with CAP. The basic demographic and clinical data of all patients were recorded, and blood samples were collected. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Serum copeptin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to CAP patients (10.2  4.4 ng/ml and 7.1  3.1 ng/ml; p < .001). Serum copeptin levels were positively correlated with leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet count (r = -.21, p = .012; r = -.21, p = .013; r = -.20, p = .018; respectively). The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that increased copeptin (odds ratio [OR] = 1.183, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.033-1.354; p = .015) and CK-MB (OR = 1.052, 95% CI, 1.013-1.092; p = .008) levels and decreased leukocyte count (OR = 0.829, 95% CI, 0.730-0.940; p = .004) were independent predictors of COVID-19 pneumonia.

While the majority of cases in most territories around the world have fitted an older age profile, our analysis shows that positive cases in Hong Kong have been concentrated among younger age groups, with the largest incidence of cases reported in the 15-24 age group. This is despite the population's rapidly aging structure and extremely high levels of population density. Using detailed case data from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Department and Immigration Department, we analyze the sex and age distribution of the confirmed cases along with their recent travel histories and immigration flows for the period January to April 2020. Our analysis highlights Hong Kong's high proportion of imported cases and large overseas student population in developing COVID-19 hotspot areas such as the United Kingdom. Combined with community action and targeted and aggressive early policy measures taken to contain the virus, these factors may have contributed to the uniquely younger age structure of COVID-19 cases in the city. Consequently, this young profile of confirmed cases may have prevented fatalities in the territory. Recent research has highlighted the importance of a demographic approach to understanding COVID-19 transmission and fatality rates. The experience in Hong Kong shows that while an older population age structure may be important for understanding COVID-19 fatality, it is not a given.

To better understand the effects of plastic waste, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) was done to com-pare the effects of various production and disposal methods. LCA shows the specific effects of the cradle-to-grave or cradle-to-cradle scenarios for landfill, incineration, and mechanical recycling. The analysis clearly indicates that increasing recycling of plastics can significantly save energy and eliminate harmful emissions of various carcino-gens and GHGs into the environment. As recycling increases, the need for virgin-plastic production can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, the results of this study may help improve current mechanical recycling processes as well as potential future recycling methods, such as chemical recycling. Concerns about the current recycling/disposal methods for plastics have brought increasing attention to the waste accumulation problem. However, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, plastic accumulation is expected to increase significantly in the near future.

Decision-makers in Malawi decided to introduce TCV and applied for financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance in 2020. The current plan is to introduce TCV as part of the national immunization program in late 2022. The introduction will include a nationwide campaign targeting all children aged 9 months to 15 years. Following the campaign, TCV will be provided through routine immunization at 9 months. This study aims to estimate the cost of TCV introduction and recurrent delivery as part of the national immunization program. METHODS: This costing analysis is conducted from the government's perspective and focuses on projecting the incremental cost of TCV introduction and delivery for Malawis existing immunization program before vaccine introduction. The study uses a costing tool developed by Levin & Morgan through a partnership between the International Vaccine Institute and the World Health Organization and leverages primary and secondary data collected through key informant interviews with representatives of the Malawi Expanded Programme on Immunization team at various levels. RESULTS: The total financial and economic costs of TCV introduction over three years in Malawi are projected to be US$8.5 million and US$29.8 million, respectively. More than two-thirds of the total cost is made up of recurrent costs. Major cost drivers include the procurement of vaccines and injection supplies and service delivery costs. Without vaccine cost, we estimate the cost per child immunized to be substantially lower than US$1. DISCUSSION: Findings from this analysis may be used to assess the economic implications of introducing TCV in Malawi. Major cost drivers highlighted by the analysis may also inform decision-makers in the region as they assess the value and feasibility of TCV introduction in their national immunization program.","output":"Projecting the cost of introducing typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) in the national immunization program in Malawi using a standardized costing framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HIV elite controllers (ECs) are characterized by the spontaneous control of viral replication, and by metabolic and autophagic profiles which favor anti-HIV CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses.

We found lower ACBP levels in ECs compared to ART-na?ve or ART-treated PLWH (p < 0.01 for both comparisons), independently of age and sex. ACBP levels were similar in ECs and HIV-uninfected controls. The expression of the protective HLA alleles HLA-B*27, *57, or *58 did not influence ACBP levels in ECs. ACBP levels were not associated with CD4 or CD8 T-cell counts, CD4 loss over time, inflammatory cytokines, or anti-CMV IgG titers in ECs. In ART-treated PLWH, ACBP levels were correlated with interleukin (IL)-1? levels, but not with other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-32, or TNF-.

Objective To describe the characteristics (race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and emergency medical services [EMS] response) associated with outpatient cardiac arrests and death during the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based, cross-sectional study compared patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest receiving resuscitation by the NYC 911 EMS system from March 1 to April 25, 2020, compared with March 1 to April 25, 2019. The NYC 911 EMS system serves more than 8.4 million people. Exposures The COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures Characteristics associated with out-of-hospital arrests and the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Results A total of 5325 patients were included in the main analysis (2935 men [56.2%]; mean [SD] age, 71 [18] years), 3989 in the COVID-19 period and 1336 in the comparison period. The incidence of nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in those who underwent EMS resuscitation in 2020 was 3 times the incidence in 2019 (47.5/100 000 vs 15.9/100 000). Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during 2020 were older (mean [SD] age, 72 [18] vs 68 [19] years), less likely to be white (611 of 2992 [20.4%] vs 382 of 1161 [32.9%]), and more likely to have hypertension (2134 of 3989 [53.5%] vs 611 of 1336 [45.7%]), diabetes (1424 of 3989 [35.7%] vs 348 of 1336 [26.0%]), and physical limitations (2259 of 3989 [56.6%] vs 634 of 1336 [47.5%]). Compared with 2019, the odds of asystole increased in the COVID-19 period (odds ratio [OR], 3.50; 95% CI, 2.53-4.84; P < .001), as did the odds of pulseless electrical activity (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31-3.02; P = .001).

In such control programs, the disease-free status can be compromised by factors that pose risks for introduction or persistence of the virus. The aim of the present study was to gain a comprehensive overview of possible risk factors for BVDV infection in cattle herds in Europe and to assess their importance. Papers that considered risk factors for BVDV infection in cattle were identified through a systematic search. Further selection of papers eligible for quantitative analysis was performed using a predefined checklist, including (1) appropriate region (i.e., studies performed in Europe), (2) representativeness of the study population, (3) quality of statistical analysis, and (4) availability of sufficient quantitative data. In total, 18 observational studies were selected. Data were analyzed by a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled estimates of the odds of BVDV infection. Meta-analyses were performed on 6 risk factors: herd type, herd size, participation in shows or markets, introduction of cattle, grazing, and contact with other cattle herds on pasture.

However, most medical schools in Taiwan have just begun to adopt this assessment method. In 2003, Kaohsiung Medical University (KMU) established the first standardized patient (SP) program in Taiwan and applied SPs with an OSCE. This study reports the process of the implementation of an OSCE at KMU, which includes collecting information, visiting leading clinical skills centers, consulting medical educators from other countries, holding international conferences, establishing an OSCE committee, writing cases, training SPs, administrating the OSCE, and receiving feedback from medical students. Most students were satisfied with the assessment and appreciated the learning experience. Based on the experience in 2003, the OSCE committee decided to incorporate the OSCE into the medical curriculum as a measure to assess medical students' clinical competences.

Data on prevalence and distribution of chest CT findings were extracted from eligible studies, pooled and meta-analyzed using random-effects model to calculate prevalence data of chest CT findings. RESULTS: Overall, 103 studies (pooled population: 9907 confirmed COVID-19 patients) were meta-analyzed. Most common CT findings were ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (77.18%, 95%CI = 72.23C81.47), reticulations (46.24%, 95%CI = 38.51C54.14), and air bronchogram (41.61%, 95%CI = 32.78C51.01). Pleural thickening (33.35%, 95%CI = 21.89C47.18) and bronchial wall thickening (15.48%, 95%CI = 8.54C26.43) were major atypical and airway findings. Findings were predominantly distributed bilaterally (75.72%, 95%CI = 70.79C80.06) and peripherally (65.64%, 95%CI = 58.21C72.36), while 8.20% (95%CI = 6.30C10.61) of patients had no abnormal findings and pre-existing lung diseases were present in 6.01% (95%CI = 4.37C8.23).

Several factors such as variable and nonspecific clinical manifestation, existence of large number of serovars and asymptomatic hosts spreading infection, poor sanitation and lack of an effective vaccine make prophylaxis difficult. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine to halt its spread all over the world. In this study, an immunoinformatics approach was employed to identify the most vital and effective immunogenic protein from the proteome of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain L1-130 that may be suitable to stimulate a significant immune response aiding in the development of peptide vaccine against leptospirosis. Both B-cell and T-cell (Helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)) epitopes were predicted for the conserved and most immunogenic outer membrane lipoprotein. Further, the binding interaction of CTL epitopes with Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) was evaluated using docking techniques.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We derived and validated a case-ascertainment model to identify OSA using linked provincial health administrative and clinical data from all consecutive adults who underwent a diagnostic sleep study (index date) at two large academic centers (Ontario, Canada) from 2007 to 2017. The presence of moderate/severe OSA (an apneaChypopnea index15) was defined using clinical data. Of 39 candidate health administrative variables considered, 32 were tested. We used classification and regression tree (CART) methods to identify the most parsimonious models via cost-complexity pruning. Identified variables were also used to create parsimonious logistic regression models. All individuals with an estimated probability of 0.5 or greater using the predictive models were classified as having OSA. RESULTS: The case-ascertainment models were derived and validated internally through bootstrapping on 5099 individuals from one center (33% moderate/severe OSA) and validated externally on 13,486 adults from the other (45% moderate/severe OSA). On the external cohort, parsimonious models demonstrated c-statistics of 0.75C0.81, sensitivities of 59C60%, specificities of 87C88%, positive predictive values of 79%, negative predictive values of 73%, positive likelihood ratios (+LRs) of 4.5C5.0 and CLRs of 0.5. Logistic models performed better than CART models (mean integrated calibration indices of 0.02C0.03 and 0.06C0.12, respectively). The best model included: sex, age, and hypertension at the index date, as well as an outpatient specialty physician visit for OSA, a repeated sleep study, and a positive airway pressure treatment claim within 1 year since the index date. INTERPRETATION: Among adults who underwent a sleep study, case-ascertainment models for identifying moderate/severe OSA using health administrative data had relatively low sensitivity but high specificity and good discriminative ability.

Given the lack of specific antiviral therapies, application of human convalescent plasma retaining neutralizing activity could be a viable therapeutic option that can bridge this gap. METHODS: We traced antibody responses and memory B cells in peripheral blood collected from 70 recovered MERS-CoV patients for three years after the 2015 outbreak in South Korea. We also used a mouse infection model to examine whether the neutralizing activity of collected sera could provide therapeutic benefit in vivo upon lethal MERS-CoV challenge. RESULTS: Anti-spike-specific IgG responses, including neutralizing activity and antibody-secreting memory B cells, persisted for up to 3 years, especially in MERS patients that suffered from severe pneumonia. Mean antibody titers gradually decreased annually by less than two fold. Levels of antibody responses were significantly correlated with fever duration, viral shedding periods, and maximum viral loads observed during infection periods. In a transgenic mice model challenged with lethal doses of MERS-CoV, a significant reduction in viral loads and enhanced survival was observed when therapeutically treated with human plasma retaining high neutralizing titer (> 1/5,000). However, this failed to reduce pulmonary pathogenesis, as revealed by pathological changes in lungs and initial weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: High titers of neutralizing activity are required for suppressive effect on the viral replication but may not be sufficient to reduce inflammatory lesions upon fatal infection. Therefore, immune sera with high neutralizing activity must be carefully selected for plasma therapy of zoonotic coronavirus infection.","output":"Sustained responses of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV in recovered patients and their therapeutic applicability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Cet article vise  proposer un bilan provisoire de la recherche dveloppe dans le contexte de la pandmie de COVID19 depuis le dbut de lanne 2020 Il value les types de recherche dj publis, prsente leurs mthodologies et analyse les questions poses Il replace les recherches rcentes dans la perspective de lhistoire des recherches empiriques sur la sexualit et notamment par rapport  celles qui ont t ralises dans le contexte du VIH-sida Situ dans une perspective dhistoire intellectuelle, larticle analyse les recherches actuellement dveloppes comme la construction et la prfiguration dun nouveau paradigme des sexualits qui distingue et associe les relations sexuelles qui se droulent en prsence dun partenaire rel et celles qui se droulent avec laide de toute une panoplie doutils lectroniques qualifis de ? virtuels ? qui assurent un support  limagination et entretiennent lexcitation sexuelle en vue de la satisfaction personnelle This paper aims to propose a provisional assessment of the research developed in the context of the COVID19 pandemic since the beginning of 2020 It reviews the types of research already published, presents their methodologies and analyzes the questions posed It places recent research in the perspective of the history of empirical research on sexuality, particularly in relation to research carried out in the context of HIV/AIDS Situated in an intellectual history perspective, the article analyzes research currently being developed as the construction and prefiguration of a new paradigm of sexualities that distinguishes and associates sexual relations that take place in the presence of a real partner and those that take place with the help of a whole range of electronic devices qualified as virtual that provide support for the imagination and maintain sexual arousal for personal satisfaction","output":"COVID-19 et Sexualits: lmergence dun nouveau paradigme des sexualits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ambulatory health care provider organizations participating in Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) organizations assume costs beyond typical practice operations that are directly associated with value-based care initiatives.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study to evaluate association between survival outcomes and treatment extensions/delays of pembrolizumab-based regimens in advanced NSCLC patients. Those who had received at least four cycles in routine practice were divided into two groups: non-standard (Non-Std: 2 cycles at intervals >3weeks +3days) and standard (Std: all cycles every 3weeks or 1 cycle >3weeks +3days). RESULTS: Among 150 patients, 92 (61%) were eligible for the study (Non-Std:27, Std:65). Reasons for patients with extensions/delays in the Non-Std group included: immune-related adverse events (irAEs,33%), non-irAE-related medical issues (26%), and patient-physician preference (41%). Non-Std group was more likely to have higher PD-L1 tumor proportion score, higher number of treatment cycles and pembrolizumab monotherapy. Univariate and 6-month landmark analyses showed longer median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in Non-Std group compared to the Std group.

The acceptance of ORV as an efficient supplementary tool is still low, not least because of limited immunogenicity and field trial data in local dogs. In this study, the immunogenicity of the highly attenuated 3rd-generation oral rabies vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS in local free-roaming dogs from Namibia was assessed by determining the immune response in terms of seroconversion for up to 56 days post-vaccination. At two study sites, free-roaming dogs were vaccinated by administering the vaccine either by direct oral administration or via a vaccine-loaded egg bait. Pre- and post-vaccination blood samples were tested for rabies virus neutralizing as well as binding antibodies using standard serological assays. A multiple logistic regression (MLR) analysis was performed to determine a possible influence of study area, vaccination method, and vaccine dose on the seroconversion rate obtained.

Health care professionals in dental practices are a high-risk population, due to close contact to saliva and aerosols. Specific guidance for those professionals is essential to control disease transmission and guarantee dentists health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a literature review based on online search in Pubmed, Scientific Electronic Library, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Cincias da Sade and Scopus databases. Included articles were fully read and analysed regarding infection control measurements, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), conditions for procedures and use of mouthrinse. RESULTS: Nineteen articles were added to this review. The majority of them recommended maintaining only urgency treatments, with use of rubber dam and mouthrinse before procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The data collected suggests dental care should be performed under strict protection measures such as a pre-check questionnaire prior to any dental procedure; postponing elective dental treatments and following infection control security procedures may be strategic at this point. The use of adequate PPE for procedures is recommended. Supplementary measures should rise from further understanding of the pandemics.

In this epidemic, most countries impose severe intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The policymakers are forced to make difficult decisions to leverage between health and economic development. How and when to make clinical and public health decisions in an epidemic situation is a challenging question. The most appropriate solution is based on scientific evidence, which is mainly dependent on data and models. So one of the most critical problems during this crisis is whether we can develop reliable epidemiological models to forecast the evolution of the virus and estimate the effectiveness of various intervention measures and their impacts on the economy. There are numerous types of mathematical model for epidemiological diseases. In this paper, we present some critical reviews on mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19. Some elementary models are presented as an initial formulation for an epidemic. We give some basic concepts, notations, and foundation for epidemiological modelling. More related works are also introduced and evaluated by considering epidemiological features such as disease tendency, latent effects, susceptibility, basic reproduction numbers, asymptomatic infections, herd immunity, and impact of the interventions.","output":"An evaluation of mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to assess the proportion of school attending adolescents who reached the recommended moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) level in Lagos State, Nigeria, as well as the predictors associated with it.

Docking of peptidomimetic inhibitors (inhibitor 92 and inhibitor 50) and allosteric inhibitors (nafamostat and camostat mesilate) in this study is carried out at the active site of the TMPRSS2 homology model. Known active ligands have low docking score energies varying from ?7.6 to ?8.7 kcal/mol. The docking study has confirmed peptidomimetic inhibitors bind with the catalytic triad HIS 41 and ASP 90 by strong hydrogen bonding. Allosteric inhibitors block access to the catalytic triad (HIS 41, ASP 90, and SER 186) by forming hydrogen bonds with ASP 180, GLN 183, and GLY 209 in the S1 pocket.

It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: : This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines effectiveness by age group. Results: : In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: : Colombias strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.","output":"Estimated number of deaths directly avoided because of COVID-19 vaccination among older adults in Colombia in 2021: an ecological, longitudinal observational study (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a coronavirus responsible for a global pandemic that started in China in December 2019 and has quickly spread to almost all countries.

PURPOSE: To evaluate CT ability in differentiating critically ill patients requiring invasive ventilation from patients with less severe disease. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from patients admitted to our institution for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 5th-24th. Patients were considered critically ill or non-critically ill, depending on the need for mechanical ventilation. CT images from both groups were analyzed for the assessment of qualitative features and disease extension, using a quantitative semiautomatic method. We evaluated the differences between the two groups for clinical, laboratory and CT data. Analyses were conducted on a per-protocol basis. RESULTS: 189 patients were analyzed. PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio and oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) were decreased in critically ill patients. At CT, mixed pattern (ground glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation) and GGO alone were more frequent respectively in critically ill and in non-critically ill patients (p < 0.05). Lung volume involvement was significantly higher in critically ill patients (38.5 % vs. 5.8 %, p < 0.05). A cut-off of 23.0 % of lung involvement showed 96 % sensitivity and 96 % specificity in distinguishing critically ill patients from patients with less severe disease. The fraction of involved lung was related to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio and SaO(2) (p < 0.05).

We detected increased concentrations of neurofilament light, a dynamic biomarker of neuronal damage, in the CSF of those with central nervous system inflammation (encephalitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) (14800pg/mL [400, 32400]), compared to those with encephalopathy (1410pg/mL [756, 1446], peripheral syndromes (GBS) (740pg/mL [507, 881]) and controls (872pg/mL [654,1200]). Serum neurofilament light levels were elevated across patients hospitalised with COVID-19, irrespective of neurological manifestations. There was not the usual close correlation between CSF and serum neurofilament light, suggesting serum neurofilament light elevation in the non-neurological patients may reflect peripheral nerve damage in response to severe illness. We did not find significantly elevated levels of serum neurofilament light in community cases of COVID-19 arguing against significant neurological damage.

The paper shows that covid-19 significantly intensified the processes of labor migration in the modern Russian school. These processes are analyzed based on data obtained during a sociological survey conducted in August-September of 2021. The intensification of labor migration processes has resulted in the fact that a significant number of teachers who have reached retirement age are leaving school today. Content analysis showed that this is due, firstly, to the concern of this category of teachers for their health, and, secondly, to a weak level of knowledge of modern information technologies, on which distance learning is mainly based. Another revealed trend of professional migration in the educational space of the Russian school in the conditions of the spread of covid-19 was that new teachers come to the place of outgoing teachers of retirement age - pedagogical workers who either do not have a systematic basic pedagogical education in a significant number, because they received it through professional retraining courses, or yesterday's graduates of pedagogical areas of training in the higher education system, due to natural reasons, having no experience in school.

Prior studies have demonstrated a reduction in ambulatory encounters and antibiotic prescriptions with the pandemic onset; however, the durability of these reductions in pediatric primary care in the United States has not been assessed. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures (e.g. social distancing, masking, school closures, and increased availability of telemedicine) on antibiotic prescribing and encounter volume in 27 pediatric primary care practices, and the duration of these changes. Patients under age 19 with an encounter from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 were included. The primary outcome was monthly antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 patients, in the overall population and a subset of encounters with infectious diagnoses, including respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was performed. RESULTS: There were 60,562 total antibiotic prescriptions from April to December in 2019 and 14,605 antibiotic prescriptions during the same months in 2020, a 76% reduction. The reduction in RTI encounter prescriptions accounted for 91.5% of the overall reduction in prescriptions from 2019 to 2020. Using ITS analysis, there was an immediate decrease from 31.6 to 7.4 prescriptions/1000 patients (predicted means) in April 2020 (-24.2 prescriptions/1000 patients; 95% CI: -31.9, -16.4) (Figures 1 and 2). This was followed by a stable rate of antibiotic prescriptions that remained flat through December 2020. For RTI encounters, a similar pattern was seen, with a decrease by 21.8 prescriptions/1000 patients; 95% CI: -29.5, -14.2) (Figures 1 and 2). Encounter volume also decreased immediately, and while overall encounter volume began returning to a pre-pandemic baseline volume toward the end of the study period, RTI encounter volume remained persistently lower through December 2020 (Figure 3).

AIM To describe the institutional experience using a knotless unidirectional barbed suture (V-Loc 180/Covidien, Mansfield, MA) to create a hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy (GJ) and jejunojejunostomy (JJ) during bariatric surgery. METHODS Evaluation of a case series of 87 morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass with a hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy (GJA) and jejunojejunostomy (JJA) between 01/2015 and 06/2017. The patients were divided into two groups: in group I, GJA und JJA sutures were performed using the knotless unidirectional barbed suture; in group II, GJA and JJA were sutured with resorbable multifilament thread (Vicryl? 3/0 Ethicon, Livingstone, UK). The recorded data on gender, age, BMI, ASA score, operative time, postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay, and reoperation, were analyzed and compared. RESULTS All procedures were completed laparoscopically with no mortality. The mean operative time was 123.23 (30.631) in group I and 127.57 (42.772) in group II (p<0.05). The postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. Early complications were observed for two patients (0.9%) in the barbed suture group and for one patient (0.42%) in the multifilament suture group (p<0.05). In group I two patients (0.9%) required reoperation: on the basis of jejunojejunal stenosis in one patient, and local abscess near the gastrojejunostomy, without a leakage, in the other. In group II one patient (0.42%) required reoperation due to stenosis of the GJA. The duration of hospital admission was similar for both groups: 3.36 (0.743) days in group I vs. 3.38 (1.058) days in group II (p<0.05). CONCLUSION The novel anastomotic technique is a safe and effective method and can be applied to gastrojejunal anastomosis and jejunojejunal anastomosis in laparoscopic gastric bypass.","output":"ROUTINE USE OF V-LOCK?

Addressing this task is necessary to the automatic recommendation of appropriate articles to readers with different comprehension abilities, and it further benefits education systems, web information systems, and digital libraries. Current methods for assessing readability employ empirical measures or statistical learning techniques that are limited by their ability to characterize complex patterns such as article structures and semantic meanings of sentences. In this paper, we propose a new and comprehensive framework which uses a hierarchical self-attention model to analyze document readability. In this model, measurements of sentence-level difficulty are captured along with the semantic meanings of each sentence. Additionally, the sentence-level features are incorporated to characterize the overall readability of an article with consideration of article structures. We evaluate our proposed approach on three widely-used benchmark datasets against several strong baseline approaches. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on estimating the readability for various web articles and literature.","output":"ReadNet: A Hierarchical Transformer Framework for Web Article Readability Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brazil has one of the fastest-growing COVID-19 epidemics worldwide.

First, we find that in high income countries, higher levels of democracy reduce the spread of COVID-19 while in the low income countries its influence is exactly the opposite. Second, we find clear evidence that three dimensions of culture (individualism versus collectivism, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity versus femininity) influence people's behaviour in relation with the spread of COVID-19 in a large manner. This study's addressability is wide, from regular people to top policymakers, through their common goal of limiting this pandemic and all the negative effects it brings along.

This study aimed to characterize the application experience with virtual interviews. METHODS: Applicants and programs participating in the 2020 AE fellowship match were prospectively sent separate 17-question surveys. Responses were collected using Research Electronic Data Capture. RESULTS: In total, 63/104 applicants (60.6%) matched and 64/71 (90.1%) positions filled within the match. The survey was completed by 37/87 (42.5%) applicants and 71 interviewers from 43/65 (66.2%) participating programs. Most applicants (64.7%) preferred a 1:1 applicant:faculty ratio and a 20-minute interview (73.5%), which was used by programs 50.7% and 47.8%, respectively. The majority of applicants (82.4%) and interviewers (76.8%) reported overall satisfaction with virtual interviews. The biggest limitations for applicants were getting a feel for the program and endoscopy unit. In the future, 41.2% of applicants preferred only virtual interviews compared to 7.2% of interviewers (P< 0.01). Conversely, 14.7% of applicants preferred only in-person interviews compared to 39.1% of interviewers (P= 0.01). Half of the interviewers (50.7%) would negatively view applicants who chose a virtual option over an in-person interview if both were offered. CONCLUSION: The majority of AE fellowship applicants and programs reported overall satisfaction with virtual interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the potential benefits, virtual interviews may have an increasing role in future residency and fellowship applications. Programs that conduct virtual interviews need to be aware of its limitations and have measures to improve the applicant experience and mitigate potential biases of interviewers.","output":"Virtual Interviews During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of Advanced Endoscopy Fellowship Applicants and Programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sedation for medical procedures is provided in a variety of clinical settings by medical personnel with differing levels of education and training. Although generally a safe practice, there is a degree of morbidity and mortality associated with sedation practice. Monitoring standards continue to be refined by professional societies with the goal of improving care. The depth of sedation should be monitored with clinical criteria. Processed electroencephalographic monitors currently do not contribute significantly to sedation care. Monitoring ventilation using pulse oximetry should be abandoned for more direct methods, such as capnography-transcutaneous carbon dioxide, respiratory acoustical and thoracic impedance monitoring could also play a role. Propofol has become widely utilized for sedation, although there are concerns about its margin of safety and synergistic interactions with other agents. Dexmedetomidine and propofol/ketamine also have utility. Patient-controlled sedation pumps and target-controlled infusion devices have been developed to improve patient care and satisfaction.

COVID-19 testing should be performed preoperatively with subsequent preprocedure quarantine. Nonemergent or nonlife-threatening surgery should be postponed for COVID-19 positive patients. The consensus of surgical societies is to use a laparoscopic surgical approach for COVID-19 positive patients when appropriate and to avoid port venting at the end of procedures. For COVID-19 positive patients requiring an emergent procedure, the use of personal protective equipment is strongly recommended.

Owing to the rarity of this disease, literature on its management is small. We present our experience of diagnosing and managing 11 cases of primary renal mucormycosis who presented during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. METHODS: We reviewed the records of all patients presenting to our institute with a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis from March 2021 to September 2021. All patients with a radiological, microbiological, or histopathological diagnosis of renal mucormycosis were included in the analysis and all demographic and clinical details, including a history of COVID-19 disease and its treatment, were noted. All patients were treated by a combination of intravenous antifungal therapy and aggressive surgical debridement including nephrectomy and multivisceral resection as required. Predictors of mortality were evaluated by statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients presented to our hospital with features of acute pyelonephritis of which 11 patients were suspected to have primary renal mucormycosis based on characteristic imaging features and confirmed on microbiological and histopathological examination. Of these, four patients had a history of COVID-19 infection. Only one patient had diabetes mellitus. Ten patients underwent nephrectomy and seven needed resections of surrounding organs. The colon was the most commonly involved organ. Five patients (45.5%) died of progressive sepsis. None of the predictors of mortality that were analyzed showed statistical significance. CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion, early cross-sectional imaging, prompt institution of antifungal therapy, and aggressive surgical extirpation are very important for achieving good outcomes in patients of primary renal mucormycosis.","output":"Renal mucormycosis presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic: A series of 11 cases from a tertiary care center in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic pathogen endemic to the Arabian Peninsula. Dromedary camels are a likely source of infection and the virus probably originated in Africa. We studied the genetic diversity, geographical structure, infection prevalence, and age-associated prevalence among camels at the largest entry port of camels from Africa into the Arabian Peninsula. METHODS: In this prospective genomic study, we took nasal samples from camels imported from Sudan and Djibouti into the Port of Jeddah in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over an almost 2-year period and local Arabian camels over 2 months in the year after surveillance of the port. We determined the prevalence of MERS-CoV infection, age-associated patterns of infection, and undertook phylogeographical and migration analyses to determine intercountry virus transmission after local lineage establishment. We compared all virological characteristics between the local and imported cohorts. We compared major gene deletions between African and Arabian strains of the virus. Reproductive numbers were inferred with Bayesian birth death skyline analyses. FINDINGS: Between Aug 10, 2016, and May 3, 2018, we collected samples from 1196 imported camels, of which 868 originated from Sudan and 328 from Djibouti, and between May 1, and June 25, 2018, we collected samples from 472 local camels, of which 189 were from Riyadh and 283 were from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Virus prevalence was higher in local camels than in imported camels (224 [475%] of 472 vs 157 [131%] of 1196; p<00001). Infection prevalence peaked among camels older than 1 year and aged up to 2 years in both groups, with 255 (669%) of 381 positive cases in this age group. Although the overall geographical distribution of the virus corresponded with the phylogenetic tree topology, some virus exchange was observed between countries corresponding with trade routes in the region. East and west African strains of the virus appear to be geographically separated, with an origin of west African strains in east Africa. African strains of the virus were not re-sampled in Saudi Arabia despite sampling approximately 1 year after importation from Africa. All local Arabian samples contained strains of the virus that belong to a novel recombinant clade (NRC) first detected in 2014 in Saudi Arabia. Reproduction number estimates informed by the sequences suggest sustained endemicity of NRC, with a mean R(e) of 116. INTERPRETATION: Despite frequent imports of MERS-CoV with camels from Africa, African lineages of MERS-CoV do not establish themselves in Saudi Arabia. Arabian strains of the virus should be tested for changes in virulence and transmissibility.

Studies of child-to-child and child-to-adult transmission and quantified the incidence of index and resulting secondary attack rates of children and adults in schools, households, and other congregate pediatric settings were identified. All articles describing confirmed transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from a child were included. PRISMA guidelines for data abstraction were followed, with each step conducted by two reviewers. RESULTS: 40 of 6110 articles identified met inclusion criteria. Overall, there were 0.8 secondary cases per primary index case, with a secondary attack rate of 8.4% among known contacts. The secondary attack rate was 26.4% among adult contacts versus 5.7% amongst child contacts.

In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of Rg1 in the sub-acute PD mouse model and explored the related mechanisms. Rg1 (10, 20, 40 mgkg(?1)d(?1)) was orally administered to mice for 18 days. A sub-acute PD model was established in the mice through LPS microinjection into the substantia nigra (SN) from D8 to D13. We found that Rg1 administration dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced damage of dopaminergic neurons and activation of glial cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The neuroprotective effects of Rg1 were associated with the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the improvement of anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophin in the midbrain. Rg1 shifted the polarization of microglia towards the M2 phenotype from M1, evidenced by decreased M1 markers (inducible NO synthase, CD16, etc.) and increased M2 markers (arginase 1 (Arg1), CD206, etc) in the midbrain. Furthermore, Rg1 administration markedly inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-B in midbrain microglia.

However, Cu is also a potentially toxic metal, especially to unicellular microbes that are in direct contact with their environment. Since 400 BCE, Cu toxicity has been leveraged for its antimicrobial properties and even today, Cu based materials are being explored as effective antimicrobials against human pathogens spanning bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. Given that Cu has the double-edged property of being both highly toxic and an essential micronutrient, it plays an active and complicated role at the host-pathogen interface. Humans have evolved methods of incorporating Cu into innate and adaptive immune processes and both sides of the penny (Cu toxicity and Cu as a nutrient) are employed. Here we review the evolution of Cu in biology and its multi-faceted roles in infectious disease, from the viewpoints of the microbial pathogens as well as the animal hosts they infect.","output":"Copper in infectious disease: Using both sides of the penny"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The medical profession, with its remarkable physical and emotional demands, predisposes physicians to compassion fatigue (CF) and burnout (BO). Although these conditions have been studied individually, little attention has been paid to how pediatric emergency physicians experience these conditions in the context of an Asian emergency setting especially during a global pandemic In our study, we aim to understand the experiences of individual physicians and describe the potential triggers or protective factors of compassion satisfaction, BO, and compassion satisfaction among physicians in an Asian pediatric emergency department during a pandemic. METHODS: A qualitative, individual interview methodology was used. From March to April 2020, we enrolled 20 physicians involved in frontline care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the pediatric emergency department to participate. Semistructured interviews were conducted, audiotaped, and transcribed in verbatim, with identifiers removed. Themes were identified, and data were analyzed using qualitative data analysis and iterative data analysis. RESULTS: We recruited 20 physicians. Three themes emerged from data analysis. First, we showed how workplace conditions are protective, including work morale, leadership and management, and social support received. Second, workload affected participants emotionally and in terms of its heavier quantity and longer hours. Finally, intrinsic factors that were protective in developing CF or BO include having professional autonomy, experience, work-life balance, and having emotional resilience to develop self-care. Cultural influences affect emotional regulation and can lead to negative coping with negative peer pressure. In general, participants quantified their levels of satisfaction at work as average to above average. However, they highlighted experiencing greater stress during COVID-19 with the underlying fear of contagion and infection. CONCLUSIONS: Being a pediatric emergency physician puts one at greater risk of experiencing CF and BO because of work and nonwork stressors, especially during a global pandemic, influenced by sociocultural factors. A positive and supportive work environment should be created while providing culturally adapted strategies to improve individual physician resilience to maintain their well-being.","output":"Are We in Control of Our Demons?: Understanding Compassion Satisfaction, Compassion Fatigue and Burnout in an Asian Pediatric Emergency Department in a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Born in a family divided by opposite understandings of Catholicism, the author chose first to be a radical social Catholic.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify cases of COVID\\\\19Cassociated CVT. The search period spanned 1 January 2020 to 1 December 2020, and the review protocol (PROSPERO\\\\CRD42020214327) followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\\\\Analyses guidelines.

The naturally occurring plant alkaloid berberine (BBR) is one of the phytochemicals with a broad range of biological activity, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity. BBR targets different steps in the viral life cycle and is thus a good candidate for use in novel antiviral drugs and therapies. It has been shown that BBR reduces virus replication and targets specific interactions between the virus and its host. BBR intercalates into DNA and inhibits DNA synthesis and reverse transcriptase activity. It inhibits replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This isoquinoline alkaloid has the ability to regulate the MEK-ERK, AMPK/mTOR, and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways, which are necessary for viral replication. Furthermore, it has been reported that BBR supports the host immune response, thus leading to viral clearance. In this short review, we focus on the most recent studies on the antiviral properties of berberine and its derivatives, which might be promising agents to be considered in future studies in the fight against the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.","output":"Antiviral activity of berberine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Overview: Coronavirus variants raise near\\\\term concerns?

We compared the accuracy of early longitudinal National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) measurement versus other early markers of stroke severity post treatment in predicting subjects' 90-day stroke outcome. METHODS Data are from the Endovascular treatment for Small Core and Anterior circulation Proximal occlusion with ESCAPE trial (Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times). Stroke severity was assessed at baseline, 1, 2, 5, 30, and 90 days. Subjects' functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale at baseline, 30 days, and 90 days. Group-based trajectory model was used to identify distinct subgroups of longitudinal trajectories of NIHSS measured over the first 2, 5, and 30 days. The accuracy of baseline NIHSS, infarct volume, 24-hour change in NIHSS, infarct volume, and disease severity trajectory subgroups in predicting 90-day stroke outcome were assessed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Group-based trajectory model of the 2-day longitudinal NIHSS data revealed 3 distinct subgroups of NIHSS trajectories-large improvement (41.6%), minimal improvement (31.1%), and no improvement (27.3%) subgroups. Individuals in the large improvement group were more likely were more likely to exhibit good outcomes after 90 days than those in the minimal improvement or no improvement subgroup. Among candidate predictors, the 2-day trajectory subgroup variable was the most accurate in predicting 90-day modified Rankin Scale at 84.5%.

The systemic inflammatory response is a pathogenic mechanism shared by cancer progression and COVID-19. We investigated systemic inflammation as a driver of severity and mortality from COVID-19, evaluating the prognostic role of commonly used inflammatory indices in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer accrued to the OnCovid study. METHODS: In a multicenter cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer in Europe, we evaluated dynamic changes in neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR); platelet:lymphocyte ratio (PLR); Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), renamed the OnCovid Inflammatory Score (OIS); modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS); and Prognostic Index (PI) in relation to oncological and COVID-19 infection features, testing their prognostic potential in independent training (n=529) and validation (n=542) sets. RESULTS: We evaluated 1071 eligible patients, of which 625 (58.3%) were men, and 420 were patients with malignancy in advanced stage (39.2%), most commonly genitourinary (n=216, 20.2%). 844 (78.8%) had &#8805;1 comorbidity and 754 (70.4%) had &#8805;1 COVID-19 complication. NLR, OIS, and mGPS worsened at COVID-19 diagnosis compared with pre-COVID-19 measurement (p<0.01), recovering in survivors to pre-COVID-19 levels. Patients in poorer risk categories for each index except the PLR exhibited higher mortality rates (p<0.001) and shorter median overall survival in the training and validation sets (p<0.01). Multivariable analyses revealed the OIS to be most independently predictive of survival (validation set HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.20, p=0.001; adjusted concordance index score 0.611). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation is a validated prognostic domain in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and can be used as a bedside predictor of adverse outcome. Lymphocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia as computed by the OIS are independently predictive of severe COVID-19, supporting their use for risk stratification.

OBJECTIVE: : To determine whether racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality still exist when Blacks and Whites are equally insured. DESIGN: : Routinely collected data on race, mortality, type of insurance, known risk factors, and lab results from the EPIC Patient Management System were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model. SETTING: : Piedmont Healthcare is the largest hospital system in Georgia. Due to its multiple locations across the state of Georgia, it receives a relatively equitably insured population. PARTICIPANTS: : All patients hospitalized with a positive COVID-19 status between March 1 and November 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES: : We hypothesized that Black patients would not have higher odds of mortality than White patients, and that type of insurance would predict COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: : 6,881 (3,674 Black, 3,207 White; 48% male, mean age = 60) patients were included. Race was not a significant predictor of COVID-19 mortality (p>0.05).

Children with epilepsy are challenging for teleconsultation as direct information from the patient is missing, regarding seizures and adverse effects, especially behavioral and psychological side effects. METHODS: Clinical and epilepsy-related details of telephonic consultations for children 1 month-18 years, performed between 26th March and 17th May 2020 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Uttarakhand (a state of India known for hilly terrains with low per capita income) were recorded. Suitable changes in the dose/commercial brand of antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen were performed, along with the addition of new AED and referral to local practitioners for immediate hospitalization, when urgent health care issues were detected. Voice call, text message, picture/video message, and all other possible measures were employed to accumulate maximum clinical information in real-time. RESULTS: A total of 153 children(95 males [62 %], 9.45a?a?3.24 years, 140 lower/middle socioeconomic status) were enrolled after screening 237 children with various neurological disorders, whose caregivers contacted for teleconsultation. A total of 278 telephone consultations performed for these 153 children (1-5 telephone calls per patient). Hundred-thirteen children were identified to have a total of 152 significant clinical events (breakthrough seizure/uncontrolled epilepsy (108), AED related (13), and unrelated systemic adverse effects (24), worsening of associated co-morbidities (7). In rest of the patients, the query of the caregiver included unavailability of AED/prescribed commercial brand in the locality, query related to the dose of drugs, proxy for a scheduled routine visit (no active issues), and concern regarding COVID-19 related symptoms and effect of COVID-19 and lockdown in children with epilepsy. Ninety-three (60 %) patients required hiking up of AED dose, whereas 29 (17 %) patients required the addition of a new AED/commercial brand. Five children were advised immediate admission to a nearby hospital. Overall, 147 (96 %) caregivers were satisfied with the quality of medical advice.

Participants: Adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19. Interventions: Use angiotensin II either as rescue vasopressor agent or as low dose vasopressor support. Main outcome measures: Patients treated before angiotensin II was available or treated in an adjacent COVID-19 ICU served as controls. For data analysis, we applied Bayesian modelling as appropriate. We assessed the effects of angiotensin II on organ function. Results: We compared 46 patients receiving angiotensin II therapy with 53 controls. Compared with controls, angiotensin II increased the mean arterial pressure (median difference, 9.05 mmHg;95% CI, 1.87-16.22;P = 0.013) and the PaO2/FiO(2) ratio (median difference, 23.17;95% CI, 3.46-42.88;P = 0.021), and decreased the odds ratio (OR) of liver dysfunction (OR, 0.32;95% CI, 0.09-0.94). However, angiotensin II had no effect on lactate, urinary output, serum creatinine, C-reactive protein, platelet count, or thromboembolic complications. In patients with abnormal baseline serum creatinine, Bayesian modelling showed that angiotensin II carried a 95.7% probability of reducing the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Conclusions: In ventilated patients with COVID-19, angiotensin II therapy increased blood pressure and PaO2/FiO(2) ratios, decreased the OR of liver dysfunction, and appeared to decrease the risk of RRT use in patients with abnormal baseline serum creatinine.

METHODS Electronic medical record data were collected and analyzed with chi-squared or t-tests to compare patient demographics. Generalized estimating equations for estimating the odds of outcomes were used, controlling for demographics. RESULTS Patients were 3.34 and 1.74 times more likely to complete a telehealth visit (n = 11,839) compared with an in-person visit during (n = 7,917) and prior (n = 15,497) to COVID-19. For patients on buprenorphine, patients with no prior in-person visits during the pre-televisit period were 2.26 more likely to complete televisits compared with patients with two or more prior in-person visits. For all patients, those with two or more prior in-person visits in the reference period were 1.27 times more likely to complete a televisit compared with a patient with no in-person visits during the pre-televisit period.

Sera were treated with protein G-agarose prior to testing for specific IgM and IgA to eliminate the possibility of false-positive results due to IgM-rheumatoid factor and to remove interisotypic competition due to specific IgG. IgM and IgA absorbance values were expressed as a percentage of the absorbance values of positive reference sera included on each plate (S/P%), and respective positive/negative threshold values of 15.0% and 28.0% were determined. The mean interval between experimental infection of 3 calves and initial detection of specific IgG1 and IgG2 responses was 8.0 and 9.3 days respectively, rising rapidly to an initial plateau 13.7 and 11.0 days postinfection (dpi). Reinfection of these calves at 30 dpi resulted in further rapid increases, with higher plateau values reached 13.0 (IgG1) and 13.7 (IgG2) days later. The mean interval between infection and the first positive IgM and IgA responses was 6.7 and 12.3 days, respectively. IgM S/P% values peaked at 13.0 dpi, with all 3 calves showing a secondary anamnestic response to reinfection, peaking 4.7 days later. The IgA response to initial infection was weak, with only 2 calves showing an obvious peak response at 15.0 dpi. A strong anamnestic IgA response to reinfection occurred in 2 calves, with a peak response 9.5 days later. Apparent biphasic and triphasic IgM and IgA responses were evident in some calves. Acute and convalescent serum samples from 80 calves involved in 17 outbreaks of respiratory disease were tested for specific IgM and IgA. Positive IgM results were detected in 15 outbreaks, with 71 sera from 44 calves testing positive.

Hines, Nicholas M. Greene Professor of Anesthesiology and Department Chair and Chief of Anesthesiology at Yale-New Haven Hospital. The pandemic led to abrupt changes at the national, hospital, and training program levels, all of which impacted trainees in anesthesiology and other disciplines. Nationally, there were sweeping regulatory changes that helped to shape the coronavirus disease-2019 response by medical front line workers. At each individual hospital, coronavirus disease-2019 units were created and teams were restructured to keep up with patient care demands. Educational programs adapted their curricula and trainees lost valuable clinical and academic opportunities. The innovative educational responses, including a pivot to virtual learning and virtual recruitment, provided a silver lining to the health care crisis. Another bright spot was that anesthesiology as a specialty rose to the forefront of patient care.

Hand searches were also undertaken using Google and reference lists to identify recent evidence. Studies were critically appraised, and the findings were analyzed by narrative synthesis. Nutritional status can impact immunity in several ways, including affecting susceptibility to infection, severity of disease, and recovery time, and is therefore a significant consideration in the management of COVID-19. COVID-19 can also impact digestive function, which can further impact nutritional status. The role of Vitamin D deficiency in vulnerability to severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, has been recognized, and it may have a role in treatment where deficiency is indicated. Healthcare professionals should be aware that obesity may be accompanied by micronutrient malnutrition including vitamin D deficiency and alterations in the microbiome and inflammatory responses, which can further impact immunity and disease severity.

A recent small study in outpatients with COVID-19 without acute respiratory distress syndrome suggests substantial symptom resolution. We therefore analyzed pharmacological/pharmacodynamic effects of isotonic or hypertonic saline, relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory care. METHODS: Mixed search method. RESULTS: Due to its wetting properties, saline achieves an improved spreading of alveolar lining fluid and has been shown to reduce bio-aerosols and viral load. Saline provides moisture to respiratory epithelia and gels mucus, promotes ciliary beating, and improves mucociliary clearance. Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 damage ciliated epithelium in the nose and airways. Saline inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells; possible interactions involve the viral ACE2-entry mechanism (chloride-dependent ACE2 configuration), furin and 3CLpro (inhibition by NaCl), and the sodium channel ENaC. Saline shifts myeloperoxidase activity in epithelial or phagocytic cells to produce hypochlorous acid. Clinically, nasal or respiratory airway care with saline reduces symptoms of seasonal coronaviruses and other common cold viruses. Its use as aerosol reduces hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis in children. Preliminary data suggest symptom reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 patients if saline is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Saline interacts at various levels relevant to nasal or respiratory hygiene (nasal irrigation, gargling or aerosol). If used from the onset of common cold symptoms, it may represent a useful add-on to first-line interventions for COVID-19. Formal evaluation in mild COVID-19 is desirable as to establish efficacy and optimal treatment regimens.","output":"Essentials in saline pharmacology for nasal or respiratory hygiene in times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess access to healthcare and to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among persons with epilepsy (PWE) during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a multicountry online survey among PWE. Persons with epilepsy were invited to participate through various social media channels. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale were used to score anxiety and depression. Logistic regression modeling was used to investigate factors associated with anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-nine PWE were included (mean age: 38.22  12.09 years), the majority were female (80.2%) and living in high-income countries (83.2%). Two hundred three PWE reported symptoms of a cold since January 2020. Nine (25%) of the 36 PWE tested for COVID were positive. A total of 72 PWE (19.6%) reported problems to obtain antiseizure medication (ASM), which in 25% of cases was directly COVID-related. Of the 399 PWE, 201 (50.4%) screened positive for anxiety according to the HADS; 159 (39.8%) and 187 (46.9%) PWE screened positive for depression based on the HADS and PHQ-9 scale, respectively. Female gender and financial problems were associated with both depression and anxiety. A planned follow-up consultation with the treating physician was associated with a lower risk of depression, whereas difficulties to access ASM treatment increased the odds of depression. In 65/137 (47.4%) PWE with a planned follow-up visit with the treating physician, this consultation was canceled. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative approaches are needed to ensure continuity in access to ASM treatment.

We assessed the magnitude of the outbreak and the role students and staff played using a self-administered antibody detection test and survey. METHODS: The school was closed on March 13, and the entire community was placed under quarantine. We implemented a home-delivery, self-administered, IgG/IgM antibody test and survey to a classroom stratified sample of students and all staff from May 4-19. We aimed to determine overall seroprevalence rates by age group, reported symptoms, contact exposure and to explore dynamics of transmission. RESULTS: Antibody positivity rates were 9.9% (95%CI: 8.2-11.8) for 1,009 students and 16.6% (95%CI: 12.1-21.9) for 235 staff. Among students, positivity was associated with younger age (P=0.01), lower grade level (P=0.05), prior RT-PCR positivity (P=0.03), and history of contact with a confirmed case (P<0.001). Among staff, positivity was higher in teachers (P=0.01) and in those previously RT-PCR positive (P<0.001). Excluding RT-PCR positive individuals, antibody positivity was associated with fever in adults and children (P=0.02; P=0.002), abdominal pain in children (P=0.001), and chest pain in adults (P=0.02). Within antibody positive individuals, 40% of students and 18% of staff reported no symptoms (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Teachers were more affected during the outbreak and younger children were at higher infection risk, likely because index case(s) were teachers and/or parents from preschool. Self-administered antibody testing, supervised remotely, proved to be a suitable and rapid tool.

The research questions were: (1) Has recreational cycling increased during the Covid-19 pandemic?; (2) If so, what factors have led to the increase?; and (3) What are some of the typical traits and behaviors of recreational cyclists? METHOD: Face-to-face surveys of 356 recreational cyclists were carried out in MarchCApril 2021 in four areas of inner Hanoi. The survey data were modelled through two binary and one ordinal logit regression. RESULTS: Recreational cycling has become much more popular in Hanoi during the Covid-19 pandemic, with early morning being the preferred time for this activity (to avoid heavy traffic). A quarter of the participants had starting cycling recreationally since the first lockdown in April 2020, and about three quarters reported having noticed an increase in cycling activity around them. Nearly half of the participants cycled regularly (more than four times per week). The groups that were most likely to have taken up cycling for recreations during the pandemic included men, those living with children in the home, and those not working or studying. Age and income were not significant. People have been embracing cycling as a way to maintain or increase physical activity levels, and to safely socialize at the time when social gatherings are limited, walking is prohibited in some zones, and social distancing rules apply everywhere. CONCLUSION: To sustain the growth in recreational cycling and widen the time-window for this activity while ensuring everyone's safety, Hanoi's planning and public health sectors should join forces to adopt a combination of hard and soft measures.

We present the case of a young gentleman with pulmonary embolism who was diagnosed with testicular seminoma despite lack of symptoms or signs suggestive of malignancy. This is a unique case describing a scenario not well documented in existing literature where contravention of clinical guidelines had a potentially advantageous outcome for the patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old white male presented with seemingly unprovoked acute pulmonary embolism with right heart strain. He did not have any predisposing factors for venous thromboembolism and did not have any symptoms or signs suggestive of malignancy. Clinical guidelines do not recommend further investigation to screen for malignancy in this scenario. Despite this, our young, otherwise healthy patient proceeded to computed tomography scanning, resulting in the diagnosis of localized testicular seminoma. Testicular ultrasound described normal-sized testes (despite a discrete lesion in the right testis), suggesting this was not detectable by the patient or clinician on routine examination. The patient was anticoagulated and had an inferior vena cava filter inserted to facilitate orchidectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy.

Dietary habits and the consumption of certain nutrients have been shown to influence inflammation. In this narrative review, we discuss currently developed tools to assess the inflammatory potential of diets and compare them with established tools.

The novel Empirical DII works without previous dietary intake assessment and the Anti-Inflammatory Diet Index was specifically developed in a northern European population. The Dietary and Lifestyle Inflammation Score addresses additional confounders. The informative value of dietary indices relies on the accuracy and completeness of dietary intake assessment. SUMMARY Dietary inflammatory indices are important tools to assess, compare and validate the inflammatory potential of diets across populations without the need for biomarker assessments. They allow to investigate associations between an (anti)-inflammatory diet with disease risk and course. Although the DII remains the most used index worldwide, currently developed indices allow more flexibility, have a different focus or simplify assessment.

Underlying acute liver diseases leading to hepatic failure differ between different geographic regions and in their incidence rates. In Europe etiological agents like viruses, drugs and toxins predominate over other much rarer causes. The different noxious agents lead to hepatocellular necrosis and/or apoptosis with loss of liver cell specific functions subsequent to a fall of functioning hepatocytes below a critical number. The syndrome is clinically characterized by the rapid onset of hepatic encephalopathy within 7 days after a first manifestation of liver disease (fulminant liver disease). Liver failure in patients with preexisting chronic liver disease is largely defined by the time which elapses between the occurrence of jaundice and encephalopathy (hyperacute, acute, subacute liver failure). The acute loss of liver specific functions is accompanied by a number of severe life-threatening complications like cerebral edema, circulatory failure, infections, renal failure and defective coagulation. Management of patients with fulminant liver disease requires a profound knowledge of hepatology and intensive care medicine. A close cooperation with a liver transplant unit is an absolute prerequisite for successful therapy. Permanent or temporary auxiliary liver replacement by a healthy human liver allows for a survival of 60 to 70% of patients selected for such a transplant procedure. Progress has been made in the temporary substitution of specific liver cell functions bridging the time period between liver failure and resumption of hepatocellular functions or availability of a donor liver.

Previous studies have shown that food fraud is associated with a large variety of food products and the fraud type may vary from deliberate changing of the food product (i.e. substitution, tampering, dilution etc.) to the manipulation of documents. It is therefore important that all actors within the food supply chain (food producers, authorities), have methodologies and tools available to detect fraudulent products at an early stage so that preventative measures can be taken.

In this study, we analyzed food fraud cases collected by MedISys-FF over a 6-year period (2015C2020) and show global trends and developments in food fraud activities. In the period investigated, the system has collected 4375 articles on food fraud incidents from 164 countries in 41 different languages. Fraud with meat and meat products were most frequently reported (27.7%), followed by milk and milk products (10.5%), cereal and bakery products (8.3%), and fish and fish products (7.7%).

Whilst many studies have evaluated the economic impact of schistosomiasis in humans, to date only one has been performed in livestock in SSA and none in Senegal. This study aimed to estimate the financial impact of livestock schistosomiasis in selected regions of Senegal. METHODS: Stochastic partial budget models were developed for traditional ruminant farmers in 12 villages in northern Senegal. The models were parameterised using data from a cross-sectional survey, focus group discussions, scientific literature and available statistics. Two scenarios were defined: scenario 1 modelled a situation in which farmers tested and treated their livestock for schistosomiasis, whilst scenario 2 modelled a situation in which there were no tests or treatment. The model was run with 10,000 iterations for 1 year; results were expressed in West African CFA francs (XOF; 1 XOF was equivalent to 0.0014 GBP at the time of analysis). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of uncertain variables on the disease costs. RESULTS: Farmers surveyed were aware of schistosomiasis in their ruminant livestock and reported hollowing around the eyes, diarrhoea and weight loss as the most common clinical signs in all species. For scenario 1, the median disease costs per year and head of cattle, sheep and goats were estimated at 13,408 XOF, 27,227 XOF and 27,694 XOF, respectively. For scenario 2, the disease costs per year and head of cattle, sheep and goats were estimated at 49,296 XOF, 70,072 XOF and 70,281 XOF, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the financial impact of livestock schistosomiasis on traditional subsistence and transhumance farmers is substantial. Consequently, treating livestock schistosomiasis has the potential to generate considerable benefits to farmers and their families. Given the dearth of data in this region, our study serves as a foundation for further in-depth studies to provide estimates of disease impact and as a baseline for future economic analyses.

The primary objective of this analysis is to classify the various policy factors adopted by the countries to manage the spread of Covid-19. Our study uses Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) dataset and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model as the model for forecasting. The representation is trained using day wise number of infected cases reported in each country from August2020 to October2020 and then forecasts the number of infections for five days from 15th November 2020 to 19th November2020. We have included 15 countries in our study and analysed 13 factors which includes 8 factors in Containment and Closure policies category, 2 factors in Economic policies category and 3 factors in Health System policies category. We analysed the impact of above factors by comparing the forecasted number of affected people with the actual total diseased cases reported in those five days. The study discovers the fact that out of thirteen policy factors, the countries which concentrated more on policies in economic category during the pandemic have helped in controlling the dissemination of covid-19.","output":"The Impact of Various Policy Factors Implemented for Controlling the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider two problems of NMT domain adaptation using meta-learning.

A great majority of SARS-CoV-2 strains (70.8%) belonged to lineages B, B.1, B.1.1 and B.1.1.1, and five strains belonging to four lineages were already reported in Italy (B.1.1.148, B.1.1.162, B.1.1.71, and B.1.425). In addition, 21 SARS-CoV-2 strains belonged to six lineages not previously observed in Italy were detected. No variants of concern were observed. A total of 152/1274 (11.3%) amino acid changes were observed among spike gene sequences and only 26/152 (17.1%) occurred in the receptor-binding domain region of the spike protein.

MSI Reproductive Choices UK (MSUK), one of the largest providers of abortion services in England, launched a no-test telemedicine EMA pathway on 6 April 2020. The objectives of this study were to report key patient-reported outcome measures and to assess whether our sample was representative of the whole population receiving no-test telemedicine EMA. METHODS: A sample of all MSUK's telemedicine EMA patients between April and August 2020 were invited to opt in to a follow-up call to answer clinical and satisfaction questions. A total of 1243 (13.7% of all telemedicine EMAs) were successfully followed-up, on average within 5 days post-procedure. RESULTS: Patients reported high confidence in telemedicine EMA and high satisfaction with the convenience, privacy and ease of managing their abortion at home. The sample responding were broadly equivalent to the whole population receiving telemedicine. No patient reported that they were unable to consult privately. The majority (1035, 83%) of patients reported preferring the telemedicine pathway, with 824 (66%) indicating that they would choose telemedicine again if COVID-19 were no longer an issue. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine EMA is a valued, private, convenient and more accessible option that is highly acceptable for patients seeking an abortion, especially those for whom in-clinic visits are logistically or emotionally challenging. Evidence that this pathway would be a first choice again in future for most patients supports the case to make telemedicine EMA permanent.","output":"Acceptability of no-test medical abortion provided via telemedicine: analysis of patient-reported outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of the new pandemic, COVID-19 health services have had to face a new scenario.

In Africa, K13-propeller genotyping confirms the emergence of the R561H mutation in Rwanda and highlights the continuing dominance of wild-type K13 elsewhere. Using gene editing, we show that R561H, along with C580Y and M579I, confer elevated in vitro ART resistance in some African strains, contrasting with minimal changes in ART susceptibility in others. C580Y and M579I cause substantial fitness costs, which may slow their dissemination in high-transmission settings, in contrast with R561H that in African 3D7 parasites is fitness neutral. In Cambodia, K13 genotyping highlights the increasing spatio-temporal dominance of C580Y. Editing multiple K13 mutations into a panel of Southeast Asian strains reveals that only the R561H variant yields ART resistance comparable to C580Y. In Asian Dd2 parasites C580Y shows no fitness cost, in contrast with most other K13 mutations tested, including R561H. Editing of point mutations in ferredoxin or mdr2, earlier associated with resistance, has no impact on ART susceptibility or parasite fitness. These data underline the complex interplay between K13 mutations, parasite survival, growth and genetic background in contributing to the spread of ART resistance.","output":"Plasmodium falciparum K13 mutations in Africa and Asia impact artemisinin resistance and parasite fitness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One key factor in stopping the spread of COVID-19 is practicing social distancing.

We established a translational approach combining home blood sampling by finger-pricking with multiplexed serology to assess the exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a general population. The developed procedure determines the immune response in multiplexed assays against several spike (S, here denoted SPK), receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (NCP) proteins in eluates from dried capillary blood. The seroprevalence was then determined in two study sets by mailing 1000 blood sampling kits to random households in urban Stockholm during early and late April 2020, respectively. After receiving 55% (1097/2000) of the cards back within three weeks, 80% (878/1097) were suitable for the analyses of IgG and IgM titers. The data revealed diverse pattern of immune response, thus seroprevalence was dependent on the antigen, immunoglobulin class, stringency to include different antigens, as well as the required analytical performance. Applying unsupervised dimensionality reduction to the combined IgG and IgM data, 4.4% (19/435; 95% CI: 2.4%-6.3%) and 6.3% (28/443; 95% CI: 4.1%-8.6%) of the samples clustered with convalescent controls.

Its use was rapidly expanded due to the international public health emergency of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak in 2020. Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) swiftly enabled temporary MBS telehealth items on 13 March 2020, currently extended until 31 March 20211. In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, Antony et al. conducted a single-centre public survey to assess patient perception of rheumatology telehealth. Their results showed that 98.4% of patients consider telehealth acceptable during the pandemic2. It is unclear, however, whether this positive perception persists after patients experience a telehealth. In addition, a survey data in 2019 suggested more than half of Australian rheumatologists work in private practice3. Therefore, inclusion of private patients will better represent patient perception of telehealth. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate patient satisfaction with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. This would determine its feasibility to be integrated in future rheumatology outpatient model. Methods: A questionnaire containing 30 questions was sent to rheumatology patients who attended telehealth appointments at a level 2 public hospital and a local private clinic between April and May 2020. The questionnaires aimed to obtain information on baseline demographics (sex, age, public or private patient, employment status, visual or auditory impairment), appointment details (TPhone or TVideo, usual arrangement for face-to-face (F2F) appointment, cost effectiveness) and appointment satisfaction using a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 1452 patients, of which 494 patients responded (34%). Female predominance (77.1%) and a higher proportion of TPhone (79.1%) was seen in the respondents. A majority of patients were existing patients known to the services (90.9%). More than 70% of responses indicated overall satisfaction in specialist care via telehealth, and 88.7% perceived this suitable during a pandemic. Of all respondents, 21.7% were prescribed new medication, and the majority of these patients were confident in taking the new medication after the telehealth appointment. Future acceptability for TPhone was significantly lower in private patients compared to public patients (p= 0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed that higher telehealth satisfaction was associated with needing to take time off work to attend face-to-face appointment (p= 0.02), perception of cost effectiveness (p<0.001) and TVideo (p=0.03). Conclusion: This is the first study which included both public and private rheumatology patients to evaluate patient satisfaction for telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall high level of satisfaction was seen in telehealth most notably associated with its cost effectiveness. A higher percentage of patients who had TVideo compared to TPhone were receptive to future telehealth via TVideo, supportive of the importance of visual cues. This in turn will have significant administrative and technological burdens to coordinate in comparison to a F2F or TPhone review.

Fifty-two subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection but mild COVID-19 symptoms (mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients) and 206 matched subjects without SARS-CoV-2 infection were controls. We measured 25OHD and IL-6 levels at admission and focused on respiratory outcome during hospitalization.Findings: Moderately-to-severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients had lower 25OHD levels (45.528.5 nmol/L) than mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients and non SARS-CoV-2 infected controls (75.821.3 nmol/L and 63.523.5 nmol/L, respectively, p<0.0001 for both comparisons). 25OHD and IL-6 levels were respectively lower and higher in moderately-to-severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care Unit [(ICU), 36.021.5 nmol/L and 43.0 [19.0-56.0] pg/mL, respectively], than in those not requiring ICU admission (56.031.8 nmol/L, p=0.0001 and 16.0[8.0-32.0] pg/mL, p=0.0002, respectively).

This creates a therapeutic challenge to the treatment of COVID-19 with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) due to the potential for significant drug-drug interactions (DDI). However, pwCF are more at risk of serious illness following COVID-19 infection and hence it is important to manage the DDI risk and provide treatment options. Methods: CYP3A-mediated DDI of ETI was evaluated using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approach. Modeling was performed incorporating physiological information and drug dependent parameters of ETI to predict the effect of ritonavir (the CYP3A4 inhibiting component of the combination) on pharmacokinetics of ETI. The ETI models were verified using independent clinical pharmacokinetic and DDI data of ETI with a range of CYP3A modulators. Results: When ritonavir was administered on day 1 through 5, the predicted AUC ratio of ivacaftor (the most sensitive CYP3A substrate) on day 6 was 9.31, indicating that its metabolism was strongly inhibited. Based on the predicted DDI, the dose of ETI should be reduced when co-administered with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir to elexacaftor 200mg-tezacaftor 100mg-ivacaftor 150mg on days 1 and 5, with resumption of full dose ETI on day 9, considering the residual inhibitory effect of ritonavir as a mechanism-based inhibitor. Conclusions: Coadministration of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir requires a significant reduction in the ETI dosing frequency with delayed resumption of full dose due to the mechanism-based inhibition with ritonavir.","output":"PBPK-led guidance for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients taking elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor with the newly approved fixed dose combination nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (PAXLOVID) for the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019), the Indian government implemented several policies and restrictions to curtail its spread.

Future predictions about the spread can be helpful for future policy-making, i.e., to plan and control the COVID-19 spread. Further, it is observed throughout the world that asymptomatic corona cases play a major role in the spread of the disease. This motivated us to include such cases for accurate trend prediction.

From a pathophysiological view, in the recent definition, sepsis has been defined as the result of a complex interaction between host response and the infecting organism, resulting in life-threatening organ dysfunction, depending on microcirculatory derangement, cellular hypoxia/dysoxia driven by hypotension and, potentially, death. The high energy expenditure driven by a high metabolic state induced by the host response may rapidly lead to micronutrient depletion. This deficiency can result in alterations in normal energy homeostasis, free radical damage, and immune system derangement. In critically ill patients, micronutrients are still relegated to an ancillary role in the whole treatment, and always put in a second-line place or, frequently, neglected. Only some micronutrients have attracted the attention of a wider audience, and some trials, even large ones, have tested their use, with controversial results. The present review will address this topic, including the recent advancement in the study of vitamin D and protocols based on vitamin C and other micronutrients, to explore an update in the setting of sepsis, gain some new insights applicable to COVID-19 patients, and to contribute to a pathophysiological definition of the potential role of micronutrients that will be helpful in future dedicated trials.","output":"Micronutrients in Sepsis and COVID-19: A Narrative Review on What We Have Learned and What We Want to Know in Future Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: : The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a serious threat for the health of immunocompromised patients.

Appendicitis is frequently managed by appendicectomy. After the onset of the pandemic, selected cases of appendicitis were managed with antibiotics which is a recognised treatment option. Our objective was to compare the management of appendicitis and post-operative outcomes between pre- and post-COVID-19. METHODS: Ninety-six patients were identified from before the onset of the pandemic (November 2019) to after the onset of the pandemic (May 2020). Data were collected retrospectively from electronic records including demographics, investigations, treatment, duration of inpatient stay, complications, readmissions and compared between pre- and post-COVID-19 groups. RESULTS: One hundred percent underwent surgical treatment before the onset of pandemic, compared with 56.3% from the onset of the pandemic. A greater percentage of patients were investigated with imaging post-COVID-19 (100% versus 60.9%; p < 0.00001). There was no significant difference in the outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSION: CT/MRI scan was preferred to laparoscopy in diagnosing appendicitis and conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis was common practice after the onset of pandemic. Health boards can adapt their management of surgical conditions during pandemics without adverse short-term consequences. Long term follow-up of this cohort will identify patients suitable for conservative management.","output":"SP4.1.13 Management of appendicitis during COVID-19 pandemic; short-term outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocarditis remains a clinical challenge in pediatrics. Originally, it was recognized at autopsy before the application of endomyocardial biopsy, which led to a histopathology-based diagnosis such as in the Dallas criteria. Given the invasive and low-sensitivity nature of endomyocardial biopsy, its diagnostic focus shifted to a reliance on clinical suspicion. With the advances of cardiac magnetic resonance, an examination of the whole heart in vivo has gained acceptance in the pursuit of a diagnosis of myocarditis. The presentation may vary from minimal symptoms to heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock. Outcomes span full resolution to chronic heart failure and the need for heart transplantation with inadequate clues to predict the disease trajectory. The American Heart Association commissioned this writing group to explore the current knowledge and management within the field of pediatric myocarditis. This statement highlights advances in our understanding of the immunopathogenesis, new and shifting dominant pathogeneses, modern laboratory testing, and use of mechanical circulatory support, with a special emphasis on innovations in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

Many individuals are concerned about the potential side-effects of the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine boosters. The purpose of this study was to assess attitudes and satisfaction concerning COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine boosters in the population in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey measuring COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and satisfaction was distributed from September to December 2021. Multiple linear regression was used to explore associations between demographic variables and questionnaire results. Spearmans correlation analysis was used to examine associations between attitude and satisfaction scores. Results: A total of 780 questionnaire responses were obtained. The largest groups of participants reported having obtained a first vaccination dose via viral vaccine (52.8%), a second vaccination booster via viral vaccine (49.5%), and a third vaccination booster via mRNA vaccine (28.8%). Multiple linear regression revealed a lower association between vaccine attitude scores and having earned less than a bachelors degree ( ?0.109; 95% CI ?2.541, ?0.451) and infection risk without self-isolating ( ?0.154; 95% CI ?4.152, ?0.670) compared with attaining a bachelors degree or higher and never having being at risk of infection, respectively. Higher vaccine satisfaction scores were more closely associated with being married than being single ( 0.074; 95% CI ?0.073, 3.022), whereas lower vaccine satisfaction scores were less closely associated with non-healthcare workers ( ?0.143; 95% CI ?4.698, ?0.831) and infection risk without self-isolating ( ?0.132; 95% CI ?6.034, ?0.502) compared with non-healthcare workers and never being at risk of infection. There was weak but significant positive correlation between attitude and satisfaction scores (r = 0.338, p-value < 0.001). Hence, a gradual decline in protection following vaccination and the positive effects of a booster dose after primary vaccination have made the decision to administer booster doses. Conclusion: The results suggest that policymakers need to develop more effective strategies to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination.","output":"The Relationship between Attitudes and Satisfaction Concerning the COVID-19 Vaccine and Vaccine Boosters in Urban Bangkok, Thailand: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been faced with challenges in maintaining interdisciplinary research collaborations.

Most published Egyptian economic evaluation studies have used utility values from other published studies and systematic reviews. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop an Egyptian EQ-5D-5L value set using the international EuroQol standardized protocol (EQ-VT-2.1). This study is a revision of a previous EQ-5D-5L value set for Egypt retracted by the authors. METHODS: Adult Egyptian participants were recruited from public places using multi-stratified quota sampling based on age, sex, and geographical distribution. Two elicitation techniques were applied: the composite time trade-off (cTTO) and discrete-choice experiments (DCEs). Before actual data collection, interviewers performance was assessed in a pilot phase. Data were modelled using generalized least squares, Tobit, heteroskedastic, logit, and hybrid models, and the best fitting model was selected based on logical consistency of the parameters, significance level, prediction accuracy, and model parsimony. RESULTS: A total of 1378 interviews were conducted, of which 188 were excluded because they were incomplete and did not comply with the protocol, 216 were pilot interviews, and 974 were included in the final analysis. The heteroskedastic model with constraints (model 4) based on the cTTO data was selected as the preferred model to generate the value set. Values ranged from ? 0.964 for the worst health state (55555) to 1 for full health (11111) and 0.948 for 11211, with 1123 of all predicted health states (35.94%) being worse than dead. Mobility had the largest impact on health state preference values. CONCLUSION: This is the first value set for the EQ-5D-5L based on social preferences obtained from a nationally representative sample in Egypt or any Arabic-speaking country. The value set can be used as a scoring system for economic evaluation and to improve the quality of health technology assessment in the Egyptian healthcare system.","output":"The EQ-5D-5L Valuation Study in Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Although clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 has been extensively described, immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 remains yet not fully understood. Similarities with bacterial sepsis were observed; however, few studies specifically addressed differences of immune response between both conditions. Here, we report a longitudinal analysis of the immune response in coronavirus disease 2019 patients, its correlation with outcome, and comparison between severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients and septic patients. DESIGN: Longitudinal, retrospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary-care hospital during the first 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in France. PATIENTS: All successive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection admitted to the emergency department, medical ward, and ICU with at least one available immunophenotyping performed during hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, 247 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 were included and compared with a historical cohort of 108 severe septic patients. Nonsevere coronavirus disease 2019 patients (n = 153) presented normal or slightly altered immune profiles. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (n = 94) immune profile differed from sepsis. Coronavirus disease 2019 exhibited profound and prolonged lymphopenia (mostly on CD3, CD4, CD8, and NK cells), neutrophilia, and human leukocyte antigen D receptor expression on CD14+ monocytes down-regulation. Surprisingly, coronavirus disease 2019 patients presented a unique profile of B cells expansion, basophilia, and eosinophilia. Lymphopenia, human leukocyte antigen D receptor expression on CD14+ monocytes down-regulation, and neutrophilia were associated with a worsened outcome, whereas basophilia and eosinophilia were associated with survival. Circulating immune cell kinetics differed between severe coronavirus disease 2019 and sepsis, lack of correction of immune alterations in coronavirus disease 2019 patients during the first 2 weeks of ICU admission was associated with death and nosocomial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating immune cells profile differs between mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a unique immune profile as compared with sepsis. Several immune features are associated with outcome.

In contrast to traditional diagnosis in a hospital environment, wearables can give unrestricted access to real-time physiological data. COVID-19 epidemic is increasing at a faster rate with limited test kits. Hence, it becomes essential to develop a novel COVID-19 diagnostic model. Numerous studies were based on the utilization of artificial intelligence techniques on radiological images to precisely identify the disease. This chapter presents an efficient fusion-based feature extraction with multikernel extreme learning machine (FFE-MKELM) for COVID-19 diagnosis using internet of things (IoT) and wearables. Primarily, the wearables and IoT are used to capture the radiological images of the patient. The presented FFE-MKELM model incorporates Gaussian filtering based preprocessing for removing the noise that exists in the radiological image. Besides, directional local extreme patterns with deep features based on Inception v4 model are applied for the FFE process. In addition, MKELM model is utilized as a classification model to determine the appropriate class label of the input radiological images. Moreover, monarch butterfly optimization algorithm is applied to fine tune the parameters involved in the MKELM model. Experimental validation of the FFE-MKELM model is performed against benchmark dataset and the outcomes are inspected under different measures. The resultant simulation outcome ensured the betterment of the FFE-MKELM method by demonstrating an increased sensitivity of 97.34%, specificity of 97.26%, accuracy of 97.14%, and F-measure of 97.01%. ? 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Considering the important role of gut microbiota in maturation, regulation, and induction of the immune system and subsequent inflammatory processes, it seems that evaluating the composition of gut microbiota in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy individuals may have potential value as a diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker for the disease. Also, therapeutic interventions affecting gut microbial flora may open new horizons in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and accelerating their recovery. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for relevant studies published from December 2019 to December 2021 using Pubmed/Medline, Embase, and Scopus. Articles containing the following keywords in titles or abstracts were selected: SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 or Coronavirus Disease 19 and gastrointestinal microbes or dysbiosis or gut microbiota or gut bacteria or gut microbes or gastrointestinal microbiota. RESULTS: Out of 1,668 studies, 22 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and a total of 1,255 confirmed COVID-19 patients were examined. All included studies showed a significant association between COVID-19 and gut microbiota dysbiosis. The most alteration in bacterial composition of COVID-19 patients was depletion in genera Ruminococcus, Alistipes, Eubacterium, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Fusicathenibacter, and Blautia and enrichment of Eggerthella, Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Clostridium, Streptococcus, Rothia, and Collinsella. Also, some gut microbiome alterations were associated with COVID-19 severity and poor prognosis including the increment of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Campylobacter, Rothia, Corynebacterium, Megasphaera, Enterococcus, and Aspergillus spp. and the decrement of Roseburia, Eubacterium, Lachnospira, Faecalibacterium, and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio.

We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study, and followed-up with all children from the families with SARS-CoV-2 infected members in Zhejiang Province, China. All infections were confirmed by testing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with real-time reverse transcription PCR method, and epidemiological data between children and adults in the same families were compared. Effect of antiviral therapy was evaluated observationally and fecal-viral excretion times among groups with different antiviral regiments were compared with Kaplan-Meier plot. By 29 February 2020, 1298 cases from 883 families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 314 of which were families with children. Incidence of infection in child close contacts was significantly lower than that in adult contacts (13.2% vs 21.2%). The mean age of 43 pediatric cases was 8.2 years and mean incubation period was 9.1 days. Forty (93.0%) were family clustering. Thirty-three children had coronavirus disease 2019 (20 pneumonia) with mild symptoms and 10 were asymptomatic. Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was positive in 91.4% (32/35) cases and some children had viral excretion time over 70 days. Viral clearance time was not different among the groups treated with different antiviral regiments. No subsequent infection was observed in family contacts of fecal-viral-excreting children.

Conventional biochemical mechanism-driven approaches are highly dependent on complicated and redundant model parameters, resulting in low efficiency. Besides, sharp increase in business volume of wastewater treatment requires automatic operation technologies for this purpose. Under this background, researchers started to introduce the idea of data mining to model the WTP, in order to automatically predict WTR given inlet conditions and aeration amount. However, existing data-driven approaches for this purpose focus on modelling of the WTP at independent timestamps, neglecting sequential characteristics of timestamps during the long-term treatment process. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, a novel prediction and control framework through combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed for prediction of the WTR. Firstly, the CNN model is utilized to automatically extract the local features of each independent timestamp in the WTP and make them encoded. Next, the RNN model is employed to represent global sequential features of the WTP on the basis of local feature encoding. Finally, we conduct a large number of experiments to verify efficiency and stability of the proposed prediction framework.","output":"Data-driven prediction and control of wastewater treatment process through the combination of convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There are increasing opportunities for healthcare professionals outside medicine to be involved in and lead clinical research. However, there are few roles within these professions that include time for research. In order to develop such roles, and evaluate effective use of this time, the range of impacts of this clinical academic activity need to be valued and understood by healthcare leaders and managers. To date, these impacts have not been comprehensively explored, but are suggested to extend beyond traditional quantitative impact metrics, such as publications, citations and funding awards. METHODS Ten databases, four grey literature repositories and a na?ve web search engine were systematically searched for articles reporting impacts of clinical academic activity by healthcare professionals outside medicine. Specifically, this did not include the direct impacts of the research findings, rather the impacts of the research activity. All stages of the review were performed by a minimum of two reviewers and reported impacts were categorised qualitatively according to a modified VICTOR (making Visible the ImpaCT Of Research) framework. RESULTS Of the initial 2704 identified articles, 20 were eligible for inclusion. Identified impacts were mapped to seven themes: impacts for patients; impacts for the service provision and workforce; impacts to research profile, culture and capacity; economic impacts; impacts on staff recruitment and retention; impacts to knowledge exchange; and impacts to the clinical academic. CONCLUSIONS Several overlapping sub-themes were identified across the main themes. These included the challenges and benefits of balancing clinical and academic roles, the creation and implementation of new evidence, and the development of collaborations and networks. These may be key areas for organisations to explore when looking to support and increase academic activity among healthcare professionals outside medicine. The modified VICTOR tool is a useful starting point for individuals and organisations to record the impact of their research activity. Further work is needed to explore standardised methods of capturing research impact that address the full range of impacts identified in this systematic review and are specific to the context of clinical academics outside medicine.","output":"A qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis exploring the impacts of clinical academic activity by healthcare professionals outside medicine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the identification of the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global number of confirmed cases as of March 15, 2020, is 156,400, with total death in 5,833 (3.7%) worldwide.

A cohort study and longitudinal exploratory analysis were performed. Forty undergraduate first-year dental students, from the University of Coimbra in Portugal, were selected as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two different teaching methods were applied during an identical time-period: face-to-face lectures complemented by physical models (T1 cohort) and webinar lectures complemented by CBCT images (T2 cohort). Learning outcomes were then studied according to theoretical and spatial orientation contexts. A self-reported survey that focused on students' satisfaction, stress, and support was studied. Both teaching methods were analyzed with paired sample student's t-test and Pearson Correlation Confidence intervals 95% with P < 0.05. Furthermore, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used for self-reported satisfaction survey validity and reliability analysis.

Logistic regression was employed to identify characteristics associated with close adherence to preventive behavior practices in 2020. RESULTS: About 70.2% of participants adhered closely to recommended preventive behavior practices. Compared with 2003SARS/2009pdmH1N1, there was a significant increase in the use of facemasks during pdmCOVID-19 (66.6% vs. 99.2% [indoors], p < 0.001) and the use of on-person alcohol-based hand sanitizer (AHS) (44.2% vs. 65.4%, p < 0.001) or 98.4% (hand sanitation at entry of buildings, p < 0.001) during the pdmCOVID-19.

Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among the Libyan population between July 18 and August 23, 2020. The data collected included basic demographic characteristics, level of education, employment status, COVID-19-related questions, and questions about abuse and domestic violence. This study assessed the psychological status of participants who were screened for anxiety symptoms using the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Depressive symptoms were also screened for using the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Binomial logistic regression was used to predict the probability of insomnia, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results: A total of 10,296 responses were recorded. Among the participants, 4,756 (46.2%) obtained a cut-off score of  3 which indicated depressive symptoms. For anxiety, 1,952 participants (19%) obtained a cut-off score of  15, which indicated anxiety symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the expansion and results of using a telehealth program to increase access to care while minimizing additional potential exposures during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Screening algorithms for patients with SARS-CoV-2Crelated complaints were created, and 150 new clinicians were trained within 72 hours to address increased patient demand. Simultaneously, Jefferson Health created mobile testing sites throughout eastern Pennsylvania and the southern New Jersey region. Visit volume, the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests ordered, and the number of positive tests were evaluated, and the volume was compared with preceding time periods. RESULTS: From March 8, 2020, to April 11, 2020, 4663 patients were screened using telehealth, representing a surge in visit volume. There were 1521 patients sent to mobile testing sites, and they received a telephone call from a centralized call center for results. Of the patients who were tested, nearly 20% (n=301) had a positive result.

The Urban Modeling Interface tool is applied to simulate the energy performance of the building mix. The boundary conditions and input parameters are set up according to the Swedish building standards and statistics. The district is at early-design stage, which includes a mix of building functions, i.e. residential buildings, offices, schools and retail shops. By comparing with the base case (normal life without confinement measures), the average delivered electricity demand of the entire district increases in a range of 14.3% to 18.7% under the three confinement scenarios. However, the mean system energy demands (sum of heating, cooling, and domestic hot water) decreases in a range of 7.1% to 12.0%. These two variation nearly cancel each other out, leaving the total energy demand almost unaffected. The result also shows that the delivered electricity demands in all cases have a relatively smooth variation across a year, while the system energy demands follow the principle trends for all the cases, which have peak demands in winter and much lower demands in transit seasons and summer.

A comparative analysis of patients attending ADOC during a similar period in 2019 is undertaken.Methods:Patients who attended the ADOC with suspected DVT during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between 01 February and 30 June 2020 at Southport and Ormskirk NHS Trust were studied and compared to a similar period in 2019. Patients characteristics, comorbidities, risk factors, incidence of DVT and relationship with COVID-19 with the evaluation of haematological parameters including D-dimer and two- tier Wells score. Additionally we examined patients outcomes including morbidity, mortality and hospital admissions.Results:Overall, there was a decrease in the number of patients attending the ADOC from 290 in 2019 to 233 in 2020. However, a total of 38 patients tested positive for DVT, a rate of 16.3%, which is compared to an incidence of 7.9% in 2019. Due to evolving protocols, the COVID-19 status of all patients attending the ADOC could not be ascertained. However, 5/233 of the 2020 cohort patients either had a positive test result (n=4) or were symptomatic of COVID-19 (n=1).Conclusion:There has been a 129% increase in the incidence of DVT in patients presenting to ADOC at our trust during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, despite fewer patients presenting with DVT symptoms to the ADOC, there appears to be a higher incidence of confirmed DVTs in ambulatory patients during COVID-19.Although there is a strong association inferred between COVID-19 and VTE [3], lack of access to SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab testing of patients attending ADOC for VTE assessment was a limiting factor to establish an association in this study. Because of this, we cannot extrapolate a definite association in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness in the community and DVT.What we postulate is perhaps the higher incidence in the 2020 cohort could be a marker for a mild case of asymptomatic COVID-19 in these patients. Currently there is no guidance as to whether point of care testing should be available in ADOC. We wonder whether a point of care COVID-19 testing of these patients would have positive impact on the rate at which COVID-19 is identified in the community. Furthermore patients have been avoiding hospitals during the pandemic, greater testing should help to reassure and encourage them to seek help earlier during their illness, minimising potential complications such as PE, hospital admission and death.References:[1]Malas MB, Naazie IN, Elsayed N et al.

We reviewed medical records at a large, urban tertiary care and trauma center in Atlanta, Georgia with the goal of identifying trends in e-scooter injury and the effects of Atlantas nighttime ban on e-scooter rentals on injuries treated in the emergency department (ED). Records from all ED visits occurring between June 2018 through August 2020 were reviewed. To account for ambiguity in medical records, confidence levels of either certain or possible were assigned using a set of predefined criteria to categorize patient injuries as being associated with an e-scooter. A total of 380 patients categorized as having certain e-scooter related injuries were identified. The average age of these patients was 31 years old, 65% were male, 41% had head injuries, 20% of injuries were associated with the built environment, and approximately 20% were admitted to the hospital. Approximately 19% of patients with injuries associated with e-scooters noted to be clinically intoxicated or have a serum ethanol level exceeding 80 mg/dL. The implementation of a nighttime rental ban on e-scooter rentals reduced the proportion of patients with e-scooter injuries with times of arrival during the hours of the ban from 32% to 22%, however this effect was not significant (p = 0.16).

Very recently its genomic RNA of a30 kb was decoded to be packaged with nucleocapsid (N) protein into phase separated condensates. Interestingly, viruses have no ability to generate ATP but host cells have very high ATP concentrations of 2-12 mM. A key question thus arises whether ATP modulates liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the N protein. Here we discovered that ATP not only biphasically modulates LLPS of the viral N protein as we previously found on human FUS and TDP-43, but also dissolves the droplets induced by oligonucleic acid. Residue-specific NMR characterization showed ATP specifically binds the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of the N protein with the average Kd of 3.3  0.4 mM. The ATP-RBD complex structure was constructed by NMR-derived constraints, in which ATP occupies a pocket within the positive-charged surface utilized for binding nucleic acids. Our study suggests that ATP appears to be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to promote its life cycle by facilitating the uncoating, localizing and packing of its genomic RNA. Therefore the interactions of ATP with the viral RNA and N protein might represent promising targets for design of drugs and vaccines to terminate the pandemic.","output":"ATP biphasically modulates LLPS of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and specifically binds its RNA-binding domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most important core competencies for medical learners to master are reviewing history, performing physical examination, communication skills and clinical reasoning.

However, there are a series of events and factors that create barriers to vaccination. In this paper, we explore vaccination narratives and challenges experienced and observed by Filipinos during the early vaccination period in the Philippines. Material and methodsWe conducted 35 interviews from a subsample of 1,599 survey respondents ages 18 and older in the Philippines. The interviews were conducted in Filipino, Cebuano, and/or English via online platforms such as Zoom or via phone call. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated, and analysed using inductive content analysis. To highlight the complex reasons for delaying and/or refusing COVID-19 vaccines, we embedded our findings within the social ecological model. ResultsOur analysis showed that individual perceptions play a major role on the decision to vaccinate. Such perceptions are shaped by exposure to (mis)information amplified by the media, the community, and the health system. Social networks may either positively or negatively impact vaccination uptake, depending on their views on vaccines. Political issues contribute to vaccine brand hesitancy, resulting to vaccination delays and refusals. Perceived inefficiencies and inflexibility of the system also create additional barriers to the vaccine rollout in the country, especially among vulnerable and marginalised groups. ConclusionsChallenges to COVID-19 vaccination may be individual, interpersonal, and structural, which work individually and collectively. Among these barriers, our results suggest that many concerns regarding vaccination operate at the individual level. Vaccine brand hesitancy and misinformation are growing public health challenges in the country that need to be addressed. Recognising and addressing concerns at all levels are critical to solutions aimed at improving COVID-19 vaccination uptake and reach.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine brand hesitancy and other challenges to vaccination in the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The lockdown and social distancing caused by COVID-19 may influence common healthy behaviour. Due to the unprecedent worldwide confinement in which Spain has been one of the most affected with severe rules governing confinement, physical activity and sedentarism may change due to prolonged stays at home. The aim of this study is to evaluate how physical activity and sedentary time have changed during confinement in the Spanish population. Methods 3800 healthy adults (age  18 - 64 years) residing in Spain were asked during confinement. Sociodemographic data and self-reported physical activity data were collected twice by an International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short (IPAQ-S) between 23rd March and 1st April, and the analysis was carried out considering the achievement of general physical activity recommendations, different age ranges and baseline physical activity levels. Results Physical activity decreased significantly during confinement in all population. Vigorous activities and walking time decreased by 16.8% (p-value > 0.001) and 58.2% (p-value > 0.001) respectively, whereas sedentary time increased by 23.8% (p-value > 0.001). The fulfilment of 75 min/week of vigorous activity recommendation decreased by 10.7% (p-value < 0.001) while the amount of people who reached to 150 min/week of moderate activity barely changed (1.4%, (p-value 0.117)). The group that performed more vigorous physical activities before confinement showed the greatest decrease (30.5%, p-value > 0.001). Men reduced more the time in vigorous activity than women (21% vs 9%, respectively) who even increased time in moderate physical activity by 11% (p-value < 0.05) and showed less increase in sitting time than men (35% vs 25.3%, respectively).

We describe the symptoms and signs of the first 2,184 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at COVID-19 treatment centers in Lagos State. We also assessed the relationship between patients' presenting symptoms, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 deaths. METHODS: Medical records of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were extracted and analyzed for their symptoms, symptom severity, presence of comorbidities and outcome. RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged from 4 days to 98 years with a mean of 43.0(16.0) years. Of the patients who presented with symptoms, cough (19.3%) was the most common presenting symptom. This was followed by fever (13.7%) and difficulty in breathing, (10.9%). The most significant clinical predictor of death was the severity of symptoms and signs at presentation. Difficulty in breathing was the most significant symptom predictor of COVID-19 death (OR:19.26 95% CI 10.95-33.88). The case fatality rate was 4.3%. CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians and COVID-19 frontline workers should maintain a high index of suspicion and prioritize the care of patients presenting with these symptoms.

Anatomical variations, such as absent or surgically clamped vessels, can result in undesirable flow patterns. These can affect the brain's ability to maintain cerebral perfusion and the formation of cerebral aneurysms. An experimental test system was developed to simulate cerebral physiological conditions through three flexible 3D patient-specific models of complete and incomplete CoW geometries. Flow visualizations were performed with isobaric dyes and the mapped dye streamlines were tracked throughout the models. Three to seven flow impact locations were observed for all configurations, corresponding to known sites for aneurysmal formation. Uni and bi-directional cross-flows occurred along the communicating arteries. The greatest shunting of flow occurred for a missing pre-communicating anterior (A1) and posterior (P1) cerebral arteries. The anterior cerebral arteries had the greatest reduction (15-37%) in efferent flow rates for missing either a unilateral A1 or bilateral P1 segments. The bi-directional cross-flows, with multiple afferent flow mixing, observed along the communicating arteries may explain the propensity of aneurysm formation at these sites.

We also discuss whether the development of an inhalable powder vaccine formulation against SARS-CoV-2 could be feasible. The review was conducted using relevant studies from PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar.Expert opinion: We believe that the scope of vaccine research should be broadened toward inhalable dry powder formulations since dry vaccines bear several advantages. Firstly, their dry state can tremendously increase vaccine stability and shelf-life. Secondly, they can be inhaled using disposable inhalers, omitting the need for trained health-care personnel and, therefore, facilitating mass-vaccination campaigns. Thirdly, inhalable vaccines may provide improved protection since they can induce an IgA-mediated mucosal immune response.","output":"Inhaled vaccine delivery in the combat against respiratory

that control the spread of the virus in the absence of effective medical therapy or a reliable vaccine. There is a general consensus that the most efficient health protocol in the actual state is to disrupt the infection chain through social distancing, although economic interests stand against closing non-essential activities and poses a debatable tradeoff. In this study, we used an individual-based age-structured network model to assess the effective roles of different healthcare protocols such as the use of personal protection equipment and social distancing at neighbor- and city-level scales. Using as much as empirical data available in the literature, we calibrated a city model and simulated low, medium, and high parameters representing these protocols. Our results revealed that the model was more sensitive to changes in the parameter representing the rate of contact among people from different neighborhoods, which defends the social distancing at the city-level as the most effective protocol for the control of the disease outbreak. Another important identified parameter represented the use of individual equipment such as masks, face shields, and hand sanitizers like alcohol-based solutions and antiseptic products. Interestingly, our simulations suggest that some periodical activities such as going to the supermarket, gas station, and pharmacy would have little contribution to the SARS-CoV-2 spread once performed within the same neighborhood. As we can see nowadays, there is an inevitable context-dependency and economic pressure on the level of social distancing recommendations, and we reinforce that every decision must be a welfare-oriented science-based decision.","output":"Assessing the relative contributions of healthcare protocols for epidemic control: an example with network transmission model for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is impacting on the entire planet, field notes from resource-limited settings are increasingly relevant, both instrumentally and normatively, due to codependency of world populations in the struggle against the pandemic.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) until 30 April 2020. All the ILI episodes, laboratory tests, complications, hospitalizations and pneumonitis were recorded. Therefore, the study prospectively recorded all the COVID-19 ILI events. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were included in this non-prespecified COVID-19 analysis, if alive on 31 January 2020, when the Italian government declared the national emergency. The prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 cases was detected as ILI episode with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Cases with clinical-radiological diagnosis of COVID-19 (COVID-like ILIs), were also reported. RESULTS: Out of 1257 enrolled patients, 955 matched the inclusion criteria for this unplanned analysis. From 31 January to 30 April 2020, 66 patients had ILI: 9 of 955 cases were confirmed COVID-19 ILIs, with prevalence of 0.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.3C2.4], a hospitalization rate of 100% and a mortality rate of 77.8%. Including 5 COVID-like ILIs, the overall COVID-19 prevalence was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.5C3.1), with 100% hospitalization and 64% mortality. The presence of elderly, males and comorbidities was significantly higher among patients vaccinated against influenza versus unvaccinated (p = 0.009, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). Overall COVID-19 prevalence was 1.2% for vaccinated (six of 482 cases, all confirmed) and 1.7% for unvaccinated (8 of 473, 3 confirmed COVID-19 and 5 COVID-like), p = 0.52. The difference remained non-significant, considering confirmed COVID-19 only (p = 0.33). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has a meaningful clinical impact on the cancer-patient population receiving ICIs, with high prevalence, hospitalization and an alarming mortality rate among symptomatic cases.

The objective was to measure and characterize risk factors for trauma and anxiety-related mental health problems among HCWs at a public hospital in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC). This study reports findings from a cross-sectional survey of NYC HCWs shortly after the initial 2020 infection surge. Over 800 hospital employees completed the survey that assessed professional quality of life indicators (compassion satisfaction [CS], burnout [BO], secondary traumatic stress [STS]), Coronavirus Anxiety (CS), Obsession with Coronavirus (OC), and PTSD symptoms. The survey also assessed pandemic-related work and life circumstances such as do you have a family member or friend who tested positive for COVID. Relatively small percentages of HCWs endorsed probable Coronavirus Anxiety (6%), PTSD (13%), and Coronavirus Obsession (21%). We observed higher proportions of Burnout (29%), Moderate or High Secondary Traumatic Stress (45%), and High Compassion Satisfaction (52%). Adjusted regression models showed important implications for prior behavioral/emotional health concerns among HCWs, providing care for a patient that died from COVID-19, and other characteristics. This study supports prior studies documenting the mental health consequences for the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study builds on that base by including non-clinical staff in the sample and assessing pandemic life-stressors such as caring for sick family members.","output":"Healthcare worker trauma and related mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study estimates the risk of aerosol infection by SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments where high density of occupation results in an increased probability of infection, such as schools, offices, supermarkets, restaurants and gyms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In each type of building use, several conditions were simulated, such as the use and effectiveness of masks, ventilation, use of equipment that allows air asepsis using HEPA filters, the density of occupancy and the length of stay in the spaces, using a model based on the dispersion of aerosol particles in indoor spaces and on the accumulation and inhalation of these particles over time. RESULTS: The results showed that the replacement of social masks by masks with FFP2 classification decreased the risk of infection by 90% in schools. In schools with natural ventilation, the complete opening of windows reduced the risk of infection by 64% in comparison with the scenario with closed windows. In spaces where mechanical ventilation is normally used, the probability of infection decreased significantly when the regulatory fresh air flow rates were doubled (reduction of 32% in offices, 42% in restaurants, 24% in supermarkets and 46% in gyms). The filtration of air with HEPA filters allowed the reduction of the probability of infection by 72% in schools, offices, and restaurants and 61% in gyms. The length of stay in the spaces was also a relevant factor in the variation of the probability of infection, especially in schools where it was found that shorter classes with a higher number of intervals reduced the risk of infection. DISCUSSION: The results show the importance of adequate ventilation in indoor environments, especially in places where the density of occupation and the staying times are longer, making the introduction of outside air inside the spaces essential, either through natural or mechanical means. It is expected that the infection risk estimates presented are undervalued because the model only considers transmission by particles smaller than 10 m and does not include the short-range transmission by assuming social distancing. Vaccination was not considered in the model since it was not yet available when the study was carried out. CONCLUSION: The present study contributes to the identification of measures that decrease the risk of viral transmission, and consequently provide greater security in indoor spaces.","output":"[Modelling the Contribution of Factors Influencing the Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Indoor Environments]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Moderate sedation is routinely performed in patients undergoing minor therapeutic and diagnostic procedures outside the operating room. The level of sedation is often monitored by sedation nurses using clinical criteria, such as sedation scores. The Bispectral Index (BIS) is derived from changes in the electroencephalograph profile that may provide an objective measure of the level of sedation. In this prospective observational study, we investigated whether using BIS values to guide sedative drug administration influences the level of sedation and the incidence of adverse events compared with using Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) only in nurse-administered moderate sedation. We hypothesized that both depth of sedation and the incidence of adverse events related to oversedation would decrease when sedation nurses used BIS values to help guide sedative drug administration. METHODS Sedation care was provided by trained sedation nurses under the supervision of a physician performing the procedure. The sedation regimen was initiated with IV midazolam 1 to 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg or hydromorphone 0.2 mg. Additional small boluses of midazolam, fentanyl, or hydromorphone were administered to maintain an RSS of 2 to 3 (cooperative, oriented, and responding to verbal command). Propofol was not used. Information including patient demographics, type of procedure, medication administered, RSS, and rates of adverse events was recorded by the sedation nurses for each patient on a computer-readable form. The study was divided into 3 phases. In phase 1 (baseline, 6 months' duration), baseline data on sedation practice were prospectively collected. There was no change from standard of care for all patients except that each patient had a BIS sensor attached, but the monitor was covered and nurses were blinded to the BIS values. In phase 2 (training, 3 months), the sedation nurses received comprehensive education on the use of BIS to guide sedative drug administration, pharmacology of commonly used drugs, and methods for rescue from oversedation. The recommended BIS range for moderate sedation was 75 to 90. Adequate training of all sedation nurses on the use of BIS was documented. In phase 3 (implementation, 6 months), the BIS values were used to guide drug administration. RESULTS Data were available on 1766 patients (999 and 767 patients in phases 1 and 3, respectively). Most of the procedures were colonoscopies, upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, examinations under anesthesia, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and central venous access catheter placements. No differences in the demographics between the 2 groups were observed. The RSS was inversely associated with the BIS value, r = -0.16 (95% confidence interval, -0.19 to -0.12; P < 0.00001). An RSS of 2 to 3 was maintained in 94% of patients in phase 1 and 96% of patients in phase 3 The mean (SD) BIS values were 80.9  6.8 in phase 1 and 80.4  6.5 in phase 3. The number of sedation-related adverse events was lower in our sample when BIS was used, with an odds ratio of 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.62; P < 0.0001), and patients with restlessness had a lower BIS value than those without this symptom (P < 0.0001). No serious adverse events or deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS Nurse-administered moderate sedation using midazolam and fentanyl was usually associated with appropriate levels of sedation as assessed by both the RSS and BIS with an overall low incidence of adverse events. The use of BIS did not change the mean level of sedation significantly, although the number of sedation-related adverse events appears to be lower when BIS was used.","output":"A prospective evaluation of the incidence of adverse events in nurse-administered moderate sedation guided by sedation scores or Bispectral Index."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early analyses revealed that dark web marketplaces (DWMs) started offering COVID-19 related products (e.g., masks and COVID-19 tests) as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic started, when these goods were in shortage in the traditional economy.

The study tested gender differences in the association between different dimensions of social capital and self-reported sleep duration of Chinese rural older adults. DESIGN: The data of rural older adults were extracted from a national cross-sectional survey of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) and analyzed in this study. SETTING: CLHLS covered 23 provinces in China. PARTICIPANTS: The 6552 rural respondents aged 65 years old were involved. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Generalized trust, informal social participation, formal social participation and social support were used to assess social capital. Self-reported sleep duration was measured as health outcome. RESULTS: Low level of generalized trust had harmful effect on insufficient sleep (AOR 1.110, 95% CI 1.018-1.324), and having no formal or informal social participation was significantly positively associated with long sleep (AOR(formal) 1.424, 95% CI 1.007-2.013; AOR(informal) 1.241, 95% CI 1.016-1.516).

All patients scored positive for the hemophagocytosis score (HScore) and were diagnosed with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH) characterized by pancytopenia, hyper-coagulation, acute kidney injury, and hepatobiliary dysfunction. At the end of treatment, ICU patients had less need for vasopressors, significantly improved respiratory function, and lower HScore. Although three patients died, the mortality was lower than historical series of patients with sHLH in sepsis.

Inadequate knowledge about perinatal depression and treatment options may contribute to the low help-seeking rates exhibited by perinatal people. The Internet can be an accessible source of information about perinatal depression; however, the quality of this information remains to be evaluated. The purpose of this study was to assess the quality of perinatal depression information websites. METHODS: After review, 37 websites were included in our sample. To assess overall website quality, we rated websites based on their reading level (Simple Measure of Gobbledegook; SMOG), information quality (DISCERN), usability (Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool; PEMAT), and visual design (Visual Aesthetics of Website Inventory; VisAWI). RESULTS: Websites often exceeded the National Institute of Health's recommended reading level of grades 6C8, with scores ranging from 6.8 to 13.5. Website information quality ratings ranged from 1.8 to 4.3 out of 5, with websites often containing insufficient information about treatment choices. Website usability ratings were negatively impacted by the lack of information summaries, visual aids, and tangible tools. Visual design ratings ranged from 3.2 to 6.6 out of 7, with a need for more creative design elements to enhance user engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This study outlines the characteristics of high-quality perinatal depression information websites. Our findings illustrate that perinatal depression websites are not meeting the needs of users in terms of reading level, information quality, usability, and visual design.

Recent studies have shown that the detection rate of liver lesions is significantly higher in gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI) than in contrast-enhanced portal-phase computed tomography (CT); however, the latter remains essential because of its high specificity, good performance in estimating liver volumes and better vessel visibility. To characterize liver lesions using both the above image modalities, we propose a multimodal nonrigid registration framework using organ-focused mutual information (OF-MI). This proposal tries to improve mutual information (MI) based registration by adding spatial information, benefiting from the availability of expert liver segmentation in clinical protocols. The incorporation of an additional information channel containing liver segmentation information was studied. A dataset of real clinical images and simulated images was used in the validation process. A Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI simulation framework is presented.

In its natural habitat, S. hexandrum is exposed to a multitude of adversities, such as fluctuating temperatures, water deficit, and high UV radiations. Transcriptional regulation of genes, which is regulated by the condition-specific binding of transcriptional factors to precise motifs in the promoter region, underlines responses to an environmental cue. Therefore, analysis of promoter sequences could ascertain the spatio-temporal expression of genes and overall stress responses. Unavailability of genomic information does not permit such analysis in S. hexandrum, especially on regulation of PTOX pathway. Accordingly, this study describes isolation and in silico analysis of 5'-upstream regions of ShPLR (PINORESINOL-LARICIRESINOL REDUCTASE) and ShSLD (SECOISOLARICIRESINOL DEHYDROGENASE), the two key genes of the PTOX biosynthetic pathway. Data showed a range of motifs related to basal transcription, stress-responsive elements, such as those for drought, low temperature, and light, suggesting that the expression of these genes and resulting PTOX accumulation would be affected by, at least, these environmental cues. While the impact of temperature and light on PTOX accumulation is well studied, the effect of water deficit on the physiology of S. hexandrum and PTOX accumulation remains obscure. Given the presence of drought-responsive elements in the promoters of the key genes, the impact of water deficit on growth and development and PTOX accumulation was studied. The results showed decline in relative water content and net photosynthetic rate, and increase in relative electrolyte leakage with stress progression. Plants under stress exhibited a reduction in transpiration rate and chlorophyll content, with a gradual increase in osmoprotectant content. Besides, stressed plants showed an increase in the expression of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway and PTOX biosynthesis, and an increase in PTOX accumulation. Upon re-watering, non-irrigated plants showed a significant improvement in biochemical and physiological parameters. Summarily, our results demonstrated the importance of osmoprotectants during water deficit and the revival capacity of the species from water deficit, wherein PTOX synthesis was also modulated.

Here, we investigate both in concert, by imaging ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in primary visual cortex (V1) across different cortical depths. We ensured that putative ODC patterns in V1 (a) are stable across runs, sessions, and scanners located in different continents, (b) have a width (a1.3 mm) expected from post-mortem and animal work and (c) are absent at the retinotopic location of the blind spot. We then dissociated the effects of bottom-up thalamo-cortical input and attentional feedback processes on activity in V1 across cortical depth. Importantly, the separation of bottom-up information flows into ODCs allowed us to validly compare attentional conditions while keeping the stimulus identical throughout the experiment. We find that, when correcting for draining vein effects and using both model-based and model-free approaches, the effect of monocular stimulation is largest at deep and middle cortical depths. Conversely, spatial attention influences BOLD activity exclusively near the pial surface. Our findings show that simultaneous interrogation of columnar and laminar dimensions of the cortical fold can dissociate thalamocortical inputs from top-down processing, and allow the investigation of their interactions without any stimulus manipulation.","output":"Ultra-high field fMRI reveals origins of feedforward and feedback activity within laminae of human ocular dominance columns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The temperature control process of electric heating furnace (EHF) systems is a quite difficult and changeable task owing to non-linearity, time delay, time-varying parameters, and the harsh environment of the furnace. In this paper, a robust temperature control scheme for an EHF system is developed using an adaptive active disturbance rejection control (AADRC) technique with a continuous sliding-mode based component. First, a comprehensive dynamic model is established by using convection laws, in which the EHF systems can be characterized as an uncertain second order system. Second, an adaptive extended state observer (AESO) is utilized to estimate the states of the EHF system and total disturbances, in which the observer gains are updated online by a non-linear observer bandwidth, that is as a function of the observation errors. Moreover, with the help of disturbance estimation, a novel sliding manifold is constructed with parameters adaptively adjusted by a dynamic nonlinear bandwidth function to reduce the impact of high gain problems, especially noise-sensitivity. A continuous sliding-mode (CSM) based component is also designed to handle disturbance estimation errors. Third, the stability of the closed loop system, including the proposed controller and estimator, is mathematically proved using the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the comparative simulation results show that the proposed method has superior robustness and temperature tracking performance.","output":"Robust adaptive active disturbance rejection control of an electric furnace using additional continuous sliding mode component"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To curb the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), confinement measures were undertaken, which altered the pattern of energy consumption and India?s anthropogenic CO2 emissions during the effective lockdowns periods (January to June 2020) Such changes are being analyzed using data of energy generated from coal and renewable sources and fossil-based daily CO2 emissions Results revealed that coal-fired (fossil-based) energy generation fell by ?13% in March, ?29% in April, and ?20% in May, and ?16 6% in mid-June 2020 as compared with the same period in 2018?2019 Conversely, the renewable energy generation increased by 19% in March, 12% in April, 17% in May, and 7% in June 2020 The share of fossil-based energy fell by ?6 55% in 2020 compared with mean levels, which was further offset by increases of renewable energy India?s daily fossil-based CO2 emissions fell by ?11 6% (?5 to ?25 7%) by mid-June 2020 compared with mean levels of 2017?2019 with total change in fossil-based CO2 emission by ?139 (?62 to ?230) MtCO2, with the largest reduction in the industry (?41%), transport (?28 5%), and power (?21%) followed by the public (?5 4%), and aviation (?4%) sectors If some levels of lockdown persist until December 2020, both energy consumption and CO2 emissions patterns would be below the 2019 level The nationwide lockdown has led to a reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emissions and, subsequently, improved air quality and global environment and has also helped in reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations at the local level but not on the global level With suitable government policies, switching to a cleaner mode of energy generation other than fossil fuels could be a viable option to minimize CO2 emissions under increasing demand for energy","output":"A short-term decline in anthropogenic emission of CO2 in India due to COVID-19 confinement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of data on how race affects the clinical presentation and short-term outcome among hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2, the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19). METHODS: Hospitalized patients  18 years, testing positive for COVID-19 from March 13, 2020 to May 13, 2020 in a United States (U.S.) integrated healthcare system with multiple facilities in two states were evaluated. We documented racial differences in clinical presentation, disposition, and in-hospital outcomes for hospitalized patients with COIVD-19. Multivariable regression analysis was utilized to evaluate independent predictors of outcomes by race. RESULTS: During the study period, 3678 patients tested positive for COVID-19, among which 866 were hospitalized (55.4% self-identified as Caucasian, 29.5% as Black, 3.3% as Hispanics, and 4.7% as other racial groups). Hospitalization rates were highest for Black patients (36.6%), followed by other (28.3%), Caucasian patients (24.4%), then Hispanic patients (10.7%) (p < 0.001). Caucasian patients were older, and with more comorbidities. Absolute lymphocyte count was lowest among Caucasian patients. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that compared to Caucasians, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality among Black patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26C1.09; p = 0.08) or other races (adjusted OR 1.62; 95% CI 0.80C3.27; p = 0.18). Black and Hispanic patients were admitted less frequently to the intensive care unit (ICU), and Black patients were less likely to require pressor support or hemodialysis (HD) compared with Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: This observational analysis of a large integrated healthcare system early in the pandemic revealed that patients with COVID-19 did exhibit some racial variations in clinical presentation, laboratory data, and requirements for advanced monitoring and cardiopulmonary support, but these nuances did not dramatically alter in-hospital outcomes.

In this study, we search for evidence of intra-individual recombination in the family cluster cases with co-circulation of genotype C, D and C/D recombinants. We studied 68 individuals from 15 families with HBV infections in 2006, identified individuals with mixed HBV genotype co-infections by restriction fragment length polymorphism and proceeded with cloning and DNA sequencing. Recombination signals were detected by RDP3 software and confirmed by split phylogenetic trees. Families with mixed HBV genotype co-infections were resampled in 2007. Three of 15 families had individuals with different HBV genotype co-infections in 2006. One individual (Y2) had a triple infection of HBV genotype C, D and C/D recombinant in 2006, but only genotype D in 2007. Further clonal analysis of this patient indicated that the C/D recombinant was not identical to previously isolated CD1 or CD2, but many novel recombinants with C2, D1 and CD1 were simultaneously found. All parental strains could recombine with each other to form new recombinant in this patient. This indicates that the detectable mixed infection and recombination have a limited time window.

This study determines correlations between program reputation and social media activity and popularity, specifically among otolaryngology residency programs. METHODS: Accredited programs, excluding military and osteopathic, in the United States were included. Activity and popularity on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were assessed during the same 7-month period from 2016 to 2020. Doximity Residency reputation scores (dividing programs into quartiles) and US News & World Report (comparing programs affiliated with top hospitals versus those with unranked hospitals) were utilized to compare differences based on reputation. RESULTS: Of 104 programs, 91 (88%) had social media accounts. Instagram and Twitter were more commonly used than Facebook, with 78 (75%), 49 (47%), and 42 (40%) accounts, respectively. The cumulative use of all three platforms grew yearly, while Twitter (R2 = 0.9863) and Instagram (R2 = 0.9955) presence increased exponentially. Doximity's top quartile programs had more Facebook (P = .020), Twitter (P < .001), and Instagram (P = .102) accounts. First-quartile programs also adopted each platform months before fourth-quartile programs. Stratified by US News & World Report, ranked programs had more social media accounts, with 24 (53%) on Facebook (P = .028), 32 (71%) on Twitter (P < .001), and 37 (82%) on Instagram (P = .155).

SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has become a dominant strain over the world and possesses higher infectivity due to mutations in its spike receptor-binding motif. CASE PRESENTATION: To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has increased potential for placenta infection and vertical transmission, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the placenta, umbilical cord, and fetal membrane from a case that unvaccinated mother and her neonate were COVID-19 positive. A 35-year-old primigravida with COVID-19 underwent an emergent cesarean delivery due to placental abruption in the setting of premature rupture of membranes. The neonate tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 hours, and then again on days of life 2, 6, 13, and 21. The placenta exhibited intervillositis, increased fibrin deposition, and syncytiotrophoblast necrosis. Sequencing of viral RNA from fixed placental tissue revealed SAR-CoV-2 B.1.167.2 (Delta) variant. Both spike protein and viral RNA were abundantly present in syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, umbilical cord vascular endothelium, and fetal membranes.

ADs complex pathobiology consists of extracellular -amyloid deposition and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau. Comprehensive mutational analyses can generate a wealth of knowledge about protein properties and enable crucial insights into molecular mechanisms of disease. Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) has enabled multiplexed measurement of mutational effects on protein properties, including kinematics and self-organization, with unprecedented resolution. However, potential bottlenecks of DMS characterization include experimental design, data quality, and the depth of mutational coverage. Here, we apply Deep Learning to comprehensively model the mutational effect of the AD-associated peptide A42 on aggregation-related biochemical traits from DMS measurements. Among tested neural network architectures, Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are found to be the most cost-effective models with robust high performance even under insufficiently-sampled DMS studies. While sequence features are essential for satisfactory prediction from neural networks, geometric-structural features further enhance the prediction performance. Notably, we demonstrate how mechanistic insights into phenotype may be extracted from the neural networks themselves suitably designed. This methodological benefit is particularly relevant for biochemical systems displaying a strong coupling between structure and phenotype such as the conformation of A42 aggregate and nucleation, as shown here using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) developed from the protein atomic structure input. In addition to accurate imputation of missing values (which here ranged up to 55% of all phenotype values at key residues), the mutationally-defined nucleation phenotype generated from a GCN shows improved resolution for identifying known disease-causing mutations relative to the original DMS phenotype. Our study suggests that neural network derived sequence-phenotype mapping can be exploited not only to provide direct support for protein engineering or genome editing but also to facilitate therapeutic design with the gained perspectives from biological modeling.","output":"Towards mechanistic models of mutational effects: Deep Learning on Alzheimers A peptide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the epidemiology of fluid balance (FB) over the first postnatal week and its impact on outcomes in a multi-center cohort of premature neonates from the AWAKEN study.

Outcome: Mechanical ventilation (MV) at postnatal day 7. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine (14.8%) were on MV at postnatal day 7. The median peak FB was 0% (IQR: ?2.9, 2) and occurred on postnatal day 2 (IQR: 1,5).

Though a number of studies were conducted to estimate the in-hospital mortality rate of stroke in Ethiopia, the lack of a nationwide study that determines the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke is an important research gap. Meta-analysis is key to improve the accuracy of estimates through the use of more data sets. Thus, this study was aimed to determine the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke in Ethiopia. METHODS: This study was conducted following the PRISMA checklist. We searched from Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases for studies. Each of the original studies was assessed using a tool for the risk of bias adapted for cross-sectional studies. Data were pooled and a random effect meta-analysis model was fitted to provide the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke. Also, the subgroup analyses were performed to examine how the in-hospital mortality rate varies across different groups of studies. RESULTS: In this study, the overall magnitude of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation among stroke patients were 47% (95%CI: 40-54), 8% (95CI%:6-12), and 10% (95%CI: 5-19), respectively.

Previous studies have suggested that gene expression levels of key cellular mediators of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are increased in response to cigarette exposure and decreased with glucocorticoids. We sought to determine whether the SARS-CoV-2 entry factor genes ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN had changed expression levels according to publicly available cigarette-, e-cigarette- and glucocorticoid-related transcriptomic datasets of various human cell types. Methods: Thirty-eight transcriptomic datasets related to cigarette and e-cigarette smoking and glucocorticoid response were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), including 18 studies related to cigarette and e-cigarette smoking involving 7 airway cell types and 20 studies related to glucocorticoid response involving 11 cell types. RAVED (https://github.com/HimesGroup/raved) was used to analyze each dataset. For genes of interest, which included housekeeping (ATCB, RPL19), positive smoking controls (CYP1A1, CYP1B1) and positive glucocorticoid controls (FKBP5, TSC22D3), nominal p-values and transcriptomic-level false-discovery rate adjusted q-values were obtained. Results: When comparing cigarette smokers versus non-smokers, ACE2 expression levels were significantly increased in small airway epithelia (SAE) and TMPRSS2 expression levels were increased in trachea (q-value &lt;0.05) [Figure 1A]. None of the genes had consistent expression changes in other airway cell types (large airway epithelia (LAE), bronchial epithelia (BE), nasal epithelia (NE), alveolar macrophages, and buccal mucosa) derived from smokers or in in vitro models where cells were exposed to cigarette or e-cigarette smoke [Figure 1A]. Expression levels of FURIN were higher in macrophages and two airway smooth muscle (ASM) studies when exposed to glucocorticoids, but otherwise, ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN were generally unchanged with glucocorticoid exposure in vitro or in asthma patients treated with ICS versus placebo [Figure 1B]. Conclusion: Potential mechanisms linking cigarette smoking to worse COVID-19 outcomes or use of ICS to improved COVID-19 outcomes are unlikely to result from direct gene expression changes to SARS-CoV-2 viral entry genes.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Viral Entry-Related Gene Expression Changes in Response to Cigarette and Glucocorticoid Exposures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article introduces a thematic issue of Transcultural Psychiatry that presents recent work that deepens our understanding of the refugee experience-from the forces of displacement, through the trajectory of migration, to the challenges of resettlement.

Implementation strategies were developed for participating sites; all household members provided baseline epidemiological data and were followed for 14 days from case identification. Household contacts completed symptom diaries and had respiratory swabs taken at baseline, day 7 and day 14, and day 28 where applicable. We modelled the spread of COVID-19 within households using a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-type model, and calculated the household secondary attack rate and key epidemiological parameters. Findings: 96 households with 101 cases and 286 household contacts were recruited into the study between April-October 2020. Forty household contacts tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the study follow-up period. Our model estimated the household secondary attack rate to be 15% (95% CI 8-25%), which scaled up with increasing household size.

We describe a cost-effectiveness framework for evaluating acute treatments for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, considering a broad spectrum of potential treatment profiles and perspectives within the US healthcare system to ensure incorporation of the most relevant clinical parameters, given evidence currently available. METHODS: A lifetime model, with a short-term acute care decision tree followed by a post-discharge three-state Markov cohort model, was developed to estimate the impact of a potential treatment relative to best supportive care (BSC) for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The model included information on costs and resources across inpatient levels of care, use of mechanical ventilation, post-discharge morbidity from ventilation, and lifetime healthcare and societal costs. Published literature informed clinical and treatment inputs, healthcare resource use, unit costs, and utilities. The potential health impacts and cost-effectiveness outcomes were assessed from US health payer, societal, and fee-for-service (FFS) payment model perspectives. RESULTS: Viewing results in aggregate, treatments that conferred at least a mortality benefit were likely to be cost-effective, as all deterministic and sensitivity analyses results fell far below willingness-to-pay thresholds using both a US health payer and FFS payment perspective, with and without societal costs included. In the base case, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) ranged from $22,933 from a health payer perspective using bundled payments to $8028 from a societal perspective using a FFS payment model. Even with conservative assumptions on societal impact, inclusion of societal costs consistently produced ICERs 40C60% lower than ICERs for the payer perspective. CONCLUSION: Effective COVID-19 treatments for hospitalized patients may not only reduce disease burden but also represent good value for the health system and society. Though data limitations remain, this cost-effectiveness framework expands beyond current models to include societal costs and post-discharge ventilation morbidity effects of potential COVID-19 treatments.

A major barrier to improving child health in such regions is limited pediatric-specific training, particularly in the care of children with critical illness. While global health rotations for trainees from North America and Europe have become commonplace, residency and fellowship programs struggle to ensure that these rotations are mutually beneficial and do not place an undue burden on host countries. We created a bidirectional, multimodal educational program between trainees in Manila, Philippines, and Baltimore, Maryland, United States, to improve the longitudinal educational experience for all participants. Program Components: Based on stakeholder input and a needs assessment, we established a global health training program in which pediatricians from the Philippines traveled to the United States for observerships, and pediatric residents from a tertiary care center in Baltimore traveled to Manila. Additionally, we created and implemented a contextualized simulation-based shock curriculum for pediatric trainees in Manila that can be disseminated locally. This bidirectional program was adapted to include telemedicine and regularly scheduled virtual rounds and educational case conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers from the two institutions have collaborated on educational and clinical research projects, offering opportunities for resource sharing, bidirectional professional development, and institutional improvements. Conclusion: Although creating a mutually beneficial global health partnership requires careful planning and investment over time, establishment of a successful bidirectional educational and professional development program in a limited-resource setting is feasible and benefits learners in both countries.","output":"Evolution of a Bidirectional Pediatric Critical Care Educational Partnership in a Resource-Limited Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the molecular events accompanying virus replication is essential for the proper understanding and control of all virus diseases. The virus replication cycle generates new viral genomes and proteins in sufficient quantities to ensure propagation of the viral genome; this requires that the extracellular viral genome is protected from enzymatic degradation and can be introduced into further target cells for further rounds of replication. The initial recognition between virus and host is more complex than originally supposed and may involve more than one cellular receptor. A critical first intracellular step is the generation of viral mRNA by one of a limited number of strategies first described by David Baltimore. Lacking ribosomes, viruses have no means of producing protein and are reliant on the host cell for protein synthesis. Viral proteins are often modified by host cell glycosylation during or after virus assembly. Temporal regulation of intracellular events is critical in all but the very simplest of viruses, and some form of suppression of the host innate immune response is common to nearly all human viruses. Infected cells often produce non-infectious particles with incomplete genomes, and these defective interfering particles may play a role in pathogenesis. Understanding these processes will open up a range of targets for the development of novel therapies.","output":"Virus Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high number of COVID-19 deaths among health workers is caused by compliance with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

It is of importance to reveal if these patients develop an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and to define which antibodies confer virus neutralization. We conducted a comprehensive serological survey of 49 patients with a mild course of disease and quantified neutralizing antibody responses against a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate employing human cells as targets. Four patients (8%), even though symptomatic, did not develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and two other patients (4%) were only positive in one of the six serological assays employed. For the remainder, antibody response against the S-protein correlated with serum neutralization whereas antibodies against the nucleocapsid were poor predictors of virus neutralization. Regarding neutralization, only six patients (12%) could be classified as highly neutralizers. Furthermore, sera from several individuals with fairly high antibody levels had only poor neutralizing activity. In addition, employing a novel serological Western blot system to characterize antibody responses against seasonal coronaviruses, we found that antibodies against the seasonal coronavirus 229E might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Altogether, we show that there is a wide breadth of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in patients that differentially correlate with virus neutralization.

However, it remains unclear whether hospitalized COVID-19 patients who live in socially vulnerable neighborhoods are more likely to experience major adverse cardiovascular events and/or death. We evaluated the association between neighborhood social vulnerability and in-hospital outcomes in a national cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Hypothesis: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, residence in socially vulnerable neighborhoods is associated with worse in-hospital outcomes. Methods: The American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry includes patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across 107 hospitals in the US between January 14, 2020 to November 30, 2020. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a composite measure of community vulnerability developed by Center for Disease Control was used to classify the social vulnerability of patients' place of residence defined by zip codes. We fit multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the association between patient's SVI and in-hospital death or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, defined as composite of all-cause death, MI, stroke, new onset heart failure, or cardiogenic shock). Results: Among 20,925 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the registry, 6083 (29.1%) resided in the most vulnerable communities (highest national quartile of SVI). Compared with those in lowest quartile of SVI, patients in the highest quartile were younger (mean age 59.817.7 versus 62.017.9), more likely to be women (47.1% vs. 43.2%), Black patients (36.1% vs. 13.3%), and less likely to have private insurance (29.0% vs. 39.1%). After adjusting for demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), insurance status, and comorbidities, the highest quartile of SVI (compared to lowest) was associated with higher likelihood of in-hospital MACE (OR [95% CI] 1.28 [1.12, 1.46], p<0.001) as well as in-hospital death (OR 1.37 [1.21, 1.54], p<0.001).

PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases were searched for studies until April 22, 2020 (Prospero Registration-No.: CRD42020180043). We followed PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines for data extraction and synthesis and the NewcastleCOttawa Scale for assessing risk of bias of included studies. A random-effects model was implemented to pool effect sizes of included studies. The primary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders. All other psychological parameters, such as anger, were reported as secondary outcomes. Out of 6807 screened articles, 25 studies were included in our analyses. Compared to controls, individuals experiencing isolation or quarantine were at increased risk for adverse mental health outcomes, particularly after containment duration of 1 week or longer. Effect sizes were summarized for depressive disorders (odds ratio 2.795; 95% CI 1.467C5.324), anxiety disorders (odds ratio 2.0; 95% CI 0.883C4.527), and stress-related disorders (odds ratio 2.742; 95% CI 1.496C5.027). Among secondary outcomes, elevated levels of anger were reported most consistently. There is compelling evidence for adverse mental health effects of isolation and quarantine, in particular depression, anxiety, stress-related disorders, and anger.

Data on the epidemiology among patients on hemodialysis in Latin America and low and middle-income countries is limited. METHODS: Using electronic medical records from the second largest dialysis network in Guatemala, we performed a retrospective analysis of all adult patients on hemodialysis with the diagnosis of COVID-19 to estimate incidence of infection, and describe the demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. We stratified incidence rate by region. We reviewed data from May 1 to July 31, 2020, with outcome data ascertained up to August 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of 3201 patients undergoing hemodialysis, 325 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (incidence rate: 102 per 1,000 patients on hemodialysis, compared with 3 per 1,000 in the general population). Incidence was higher in the Central region (207 per 1,000) and lowest in the Southeast region with 33 per 1,000, and unlike in the general population, incidence was lower in Guatemalan city. Mean age of the COVID-19 diagnosed patients was 51.1 (SD 14.8) years, and 84 (25.8%) were female.

However, availability of these modern gadgets is a major concern in resource-deficient countries. A two-dimensional ultrasonography 2D USG is cheaper, provides real-time imaging, and is already established but underutilized instrument. Objective Here, we revisited the principles of 2D USG and used it for eloquent-area glioma surgery. Materials and Methods Fifty-eight patients with eloquent area gliomas were operated in last 2 years with the aid of 2D USG with 6-13 MHz curvilinear probe. Preoperative diagnosis was high-grade glioma in 38 and low-grade glioma (LGG) in 20 patients. Tumors were categorized as predominantly hyperechoic (27), uniformly hyperechoic (7), mixed echogenicity (21), and cystic (3). Results Intraoperatively, 2D USG could define the tumor margins in 46 cases. Of these, USG suggested gross total excision in 38 patients and subtotal in 8 patients. The findings matched with follow-up MRI in 34 patients who showed hyperechogenicity (predominant/uniform). Injecting saline with air in to the resection cavity and insinuating through adjacent brain parenchyma helped in detecting residual lesion in three cystic gliomas and in two LGG where the tumor cavity collapsed. Conclusion 2D USG is a helpful tool in eloquent area glioma surgery, especially in resource-limited countries.

SARS-CoV-2 is known to use its spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface as a first step in the infection process. As for other coronaviruses, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 next undergoes endocytosis, but whether or not this is required for infectivity, and the precise endocytic mechanism used are unknown. Using purified spike glycoprotein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein, a common model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, we now demonstrate that following engagement with the plasma membrane, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that transfer of viral RNA to the cell cytosol occurs from the lumen of the endosomal system. Importantly, we further demonstrate that knockdown of clathrin-heavy chain, which blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduces viral infectivity.

METHODS A three-round Delphi process was conducted with the first round derived from a systematic literature review and advisory board input, including patients who have been affected by HCV, physicians, pharmacists, and a patient group representative. Delphi panelists were HCV patients who had received treatment or were considering treatment. Panelists were asked about factors influencing their HCV treatment decisions. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses based on grounded theory was used. Agreement with each category and rankings based on order of importance from the patient perspective was reported. RESULTS Treatment effectiveness (100% agreement), longer life (88%), fear of complications (84%), financial issues (80%), quality of life (100%), and impact on society (80%) were considered important factors to patients in decisions to seek treatment. A fear of harming others (87%) was considered more important than physical symptoms (83%) in terms of patient-reported problems caused by HCV. Medication costs (91%) were identified as the most important costs of having HCV, followed by doctor costs (77%). CONCLUSIONS In addition to treatment effectiveness, patient experiences with financial problems, quality of life, and altruistic desires impact HCV patients' decisions. The risk of infecting others may motivate patients to seek treatment as much as personally experienced physical symptoms.","output":"What Matters Most for Treatment Decisions in Hepatitis C: Effectiveness, Costs, and Altruism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Declining humoral immunity in COVID-19 patients and the possibility of reinfection have raised concern. Mucosal immunity, particularly salivary antibodies, may be short-lived although long-term studies are lacking. METHODS: Using a multiplex bead-based array platform, we investigated antibodies specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins in 256 saliva samples from convalescent patients 1-9 months after symptomatic COVID-19 (n=74, Cohort 1), undiagnosed individuals with self-reported questionnaires (n=147, Cohort 2), and individuals sampled pre-pandemic time (n= 35, Cohort 3). RESULTS: Salivary IgG antibody responses in Cohort 1 (mainly mild COVID-19) were detectable up to nine months post-recovery, with high correlations between spike and nucleocapsid specificity. At nine months, IgG remained in both blood and saliva in majority of patients. Salivary IgA was rarely detected at this timepoint. In Cohort 2, salivary IgG and IgA responses were significantly associated with a recent history of COVID-19 like symptoms. Salivary IgG also tolerated temperature and detergent pre-treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA that appeared short-lived, the specific IgG in saliva appeared stable even after mild COVID-19 as noted for blood serology. This non-invasive saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antibody test with home self-collection may therefore serve as a complementary alternative to conventional blood serology.","output":"Persisting Salivary IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at 9 Months After Mild COVID-19: A Complementary Approach to Population Surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low-income middle-aged women (LMW) who are vulnerable have various physical and psychosocial problems.

We developed a smartwatch-based active assessment that enables unsupervised measurement of motor signs of PD. Participants with early-stage PD (N = 388, 64% men, average age 63) wore a smartwatch for a median of 390 days. Participants performed unsupervised motor tasks both in-clinic (once) and remotely (twice weekly for one year). Dropout rate was 5.4%. Median wear-time was 21.1 h/day, and 59% of per-protocol remote assessments were completed. Analytical validation was established for in-clinic measurements, which showed moderate-to-strong correlations with consensus MDS-UPDRS Part III ratings for rest tremor (? = 0.70), bradykinesia (? = ?0.62), and gait (? = ?0.46).

There is increasing commitment to screening for social needs within health care settings. However, little is known about current screening processes or the capacity for prenatal care clinics to address food insecurity among their patients. We aimed to assess barriers and facilitators prenatal care clinics face in addressing food insecurity among pregnant people and to identify opportunities to improve food security among this population. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among prenatal care clinics in New Hampshire and Vermont. Staff and clinicians engaged in food security screening and intervention processes at clinics affiliated with the Northern New England Perinatal Quality Improvement Network (NNEPQIN) were recruited to participate in key informant interviews. Thematic analysis was used to identify prominent themes in the interview data. RESULTS: Nine staff members or clinicians were enrolled and participated in key informant interviews. Key barriers to food security screening and interventions included lack of protocols and dedicated staff at the clinic as well as community factors such as availability of food distribution services and transportation. Facilitators of screening and intervention included a supportive culture at the clinic, trusting relationships between patients and clinicians, and availability of clinic-based and community resources. CONCLUSION: Prenatal care settings present an important opportunity to identify and address food insecurity among pregnant people, yet most practices lack specific protocols for screening. Our findings indicate that more systematic processes for screening and referrals, dedicated staff, and onsite food programs that address transportation and other access barriers could improve the capacity of prenatal care clinics to improve food security during pregnancy.

It is the need of the day that all the gaps and deficiencies, represented by variable response of adaptive immune system toward this infection, be filled and rectified. We have discussed reinfections with variable outcomes along with the possible reasons for variable response.

Accurate neutrophil recruitment is essential to combat microbes and to restore homeostasis, for inflammation modulation and resolution, wound healing and tissue repair. After fulfilling the appropriate effector functions, however, dampening neutrophil activation and infiltration is crucial to prevent damage to the host. In humans, chemoattractant molecules can be categorized into four biochemical families, i.e., chemotactic lipids, formyl peptides, complement anaphylatoxins and chemokines. They are critically involved in the tight regulation of neutrophil bone marrow storage and egress and in spatial and temporal neutrophil trafficking between organs. Chemoattractants function by activating dedicated heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In addition, emerging evidence suggests an important role for atypical chemoattractant receptors (ACKRs) that do not couple to G proteins in fine-tuning neutrophil migratory and functional responses. The expression levels of chemoattractant receptors are dependent on the level of neutrophil maturation and state of activation, with a pivotal modulatory role for the (inflammatory) environment.

The specific molecular profile of hobnail PTC (HPTC) is different from the classic, poorly differentiated and anaplastic variants and may contribute to its aggressive behavior. HPTC's genetic profile remains unclear. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 61-year-old woman presented to our endocrine clinic with generalized aches, bone pain, polyuria, and right neck swelling of a few months' duration. Laboratory findings revealed hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. Ultrasound of the neck showed 4.6 cm complex nodule within the right thyroid lobe. Sestamibi scan suggested parathyroid adenoma in the right thyroid lobe. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) revealed atypical follicular lesion of undetermined significance. She underwent right lobectomy, which normalized the intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone levels. Final pathology with immunohistochemical stains demonstrated HPTC and IPTA (2 cm each). Next-generation sequencing investigated the mutation spectrum of HPTC and detected BRAFV600E mutation. CONCLUSIONS A parathyroid adenoma should not exclude the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid evaluation is needed for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism to prevent missing concurrent thyroid cancers. Cytomorphologic features to distinguish thyroid from parathyroid cells on FNA cytology must be considered. Immunohistochemical stains are important. BRAFV600E is the most common mutation in HPTC.

Poor kidney transplant function in elderly recipients may be related to both pre-existing (i.e. donor-derived) kidney damage and increased susceptibility to nephrotoxicity of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) in kidneys from older donors. Hence, it is pivotal to shift the focus from prevention of rejection to preservation of graft function and prevention of over-immunosuppression in the elderly. The OPTIMIZE study will test the hypothesis that reduced CNI exposure in combination with everolimus will lead to better kidney transplant function, a reduced incidence of complications and improved health-related quality of life for kidney transplant recipients aged 65 years and older, compared to standard immunosuppression. METHODS: This open label, randomized, multicenter clinical trial will include 374 elderly kidney transplant recipients ( 65 years) and consists of two strata. Stratum A includes elderly recipients of a kidney from an elderly deceased donor and stratum B includes elderly recipients of a kidney from a living donor or from a deceased donor < 65 years. In each stratum, subjects will be randomized to a standard, tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen with mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids or an adapted immunosuppressive regimen with reduced CNI exposure in combination with everolimus and glucocorticoids. The primary endpoint is successful transplantation, defined as survival with a functioning graft and an eGFR  30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in stratum A and  45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in stratum B, after 2 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The OPTIMIZE study will help to determine the optimal immunosuppressive regimen after kidney transplantation for elderly patients and the cost-effectiveness of this regimen. It will also provide deeper insight into immunosenescence and both subjective and objective outcomes after kidney transplantation in elderly recipients.

Gain-of-function experiments using SIVcpzPtt Vif revealed that this barrier could be overcome by a single Vif acidic amino acid substitution (M16E). Moreover, degradation of gorilla APOBEC3F is induced by Vif through a mechanism that is distinct from that of human APOBEC3F.

First, on net, firms see the shock (thus far) largely as a demand rather than supply shock. A greater share of firms report significant or severe disruptions to sales activity than to supply chains. We compare these measures of disruption to their expected changes in selling prices and find that, even for firms that report supply chain disruptions, they expect to lower near-term selling prices on average. We also show that firms are engaging in wage cuts and expect to trim wages further before the end of 2020. These cuts stem from firms that have been disproportionally negatively impacted by the pandemic. Second, firms (like professional forecasters) have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by lowering their one-year-ahead inflation expectations. These responses stand in stark contrast to that of household inflation expectations (as measured by the University of Michigan or the New York Fed). Indeed, firms one-year-ahead inflation expectations fell precipitously (to a series low) following the onset of the pandemic, while household measures of inflation expectations jumped markedly.

Changes in health care delivery, such as visitor restrictions and limited availability of therapy services coupled with economic hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate these long-term consequences. Methods: Patients with respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support (endotracheal tube, noninvasive ventilation, or high-flow nasal cannula) and/or shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 were eligible for enrollment in this prospective observational study. We assessed quality of life (using short form-36 [SF-36]), work status, and independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) in survivors at hospital discharge and 6 months. Quality of life scores were compared to US population norms. An SF-36 score 50 is the population norm for both physical and mental scores;scores &lt;45 define significant physical or mental health impairment. Patients underwent assessment for ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) and functional impairment (using Functional Status Score for the ICU (FSS-ICU)) by physical and occupational therapists upon hospital discharge. An FSS-ICU score 28 is associated with discharge to home. Analysis of changes over time for the quality of life assessment were performed using paired t-test and tests of proportions. Results: 100 patients were enrolled from April to November 2020. On hospital discharge, 39% of patients had ICU-AW. The median FSS-ICU score on discharge was 24 [20-29], consistent with functional impairment. Fifty-six patients completed the 6-month evaluation with 74.7% follow-up (56/75 alive patients). Mental health impairment was reported by 33% of patients on hospital discharge and declined to 13% at 6 months (p=0.007). Physical health impairment was reported by 70% at discharge and persisted in 46% of patients at 6 months (p=0.007). Patients were independent in ADLs at both hospital admission and 6 months post discharge (90 vs 91%). Only 56% of patients who had been working prior to hospitalization had returned to work at 6 months. Conclusions: Impairments in quality of life and neuromuscular weakness were present at hospital discharge in a significant number of ICU survivors of COVID-19. Similar to the trajectory described in survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome, despite relatively normal mental health quality of life, persistent physical health impairment was noted in almost half of the survivors at 6 months.

Healthcare workers are at increased risk for infection, and specific requirements for their protection are advisable to ensure the functioning of the basic healthcare system, including the availability of general practitioners (GPs). Understanding the transmission risk is particularly important for guiding evidence-based protective measures in the primary healthcare setting. METHODS: Healthcare worker contacts of an initially undiagnosed COVID-19 case, who were without personal protective equipment, in particular not wearing facemasks, were screened with nasopharyngeal swabs and polymerase chain reaction tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), irrespective of respiratory symptoms or fever seven days after initial contact. The details of exposure to the index case were obtained during routine contact investigation after unintentional pathogen exposure. RESULTS: Twenty-one healthcare workers reported contacts with the index case. Three healthcare workers reported respiratory symptoms (cough) or low-grade fever within 4 days. None of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of symptom onset. All 21 healthcare workers tested SARS-CoV-2 negative 7 days after initial index case contact, including the three healthcare workers with previous symptoms. Ten of the 21 healthcare workers reported a cumulative exposure time of &gt;15 minutes. Longer cumulative contact times were associated with more individual contacts, reduced contact time per contact and activities with physical patient contact. The closest relative of the index patient tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 2 days after the index case presented at the hospital emergency department. CONCLUSION: We found a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a primary care setting. These findings are compatible with previous reports of the highest transmission probability in household settings with prolonged close contacts. The current protective measures for healthcare workers, including strict adherence to basic standard hygiene and facemasks, offer considerable protection during short periods of contact with symptomatic COVID-19 cases by diminishing the risk of direct and indirect transmission.","output":"Transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare workers -observational results of a primary care hospital contact tracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is a catastrophic health risk, with psychological, emotional, social, and relational implications.

Two modes of scavenging superoxide are seen for galangin: (1) superoxide radical extraction of H atom from the hydroxyl moieties located in position 3 and 5 of galangin, which are also associated with proton incorporation defining the SOD action; (2) - interaction among several superoxide radicals and the galangin polyphenol ring that evolve towards release of O(2) and H(2)O(2).

Herein, we compared five different assays in active healthcare personnel exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in a large center in Madrid, Spain, in a retrospective study. Median time lapse between polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) and serological testing was 11 days (7-21).

Over-expressing wild-type MEPE/OF45, but not the mutant MEPE/OF45 (depleted the key domain to interact with CHK1) increases CHK1 levels in the cells and increases the resistance of the cells to IR or CPT. MEPE/OF45, interacting with CHK1, increases CHK1 half-life and decreases CHK1 degradation through the ubiquitine-mediated pathway. In addition, the interaction of MEPE/OF45 with CHK1 decreases CHK1 levels in the ubiquitin E3 ligases (Cul1 and Cul4A) complex, which suggests that MEPE/OF45 competes with the ubiquitin E3 ligases binding to CHK1 and thus decreases CHK1 from ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. These findings reveal an important role of MEPE/OF45 in protecting cells from DNA damage induced killing through stabilizing CHK1, which would provide MEPE/OF45 as a new target for sensitizing tumor cells to radiotherapy or chemotherapy.","output":"MEPE/OF45 protects cells from DNA damage induced killing via stabilizing CHK1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has significantly increased demand on laboratory throughput and reagents for nucleic acid extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Reagent shortages may limit the expansion of testing required to scale back containment measures. The aims of this study were to investigate the viability of sample pooling as a strategy for increasing test throughput and conserving PCR reagents; and to report our early experience with pooling of clinical samples. A pre-implementation study was performed to assess the sensitivity and theoretical efficiency of two, four, and eight-sample pools in a real-time reverse transcription PCR-based workflow. A standard operating procedure was developed and implemented in two laboratories during periods of peak demand, inclusive of over 29,000 clinical samples processed in our laboratory. Sensitivity decreased (mean absolute increase in cycle threshold value of 0.6, 2.3, and 3.0 for pools of two, four, and eight samples, respectively) and efficiency increased as pool size increased. Gains from pooling diminished at high disease prevalence. Our standard operating procedure was successfully implemented across two laboratories. Increased workflow complexity imparts a higher risk of errors, and requires risk mitigation strategies. Turnaround time for individual samples increased, hence urgent samples should not be pooled.

It is now evident that this health delivery format will remain in use well into the future. However, health education training, most particularly allied health, has been slow to catch up and adapt curriculum to ensure graduates are equipped with the knowledge and skills to implement telehealth in the workplace. The aim of this study was to gain a comprehensive understanding of current telehealth curricula in undergraduate and postgraduate allied health education training programs, with a focus on the aims, objectives, content, format, delivery, timeline and assessments. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Scopus, ERIC and relevant grey literature was conducted. Students studying allied health degrees through formal education at either postgraduate or undergraduate level were included, while nursing, dentistry and medical students were excluded. The data from the included studies was extracted and tabulated by country, participants, program and content. RESULTS: Of the 4484 studies screened, eleven met the eligibility criteria. All studies were published after 2012, highlighting the recency of research in this area. The studies were conducted in four countries (Australia, United Sates of America, United Kingdom, Norway) and participants were from various allied health professions. Of the included studies, four related to undergraduate programs, four to postgraduate programs and for the remaining three, this was not specified. Curricula were delivered through a combination of online and face-to-face delivery, with assessment tasks, where reported, comprising mainly multiple-choice and written tests.

This contribution problematizes how populations in informality are included in narrowly targeted social assistance interventions, which are heavily reliant on targeted schemes and fail to make informality legible to programme administrators. The focus of the article lies in the politics of exclusion and inclusion that permeate digital infrastructures, particularly data infrastructures such as social registries, that are used to target Ecuador's most prominent social assistance programme, Bono de Desarrollo Humano, and the COVID\\\\related programme Bono de Proteccin Familiar. The article is based on ethnographic work, interviews and narrative analysis. It finds that social registries compiled for proxy means testing weaken the link between eligibility and informal employment and obscure the processes that perpetuate precarity. More recent data innovations, such as machine learning, are also insufficient to locate vulnerable workers as they learn from historical social registries data and replicate their biases, for example by overlooking non\\\\poor areas where informal employment also occurs. Data infrastructures have shifted attention to the technicalities of the selection of beneficiaries and away from power imbalances in the design of social assistance, despite their selectivity and politics.

Along with hemodynamic changes such as prolonged clotting time, high fibrin degradation products and D-dimers, increased levels of monocytes with disturbed morphology have also been identified. In this study, through an integrated analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data from Covid-19 patients with data from single-cell sequencing studies on lung tissues, we found that most of the cell-types that contributed to the altered gene expression were of hematopoietic origin. We also found that differentially expressed genes in Covid-19 patients formed a significant pool of the expressing genes in phagocytic cells such as Monocytes and Platelets. Interestingly, while we observed a general enrichment for Monocytes in Covid-19 patients, we found that the signal for FCGRA3+ Monocytes was depleted. Further, we found evidence that age-associated gene expression changes in Monocytes and Platelets, associated with inflammation, mirror gene expression changes in Covid-19 patients suggesting that pro-inflammatory signalling during aging may worsen the infection in older patients. We identified more than 20 genes that change in the same direction between Covid-19 infection and aging cells that may act as potential therapeutic targets. Of particular interest were IL2RG, GNLY and GMZA expressed in Platelets, which facilitates cytokine signalling in Monocytes through an interaction with Platelets. To understand whether infection can directly manipulate the biology of Monocytes and Platelets, we hypothesize that these non-ACE2 expressing cells may be infected by the virus through the phagocytic route. We observed that phagocytic cells such as Monocytes, T-cells, and Platelets have a significantly higher expression of genes that are a part of the Covid-19 viral interactome. Hence these cell-types may have an active rather than a reactive role in viral pathogenesis to manifest clinical symptoms such as coagulopathy. Therefore, our results present molecular evidence for pursuing both anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation therapy for better patient management especially in older patients.","output":"Integrated analysis of bulk multi omic and single-cell sequencing data confirms the molecular origin of hemodynamic changes in Covid-19 infection explaining coagulopathy and higher geriatric mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experimental and real-life evaluations show that the use of front-of-package warning labels (FoP) in unhealthy foods is well understood and can modify peoples behaviors.

Nine focus groups of mothers (7C10 people each) of children (2C14 yo) were conducted in Santiago, Chile, and macrocodes were developed, combining an iterative process of deductive and inductive thematic analyses. We found that mothers experienced labels fatigue but also had greater knowledge about nutrition and appreciation for more natural foods. This greater knowledge about better nutrition interferes with the perception that healthier and less processed foods are financial and physically inaccessible. The key role of schools as an environment for promoting healthier diets in children was strengthened by the mothers. These results suggest that policies based on providing consumer information need reinforcement campaigns to maintain their effectiveness and that we also need to advance policies to improve access and affordability of healthy foods to ensure better diets.","output":"Why Dont You [Government] Help Us Make Healthier Foods More Affordable Instead of Bombarding Us with Labels?

Previously, we showed a reciprocal effect of 15q11.2 copy-number variation on fractional anisotropy, with widespread increases in deletion carriers. We aim to replicate and expand these findings, using a larger sample of participants (n=30,930), higher resolution imaging, and examining the implications for cognitive performance. Methods Diffusion tensor imaging measures from participants with no neurological/psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from the UK Biobank database. We compared 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion (n=103) and duplication (n=119) carriers to a large cohort of control individuals with no neuropsychiatric copy-number variants (n=29,870). Additionally, we assessed how changes in white matter mediated the association between carrier status and cognitive performance. Results Deletion carriers showed increases in fractional anisotropy in the internal capsule and cingulum, and decreases in the posterior thalamic radiation, compared to both duplication carriers and controls (who had intermediate values). Deletion carriers had lower scores across cognitive tasks compared to controls, which were mildly influenced by white matter alterations. Reduced fractional anisotropy in the posterior thalamic radiation partially contributed to worse cognitive performance in deletion carriers. Conclusions This study, together with our previous findings, provides convergent evidence for a dosage-dependent effect of 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 on white matter microstructure. Additionally, changes in white matter were found to partially mediate cognitive ability in deletion carriers, providing a link between white matter changes in 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 carriers and cognitive function.","output":"Analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data from UK Biobank confirms dosage effect of 15q11.2 copy-number variation on white matter and shows association with cognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Passively generated cell-phone location (\\"mobility\\") data originally intended for commercial use has become frequently used in epidemiologic research, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic to study the impact of physical-distancing recommendations on aggregate population behavior (e.g., average daily mobility). Given the opaque nature of how individuals are selected into these datasets, researchers have cautioned that their use may give rise to selection bias, yet little guidance exists for assessing this potential threat to validity in mobility-data research. Through an example analysis of cell-phone-derived mobility data, we present a set of conditions to guide the assessment of selection bias in measures comparing aggregate mobility patterns over time and between groups. METHODS: We specifically consider bias in measures comparing group-level mobility in the same group (difference, ratio, percent difference) and between groups (difference in differences, ratio of ratios, ratio of percent differences). We illustrate no-bias conditions in these measures through an example comparing block-group-level mobility between income groups in U.S. metro areas before (January 1st-March 10, 2020) and after (March 11th-April 19th, 2020) the day COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. RESULTS: Within-group contrasts describing mobility over time, especially for the higher-income decile, were expected to be most resistant to bias during the example study period. CONCLUSIONS: The presented conditions can be used to assess the susceptibility to selection bias of group-level measures comparing mobility. Importantly, they can be used even without knowledge of the degree of bias in each group at each time point. We further highlight links between no-bias principles originating in epidemiology and economics, showing that certain assumptions (e.g., parallel trends) can apply to biases beyond their original application.","output":"On selection bias in comparison measures of smartphone-generated population mobility: an illustration of no-bias conditions with a commercial data source"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study objectives: There is accumulating evidence that the common cold produces impairments in psychomotor vigilance.

CONCLUSION: There is little evidence suggesting that remote exercise interventions promote exercise behaviours or improve physical function in sedentary adults living with and beyond cancer. The development and evaluation of novel remote exercise interventions is needed to establish their usefulness for clinical practice. Given the social response to the COVID-19 pandemic, further research in this area is urgently needed.","output":"Remote interventions to improve exercise behaviour in sedentary people living with and beyond cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conjunctivitis may be a feature of COVID-19, with tears containing SARS-CoV-2 virus, and a source of potential transmission via aerosols.","output":"Management of conjunctivitis during the COVID-19 pandemic 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the period of self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic the time of contact of children and adolescents with technical means of Internet access has significantly increased, and accordingly time of contact of the students with device screens also increased.

Nevertheless, almost all countries of the world are trying to find ways to optimize the length of screen time for children and adolescents and are preparing recommendations to prevent negative health consequences. For the purposes of this study, we have reviewed the literature of recent years, reflecting the results of both individual and national studies focused primarily on identifying the causes of deterioration of the health of children and adolescents under the influence of digital technologies. The most significant changes, that can be caused by increase in screen time are disorders of mental health and sleep. Further consequences are disorders in the musculoskeletal system coupled with pain syndrome, metabolic disorders and obesity, hypodynamia. The indirect consequences are behavioural disorders and, in a broader sense, problems in the socialization of the child. It is currently not possible to exclude the use of various technical means.

N-linked glycosylation is involved in stability and function of these proteins and occurs at Asn residues. In several organs, profiles of N-glycans have been determined by comprehensive analyses. Nevertheless, the cochlea of the mammalian inner ear, a tiny organ mediating hearing, has yet to be examined. Here, we focused on the stria vascularis, an epithelial-like tissue in the cochlea, and characterised N-glycans by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. This hypervascular tissue not only expresses several ion transporters and channels to control the electrochemical balance in the cochlea but also harbours different transporters and receptors that maintain structure and activity of the organ. Seventy-nine N-linked glycans were identified in the rat stria vascularis. Among these, in 55 glycans, the complete structures were determined; in the other 24 species, partial glycosidic linkage patterns and full profiles of the monosaccharide composition were identified. In the process of characterisation, several sialylated glycans were subjected sequentially to two different alkylamidation reactions; this derivatisation helped to distinguish 2,3-linkage and 2,6-linkage sialyl isomers with mass spectrometry.

Symptomatically affected individuals often become severely hypoxic, requiring non-invasive ventilation. The scarcity of resources in resource-compromised countries like India led to the adoption of novel strategies like using Bains circuit for assisting spontaneous ventilation. This study compares the outcome when a standard circuit is replaced with a shortened Bains circuit. Aims and objectives To compare shortened Bains circuit and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in spontaneously ventilated COVID 19 patients with regards to effects on hemodynamic stability and efficacy of ventilation using blood gas analysis. Methodology Twenty-four COVID patients aged between 35-70 years, requiring non-invasive ventilation but not tolerating BiPAP or not improving on BiPAP were enrolled in the study. Baseline heart rate and arterial blood gases (ABG) were recorded. Patients were then ventilated using shortened Bains circuit. Heart rate and ABG were then recorded two hours after ventilation. Results Hemodynamic and blood gas parameters were comparable between the two groups at baseline and on BiPAP. Group A showed better hemodynamic and blood gas profiles compared to group B, but the difference was not statistically significant because of small sample size. Conclusion Shortened Bains circuit may be a viable alternative to non-invasive ventilation in spontaneously breathing hypoxic patients with efficacy comparable to a standard Bains circuit and reduced chances of carbon dioxide retention.

Methods: Against the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, the data of patients who visited the neurological clinic of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital West Branch during the pandemic (February 1CMay 30, 2020) and the corresponding period in 2019 (February 1CMay 30, 2019) were analyzed, and patients with dizziness/vertigo from these two periods were compared to discover their demographic features and etiologic distribution according to their age and sex. Result: The absolute number of neurological outpatients decreased from 14,670 in 2019 to 8,763 in 2020 (?40.3%), with a corresponding decline in dizziness/vertigo patients (2019: n = 856; 2020: n = 1,436, ?40.4%). Dizziness/vertigo was more common in women than men in these two periods (2019: women = 63.6%; 2020: women = 63.1%, p = 0.82). The overall etiology distribution was different among all disorders between the two periods (p < 0.001). There was an increase in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) (2019 vs. 2020: 30.7 vs. 35%, p < 0.05) and psychogenic/persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) (2019 vs. 2020: 28.5 vs. 34.6%, p < 0.05) while a decrease in vascular vertigo during the epidemic (2019 vs. 2020: 13 vs. 9.6%, p < 0.05). During the epidemic, the top three causes of dizziness/vertigo were BPPV (35%), psychogenic/PPPD (34.6%), and vascular vertigo (9.6%). A female predominance was observed in BPPV (women = 67.7%, p < 0.05) and psychogenic/PPPD (women = 67.6%, p < 0.05). In addition, the etiology ratio of different age groups was significantly different (p < 0.001). The most common cause for young and young-old patients was BPPV, and the most common cause for middle-aged and old-old patients was psychogenic/PPPD. Conclusion: The absolute number of outpatients with dizziness/vertigo during the COVID-19 pandemic was reduced during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak. BPPV and psychogenic/PPPD were more abundant, and vascular vertigo was less frequent. Based on those data, health-care management policy for dizziness/vertigo and mental disorder should be developed during the outbreak of COVID-19 and other infective diseases.","output":"The Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic on Dizziness/Vertigo Outpatients in a Neurological Clinic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Glomerular diseases (GD) are chronic conditions that often involve immune dysfunction and require immunosuppressive therapy (IST) to control underlying pathogenesis. Unfortunately, such diseases appear to heighten risks of severe outcomes in COVID-19 and predispose to other infections that may be life-threatening. Thus, averting preventable infections is imperative in GD patients. SUMMARY: The advent of vaccines demonstrated to be safe and efficacious against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has favorably impacted the COVID-19 pandemic epidemiology. However, patients on ISTs were excluded from initial vaccine clinical trials. Thus, only limited and incomplete data are available currently regarding the potential impact of immunosuppression on immune response to or efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, new insights are emerging from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies, and impacts of ISTs on conventional vaccines are useful to consider. Mechanisms of immunosuppressive agents commonly used in the treatment of GD are reviewed with respect to implications for immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. ISTs discussed include corticosteroids; alkylating agents; antimetabolites; calcineurin or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors; CD38+, CD20+, or CD19+ cell depletion; and complement protein C5 inhibition. KEY MESSAGES: Many immunosuppressive therapies may potentially attenuate or impair protective immunity of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, as vaccines currently in use employ mRNA or nonreplicative viral vectors, they appear to be safe in patients on immunosuppression, further favoring vaccination. Moreover, predominant SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are likely to afford at least partial protective immunity through one or more immune mechanisms even in patients on IST. Guidelines and emerging strategies are also considered to optimize vaccine protection from COVID-19.","output":"Immunosuppression in Glomerular Diseases: Implications for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pursuit of relationship goals is critical to the wellbeing of young adults. This study investigated different achievement goals toward social competence as potential predictors of social anxiety and depression symptoms. It proposed that self-esteem may function as a mediator on the pathway from endorsing social achievement goals to undergraduates' concurrent and longitudinal social anxiety and depression symptoms. Social achievement goal theory proposes three types of goals: social mastery goals (striving to improve one's social competence), social performance-approach goals (striving to prove one's social competence and win positive evaluation), and social performance-avoid goals (striving to avoid incompetent social behaviors and negative evaluation). One hundred and eighty-five Chinese undergraduates aged from 18 to 23 (50% female) completed this study across two-time points. Path analyses indicated that social mastery (marginally) and performance-approach goals were positively associated with self-esteem, whereas social performance-avoid goals were negatively associated with self-esteem; self-esteem was negatively associated with the concurrent social anxiety and depression symptoms and the longitudinal depression symptoms. The proposed mediation effects of self-esteem on the links from three types of social achievement goals to the concurrent and longitudinal social anxiety and depression symptoms were significant except on the links from social mastery goals and social performance-approach goals to the subsequent social anxiety symptoms. Self-esteem and the baseline social anxiety and depressive symptoms have a chain mediating effect between social achievement goals and the longitudinal symptoms of social anxiety and depression. These findings suggest that the pursuit of social mastery goals and performance-approach goals in initiating and maintaining social relationships boosts undergraduates' self-worth and reduces their concurrent and longitudinal depression experiences. However, the strivings to hide inadequacy and avoid negative evaluation in social contexts impede one's self-worth and increase concurrent and longitudinal social anxiety and depression symptoms.

METHODS: The study was conducted cross-sectionally 4 weeks after the completed treatment of COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the polymerase chain reaction test and/or clinical and radiological findings. The patients with treated COVID-19 were enrolled in the COVID-19 group; age- and sex-matched healthy participants served as the control group. All patients in the COVID-19 group were hospitalized and treated with favipiravir, moxifloxacin, and heparin without the requirement for intubation. The measurements of CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) were performed by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). RESULTS: Similar visual acuity (p = 0.582) and intraocular pressure (p = 0.766) values were observed between the COVID-19 and control groups. Regarding SS-OCT measurements, all mean CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) values were similar in the COVID-19 and control groups (p > 0.05 for all). In the COVID-19 group, a statistically significant negative correlation was noted between the mean ferritin level and temporal RNFLT (r = - 0.378, p = 0.014) and a positive correlation was observed between the mean ferritin level and nasal RNFLT (r = + 0.371, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: SS-OCT measurements showed no retinal neurodegenerative and choroidal thickness alterations in COVID-19 patients. Nonsignificant results might be due to the examination of the patients in the early period of the COVID-19 after the treatment. Therefore, late period OCT measurements should be reviewed with new studies in the future.","output":"Assessment of Retinal Neurodegeneration and Choroidal Thickness in COVID-19 Patients Using Swept-Source OCT Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present review is aimed at the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) and exergames in the prevention of falls among the elderly.

Stress influences health behaviors, including those related to dietary behaviors, alcohol, and sleep; yet the effects of stress can be mitigated by resilience. To date, past research studying the connections between dietary behaviors, alcohol misuse, sleep, and resilience commonly investigated singular relationships between two of the constructs. The aim of the current study was to explore the relationships between these constructs in a more holistic manner using mediation and moderation analyses. Methods: Higher education students from China, Ireland, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and the United States were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from April to May 2020, which was during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic for most participants. An online survey, using validated tools, was distributed to assess perceived stress, dietary behaviors, alcohol misuse, sleep quality and duration, and resilience. Results: 2254 students completed the study. Results indicated that sleep quality mediated the relationship between perceived stress and dietary behaviors as well as the relationship between perceived stress and alcohol misuse.

Testing of symptomatic prisoners was limited for most of the outbreak, with only 33% of probable cases tested. This explains the low number of confirmed cases (three) among prisoners despite the large number of probable cases (n=81; 92%). Over 50% of the initial cases among prisoners were on the two wings associated with the index case. Interpretation: Rapid transmission of SARS-COV-2 was prevented through proactive steps in identifying and isolating infected prisoners (and staff), cohorting new admissions and shielding vulnerable individuals. These novel and cost-effective approaches can be implemented in a wide range of correctional facilities globally and proved effective even in the absence of mass testing.","output":"Implementation of novel and conventional outbreak control measures in managing a COVID-19 outbreak in a large UK prison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of anti-Sarcocystis spp. specific IgG antibodies in serum samples from precolostral lambs to determine the occurrence of transplacental transmission of Sarcocystis spp. in sheep. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 80 ewes and their respective lambs, immediately after lambing and before colostrum ingestion, respectively. The presence of anti-Sarcocystis spp. IgG was evaluated in serum samples using the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Positive samples of the lambs were submitted to titration and IFAT to detect anti-T. gondii and anti-N. caninum specific IgG. RESULTS: Anti-Sarcocystis spp. IgG was detected in 62.5% of the ewes (50/80) and in 4% of the lambs of the seropositive ewes (2/50). None of the lambs from seronegative ewes were positive. The final titers of the positive lambs were 80. No cross reaction was detected among the positive samples to anti-Sarcocystis spp., anti-N. caninum, and anti-T. gondii IgG. The detection of anti-Sarcocystis spp. antibodies in serum samples of lambs deprived of colostrum suggests transplacental transmission of infection. Thus, the vertical transmission may be an alternative route of infection of Sarcocystis spp. also in sheep. Further studies are warranted to confirm transplacental transmission in sheep and to explain the importance of this infection pathway.","output":"Anti-Sarcocystis Antibodies in Lambs Deprived of Colostrum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adult Mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes carry several biologically active molecules that play prominent roles in controlling disease manifestations. The content of these exosomes, their functions, and effect on the immune cells may differ depending on their tissue sources. Therefore, in this study, we purified the exosomes from three different sources and, using the RNA-Seq approach, highly abundant microRNAs were identified and compared between exosomes and parental cells. The effects of exosomes on different immune cells were studied in vitro by incubating exosomes with PBMC and neutrophils and assessing their functions. The expression levels of several miRNAs varied within the different MSCs and exosomes. Additionally, the expression profile of most of the miRNAs was not similar to that of their respective sources. Exosomes isolated from different sources had different abilities to induce the process of neurogenesis and angiogenesis. Moreover, these exosomes demonstrated their varying effect on PBMC proliferation, neutrophil survival, and NET formation, highlighting their versatility and broad interaction with immune cells. The knowledge gained from this study will improve our understanding of the miRNA landscape of exosomes from hMSCs and provide a resource for further improving our understanding of exosome cargo and their interaction with immune cells.","output":"MicroRNA-Enriched Exosomes from Different Sources of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Can Differentially Modulate Functions of Immune Cells and Neurogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The study aim is to review the prevalence, management, and outcomes for patients diagnosed with ileal pouch prolapse after restorative proctocolectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients were identified retrospectively from a prospectively maintained pouch database. Parameters analyzed included presenting symptoms, indications for pouch surgery, type of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, treatment modalities, and outcomes. RESULTS Of 3,176 patients who underwent ileal pouch surgery, 11 were diagnosed with pouch prolapse (0.3%). Seven had full-thickness prolapse and four mucosal prolapse. Six were male, and five were female. Indication for index surgery was ulcerative colitis (nine patients), familial adenomatous polyposis (one patient), and colonic inertia (one patient). Median age at pouch prolapse was 34 years. Median time from index surgery to prolapse diagnosis was 2 years. Two patients with mucosal prolapse responded to conservative management; two required mucosal excisions. An abdominal approach was successful in four out of seven patients with full thickness prolapse. The three failures subsequently underwent continent ileostomy formation and prompted us to add biological mesh to future pouchpexy repairs. CONCLUSIONS Pouch prolapse is rare, and there are no obvious predisposing factors. Mucosal prolapse may be treated by stool bulking or a local perineal procedure. Full thickness prolapse requires definitive surgery and is associated with risk of pouch loss.","output":"Ileal pouch prolapse: prevalence, management, and outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nordic countries are part of the borderless Schengen Area, but free movement in the Nordic countries, or Norden, dates back even further: no border controls or restrictions on workers' movements have existed since the entry into force of the Nordic labour market and passport union in 1958.

Eighteen COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit at the University Hospital Rechts der Isar, Munich, Germany, between 14 March and 23 June 2020, were prospectively followed-up at a median of 36, 75.5, 122 and 222 days after discharge. The health-related quality of life (HrQoL) (36-item Short Form Health Survey and St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ), cardiopulmonary function, laboratory parameters and chest imaging were assessed longitudinally. The HrQoL assessment revealed a reduced physical functioning, as well as increased SGRQ impact and symptoms scores that all improved over time but remained markedly impaired compared to the reference groups. The median radiological severity scores significantly declined; persistent abnormalities were found in 33.3% of the patients on follow-up. A reduced diffusion capacity was the most common abnormal pulmonary function parameter. The length of hospitalization correlated with role limitations due to physical problems, the SGRQ symptom and the impact score. In conclusion, in survivors of severe COVID-19, the pulmonary function and symptoms improve over time, but impairments in their physical function and diffusion capacity can persist over months.

While conventional therapeutics often involve administering small molecules to fight viral infections, small non-coding RNA sequences, known as microRNAs (miRNAs/miR-), may present a novel antiviral strategy. We can take advantage of their ability to modulate hostCvirus interactions through mediating RNA degradation or translational inhibition. Investigations into miRNA and SARS-CoV-2 interactions can reveal novel therapeutic approaches against this virus. The viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were searched using the Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) for highly similar sequences, to identify potential binding sites for miRNAs hypothesized to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. miRNAs that target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV for host cell entry, were also predicted. Several relevant miRNAs were identified, and their potential roles in regulating SARS-CoV-2 infections were further assessed. Current treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 are limited and have not generated sufficient evidence on safety and efficacy for treating COVID-19. Therefore, by investigating the interactions between miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2, miRNA-based antiviral therapies, including miRNA mimics and inhibitors, may be developed as an alternative strategy to fight COVID-19.","output":"MicroRNA Mimics or Inhibitors as Antiviral Therapeutic Approaches Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The focus on hand hygiene during the pandemic has been reported to increase the hand eczema (HE) prevalence in healthcare workers (HCWs), however, detailed prospective data is missing.

Methods In this prospective cohort study, HCWs employed at hospitals in Copenhagen responded to a digital questionnaire at the beginning of the pandemic and again 10 months later. Results Seven-hundred-and-ninety-five HCWs responded to both questionnaires (83.4% females). The calculated one-year HE prevalence decreased from 16.0% at baseline to 13.0% at follow-up. Number of hand washings decreased significantly, while use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) on wet skin increased significantly. In a logistic regression model, increased use of ABHR on wet skin was associated with HE at follow-up (OR 1.78, 95%CI [1.11-2.87]). HR-QoL worsened slightly at follow-up, with HE severity and frequent flares being risk factors for a reduced HR-QoL. Limitations Sample size Conclusion In contrast to previous studies undertaken during the pandemic, we found a relatively low and stable HE prevalence.

However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation: Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.","output":"Detectable serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is closely associated with drastically elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) level in critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The healthcare policy changes need to be updated for better management of the COVID-19 outbreak; hence, there is an urgent need to understand the knowledge and preparedness of healthcare workers regarding the infection control COVID-19.

METHODS: The study was conducted at 3 tertiary referral hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from March to August 2020. Pregnant women admitted for delivery at these hospitals with laboratory results (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) were analyzed. Using convenience sampling, we included 70 COVID-19-positive and 140 COVID-19-negative pregnant women. Trained and experienced midwives conducted the interviews. Data were analyzed using the t-test, the chi-square test, and univariate and multivariable linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: Pregnant women with COVID-19 were more likely to give birth to a preterm baby (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 to 4.37) and undergo a cesarean section (aOR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.51 to 7.07).

The current study examined the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disruption on well-being throughout adulthood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Perceived stress and affect were examined in 166 community-dwelling adults (Mage=35.65; SD=15.53; range=18-79) in relation to the perceived disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic to their lives. RESULTS: A significant moderation was found for age and COVID-19 disruption on perceived stress [F(5, 153) = 8.88, p & .05, R(2)= .22] and negative affect [F(5, 154) = 4.91, p & .05, R(2)= .14], but not for positive affect. For participants over 50, those who rated COVID-19 as a low or high disruption had similar scores on stress and negative affect, but with younger aged participants, perceiving high disruption corresponded with higher levels of stress and negative affect. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings are consistent with the strength and vulnerability integration (SAVI) model, wherein older adults try to maintain positive emotional well-being; with middle-aged and older adults in the current study having experienced less negative impact on well-being. Middle-aged and older adults may be better able to regulate negative emotions, from COVID-19, than younger adults.

T cell development depends upon cell-cell interactions with epithelial cells in the thymus. The thymus is composed of two different types of epithelial cells: cortical and medullary epithelial cells. Both of these express and critically depend on the transcription factor Foxn1 Foxn1 is also expressed in the hair follicle, and disruption of Foxn1 function in mice results in severe thymic developmental defects and the hairless (nude) phenotype. Despite its importance, little is known about the direct regulation of Foxn1 expression. In this study, we identify a cis-regulatory element (RE) critical for expression of Foxn1 in mouse thymic epithelial cells but dispensable for expression in hair follicles. Analysis of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and sequence conservation identified regions within the first intron of Foxn1 that possessed the characteristics of REs. Systematic knockout of candidate regions lead us to identify a 1.6 kb region that, when deleted, results in a near total disruption of thymus development.

Although SARS-CoV-2 associated intrinsic kidney disease has been scarcely reported in children, only one case of AIN temporally associated with the infection has been described in the pediatric population so far. We presented a case of a 12-year old boy who presented with fatigue, anorexia, and polydipsia following an RT-PCR that confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection seven weeks prior to admission. Initial workup revealed increased serum creatinine (235 mol/L), glucosuria, low-molecular-weight proteinuria, mild leukocyturia, and microhematuria with hyaline and granular casts on microscopy. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor-binding domain confirmed prior infection with high titers. Kidney biopsy showed diffuse active interstitial nephritis with negative immunofluorescence and positive immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 in the inflammatory cells within the interstitium. Electron microscopy revealed several SARS-CoV-2-like particles. Kidney function continued to deteriorate despite several days of supportive therapy only (peak serum creatinine 272 mol/L); thus, treatment with methylprednisolone pulse-dose therapy was initiated and was followed by oral prednisolone with gradual tapering. Kidney function completely recovered after 3 weeks post-discharge and remained normal after 11 weeks of follow-up (last estimated glomerular filtration rate 106 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) with only residual microhematuria. Our case adds to the emerging evidence of SARS-CoV-2 as a potential etiological agent of AIN in children and also suggests that interstitial kidney injury may result from secondary inflammatory damage.

Methods: : This is a retrospective cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 patients that were admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 30, 2020 to February 15, 2020. The baseline clinical and laboratory parameters were collected. Results: : 264 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 52 died during hospitalization and 212 were discharged from the hospital. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that the area under curve (AUC) of D-dimer was 0.818 with a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 78.3%, and the AUC of DPR was 0.847 with a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 75.5% for the prediction of in-hospital mortality on admission. Patients with higher D-dimer or DPR levels were associated with higher mortality risk, compared to those who lower levels. The multivariable Cox regression indicated that in-hospital mortality was associated with age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.034, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.011-1.058, P =0.003), gender (HR 0.553, 95% CI 0.313-0.976;P =0.041), coronary heart disease (HR 2.315, 95% CI 1.276-4.200;P =0.006), elevated D-dimer (HR 6.111, 95% CI 3.095-12.068;P <0.001), and elevated DPR (HR 7.158, 95% CI 3.633-14.101;P <0.001). Conclusions: : DPR levels seem to be slightly better at predicting mortality than D-dimer, and elevated D-dimer and DPR can both be considered independent risk factors of the death in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The Predictive Value of D-Dimer and DPR for in-Hospital Mortality in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Monthly primary dysmenorrhoeic pain is associated with increased sensitivity to painful stimuli, particularly in deep tissue. We investigated whether women with dysmenorrhoea, compared with controls, have increased sensitivity to experimentally induced deep-tissue muscle ischaemia in a body area distant from that of referred menstrual pain. METHODS The sub-maximal effort tourniquet test was used to induce forearm ischaemia in 11 women with severe dysmenorrhoea and in nine control women both during menstruation and in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Von Frey hair assessments confirmed the presence of experimental ischaemia. Women rated the intensity of menstrual and ischaemic pain on a 100-mm visual analogue scale. RESULTS Women with dysmenorrhoea [mean (SD): 68 (20) mm] reported significantly greater menstrual pain compared with controls [mean (SD): 2 (6) mm; p = 0.0001] during the menstruation phase. They also rated their forearm ischaemic pain as significantly greater than the controls during the menstruation [dysmenorrhoeics vs. controls mean (SD): 58 (19) mm vs. 31 (21) mm, p < 0.01] and follicular [dysmenorrhoeics vs. controls mean (SD): 60 (18) mm vs. 40 (14) mm, p < 0.01] phases of the menstrual cycle. CONCLUSIONS These data show that compared with controls, women who experience severe recurrent dysmenorrhoea have deep-tissue hyperalgesia to ischaemic pain in muscles outside of the referred area of menstrual pain both during the painful menstruation phase and pain-free follicular phase. These findings suggest the presence of long-lasting changes in muscle pain sensitivity in women with dysmenorrhoea.

We have seen the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), the causative agent of COVID-19 that has already infected more than 29 million people, with more than 900 000 deaths since its identification in December 2019. Considering the significant impact of viral infections, research and development of new antivirals and control strategies are essential. In this paper, we summarize 96 antivirals approved by the Food and Drug Administration between 1987 and 2019. Of these, 49 (51%) are used in treatments against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), four against human papillomavirus, six against cytomegalovirus, eight against hepatitis B virus, five against influenza, six against herpes simplex virus, 17 against hepatitis C virus and one against respiratory syncytial virus. This review also describes future perspectives for new antiviral therapies such as nanotechnologies, monoclonal antibodies and the CRISPR-Cas system. These strategies are suggested as inhibitors of viral replication by various means, such as direct binding to the viral particle, blocking the infection, changes in intracellular mechanisms or viral genes, preventing replication and virion formation. We also observed that a large number of viral agents have no therapy available and the majority of those approved in the last 32 years are restricted to some groups, especially anti-HIV. Additionally, the emergence of new viruses and strains resistant to available antivirals has necessitated the formulation of new antivirals.","output":"Antiviral therapies: advances and perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 variants from the United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, and Brazil have received much attention for their increased infectivity, potentially high virulence, and possible threats to existing vaccines and antibody therapies. The question remains if there are other more infectious variants transmitted around the world. We carry out a large-scale study of 506,768 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates from patients to identify many other rapidly growing mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We reveal that essentially all 100 most observed mutations strengthen the binding between the RBD and the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicating the virus evolves toward more infectious variants. In particular, we discover new fast-growing RBD mutations N439K, S477N, S477R, and N501T that also enhance the RBD and ACE2 binding. We further unveil that mutation N501Y involved in United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, and Brazil variants may moderately weaken the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies, while mutations E484K and K417N found in South Africa and Brazilian variants, L452R and E484Q found in India variants, can potentially disrupt the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies. Among these RBD mutations, L452R is also now known as part of the California variant B.1.427. Finally, we hypothesize that RBD mutations that can simultaneously make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious and disrupt the existing antibodies, called vaccine escape mutations, will pose an imminent threat to the current crop of vaccines. A list of most likely vaccine escape mutations is given, including S494P, Q493L, K417N, F490S, F486L, R403K, E484K, L452R, K417T, F490L, E484Q, and A475S. Mutation T478K appears to make the Mexico variant B.1.1.222 the most infectious one. Our comprehensive genetic analysis and protein-protein binding study show that the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 on the RBD, which may be regulated by host gene editing, viral proofreading, random genetic drift, and natural selection, gives rise to more infectious variants that will potentially compromise existing vaccines and antibody therapies.","output":"Vaccine-escape and fast-growing mutations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, Spain, India, and other COVID-19-devastated countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic challenges the delivery of care for patients with head and neck cancer.

This study aimed to develop a Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy planning solution for GBM re-irradiation including a means of assessing if target coverage would be achievable and how much PTV 'cropping' would be required to meet OAR constraints, based on PTV volume and OAR proximity. Materials and methods: For 10 PTVs, 360, 180, two coplanar 180 and 180 + non-coplanar 45 arc arrangements were compared using 35 Gy in 10 fractions. Using the preferred arrangement, dose fall-off was modelled to determine the separation required between PTV and OAR to ensure OAR dose constraints were met, with data presented graphically. To evaluate the graph as an aid to planning, seven cases with overlap were replanned in two treatment planning systems (TPSs). Results: There were no significant dosimetric differences between arc arrangements. 180 was preferred due to shorter treatment times. The graph, which indicated if 95% PTV coverage would be achievable based on PTV volume and OAR proximity, was employed in seven cases to guide planning in two TPSs. Plans were deliverable. Conclusions: Re-irradiation treatment planning can be challenging, especially when PTV under-coverage is necessary. 180 was considered optimal. To assist in the planning process, graphical guidance was produced to inform planners whether PTV under-coverage would be necessary and how much PTV 'cropping' would be required to meet constraints during optimisation.","output":"Optimising tumour coverage and organ at risk sparing for hypofractionated re-irradiation in glioblastoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 posed an historic challenge to healthcare systems around the world.

The rheological, anti-inflammatory, and renin-angiotensin axis properties of PTX highlight this drug as a therapeutic treatment alternative for patients with COVID-19 by helping reduce the production of the inflammatory cytokines without deleterious effects on the immune system to delay viral clearance. Moreover, PTX can restore the balance of the immune response, reduce damage to the endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells, improve circulation, and prevent microvascular thrombosis. There is further evidence that PTX can improve ventilatory parameters. Therefore, we propose repositioning PTX in the treatment of COVID-19. The main advantage of repositioning PTX is that it is an affordable drug that is already available worldwide with an established safety profile, further offering the possibility of immediately analysing the result of its use and associated success rates. Another advantage is that PTX selectively reduces the concentration of TNF- mRNA in cells, which, in the case of an acute infectious state such as COVID-19, would seem to offer a more strategic approach.","output":"Repositioning of pentoxifylline as an immunomodulator and regulator of the renin-angiotensin system in the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Neuropsychological assessment via video conferencing has been proposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The review is based on the experience of 1,574 spinal endoscopic procedures performed by the senior author. RESULTS Advantages of endoscopic surgery include better visualization, panoramic vision, and the ability to work around corners. Limitations with endoscopic procedures include proximal blind areas, obstruction in instrument handling due to a narrow corridor, disorientation, frequent lens fogging, loss of depth perception, and difficulty in achieving hemostasis, leading to complications and longer operative time during the learning curve. CONCLUSION Surgeons need to learn endoscopic skills in addition to microsurgical ones to perform microendoscopic procedures properly.

The development of trauma systems in low-resource settings may be of benefit. The objective of this study was to describe operative procedures performed for trauma at a tertiary care facility in Kigali, Rwanda, and to evaluate geographical variations and referral patterns of trauma care. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all prospectively collected operative cases performed at the largest referral hospital in Rwanda, the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK), between June 1 and Dec. 1, 2011, for injury-related diagnoses. We used the Pearson 2 and Fisher exact tests to compare cases arising from within Kigali to those transferred from other provinces. Geospatial analyses were also performed to further elucidate transfer patterns. RESULTS Over the 6-month study period, 2758 surgical interventions were performed at the CHUK. Of these, 653 (23.7%) were for trauma. Most patients resided outside of Kigali city, with 337 (58.0%) patients transferred from other provinces and 244 (42.0%) from within Kigali. Most trauma procedures were orthopedic (489 [84.2%]), although general surgery procedures represented a higher proportion of trauma surgeries in patients from other provinces than in patients from within Kigali (28 of 337 [8.3%] v. 10 of 244 [4.1%]). CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight geographical variations in access to trauma care in a low-income country and the first description of trauma procedures at a referral centre in Rwanda.

METHODS: Caregivers of 151 kindergarteners from low-income homes completed questionnaires as part of a larger study. Caregivers reported how much time children spent watching television/videos and using apps on the most recent weekday and weekend days. Caregivers also reported how their child's current use of media for several different purposes compared with how much the child usually uses media for that purpose. RESULTS: Weekly average media use was 46.3 hours or 6.6 hours per day. Counter to previous research, weekday media use was higher than weekend media use, suggesting that media was likely used as a replacement for time usually spent in school. Caregivers reported increased child media use for positive purposes, such as education and maintaining relationships with family and friends outside of the home, and potentially useful but less socially valued purposes, such as occupying the child's time while caregivers were completing other tasks. Having more children in the household was related to higher media use, and girls used media for maintaining remote relationships more than boys. CONCLUSION: These findings provide reason for both concern and optimism for the impacts of pandemic closures on low-income children. High levels of media use seem to be prevalent in this population. However, the diverse purposes for media use suggest that caregivers relied on media to supplement children's academic and social growth at a time when school and socializing were not safe in their typical forms.","output":"Media Use Among Kindergarteners From Low-Income Households During the COVID-19 Shutdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India witnessed a huge surge in Covid 19 cases in the second wave. There was also an increased presentation of Mucor mycosis cases associated with Covid 19 illness. Severe COVID-19 is a hyper-ferritinemic syndrome, but whether high ferritin is a marker of a severe systemic disease versus a modulator of pathophysiology is not known. Irrespective of its role, high ferritin levels lead to excess intracellular iron that generates reactive oxygen species resulting in tissue damage. There are many theories existing presently to associate the development of Mucor mycosis in Covid 19 patients. The present study is to evaluate the correlation between HbA1c and serum ferritin levels in COVID 19 associated Mucor mycosis and the associated outcomes. MATERIAL: It is prospective observational study. RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID 19 pneumonia with clinical, microbiological or radiologically confirmed cases of mucor mycosis were selected after obtaining informed consent. Relevant clinical data collected, Serum Hba1c and Ferritin was sent. Data analysis was done using SPSS software. OBSERVATION: Among the 97 patients, 63 (64.9 %) were male and 34 (35.1%) were females, 10 (10.3 %) patients had no comorbidities, 82 (84.5 %) patients had diabetes mellitus, 32 (33.0 %) patients had hypertension and 30 (30.9 %) patients had both diabetes and hypertension. Mean Hba1c among the patients was 10.98 %. Mean serum ferritin level was 929.11 ng/dl. Mean Serum ferritin was significantly lower among survivors (843.8 ng/dl) when compared to non survivors (1150.2 ng/dl) (p= 0.034). CONCLUSION: Serum ferritin is significantly elevated in COVID-19- associated mucor mycosis (CAMCR) cases. The mean Hba1c of 10.98 % suggests a background of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus along with COVID 19 infection is a risk factor for mucor mycosis. Serum ferritin was significantly lower among survivors when compared to non survivors. Increased serum ferritin can be associated with poor prognosis and mortality in COVID-19 associated mucor mycosis.","output":"Study of hba1c and serum ferritin levels in covid 19 associated Mucor mycosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, our goal is to analyze and compare cellular network usage data from pre-lockdown, during lockdown, and post-lockdown phases surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic to understand and model human mobility patterns during the pandemic, and evaluate the effect of lockdowns on mobility. To this end, we collaborate with one of the main cellular network providers in Brazil, and collect and analyze cellular network connections from 1400 antennas for all users in the city of Rio de Janeiro and its suburbs from March 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020. Our analysis reveals that the total number of cellular connections decreases to 78% during the lockdown phase and then increases to 85% of the pre-COVID era as the lockdown eases. We observe that as more people work remotely, there is a shift in the antennas incurring top 10% of the total traffic, with the number of connections made to antennas in downtown Rio reducing drastically and antennas at other locations taking their place. We also observe that while nearly 40-45% users connected to only 1 antenna each day during the lockdown phase indicating no mobility, there are around 4% users (i.e., 80K users) who connected to more than 10 antennas, indicating very high mobility. Finally, we design an interactive tool that showcases mobility patterns in different granularities that can potentially help people and government officials understand the mobility of individuals and the number of COVID cases in a particular neighborhood.

All patients were non-smokers, six (86%) were male and median age was 56.7 (50C64) years. They had failed approaches including therapeutic anticoagulation, prone ventilation (n = 4), inhaled nitric oxide (n = 5) and nebulised epoprostenol (n = 2). The median duration of mechanical ventilation prior to thrombolysis was seven (5C11) days. Systemic alteplase was administered to six patients (50 mg or 90 mg bolus over 120 min) at 16 (10C22) days after symptom onset. All received therapeutic heparin pre- and post-thrombolysis, without intracranial haemorrhage or other major bleeding.

New and effective intervention strategies are urgently needed to combat the disease. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, non-randomized, clinical trial involving moderate COVID-19 patients according to study protocol. Patients were assigned in a 1:2 ratio to receive either aerosol inhalation treatment with IFN- and TFF2, every 48 h for three consecutive dosages, in addition to standard treatment (experimental group), or standard treatment alone (control group). The end point was the time to discharge from the hospital. This study is registered with chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000030262. FINDINGS: A total of thirty-three eligible COVID-19 patients were enrolled from February 1, 2020 to April 6, 2020, eleven were assigned to the IFN- plus TFF2 group, and twenty-two to the control group. Safety and efficacy were evaluated for both groups. No treatment-associated severe adverse effects (SAE) were observed in the group treated with aerosol inhalation of IFN- plus TFF2, and no significant differences in the safety evaluations were observed between experimental and control groups. CT imaging was performed in all patients with the median improvement time of 5(.)0 days (IQR 3(.)0C9(.)0) in the experimental group versus 8(.)5 days (IQR 3(.)0C17(.)0) in the control group (p<0(.)05). In addition, the experimental group had a significant shorten median time in cough relief (4(.)5 days [IQR 2(.)0C7(.)0]) than the control group did (10(.)0 days [IQR 6(.)0C21(.)0])(p<0(.)005), in viral RNA reversion of 6(.)0 days (IQR 2(.)0C13(.)0) in the experimental group vs 9.5 days (IQR 3(.)0C23(.)0) in the control group (p < 0(.)05), and in the median hospitalization stays of 12(.)0 days (IQR 7.0C20.0) in the experimental group vs 15(.)0 days (IQR 10.0C25.0) in the control group (p<0(.)001), respectively.

METHOD: Demographics, comorbidities, and mortality data for HD patients who got infected with COVID-19 in Kuwait from 1/March/2020 to 31/July/2020 were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Kuwait population during that same period was 4,600,000 (63% Males and 37%Females). 3 Total number of HD patients was 2000 (representing only 0.04% of the total population with 52% Males and 48% Females). Total number of COVID-19 cases confirmed by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab was 66,957. Total number of infected HD patients was 141 (representing 7% of the total HD population and 0.2% of the total number of people infected with COVID-19 in Kuwait). All COVID-19 positive cases were treated for free in ministry of health hospitals Mean age for HD patients with COVID-19 was 57 (54 for males and 62 for males). DM was present in 70%, HTN in 95%, CV disease in 61%, respiratory illness in 20.5%, and ICU admission was required for 31 patients (22%), with 80% requiring intubation and assisted ventilation. Conventional HD was switched to CRRT in 61 patients (43%). Steroids were used for 23%, convalescent plasma in 1 patient, lopinavir/ritonavir in 7 patients, tocilizumab in 3 patients. Total number of mortality due to covid-19 infection in Kuwait was 447 (0.7% of the total cases). 4 Total mortality in HD population during that period for any reason was 100 (5% of the total HD population), however, total mortality due to COVID-19 infection was 30% of the total mortality in the HD population (and 7% of the total COVID-19 related mortality in the country). Patients who died were older with mean age of 63 vs 56 for survivors and had respiratory illness more frequently (27% vs 18%) and 60% were males.

This pandemic has affected every segment of the population with more recent hospitalizations in the pediatric population. Vertical transmission of COVID-19 is uncommon, but reports show that there are thrombotic, vascular, and inflammatory changes in the placenta to which neonates are prenatally exposed. Individuals exposed in utero to influenza during the 1918 pandemic had increased risk for heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, stomach disease and hypertension. Early exposure of COVID-19 during fetal life may lead to altered gene expression with potential long-term consequences. OBJECTIVE: To determine if gene expression is altered in cord blood cells from term neonates who were exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy and to identify potential gene pathways impacted by maternal COVID-19. METHODS: Cord blood was collected from 16 term neonates (8 exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy and 8 controls without exposure to COVID-19). Genome-wide gene expression screening was performed using Human Clariom S gene chips on total RNA extracted from cord blood cells. RESULTS: We identified 510 differentially expressed genes (374 genes up-regulated, 136 genes down-regulated, fold change 1.5, p-value  0.05) in cord blood cells associated with exposure to COVID-19 during pregnancy. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified important canonical pathways associated with diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hematological disease, embryonic cancer and cellular development. Tox functions related to cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were also altered after exposure to COVID-19 during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to COVID-19 during pregnancy induces differential gene expression in cord blood cells. The differentially expressed genes may potentially contribute to cardiac, hepatic, renal and immunological disorders in offspring exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy. These findings lead to a further understanding of the effects of COVID-19 exposure at an early stage of life and its potential long-term consequences as well as therapeutic targets.","output":"COVID-19 Infection During Pregnancy Induces Differential Gene Expression in Human Cord Blood Cells From Term Neonates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report describes a rapidly progressive loss of motor function in a 16-month-old male neutered Bengal cat, beginning in the pelvic limbs and progressing to involve all limbs and rendering the cat non-ambulatory.

The outbreak expanded rapidly in geographic scope and size, with a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed cases reported by 3 June 2013, in 10 Chinese provinces and Taiwan. The incidence of A/H7N9 cases has stalled in recent weeks, presumably as a consequence of live bird market closures in the most heavily affected areas. Here we compare the transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9 with that of other emerging pathogens and evaluate the impact of intervention measures in an effort to guide pandemic preparedness. METHODS: We used a Bayesian approach combined with a SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) transmission model fitted to daily case data to assess the reproduction number (R) of A/H7N9 by province and to evaluate the impact of live bird market closures in April and May 2013. Simulation studies helped quantify the performance of our approach in the context of an emerging pathogen, where human-to-human transmission is limited and most cases arise from spillover events. We also used alternative approaches to estimate R based on individual-level information on prior exposure and compared the transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9 with that of other recent zoonoses. RESULTS: Estimates of R for the A/H7N9 outbreak were below the epidemic threshold required for sustained human-to-human transmission and remained near 0.1 throughout the study period, with broad 95% credible intervals by the Bayesian method (0.01 to 0.49). The Bayesian estimation approach was dominated by the prior distribution, however, due to relatively little information contained in the case data. We observe a statistically significant deceleration in growth rate after 6 April 2013, which is consistent with a reduction in A/H7N9 transmission associated with the preemptive closure of live bird markets. Although confidence intervals are broad, the estimated transmission potential of A/H7N9 appears lower than that of recent zoonotic threats, including avian influenza A/H5N1, swine influenza H3N2sw and Nipah virus. CONCLUSION: Although uncertainty remains high in R estimates for H7N9 due to limited epidemiological information, all available evidence points to a low transmission potential. Continued monitoring of the transmission potential of A/H7N9 is critical in the coming months as intervention measures may be relaxed and seasonal factors could promote disease transmission in colder months.","output":"Transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9, February to May 2013, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Staphylococcal Bap proteins sense environmental signals (such as pH, [Ca2+ ]) to build amyloid scaffold biofilm matrices via unknown mechanisms.

The N-terminal lobe is sufficient to mediate amyloid aggregation through liquid-liquid phase separation and maturation, and subsequent biofilm formation under acidic conditions. Such processes are promoted by disordered MM at low [Ca2+ ] but inhibited by ordered MM stabilized by Ca2+ binding, with inhibition efficiency depending on structural integrity of the interaction networks.

We aimed at evaluating the proportion of patients with persisting respiratory symptoms and/or abnormalities in pulmonary function tests (PFT) or in lung imaging. STUDY DESIGN: and methods: This is a single center cohort study including COVID-19 survivors who underwent a three-month follow-up with clinical evaluation, PFT and lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). All clinical, functional, and radiological data were centrally reviewed. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with residual lesions on HRCT. RESULTS: Full clinical evaluation, PFT and lung HRCT were available for central review in 126, 122 and 107 patients, respectively. At follow-up, 25% of patients complained from dyspnea and 35% from fatigue, lung diffusion capacity (DLCO) was decreased in 45%, 17% had HRCT abnormalities affecting more than 5% of their lung parenchyma while signs of fibrosis were found in 21%. In multiple linear regression model, number of days in ICU were related to the extent of persisting lesions on HRCT, while intubation was associated with signs of fibrosis at follow-up (P = 0.0005, Fisher's exact test). In contrast, the severity of lung imaging or PFT changes were not predictive of fatigue and dyspnea.

As part of an ongoing study on adolescents sexual health, we used a large sample (NTime 1 = 1771;47.6% girls, Mage = 15.42 years, SD = 0.59) to examine changes from baseline (before the COVID-19 pandemic) to one year later (during the COVID-19 pandemic) in adolescents self-reported pornography use frequency, motivations, and PPU, using latent change models and examining potential gender differences. No significant changes were observed in adolescents pornography use frequency and pornography use motivations, and no gender differences were present in these trends. Although statistically significant, slight decrease was observed in boys PPU levels, and a statistically significant, slight increase was observed in girls PPU levels, these changes were very small, providing no practical or clinical relevance.

Once one stops trying to fix a market model that has stopped functioning, one is free to carry out research and development (R&D) in ways that are more openly collaborative, a mechanism that has been demonstrably effective for the R&D underpinning the response to the COVID pandemic. New open source research models have great potential for the development of medicines for areas of public health where the traditional profit-driven model struggles to deliver. New financial initiatives, including major push/pull incentives, aimed at fixing the broken antibiotics market provide one possible means for funding an openly collaborative approach to drug development. We argue that now is therefore the time to evaluate, at scale, whether such methods can deliver new medicines through to patients, in a timely manner.","output":"There is no market for new antibiotics: this allows an open approach to research and development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with COVID-19 may be at increased risk for secondary bacterial infections At our quaternary care hospital in New York City, the rapid escalation of COVID-19 cases was accompanied by a massive surge in the need for hospital and critical care capacity During this time, we noted a increase in infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) Methods: We retrospectively assessed microbiology data to identify patients with positive testing for SARS-CoV-2 who had clinical cultures with meropenem-resistant and/or carbapenemase gene-positive Enterobacterales We obtained microbiological and clinical data by manual chart review Available clinical isolates underwent long-range genomic sequencing using the MinION (Oxford) for rapid genotyping, resistance gene detection, and phylogenetic analysis Results: From March 1 to May 18, we identified 33 CPE isolates from 13 patients, including 29 Klebsiella pneumonia and four Enterobacter cloacae Most patients (11/13) had a positive respiratory culture, and 7/13 developed bacteremia All patients had prolonged, complex hospitalizations with extensive antibiotic exposure We performed long-range sequencing on 19 isolates from 12 patients 15/16 K pneumoniae isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 258 encoding KPC (14 KPC-2;1 KPC-3);one ST70 isolate encoded KPC-2 All four E cloacae isolates belonged to ST270 and encoded NDM-1 Phylogenetic analysis of ST258 isolates including historical isolates from our hospital revealed a distinct lineage of isolates from COVID-19 patients (72% bootstrap support), with expected clustering of isolates from the same patient and patients that were cohorted together Conclusion: While CPE have declined substantially in New York City in recent years, increased detection in patients with COVID-19 may signal a reemergence of these highly resistant pathogens in the wake of the global pandemic System-level factors, such as the rapid scale-up of critical care capacity, while clearly needed to address the unprecedented reach of COVID-19, may have contributed to isolate clustering in these patients Increased surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship efforts will be needed to mitigate the impact of CPE in the future","output":"Cluster of carbapenemase-producing enterobacterales secondary infections during the COVID-19 crisis at a New York City Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lipase-catalyzed esterification is an efficient technique in the production of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrates which are applied for nutrition and health purposes.

A subset of patients suffer serious consequences that require hospitalization and ventilator support. Current tests for SARS-CoV-2 generate qualitative results and are vital to make a diagnosis of the infection. However, they are not helpful to follow changes in viral loads after diagnosis. The ability to quantitatively assess viral levels is necessary to determine the effectiveness of therapy with anti-viral or immune agents. Viral load analysis is also necessary to determine the replicative potential of strains with different mutations, emergence of resistance to anti-viral agents and the stability of viral nucleic acid and degree of RT-PCR inhibition in different types of collection media. Quantitative viral load analysis in body fluids, plasma and tissue may be helpful to determine the effects of the infection in various organ systems. To address these needs, we developed two assays to quantitate SARS-CoV-2. The assays target either the S or E genes in the virus, produce comparable viral load results, are highly sensitive and specific and have a wide range of quantitation. We believe that these assays will be helpful to manage the clinical course of infected patients and may also help to better understand the biology of infection with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Development and validation of viral load assays to quantitate SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the presented work, an attempt to assess the correlation between the performance indicators of several sectors of the Russian economy and a set of restrictive measures taken by the Government of our country against the backdrop of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is made In addition, a comparative analysis of the impact of this pandemic on the neighboring countries of Russia, which, in the recent past, were part of the USSR and, therefore, have similar health care organization structures, is carried out","output":"To The Covid-19 Pandemic Experience: A View from Russia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the COVID-19 outbreak, many challenges are posed before the scientific world to curb this pandemic.

Poor academic performance has significant social and health consequences. Objective: To study academic achievement and attainment in children with sickle cell disease in the United States. Design: Medline, Embase, SCOPUS, CINAHL, ERIC, and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed articles. Studies of children (ages 5-18) diagnosed with sickle cell disease of any genotype reporting academic achievement (standardized tests of reading, math, and spelling) or attainment (grade retention or special education) outcomes were included. Outcomes were analyzed using a random effects model. Achievement scores were compared to within study controls or normative expectations. Prevalence of grade retention and special education services were compared to national (United States) estimates for Black students. Age at assessment and overall IQ were evaluated separately for association with reading and mathematics scores. Subgroup analyses of reading and math scores were analyzed by cerebral infarct status (no cerebrovascular accident, silent infarct, stroke). Results: There were 44 eligible studies. Students with sickle cell disease scored 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80 (p < 0.001) SD below normative expectations on measures of reading, mathematics, and spelling, respectively. Compared to unaffected sibling and/or healthy controls (k = 8, n = 508), reading and math scores were 0.40 (p = 0.017) and 0.36 (p = 0.033) SD below expectations. Grade retention was approximately 10 times higher in students with sickle cell disease than Black students nationally. Intellectual functioning explained 97.3 and 85.8% of the variance in reading and mathematics performance, respectively (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed significant differences in reading (p = 0.034) and mathematics (p < 0.001) based on infarct status, with lower performance associated with presence of a silent infarct or stroke. Conclusion: Students with sickle cell disease demonstrate notable academic difficulties and are at high risk for grade retainment.

Consequently, 7 field hospitals (FHs) were deployed in Lebanon. The purpose of this study is to explore the challenges that emergency medical teams (EMTs) faced and explain the gaps at the national level related to deploying a FH. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted. To collect the data, semi-structured interviews were done with 8 key informants (5 from the FHs, 2 from Lebanese Army Forces, and 1 from Ministry of Public Health). In this study, purposive sampling was used and data were analyzed using Braun and Clarke (2006) thematic analysis and MAXQDA software. RESULTS: Three major themes (logistical challenges, staff challenges, and coronavirus disease [COVID-19] pandemic) and 10 subthemes emerged for the challenges that EMTs faced. The gaps at the national level were categorized into 2 themes (absence of needs-based response and limited effective coordination between the host country and donor countries) and 5 sub-themes. CONCLUSION: Lebanon focuses on response rather than preparedness for disasters. EMTs that arrived didn't meet the medical needs. Hence, there is a need to strengthen the national capacities and to ensure better communication and coordination between the disaster-affected country and the EMTs.","output":"Challenges of Emergency Medical Teams and Deploying a Field Hospital in the Aftermath of the Beirut Blast: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic of COVID-19, Macau faces tremendous pressure because it is a famous gambling and tourism city with the worlds highest population density The Macau government implemented decisive public health intervention to control the transmission of COVID-19, and there were only two independent outbreaks in Macau In the second outbreak, all 35 cases were infected in foreign countries They were quarantined in airborne infection isolation rooms for at least 14 days with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests after hospital discharge Twelve (34 3%) of them had re-positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and none of them presented any COVID-19 signs or symptoms during the entire quarantine period In this study, the re-positive patients were more likely to be diagnosed in the early stage of the disease with a longer hospital stay Virus re-infection is impossible in this high standard isolation setting, and reactivation is also unlikely, so that residual virus nucleic acid should be the possible reason for this phenomenon Due to limited data about the risk of re-positive patients, it is better to quarantine patients after discharge for a prolonged period with repeat RT-PCR tests to minimize the communitys potential risk, particularly in the regions with relative plenty of resources and low community infection rate such as Macau","output":"Re-positive of SARS-CoV-2 test is common in COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge.

Negative RT-PCR testing associated with positive serology in most cases suggests a post-infectious syndrome. Because the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still poorly understood, extensive virological and immunological investigations are needed. METHODS: We report a series of four pediatric patients admitted to Geneva University Hospitals with persistent fever and laboratory evidence of inflammation meeting published definition of MIS-C related to COVID-19, to whom an extensive virological and immunological workup was performed. RESULTS: RT-PCRs on multiple anatomical compartments were negative whereas anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were strongly positive by ELISA and immunofluorescence. Both pseudo- and full virus neutralization assays showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in all children, confirming a recent infection with SARS-CoV-2. Analyses of cytokine profiles revealed an elevation in all cytokines, as reported in adults with severe COVID-19. Although differing in clinical presentation, some features of MIS-C show phenotypic overlap with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). In contrast to patients with primary HLH, our patients showed normal perforin expression and NK cell degranulation. The levels of soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) correlated with the severity of disease, reflecting recent T-cell activation. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MIS-C related to COVID-19 is caused by a post-infectious inflammatory syndrome associated with elevation in all cytokines, and markers of recent T-cell activation (sIL-2R) occurring despite a strong and specific humoral response to SARS-CoV2. Further functional and genetic analyses are essential to better understand the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions.","output":"Immunological assessment of pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome related to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cluver L, Lachman JM, Sherr L, et al.

The system is made up of a variety of proteins which function to deliver intracellular cargo to lysosomes for formation of autophagosomes in which the contents are degraded. The maintenance of cellular homeostasis is key in the survival and function of a variety of human cell populations. The interconnection between metabolism and autophagy is extensive, therefore it has a role in a variety of different cell functions. The disruption or dysfunction of autophagy in these cell types have been implicated in the development of a variety of inflammatory diseases including asthma. The role of autophagy in non-immune and immune cells both lead to the pathogenesis of lung inflammation. Autophagy in pulmonary non-immune cells leads to tissue remodeling which can develop into chronic asthma cases with long term effects. The role autophagy in the lymphoid and myeloid lineages in the pathology of asthma differ in their functions. Impaired autophagy in lymphoid populations have been shown, in general, to decrease inflammation in both asthma and inflammatory disease models. Many lymphoid cells rely on autophagy for effector function and maintained inflammation. In stark contrast, autophagy deficient antigen presenting cells have been shown to have an activated inflammasome. This is largely characterized by a TH17 response that is accompanied with a much worse prognosis including granulocyte mediated inflammation and steroid resistance. The cell specificity associated with changes in autophagic flux complicates its targeting for amelioration of asthmatic symptoms. Differing asthmatic phenotypes between TH2 and TH17 mediated disease may require different autophagic modulations. Therefore, treatments call for a more cell specific and personalized approach when looking at chronic asthma cases. Viral-induced lung inflammation, such as that caused by SARS-CoV-2, also may involve autophagic modulation leading to inflammation mediated by lung resident cells. In this review, we will be discussing the role of autophagy in non-immune cells, myeloid cells, and lymphoid cells for their implications into lung inflammation and asthma. Finally, we will discuss autophagy's role viral pathogenesis, immunometabolism, and asthma with insights into autophagic modulators for amelioration of lung inflammation.","output":"Role of Autophagy in Lung Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis with possible long-term impact of general cardio-vascular health. An endothelial glycocalyx disorder during the disease's acute phase might predispose to long-term vascular anomalies leading to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. To investigate any association between increased cardiovascular risk and endothelial glycocalyx, we assessed circulating glycocalyx components in patients with a KD history, and analysed their association with acute-phase clinical features and more importantly, with patients' current cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS This prospective observational cohort study included 51 subjects: 31 patients with a history of KD, and 20 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. We analysed serum syndecan-1 and hyaluronan via ELISA. We assessed features reported during the acute phase of KD such as blood counts, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and coronary artery aneurysms (CAA), and their current blood pressure and lipid markers in relation to measured glycocalyx components. RESULTS Our multivariate analysis revealed that hyaluronan and syndecan-1 levels were not associated with KD. However, the latter exhibited a significant association with acute-phase blood count alterations in patients with KD. Furthermore, significant interactions of hyaluronan and syndecan-1 with certain cardiovascular risk factors like blood lipids and blood pressure were only present in KD patients. CONCLUSION Vasculitis during KD's acute phase might predispose to a long-term endothelial glycocalyx alteration, influenced by other factors having a vascular impact such as blood pressure and circulating lipids.

Though active transportation through bicycling and walking can increase physical activity and thereby positively affect health, factors that influence people's decisions to commute using active transportation modes remain underexplored and often fail to capture equity-related barriers. Increases in active transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic call for a better understanding of these influences. This study examines the commute mode choices of essential workers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA to explore the extent to which active transportation to work is explained by individual, social, and environmental factors and whether active transportation choices reflect inequalities. Methods Drawing on the theory of planned behavior and the social-ecological model, this study utilizes data from an online survey (N = 213) completed between June and August 2020. Bivariate analyses compare respondents who commuted using active transportation modes to those who did not using chi-square and ANOVA tests. A series of logistic regression models using forward stepwise selection, controlling for demographic characteristics and commute distance, identify salient individual, social, and environmental factors associated with active transportation. Results Nearly half of respondents changed their commute mode during the pandemic, most often to limit exposure to COVID-19. The full model, accounting for 54% of variation in active transportation commuting, indicated significantly lower odds of active transportation use among non-white (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.155) respondents and those who reported time constraints (OR: 0.450), concerns about safety from traffic (OR: 0.482), and greater satisfaction with community support for bicycling and pedestrian issues (OR: 0.551) and significantly higher odds among those who reported safety concerns around germs (OR: 1.580).

Therefore, we compared the antiviral activities of three antiviral drugs which have been currently used in the clinic. In silico docking analyses and in vitro viral infection in Vero E6 cells were performed to delineate their antiviral effectivity when used alone or in combination. Both in silico and in vitro results suggest that the combinatorial treatment by favipiravir and umifenovir or camostat mesylate has more antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 rather than single drug treatment.

This retrospective study included patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 infection from August 20, to September 25, 2020. The initial study cohort included 127 patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. Of whom 26 patients were excluded, leaving 101 patients for final analysis. low lymphocytes % [Odds ratio and confidence intervals = OR (CI)] [0.2(0.0-0.2, p=0.03] increased the odds of ICU stay length while high platelet mean volume (PMV) [0.9 (1.1-5, p<0.00], high platelet distribution width (PDW) [0.3(0.4-1.9), p<0.00], and low lymphocytes % [0.2 (0.0-0.2), p=0.02] increased the odds of length of hospital stay. Decreased lymphocytes % showed significant independent association with increased risk for mechanical ventilation use [0.9 (0.9-1), p=0.04], extensive degree of lung injury [0.2 (0.1-0.7), p<0.00], and in-hospital death [0.5 (0.3-0.8), p=0.01].

We aimed to study antibiotic use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to influenza patients in two consecutive years. Furthermore, we investigated changes in antibiotic use from the first to second pandemic wave. METHODS This prospective study included both patients from two referral hospitals in Bergen, Norway, admitted with influenza (n = 215) during the 2018/2019 epidemic and with COVID-19 (n = 82) during spring/summer 2020, and national data on registered Norwegian COVID-19 hospital admissions from March 2020 to January 2021 (n = 2300). Patient characteristics were compared, and logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for antibiotic use. RESULTS National and local COVID-19 patients received significantly less antibiotics (53% and 49%) than influenza patients (69%, p < .001). Early antibiotics contributed to >90% of antibiotic prescriptions in the two local hospitals, and >70% of prescriptions nationally. When adjusted for age, comorbidities, symptom duration, chest X-ray infiltrates and oxygen treatment, local COVID-19 patients still had significantly lower odds of antibiotic prescription than influenza patients (aOR 0.21, 95%CI 0.09-0.50). At the national level, we observed a significant reduction in antibiotic prescription rates in the second pandemic wave compared to the first (aOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.29-0.43). CONCLUSION Fewer COVID-19 patients received antibiotics compared to influenza patients admitted to the two local hospitals one year earlier.

The advent of electron microscopy and molecular biology showed that diarrhea could also be caused by viruses, both in humans and in other animals.

This  reo-like virus  was subsequently identified as a rotavirus, and was shown only four years later to be responsible for severe diarrhea in young children. Noroviruses, and particularly the human virus Norwalk, were subsequently discovered, followed by coronavirus, sapovirus, pestivirus, astrovirus, enteric adenoviruses, torovirus, and picobirnavirus. Some of viruses found in animals, and particularly rotaviruses, can also infect humans. Rotaviruses have been identified in numerous animal species and are generally host-specific, but zoonotic transmission has been suggested by cross-infection (especially in experimental models), by genetic studies showing a close relationship between certain human and animal rotaviruses, and by the discovery of new animal genotypes during epidemiological surveillance of human rotaviroses.

Genomic signature-based identification techniques have the advantage of being precise, highly sensitive, and relatively fast in comparison to biochemical typing methods and protein signatures. Classic biochemical typing methods were developed long before knowledge of DNA and resulted in dozens of tests that are used to roughly characterize the major known pathogens. Genomic signatures can be intended for many different purposes and applied at multiple different resolutions. Organism signatures are intended to uniquely identify the organisms involved. Mechanism signatures can be best thought of as identifying particular genes that result in functional properties such as virulence, antibiotic resistance, or host range. The primary reason to identify mechanisms, independent of organisms, is to detect potential genetic engineering. A secondary reason is that nature has shared many important mechanisms on its own over the millennia, and thus they may not be sufficiently unique to identify specific organisms. Method signatures present yet another dimension of analyzing pathogens: evidence of potential bacterial genetic engineering may be seen in a genome by checking for traces of the bacterial vectors that may have been used to insert one or more foreign genes and related components into the genome being modified.","output":"Design of Genomic Signatures for Pathogen Identification and Characterization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Health care workers caring for Covid-19 patients go through mental stress, physical exertion, stigma from society and the fear of losing patients' and colleagues Aims and Objective: To evaluate frontline health care workers perspective about the society's behavior towards them Materials and Methods: This questionnaire-based study included a total of 648 participants and included 20 questions about demography, Covid duty, health related issues and behavioral aspect of society during Covid duty Behavioral related responses were scaled on the basis of response score Results: Suggested that the overall population behavior was satisfactory but behavioral biases were existent Major health issue of concern that surfaced during duties was stress Conclusion: Behavioral prejudices are existent due to the stigma attached to this pandemic and hence needs to be addressed with great concern Health related issues should be dealt promptly and psychological counseling should be made mandatory [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Asian Journal of Medical Sciences is the property of Manipal Colleges of Medical Sciences and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"A study to evaluate behavior of society with Covid-19 Frontline health workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose in life is associated with greater engagement in physical activity.

It is caused by a small RNA virus (PRRSV), which targets almost exclusively pig monocytes or macrophages. In the present study, five SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) libraries derived from 0 hour mock-infected and 6, 12, 16 and 24 hours PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) produced a total 643,255 sequenced tags with 91,807 unique tags. Differentially expressed (DE) tags were then detected using the Bayesian framework followed by gene/mRNA assignment, arbitrary selection and manual annotation, which determined 699 DE genes for reactome analysis. The DAVID, KEGG and REACTOME databases assigned 573 of the DE genes into six biological systems, 60 functional categories and 504 pathways. The six systems are: cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, metabolism, organismal systems and human diseases as defined by KEGG with modification. Self-organizing map (SOM) analysis further grouped these 699 DE genes into ten clusters, reflecting their expression trends along these five time points. Based on the number one functional category in each system, cell growth and death, transcription processes, signal transductions, energy metabolism, immune system and infectious diseases formed the major reactomes of PAMs responding to PRRSV infection. Our investigation also focused on dominant pathways that had at least 20 DE genes identified, multi-pathway genes that were involved in 10 or more pathways and exclusively-expressed genes that were included in one system. Overall, our present study reported a large set of DE genes, compiled a comprehensive coverage of pathways, and revealed system-based reactomes of PAMs infected with PRRSV. We believe that our reactome data provides new insight into molecular mechanisms involved in host genetic complexity of antiviral activities against PRRSV and lays a strong foundation for vaccine development to control PRRS incidence in pigs.","output":"Reactomes of Porcine Alveolar Macrophages Infected with Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare in England generates 24.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)e), equating to approximately 4% of the total national output of greenhouse gases (GHG), and of this, 10% is from the manufacturing of medical equipment.

In addition to accommodating new guidelines and policies, staff had to adjust to rapid reconfiguration of services external to the home that they would normally depend upon for support. This study examined the complex interdependencies of support as staff responded to COVID-19. The aim was to inform more effective responses to the ongoing pandemic, and to improve understanding of how to work with care home staff and organisations after the pandemic has passed. MethodsTen managers of registered care homes in the East Midlands of England were interviewed by videoconference or phone about their experiences of the crisis from a structured organisational perspective. Analysis used an adapted organisational framework analysis approach with a focus on social ties and interdependencies between organisations and individuals. ResultsThree key groups of interdependencies were identified: care processes and practice; resources; and governance. Care home staff had to deliver care in innovative ways, making high stakes decisions in circumstances defined by: fluid ties to organisations outside the care home; multiple, sometimes conflicting, sources of expertise and information; and a sense of deprioritisation by authorities. Organisational responses to the pandemic by central government resulted in resource constraints and additional work, and sometimes impaired the ability of staff and managers to make decisions. Local communities, including businesses, third-sector organisations and individuals, were key in helping care homes overcome challenges. Care homes, rather than competing, were found to work together to provide mutual support. Resilience in the system was a consequence of dedicated and resourceful staff using existing local networks, or forging new ones, to overcome barriers to care. ConclusionsThis study identified how interdependency between care home organisations, the surrounding community, and key statutory and non-statutory organisations beyond their locality, shaped decision making and care delivery during the pandemic. Recognising these interdependencies, and the expertise shown by care home managers and staff as they navigate them, is key to providing effective healthcare in care homes as the pandemic progresses, and as the sector recovers afterwards.","output":"Care homes, their communities, and resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic: interim findings from a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The traditional Indian healthcare system of Yoga contains a wealth of health-promotional practices-some of which are based on \\"humming.\\" \\"Humming\\" is produced when a wordless sound is forced to exit through the nose while keeping the mouth either fully closed or nearly closed; it is a low, prolonged, and buzzing sound.

Future models of buprenorphine treatment should incorporate telemedicine for buprenorphine initiation, which can be done in collaboration with community-based outreach and peer networks to engage people who use drugs. This regulatory change must be sustained beyond COVID-19, and is vital to increasing access to buprenorphine, closing the opioid use disorder treatment gap, and achieving greater health equity for people who use drugs.","output":"Telemedicine increases access to buprenorphine initiation during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aims: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-stranded single-stranded RNA virus, a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B) and responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 encompasses a large range of disease severity, from mild symptoms to severe forms with Intensive Care Unit admission and eventually death. The severe forms of COVID-19 are usually observed in high-risk patients, such as those with type two diabetes mellitus. Here, we review the available evidence linking acute and chronic hyperglycemia to COVID-19 outcomes, describing also the putative mediators of such interactions. Findings/Conclusions: Acute hyperglycemia at hospital admission represents a risk factor for poor COVID-19 prognosis in patients with and without diabetes. Acute and chronic glycemic control are both emerging as major determinants of vaccination efficacy, disease severity and mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. Mechanistically, it has been proposed that hyperglycemia might be a disease-modifier for COVID-19 through multiple mechanisms: (a) induction of glycation and oligomerization of ACE2, the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2; (b) increased expression of the serine protease TMPRSS2, responsible for S protein priming; (c) impairment of the function of innate and adaptive immunity despite the induction of higher pro-inflammatory responses, both local and systemic. Consistently, managing acute hyperglycemia through insulin infusion has been suggested to improve clinical outcomes, while implementing chronic glycemic control positively affects immune response following vaccination. Although more research is warranted to better disentangle the relationship between hyperglycemia and COVID-19, it might be worth considering glycemic control as a potential route to optimize disease prevention and management.","output":"Effect of Hyperglycemia on COVID-19 Outcomes: Vaccination Efficacy, Disease Severity, and Molecular Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With COVID-19, populations are facing unmet health needs due to fear of contagion, lockdown measures and overload of Healthcare services (HCS). The COCOS study aimed to investigate reduced healthcare access among Italian citizens, additionally looking for specific subgroups that will primarily need health services in the next future. A cross-sectional online survey was performed during the Italian lockdown between April and May 2020. Descriptive, univariable and multivariable (logistic regression models) analyses were performed: results are expressed as Odd Ratios and Adjusted Odd Ratios (ORs and AdjORs). Totally, 1,515 questionnaires were collected. Median age was 42 years (IQR 23), 65.6% were females. Around 21.8% declared to suffer from chronic diseases. About 32.4% faced a delay of a scheduled Medical Service (MS) by provider decision, 13.2% refused to access scheduled MS for the fear of contagion, and 6.5% avoided HCS even if having an acute onset issue. Alarmingly, 1.5% avoided Emergency Department when in need and 5.0% took medications without consulting any physician: patients suffering from chronic conditions resulted to be more prone to self-medication (AdjOR [95% CI]: 2.16 [1.16-4.02]). This study demonstrated that indirect effects of COVID-19 are significant.

The purpose of the study was to explore the associations between age, gender, and exercise facilities-type membership and physical activity levels during COVID-19 lockdown among users of exercise facilities from Spain. Participants were recruited among the members of 84 exercise facilities across Spain. Data was collected through an online questionnaire between 5th and 20th of April 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown. A total of 7062 participants met inclusion criteria and responded correctly to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Lower levels of total PA were found in women compared with men ( = ?26, 95%CI: ?40 to ?13), and among older adults ( = ?48, 95%CI: ?10 to ?85) compared with younger ones. Moreover, users of private facilities showed higher levels of PA ( = 40, 95%CI: 13 to 66) than those from low-cost and public facilities (reference). Lastly, women from private facilities showed greater levels of PA ( = 63, 95%CI: 29 to 96) than low cost and public's users, an increase higher than what was found in men ( = 7, 95%CI: ?38 to 52). Therefore, gender, age and the type of exercise facility's subscription had a relevant influence on PA levels during COVID-19 lockdown in an active population.

To identify positive strategies for midwifery education in this context, five case studies from the UK and beyond were conducted using an appreciative enquiry approach, from the perspectives of students, the maternity services, cross-university collaboration, and digital learning. A health system analysis was used to identify strategies to cope, adapt, and transform for the future, at the levels of individuals, teams, and the whole system. Findings showed that the implementation of effective responses was possible. Responding effectively and rapidly to a shock as profound as this pandemic requires courageous, respectful, evidence-based, innovative, collaborative, cross-sectoral working and leadership across education institutions, practice settings, the regulator, government, and with students themselves. Pre-existing trusting relationships and collaborative systems supported rapid responses. Effective digital learning requires a pro-active, student-centred approach, and addressing the problems of inequitable access to equipment and space. Joint problem-solving and focussing on the key outcomes that matter contribute to developing successful strategies and robust processes. The pandemic provides an opportunity for student midwives to be re-imagined as essential members of midwifery teams and not 'just students'. Transformative actions identified include whole-system working, tackling longstanding problems including racism, poverty, prejudice, and systemic discrimination, and keeping students at the heart of the education system.","output":"Sustaining quality education and practice learning in a pandemic and beyond: 'I have never learnt as much in my life, as quickly, ever'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One quarter of all mammal species are considered threatened with extinction (IUCN 2007).

Its mechanism of action remains unclear. We used network pharmacology and molecular docking technology to explore the potential material basis and mechanism of action of Chansu injection for COVID-19. METHODS: The main components of Chansu injection were determined using HPLC. The PharmMapper, SwissTargetPrediction, SEA, and TCMID databases were used to screen for the active ingredients and therapeutic targets of Chansu injection, while the OMIM and GeneCards Suite databases were used to search for COVID-19-related targets. The STRING database was used for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and topological analysis, while DAVID was used for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of the core targets. The main active compounds of Chansu injection were docked with 3CL protease, ACE2, RdRp, and spike protein. RESULTS: The three Chansu injection compounds were identified using HPLC. A total of 236 drug-related targets and 16,611 disease-related targets were identified, and 77 common targets were determined through mapping. The PPI mapping results revealed that 16 core targets were obtained through topological analysis and screening. Furthermore, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the PI3K and JAK-STAT signaling pathways are the major pathways. The molecular docking results suggest that the three Chansu injection components have high binding energies to the S protein.

The measurement of NO2 emission serves as the indicator for the emission of the group of nitrogen oxides (NOx). Approximately 56% of NO2 emissions in the US are from mobile sources, and the remainder is from stationary sources. Since 2002, clean air regulations have resulted in approximately 5% compound annual reduction of NOx emissions in the US (8.2% in the study area). Therefore, when studying the impact of sporadic events like an epidemic on emissions, it is necessary to account for the persistent reduction of emissions due to policy driven emission reduction measures. Using spaceborne sensors, ground monitors, National Emission Inventory data, and the US Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator, we quantified the reduction of total NOx emissions, distinguishing stationary sources from on-road mobile sources (trucks and automobiles). When considering total NOx emissions (stationary and mobile combined), we find that the pandemic restrictions resulted in 3.4% reduction of total NOx emissions in the study area in 2020. This is compared to (and in addition to) the expected 8.2% policy driven reduction of NOx emissions in 2020. This somewhat low reduction of emissions is because most stationary sources (factories, power plants, etc.) were operational during the pandemic. Truck traffic, a significant source of mobile emissions, also did not decline significantly (average 4.8% monthly truck traffic reduction in the study area between March and August 2020), as they were delivering goods during the lockdown. On the other hand, automobile traffic, responsible for 24% of total NOx emissions, dropped significantly, 52% in April, returning to near normal after 5 months. While the reduction of automobile traffic was significant, especially in the early months of the pandemic, its effect on emissions was relatively insignificant.","output":"Emissions of nitrogen dioxide in the northeast U.S. during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the literature on technology-facilitated sexual violence (TFSV).

This does not only imply possible problems with animal welfare, but it also causes economic losses to the farmer. The objective of this study was to evaluate time trends in on-farm dairy cow mortality in Sweden and identify potential herd-level risk factors. Data were retrieved on all Swedish dairy herds enrolled in the milk recording scheme between 2002 and 2010. Herds with a herd size of <20 cows or a mortality rate (MR) of >40 dead or euthanized cows per 100 cow-years were excluded. Two different models were used: 1 multiple-year analysis, which included 6,898 herds during the period 2002 to 2010 and 1 single-year analysis including 4,252 herds for the year 2010, where other variables that were not present during the entire multiple year study were analyzed. The outcome variable was the number of euthanized and dead cows per year and season. A negative binomial regression model, adjusted for clustering within herd, was applied to both models. Fixed effects in the multiple-year analysis were breed, calving interval, herd size, milk yield, region, season, pasture period, and year. The fixed effects in the single-year analysis were breed, calving interval, conventional versus organic farming, herd size, housing system, milk yield, region, and season. The results demonstrated that MR gradually increased from 5.1 to 6.6 events per 100 cow-years during the study period. Swedish MR are consequently on par with, or even greater than, MR among dairy herds in other comparable countries. Higher mortality was associated with larger herd size, longer calving intervals, and herds that had Swedish Holstein as the predominant breed. Lower mortality was observed in herds with a higher herd average milk yield, during the fall and winter, and in organically managed herds. There were regional differences in mortality. An interaction between herd size and season was found in both models. Also, an interaction between housing system and milk yield was found in the single-year analysis.

This study investigates the link between luxury goods advertising and expected utility from a biological perspective by looking at males hormonal responses to advertising of luxury versus non-luxury branded goods. Using traditional and consumer neuroscience methods, we collected salivary testosterone data pre- and post-ad viewing. Self-reported scores on social and quality value of the brands were compared to salivary testosterone levels from participants placed in different social conditions (Alone versus Together with another person). The results show that higher post-viewing testosterone levels were associated with higher scores on quality, but not on social value and only for branded goods viewed in the Together condition, compared to the Alone condition. These results suggest that changes in testosterone levels reflect a rewarding experience or activate social competitiveness when male consumers appraise the quality but not the social value of the advertised luxury goods and that social context modulates this effect.

In this publication, the use of Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2) for enhancing yield improvements, especially for heterocyclics is reported. The use of the 40 nm sized silica functionalized magnetite nanoparticles seems to help in both condensation and cyclization steps of representative 2-methyl-6-nitroquinoline. Reaction time reduction due to surface enabled catalysis of nanoparticles is 110 min to 80 min. The reaction yield has doubled due to the presence of catalyst and the mechanism suggests this drastic result is due to stabilization of unstable intermediate on the acidic surface of the silica coating.

Given this, occupant-centric control (OCC), which adapt building systems based on occupants presence or preferences, offer an alternative to traditional control that assumes full occupancy. However, poor sequences of operation can degrade the benefits of OCC. This paper explores this interaction by examining energy data from two buildings C one with two control logic faults corrected and an occupancy-based ventilation OCC implemented in 2020, and one with traditional ventilation C from 2019 to 2020. Sequences that impacted implementation in the first building are discussed. Then, a calibrated energy model of the second building is developed to evaluate how occupancy-based ventilation alongside changes to the sequences of operation C namely supply air temperature (SAT) reset and economizer high limits C impacted energy use. The inclusion of OCC and improved sequences in the second building saved 30.6% and 9.6% of annual heating and cooling energy, respectively. Without an SAT reset, OCC saved 4.4% and 3.9% of heating and cooling, respectively, compared to 15.7% and 5.7% when an SAT was present.

CRESS DNA viruses (phylum Cressdnaviricota) encompass several viral families including Circoviridae. Circoviruses are classified into two genera, Circovirus and Cyclovirus, and they are known to cause fatal diseases in birds and pigs. Circoviruses have also been identified in human stools, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as in various wild and domestic vertebrates, including reptiles. The synanthropic presence of Squamata reptiles has increased in the last century due to the anthropic pressure, which has shifted forested animal behavior to an urban and peri-urban adaptation. In this paper, we explored the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses in Squamata reptiles from different Italian areas representative of the Mediterranean basin. CRESS DNA viruses were detected in 31.7% (33/104) of sampled lizards and geckoes. Different CRESS DNA viruses likely reflected dietary composition or environmental contamination and included avian-like (n = 3), dog (n = 4), bat-like (n = 1), goat-like (n = 1), rodent-like (n = 4), and insect-like (n = 2) viruses. Rep sequences of at least two types of human-associated cycloviruses (CyV) were identified consistently, regardless of geographic location, namely, TN9-like (n = 11) and TN12-like (n = 6). A third human-associated CyV, TN25-like, was detected in a single sample. The complete genome of human-like CyVs, of a rodent-like, insect-like, and of a bat-like virus were generated. Collectively, the results recapitulate hosts dietary and environmental sources of exposure and may suggest unexpected ecological niches for some CRESS DNA viruses. IMPORTANCE CRESS DNA viruses are significant pathogens of birds and pigs and have been detected repeatedly in human samples (stools, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid), both from healthy individuals and from patients with neurological disease, eliciting in 2013 a risk assessment by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Sequences of CRESS DNA viruses previously reported in humans (TN9, TN12, and TN25), and detected in different animal species (e.g., birds, dogs, and bats) were herein detected in fecal samples of synanthropic squamates (geckos and lizards). The complete genome sequence of six viruses was generated. This study extends the information on the genetic diversity and ecology of CRESS DNA viruses. Because geckos and lizards are synanthropic animals, a role in sustaining CRESS DNA virus circulation and increasing viral pressure in the environment is postulated.","output":"Diversity of CRESS DNA Viruses in Squamates Recapitulates Hosts Dietary and Environmental Sources of Exposure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In the short-term, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has been shown to be effective for the treatment of the type 2 diabetes in patients with severe obesity. There are few data with greater follow-up. Our aim was to evaluate the results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on the control of type 2 diabetes in patients with severe obesity at 5 years at the University Hospital, France. METHODS From a total of 355 patients with severe obesity operated between January 2006 and June 2010, 52 (15%) had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes before undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. RESULTS There were 31 females (60%) and 21 males (40%), with a mean age of 51  10 years (range 27-67) with a mean body mass index of 48  10 kg/m2 (range 35-82). The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 10.8  10.8 years before bariatric operation. The preoperative glycated hemoglobin was 8  2% (range 5.9-12.8) in 45 patients; 17 patients (38%) had levels of glycated hemoglobin 9%. Three patients (6%) required insulin alone, 4 (8%) were taking oral antidiabetic medicine and insulin, and the remaining 45 patients (87%) were taking only oral antidiabetic medicines. The complete data regarding weight loss at 5-year follow-up were obtained for 46 patients, yielding an overall follow-up rate of 89%. The prolonged remission of type 2 diabetes achieved at 1 year that persisted at 5 years of follow-up was present in 9 patients (17%). No patient with complete remission of their type 2 diabetes required insulin preoperatively. Improvement of type 2 diabetes was observed in 30 patients (58%) at 1 year, which was maintained for 27 patients (52%) at 5-year follow-up. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has demonstrated a moderate efficacy in the treatment morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Markedly increased preoperative glycated hemoglobin levels, older age, and preoperative need for insulin treatment may be the factors predicting failure of complete remission of type 2 diabetes after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.","output":"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: Effect on long-term remission for morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes at 5-year follow up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"West Nile Virus (WNV), an emerging and re-emerging RNA virus, is the leading source of arboviral encephalitic morbidity and mortality in the United States. WNV infections are acutely controlled by innate immunity in peripheral tissues outside of the central nervous system (CNS) but WNV can evade the actions of interferon (IFN) to facilitate CNS invasion, causing encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and death. Recent studies indicate that STimulator of INterferon Gene (STING), canonically known for initiating a type I IFN production and innate immune response to cytosolic DNA, is required for host defense against neurotropic RNA viruses. We evaluated the role of STING in host defense to control WNV infection and pathology in a murine model of infection. When challenged with WNV, STING knock out (-/-) mice displayed increased morbidity and mortality compared to wild type (WT) mice. Virologic analysis and assessment of STING activation revealed that STING signaling was not required for control of WNV in the spleen nor was WNV sufficient to mediate canonical STING activation in vitro. However, STING-/- mice exhibited a clear trend of increased viral load and virus dissemination in the CNS. We found that STING-/- mice exhibited increased and prolonged neurological signs compared to WT mice. Pathological examination revealed increased lesions, mononuclear cellular infiltration and neuronal death in the CNS of STING-/- mice, with sustained pathology after viral clearance. We found that STING was required in bone marrow derived macrophages for early control of WNV replication and innate immune activation. In vivo, STING-/- mice developed an aberrant T cell response in both the spleen and brain during WNV infection that linked with increased and sustained CNS pathology compared to WT mice. Our findings demonstrate that STING plays a critical role in immune programming for the control of neurotropic WNV infection and CNS disease.","output":"STING is required for host defense against neuropathological West Nile virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased focus on pathogenic microbes that cross the animal-human species barrier, calls to include non-pathogenic interactions in our perspective on public health are gaining traction in the academic community. Over generations, the diversity of the human gut microbiota is being challenged by external perturbations and reduced acquisition of symbiotic species throughout life. When such reduced diversity concerns not only the microbial species, but also the higher taxonomic levels and even the guild level, adequate compensation for possible losses may be lacking. Shifts from a high-abundance to a low-abundance state, known as a tipping point, may result in simultaneous shifts in covarying taxa and ultimately to a catastrophic collapse in which the ecosystem abruptly and possibly irreversibly shifts to an alternative state. Here, we propose that co-occurrence patterns within and between microbial communities across human, animal, soil, water, and other environmental domains should be studied in light of such critical transitions. Improved mechanistic understanding of factors that shape structure and function is needed to understand whether interventions can sustainably remodel disease-prone microbiota compositions to robust and resilient healthy microbiota. Prerequisites for a rational approach are a better understanding of the microbial interaction network, both within and inter-domain, as well as the identification of early warning signs for a catastrophic collapse, warranting a timely response for intervention. We should not forget that mutualism and pathogenicity are two sides of the same coin.

Method: Using real-time data from three state-based suicide registers, we ran multiple unadjusted and adjusted interrupted time series analyses to see if trends in monthly suicide counts changed after the pandemic began and whether there had been an increase in suicides where relationship breakdown, financial stressors, unemployment and homelessness were recorded. Results: Compared with the period before COVID-19, during the COVID-19 period there was no change in the number of suicides overall, or in any stratum-specific estimates except one. The exception was an increase in the number of young males who died by suicide in the COVID-19 period (adjusted RR 1.89 [95% CI 1.11C3.23]). The unadjusted analysis showed significant differences in suicide in the context of unemployment and relationship breakdown during the COVID-19 compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Analysis showed an increase in the number of suicides occurring in the context of unemployment in the COVID-19 period (unadjusted RR 1.53 [95% CI 1.18C1.96]). In contrast, there was a decrease in the number of suicides occurring in the context of relationship breakdown in the COVID-19 period (unadjusted RR 0.82 [95% CI 0.67C0.99]). However, no significant changes were identified when the models were adjusted for possible over-dispersion, seasonality and non-linear trend. Conclusion: Although our analysis found no evidence of an overall increase in suicides after the pandemic began, the picture is complex. The identified increase in suicide in young men indicates that the impact of the pandemic is likely unevenly distributed across populations.

Point-of-care ultrasound is without patient or staff exposure to ionizing radiation and enlists no additional staffing resources or patient transfer. METHODS We conducted a chart review of all children who underwent reduction of a distal forearm fracture in the pediatric emergency department over a 2-year period, from September 2018 to September 2020. We compared length of stay (LOS) with that for orthopedist-performed distal forearm reductions during the study period. We allowed a 6-week lag period to ensure no missed rereduction before analyzing the data. After reduction, children were instructed to follow up with an orthopedist within 1 week. Children with loss of reduction on orthopedic follow-up are referred back through our emergency department for operative reduction. RESULTS A total of 74 children with 75 distal forearm fractures were identified. Average LOS was 179 minutes for the pediatric emergency medicine physician reductions and 215 minutes for the orthopedist reductions (P < 0.001). Ninety-six percent of reductions were completed with POCUS assistance, and 61% had less than 5 degrees of angulation on postreduction radiography. Only 2.7% of children underwent rereduction. CONCLUSIONS Distal forearm fracture reductions by a pediatric emergency medicine physician under POCUS guidance have a high rate of excellent alignment, low rate of failed reduction, and significantly shorter LOS (P < 0.001) than reductions performed by orthopedists.","output":"Ultrasound-Guided Distal Forearm Fracture Reduction by Pediatric Emergency Physicians: A Single Center Retrospective Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reducing negative impacts of stress, for example through mindfulness training, benefits physical and psychological well-being and is becoming ever more crucial owing to large-scale societal uncertainties (e.g., COVID-19). Whereas extensive research has focused on mindfulness-related reductions in self-reported negativity, essentially no research has targeted task-based behavioral outcomes throughout long-term mindfulness trainings. Responses to emotionally ambiguous signals (e.g., surprised expressions), which might be appraised as either positive or negative, provide a nuanced assessment of one's emotional bias across diverse contexts, offering unique leverage for assessing the effects of mindfulness. Here, we compared the effects of short- and long-term training via Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on ratings of faces with a relatively clear (angry, happy) and ambiguous (surprised) valence. Ratings became more positive for ambiguity from the start (Week 1) to end of training (Week 8; p < .001), but there were no short-term effects (from a single class session). This shift toward positivity continued through an additional 8-week follow-up (Week 16; p < .001). Notably, posttraining valence bias (Week 8) was uniquely predicted by the nonreactivity facet of mindfulness (p = .01). Together, mindfulness promotes a relatively long-lasting shift toward positivity bias, which is uniquely supported by reduced emotional reactivity.

We have developed a novel bioluminescence-based biosensor to probe a key host-virus interaction during viral entry: the binding of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) protein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Derived from Nanoluciferase binary technology (NanoBiT), the biosensor is composed of Nanoluciferase split into two complementary subunits, Large BiT and Small BiT, fused to the Spike S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 ectodomain, respectively. The ACE2-S1 interaction results in reassembly of functional Nanoluciferase, which catalyzes a bioluminescent reaction that can be assayed in a highly sensitive and specific manner. We demonstrate the biosensor's large dynamic range, enhanced thermostability and pH tolerance. In addition, we show the biosensor's versatility towards the high-throughput screening of drugs which disrupt the ACE2-S1 interaction, as well as its ability to act as a surrogate virus neutralization assay. Results obtained with our biosensor correlate well with those obtained with a Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus assay.

There is need for tools to estimate the relative transmissibility of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 with respect to circulating strains. AIM: We aimed to assess the prevalence of co-circulating VOC in Italy and estimate their relative transmissibility. METHODS: We conducted two genomic surveillance surveys on 18 February and 18 March 2021 across the whole Italian territory covering 3,243 clinical samples and developed a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of co-circulating strains. RESULTS: The Alpha variant was already dominant on 18 February in a majority of regions/autonomous provinces (national prevalence: 54%) and almost completely replaced historical lineages by 18 March (dominant across Italy, national prevalence: 86%). We found a substantial proportion of the Gamma variant on 18 February, almost exclusively in central Italy (prevalence: 19%), which remained similar on 18 March. Nationally, the mean relative transmissibility of Alpha ranged at 1.55C1.57 times the level of historical lineages (95% CrI: 1.45C1.66). The relative transmissibility of Gamma varied according to the assumed degree of cross-protection from infection with other lineages and ranged from 1.12 (95% CrI: 1.03C1.23) with complete immune evasion to 1.39 (95% CrI: 1.26C1.56) for complete cross-protection. CONCLUSION: We assessed the relative advantage of competing viral strains, using a mathematical model assuming different degrees of cross-protection. We found substantial co-circulation of Alpha and Gamma in Italy.

BACKGROUND: Decision fatigue may impair nurses ability to make sound clinical decisions and negatively impact patient care. Given the negative impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on psychological well\\\\being and the workplace environment, decision fatigue may be even more apparent among clinical nurses. Valid assessment of this condition among clinical nurses may inform supportive interventions to mitigate the negative sequelae associated with states of decision fatigue. DESIGN: This study was a secondary analysis of a parent study using a cross\\\\sectional descriptive design. METHODS: A convenience sample of 160 staff nurses was recruited online from across the United States. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire and subjective measures of decision fatigue, nursing practice environment scale and traumatic stress. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), correlation coefficients and internal consistency reliability coefficients were computed to examine the DFSs validity and reliability within this sample. RESULTS: The EFA yielded a single factor, 9\\\\item version of the DFS. The DFS scores were strongly correlated with traumatic stress and moderately correlated with the nursing practice environment, and the scale displayed appropriate internal consistency. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known study to provide evidence of the DFSs validity and reliability in a sample of registered nurses working during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. The results of this study provide evidence of a reliable and valid assessment instrument for decision fatigue that can be used to measure the burden of decision\\\\making among registered nurses.

Doing this early would save millions of lives and help countries keep a stable economy. The easiest way to control the spread of a virus is to immediately inform the individuals who recently had close contact with the diagnosed patients. However, to achieve this, a centralized authority (e.g., a health authority) needs detailed location information from both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients. Thus, such an approach, although beneficial to control the spread of a virus, results in serious privacy concerns, and hence privacy-preserving solutions are required to solve this problem. Previous works on this topic either (i) compromise privacy (especially privacy of diagnosed patients) to have better efficiency or (ii) provide unscalable solutions. In this work, we propose a technique based on private set intersection between physical contact histories of individuals (that are recorded using smart phones) and a centralized database (run by a health authority) that keeps the identities of the positive diagnosed patients for the disease. Proposed solution protects the location privacy of both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients and it guarantees that the identities of the diagnosed patients remain hidden from other individuals. Notably, proposed scheme allows individuals to receive warning messages indicating their previous contacts with a positive diagnosed patient. Such warning messages will help them realize the risk and isolate themselves from other people. We make sure that the warning messages are only observed by the corresponding individuals and not by the health authority. We also implement the proposed scheme and show its efficiency and scalability via simulations.","output":"Tracking and Controlling the Spread of a Virus in a Privacy-Preserving Way"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) has been implicated as a putative risk factor in severe Covid-19 based on high incidences of advanced AGA in male hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Research further suggests that androgen signaling, which plays a central role in AGA etiology, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection and is associated with severe Covid-19 symptoms in men. We aimed to systematically investigate a potential association between AGA and Covid-19 both on an epidemiological and a genetic level in a large single-population cohort. To this end, we performed regression, genetic correlation and polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses using data from the UK Biobank and published GWAS data on AGA and Covid-19. Our analyses did not reveal any significant epidemiological association between AGA and severe Covid-19. Detailed examination of the data that led to the previous reports of an epidemiological association between both traits suggests that this is a spurious finding and the result of ascertainment biases. Similarly, genome-wide correlation analyses and association testing for severe Covid-19 and AGA PRS yielded no evidence for a general shared genetic component between both traits. Subsequent association testing for pathway-based AGA PRS and Covid-19 severity however revealed a significant association in specific pathways, namely vitamin metabolism (pFDR=0.02), natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (pFDR=0.02) and WNT signaling (pFDR=0.02) in men as well as aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling (pFDR=0.02) in women.

METHODS: PubMed and Google were searched for studies that reported on cardiac arrhythmias and/or examined the relationship between arrhythmias and adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty studies with 12,713 participants were included in the systematic review, and 28 studies (n = 12,499) in the meta-analysis. The mean age was 61.3  16.8 years; 39.3% were female. In 25 studies with 7578 patients, the overall prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias was 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4%-12.3%). The most common arrhythmias documented during hospitalization were supraventricular arrhythmias (6.2%, 95% CI: 4.4%-8.1%) followed by ventricular arrhythmias (2.5%, 95% CI: 1.8%-3.1%). The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was higher among critically ill patients (relative risk [RR]: 12.1, 95% CI: 8.5-17.3) and among non-survivors (RR: 3.8, 95%, CI: 1.7-8.7).

As the current main driver, {delta} variant bears little resemblance to the other three variants of concern, raising the question what features future variants of concern may possess. To address this important question, I compared different variant genomes and specifically analyzed {delta} genomes in the GISAID database for potential clues. The analysis revealed that {delta} genomes identified in India by April 2021 form four different groups (referred to as {delta}1, {delta}2, {delta}3 and {delta}4) with signature spike, nucleocapsid and NSP3 substitutions defining each group. Since May 2021, {delta}1 has gradually overtaken all other subvariants and become the dominant pandemic driver, whereas {delta}2 has played a less prominent role and the remaining two ({delta}3 and {delta}4) are insignificant. This group composition and variant transition are also apparent across Europe. In the United Kingdom, {delta}1 has quickly become predominant and is the sole pandemic driver underlying the current wave of COVID-19 cases. Alarmingly, {delta}1 subvariant has evolved further in the country and yielded a sublineage encoding spike V36F, A222V and V1264L. These substitutions may make the sublineage more virulent than {delta}1 itself. In the rest of Europe, {delta}1 is also the main pandemic driver, but {delta}2 still plays a role. In many European countries, there is a {delta}1 sublineage encoding spike T29A, T250I and Q613H. This sublineage originated from Morocco and has been a key pandemic driver there. Therefore, {delta} variant drives the pandemic in India and across Europe mainly through {delta}1 and {delta}2, with the former acquiring additional substitutions and yielding sublineages with the potential to drive the pandemic further.

Control of the COVID-19 epidemic has become a crucial issue around the globe, but there are limited studies that investigate the global trend of the COVID-19 pandemic together with each countrys policy measures. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop an online artificial intelligence (AI) system to analyze the dynamic trend of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate forecasting and predictive modeling, and produce a heat map visualization of policy measures in 171 countries. METHODS: The COVID-19 Pandemic AI System (CPAIS) integrated two data sets: the data set from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from the Blavatnik School of Government, which is maintained by the University of Oxford, and the data set from the COVID-19 Data Repository, which was established by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. This study utilized four statistical and deep learning techniques for forecasting: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural network (FNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM). With regard to 1-year records (ie, whole time series data), records from the last 14 days served as the validation set to evaluate the performance of the forecast, whereas earlier records served as the training set. RESULTS: A total of 171 countries that featured in both databases were included in the online system. The CPAIS was developed to explore variations, trends, and forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic across several counties. For instance, the number of confirmed monthly cases in the United States reached a local peak in July 2020 and another peak of 6,368,591 in December 2020. A dynamic heat map with policy measures depicts changes in COVID-19 measures for each country. A total of 19 measures were embedded within the three sections presented on the website, and only 4 of the 19 measures were continuous measures related to financial support or investment. Deep learning models were used to enable COVID-19 forecasting; the performances of ARIMA, FNN, and the MLP neural network were not stable because their forecast accuracy was only better than LSTM for a few countries. LSTM demonstrated the best forecast accuracy for Canada, as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 2272.551, 1501.248, and 0.2723075, respectively. ARIMA (RMSE=317.53169; MAPE=0.4641688) and FNN (RMSE=181.29894; MAPE=0.2708482) demonstrated better performance for South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: The CPAIS collects and summarizes information about the COVID-19 pandemic and offers data visualization and deep learningbased prediction. It might be a useful reference for predicting a serious outbreak or epidemic. Moreover, the system undergoes daily updates and includes the latest information on vaccination, which may change the dynamics of the pandemic.","output":"A COVID-19 Pandemic Artificial IntelligenceBased System With Deep Learning Forecasting and Automatic Statistical Data Acquisition: Development and Implementation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aims to provide an overview of the emerging AgeTech sector and highlight key areas for research and development that have emerged under COVID-19, as well as some of the challenges to real-world implementation Design/methodology/approach The paper is a commentary on emerging issues in the AgeTech sector, with particular reference to COVID-19 Information used in this paper is drawn from the Canadian AGE-WELL network Findings The COVID-19 pandemic has particularly impacted older adults Technology has increasingly been seen as a solution to support older adults during this time AgeTech refers to the use of existing and emerging advanced technologies, such as digital media, information and communication technologies (ICTs), mobile technologies, wearables and smart home systems, to help keep older adults connected and to deliver health and community services Research limitations/implications Despite the potential of AgeTech, key challenges remain such as structural barriers to larger-scale implementation, the need to focus on quality of service rather than crisis management and addressing the digital divide Practical implications AgeTech helps older adults to stay healthy and active, increases their safety and security, supports independent living and reduces isolation In particular, technology can support older adults and caregivers in their own homes and communities and meet the desire of most older adults to age in place Social implications AgeTech is helpful in assisting older adults to stay connected The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of the informal social connections and supports within families, communities and voluntary organizations Originality/value The last months have seen a huge upsurge in COVID-19-related research and development, as funding organizations, research institutions and companies pivot to meet the challenges thrown up by the pandemic This paper looks at the potential role of technology to support older adults and caregivers","output":"COVID-19 and AgeTech"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Health care workers (HCWs) have been engaged in fighting dangerous epidemics for hundreds of years, more recently in severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and now coronavirus disease 2019.

PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched in March 2020 using terms \\"Healthcare\\" OR \\"Medical\\" AND \\"Staff\\" OR \\"Workers\\" OR \\"Front line\\" AND \\"Concerns\\" OR \\"Anxiety\\" OR \\"Stress\\" AND \\"Pandemic\\" Or \\"Epidemic.\\" RESULTS Twenty-five studies that reported the concerns and expectations of an estimated 13,793 HCWs in 10 countries (Canada, China, Greece, Hong Kong, Japan, Liberia, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Taiwan) during pandemic situations were identified. Health care workers identified personal and family safety, appreciation, and the provision of personal protective equipment and adequate rest as primary concerns. Informal psychological supports were favored over formal employment-based group interventions. DISCUSSION Despite being hailed by the media as heroes, HCWs face social stigmatization and experienced high levels of anxiety and fear regarding personal safety and the health of their colleagues and family. Health care workers are more likely to seek peer-to-peer psychological support but also benefit from knowing that formal psychological supports are available to them.","output":"What Can We Learn From the Past?

This research was conducted in a pandemic hospital which is among the largest hospital complexes in Turkey. Internal medicine physicians actively working in many departments under the severe conditions in the diagnosis and treatment processes were included. Among the physicians constituting the study population, residents, attendings, and subspecialists from different fields were included. These physicians were working in the quarantine services, inpatient services, intensive care units, and polyclinics. A short and easy face-to-face survey, in which included questions on demographic information, medicolegal subjects, and questions from the Maslach Burnout Inventory, was used to collect data. While 58.2% of the physicians stated that they were extremely worried about malpractice in the pandemic period, 82.1% stated they needed training on medicolegal subjects, and 25.4% stated they were exposed to violence during work. Three sub-dimensions within the burnout inventory were compared with other parameters. The Cronbach alpha value was found highly reliable in the evaluation of the answers' internal consistency. The notable significance of burnout was interesting regarding physicians' anxiety on medicolegal issues and exposure to violence (p < 0.05). The findings obtained in this study suggest that healthcare workers' motivations will increase if they feel valued, their working conditions have been improved, and if they are in mentally well. This mental wellness may contribute to fighting public health crises such as a pandemic more efficiently with the lowest number of casualties.","output":"Burnout among physicians working in a pandemic hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has recently become one of the most challenging pandemics of the last century with deadly outcomes and a high rate of reproduction number.

In recent years, there have been an increasing number of studies utilizing warm needle acupuncture (WNA) for the treatment of TMD, and the quality of the studies has gradually improved. However, evidence from evidence-based medicine is lacking. This study aims to use a systematic review and meta-analysis method to understand the efficacy of WNA for the treatment of TMD. Methods and Analysis. We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of WNA for the treatment of TMD from 9 electronic databases, including 5 English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MEDLINE) and 4 Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese VIP Information, Wanfang Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)) from their inception to May 2021. The included RCTs compared WNA with acupuncture, electroacupuncture, pharmacological therapy, or other therapies. And outcome indicators such as total effective rate and cure rate were assessed. All analyses were conducted using RevMan software V5.3 and Stata16. Measurement count data used the relative risk (RR) as the efficacy statistic, and each effect size was given its point estimate value and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results The meta-analysis included 10 studies with a total of 670 patients, which included 340 patients in the experimental group and 330 patients in the control group. The data in this review showed that WNA is superior to treatments such as acupuncture alone, acupuncture therapy combined with TDP, drug therapy, and ultrasonic therapy in terms of effective rate (RR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.35; and P = 0.003) and cure rate (RR = 1.82; 95% CI, 1.46 to 2.28; and P < 0.00001) for the treatment of TMD. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis provides new evidence for the effectiveness of WNA for the treatment of TMD. However, the above conclusions need to be further verified by multicenter prospective studies of larger samples and higher-quality RCTs.

Various trends and clusters were observed and analysed by fitting linear mixed models and time series clustering. The association of co-morbidities and other variables were studied by fitting a spatial panel data linear model (SPLM). On average, the greatest risks were observed in Baja California Norte, Chiapas and Sonora, while some other densely populated states, e.g., Mexico City, had lower values. The trends varied by state and a four-order polynomial, including fixed and random effects, was necessary to model them. The most common risk development was observed in states belonging to two clusters and consisted of an initial increase followed by a decrease. Some states presented cluster configurations with a retarded risk increase before the decrease, while the risk increased throughout the time of study in others. A cyclic behaviour with a second increasing trend was also observed in some states. The SPLM approach revealed a positive significant association with respect to case fatality risk between certain groups, such as males and individuals aged 50 years and more, and the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, asthma and hypertension.

Force plate (IBS) signals were captured simultaneously during bipedal stance with eyes open. Load proportion of the left and right sides as well as heel and forefoot were calculated via four independent pressure transducers. Overall, weight distribution (WD) indices are reported with higher results representing a poorer WD. RESULTS Analyses of WD showed large differences between groups (PwH: 10.2 [5.4], Con: 5.2 [2.9], P < 0.001, d = 1.15).

Neurosarcoidosis can present with or without systemic disease and can present with mass effect, endocrinopathies, and neuropathic symptoms. We report on an unusual case of neurosarcoidosis involving a pituitary adenoma. Case report: A 45-year-old African American man presented to ophthalmology clinic with a chief complaint of worsening field of vision. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 3.8-cm macroadenoma containing cystic and calcified components with optic chiasm compression, near-complete opacification of the maxillary sinuses, and mucosal thickening in the frontal sinuses. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, follow-up was delayed for 4 months while the vision loss progressed to near blindness in his right eye. After thorough evaluation, the patient was found to have near-complete right sided blindness, diffuse lymphadenopathy. After interdisciplinary discussions surgery was recommended. The patient underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary tumor and concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery. During the approach sinus mucosa was grossly inflamed. Frozen section of the sinus mucosa revealed granulomatous disease. The suprasellar mass had both soft contents which could be suctioned and fibrotic tumor with dense septations. Final pathology showed a pituitary adenoma with non-necrotizing granulomas within in the pituitary adenoma. Post-operatively, the patient was started on steroids and reported gradual improvement in his visual fields. At 3-months post-operative, MRI showed significant reduction in macroadenoma with a 1.5 cm residual tumor remaining in the sella and a decompressed optic chiasm which retracted inferiorly without any evidence of other intercranial anomalies. Literature review: Sarcoidosis occurs mostly in African Americans and Northern European women in their 3rd and 4th decades and can affect any part of the body such as the lymphatic systems, skin, lungs, and liver. Sarcoidosis is estimated to be prevalent in up to 80 per 100,000 people. CNS involvement occurs in 5 to 15% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis and can present with cranial neuropathy such as 7th nerve palsy, anticonvulsant refractory seizures, visual changes, and headaches. Pituitary involvement occurs 0.5% of patients with sarcoidosis and can present with endocrine and water metabolism dysfunction while sinonasal sarcoidosis can occur in up to 4%. Sinonasal sarcoidosis most usually presents as chronic crusting rhinitis, nasal obstruction, anosmia, and epistaxis and can show clinically as mucosal hypertrophy and external nose deformity in ~10% of these patients. Discussion and Conclusion: Symptomatic pituitary mass as the initial presentation of sarcoidosis is extremely rare. This case of primary neurosarcoidosis is unusual with its initial presentation mimicking non-functional pituitary macroadenoma with optic chiasm compression and associated vision loss. Primary presentation of neurosarcoidosis as a pituitary mass is rare but should be included in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with a combination of a macroadenoma, chronic sinusitis, and lymphadenopathy.","output":"Primary Presentation of Neurosarcoidosis as a Pituitary Mass with Sinonasal Involvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this issue of Cell, three studies confirm that SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strongly evades a key immune defenseneutralizing antibodies.

Polyclonal neutralizing antibodies offers many advantages such as providing immediate immunity, consequently blunting an early pro-inflammatory pathogenic endogenous antibody response and lack of drug-drug interactions. By providing immediate immunity and inhibiting entry into cells, neutralizing antibody treatment is of interest for patient with COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia. Convalescent plasma to treat infected patients is therefore a relevant therapeutic option currently under assessment (CORIMUNO-PLASM NCT04324047). However, the difficulties of collecting plasma on the long term are not adapted to a broad use across all populations. New polyclonal humanized anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (XAV-19) developed by Xenothera and administered intravenous. XAV-19 is a heterologous swine glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody (GH-pAb) raised against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, blocking infection of ACE-2-positive human cells with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in preclinical models including primates. A first human study with another fully representative GH-pAb from Xenothera is ongoing in recipients of a kidney graft. These studies indicated that 5 consecutive administrations of GH-pAbs can be safely performed in humans. The objectives of this 2-step phase 2 randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled study are to define the safety and the optimal XAV-19 dose to administrate to patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced moderate pneumonia, and to assess the clinical benefits of a selected dose of XAV-19 in this population. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the clinical benefits of XAV-19 when administered to patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced moderate pneumonia. As a prerequisite, a first step of the study will define the safety and the dose of XAV-19 to be used. Such treatment might become a new therapeutic option to provide an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients (possibly in combination with anti-viral and immunotherapies). Further studies could later evaluate such passive immunotherapy as a potential post-exposure prophylaxis.

We found: 1) Clinicians continued providing the same types of support services for family caregivers before and after COVID, with over 50% of providers interacting with caregivers daily or multiple times per week. The most prevalent services were caregiver needs assessments, information and referrals, and assistance with accessing services. Two-thirds reported continuing to offer caregiver skills training and counseling, including peer support groups. 2) Caregiver support modality changed, most frequently through the combined use of phone and video, followed by only phone, and rarely, by only video. 3) Providers indicated that phone, more than video, increased to replace in-person interactions, because of multiple factors: caregivers (who continued to call for support on an as-needed basis but declined video encounters), providers (who began to provide group support via phone), and service factors (ad hoc versus scheduled encounters). Results suggest clinicians continued providing caregiver support despite suspension of in-person interactions, but future research is needed to assess the impacts of caregiver support delivery mostly by phone and factors underlying the limited use of video in delivering caregiver support.","output":"Dementia care providers delivery of family caregiver support during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding mechanism commonly used by RNA viruses to express two or more proteins from a single mRNA at a fixed ratio.

Objectives: To examine the associations between all-cause mortality and daily PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 in the pandemic period, and compare them to the normal periods (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily data regarding all-cause (stratified by age and gender), and PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-cross design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between PM and all-cause mortality during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak (March to May in 2020) and the same months in 2015-2019. We also compared the counts and fractions of death attributable to PM in two periods. Results: Overall, Italy saw an increase in daily death counts while slight decreases in PM concentrations in 2020 pandemic period compared to same months of 2015-2019. Mortality effects were significant in lag 0-3 days for PM2.5, lag 0-2 for PM10, and lag 0-1 for PM2.5-10. Each 10 g/m3 increase in PM was associated much higher increase in daily all-cause mortality during 2020 pandemic period compared to the same months during 2015-2019 [increased mortality rate: 7.24 % (95%CI: 4.84%, 9.70%) versus 1.69% (95%CI: 1.12%, 2.25%) for PM2.5; 3.45 % (95%C: 2.58%, 4.34%) versus 1.11% (95%CI: 0.79%, 1.42%) for PM10, 4.25% (95%CI: 2.99%, 5.52%) versus 1.76% (95%CI: 1.14%, 2.38%) for PM2.5-10]. The counts and fractions of deaths attributable to PM were higher in 2020 than the normal periods for PM2.5 (attributable death counts: 20,062 in 2020 versus 3,927 per year in 2015-2019; attributable fractions: 10.2% versus 2.4%), PM10 (15,112 versus 3,999; 7.7% versus 2.5%), and PM2.5-10 (7,193 versus 2303; 3.7% versus 1.4%).

However, many concerns stay unnoticed due to the hesitance of young people to seek help and the unavailability and inaccessibility of appropriate help services. Contemporary interventions have been developed incorporating with target group specific needs and preferred modes of communication. krisenchat (German for crisis chat) is a German low-threshold chat-based psychosocial crisis counselling service that is available around-the-clock. Despite the growing number of online support services, there is a dearth of research regarding the acceptability, usability, and feasibility. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study analyzed retrospective anonymous data on sociodemographic variables, utilization behavior, and user satisfaction of all krisenchat users between May 2020 and July 2021. Predictors of user satisfaction were identified using exploratory multiple regression analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted using chi-square-tests to identify differences in user satisfaction. RESULTS: Data of N = 6962 users was included in the analysis. More than 50% of those reported not having contacted the professional health care system before. The mean user of krisenchat was 17 years old (M = 16.6, SD = 3.5), female (female: 83.4%, male: 14.7%, diverse: 1.8%), and first approached the service at 4 PM (M = 4:03 PM, SD = 5:44 h). More than 60% of the users contacted the service between 4 PM and 12 AM, 10% even between 12 AM and 8 AM. The most frequent chat topics were concerns regarding psychiatric symptoms (60.1%), psychosocial (34.0%) or emotional distress (30.2%). The majority of the users (64.7%) reported high levels of satisfaction and 88.3% a high likelihood (60% or more) of recommending krisenchat to others. Also, the results indicate that the number of messages and their respective length differed between users and counsellors, with users writing several, but shorter messages and counsellors replying with fewer, but longer messages. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study imply a high acceptability and feasibility of krisenchat. Overall, there is a high need for a 24/7 messenger-based chat counselling service in crises for children and young adults. Currently, there is no other online service for youth that is available after 7 PM or at weekends, which indicates the great importance of krisenchat and its function to bridge a current gap in the mental health care system. A need for further research emerges e.g., for subgroup differences regarding utilization patterns and also for further insights regarding help-seeking behavior via social media in youth.

This communication analyses how hospitalisations due to COVID-19 changed in the age groups 18C49 years and 70 years. Study design Longitudinal study based on secondary data. Methods Data from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records (including COVID-19 notifications), were used in this study. Statistical control charts examined changes in the magnitude and variation of younger (18C49 years) and older (70 years) adults who were hospitalised between 15 March 2020 and 19 June 2021. Results During the few first weeks of the pandemic in Brazil, the number of COVID-19 hospitalisations increased in older adults, but decreased in younger adults. Subsequently, hospitalisations reached statistical control zones in epidemiological weeks (EW) 19C48 of 2020 (EW 19-48/2020) and EW 03-05/2021 (18C49 y, mean = 26.1%; 70 y, mean = 32.8%). Between EW 49/2020 and EW 02/2021, the number of hospitalisations of younger adults dropped to levels below the lower control limit. In contrast, the number of hospitalisations of older adults surpassed the upper limit of the corresponding statistical control zones. However, from EW 06/2021, numbers of hospitalisations changed from statistical control zones, with hospitalisations of younger adults increasing and reaching 44.9% in EW 24/2021 and hospitalisations of older adults decreasing until EW 19/2021 (14.1%) and reaching 17.3% in EW 24/2021. Conclusions An increasing number of COVID-19 hospitalisations were observed in younger adults from EW 06/2021. This could be a result of the successful vaccination programme in older adults, who were initially prioritised, and possibly an increased exposure to highly transmissible variants of COVID-19 in younger adults who had to go to work in the absence of social protection (i.e. government financial support).

The implementation of health surveillance in this region has faced multiple constraints. New and novel approaches in surveillance are in a constant state of high and immediate demand. Identifying the existing literature on surveillance helps foster an understanding of scientific development and thus potentially supports future development directions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to illustrate the scientific production, quantify the scholarly impact, and highlight the characteristics of publications on public health surveillance in the EMR over the past decade. METHODS: We performed a Scopus search using keywords related to public health surveillance or its disciplines, cross-referenced with EMR countries, from 2011 to July 2021. Data were exported and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Visualization of Similarities Viewer. Quality of journals was determined using SCImago Journal Rank and CiteScore. RESULTS: We retrieved 1987 documents, of which 1927 (96.98%) were articles or reviews. There has been an incremental increase in the number of publications (exponential growth, R(2)=0.80) over the past decade. Publications were mostly affiliated with Iran (501/1987, 25.21%), the United States (468/1987, 23.55%), Pakistan (243/1987, 12.23%), Egypt (224/1987, 11.27%), and Saudi Arabia (209/1987, 10.52%). However, Iran only had links with 40 other countries (total link strength 164), and the biggest collaborator from the EMR was Egypt, with 67 links (total link strength 402). Within the other EMR countries, only Morocco, Lebanon, and Jordan produced 79 publications in the 10-year period. Most publications (1551/1987, 78.06%) were affiliated with EMR universities. Most journals were categorized as medical journals, and the highest number of articles were published in the Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (SCImago Journal Rank 0.442; CiteScore 1.5). Retrieved documents had an average of 18.4 (SD 125.5) citations per document and an h-index of 66. The top-3 most cited documents were from the Global Burden of Diseases study.

FebriDx?, a rapid point-of-care test that can differentiate viral from bacterial infections, can inform antibiotic treatment decisions. Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to conduct a literature-based US economic evaluation of a novel rapid point-of-care test, FebriDx?, that simultaneously measures two key infection biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), to accurately differentiate viral from bacterial infection. Methods: A budget impact model was developed based on a review of published literature on antibiotic prescribing for ARIs in the United States. The model considers the cost of antibiotic treatment, antibiotic resistant infections, antibiotic-related adverse events, and point-of-care testing. These costs were extrapolated to estimate savings on a national level. Results: The expected national cost to treat ARIs under standard of care was US $8.25 billion, whereas the expected national cost of FebriDx point-of-care-guided ARI treatment was US $5.74 billion. Therefore, the expected national savings associated with FebriDx? rapid point-of-care testing was US $2.51 billion annually. Conclusions: FebriDx, a point of care test that can reliably aid in the differentiation of viral and bacterial infections, can reduce antibiotic misuse and, therefore, antibiotic resistant infections.

I take some early examples from two distinct education systems, Australia and Finland, to highlight how disrupted teaching caused by school closures has had different impacts on schools and teachers. The conclusion is that the pandemic may help make education more equitable if current socio-economic inequalities are addressed early on; teachers and principals are trusted more in leading schools forward in the post-pandemic world; and schools and children are supported to become more self-directed in leading and learning.","output":"Does the pandemic help us make education more equitable?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to identify the challenges faced by instructors when conducting online teaching and learning (OTL) entirely using the universitys learning management system (LMS) during a global crisis - the Coronavirus disease outbreak Additionally, the present study proposes strategies for mitigating the challenges In-depth interviews were conducted with instructors from selected public and private universities in central Malaysia The fields of teaching involved in this study are Information System, Information Technology, Logistics Management, Accounting and Finance, Business Administration as well as Marketing Apart from the interviews, the use of LMS and instructor-student communication within the system were observed This study found several challenges faced by the instructors, which include ineffective real-time communications, technology incompetence, low rate of interactivity and lack of understanding of learners characteristics and attitude The possible strategies that are likely could help to mitigate these challenges are adding relevant functions and features in current LMS such as real-time communication, collaborative tools and social function Additionally, university should also provide resources and professional training on developing material that is in a digital format for the instructors The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge relevant to online teaching and learning Practically, the findings from this study may increase the understanding and awareness about the challenges among ministries, universities, instructors, students, and system developers Thus, relevant assistance and solutions can be provided to further improve and ensure the effectiveness of conducting OTL in similar circumstances ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Understanding challenges faced in online teaching and learning among Malaysian universities instructors during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Hellenic Heart Failure Association has undertaken the initiative to develop a national network of heart failure clinics (HFCs) and cardio\\\\oncology clinics (COCs).

In the current study, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as HCV (MFED 7-9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analysed created by several hundred consecutive energetically favoured stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses C even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base-paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus which is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterised, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represent important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.","output":"Pervasive RNA secondary structure in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses C an endeavour to understand its biological purpose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flaviviruses are known to cause a variety of diseases in humans in different parts of the world.

Whereas a serious lack of ventilators, vaccine being months away makes the condition even worse. That's why promising drug therapy is required. One of them was suggested in this article. It is the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) to which the COVID-19 virus binds and upon downregulation of which the pulmonary permeability increases and results in the filling of alveoli by proteinaceous fluids, which finally results in ARDS. ARDS can be assisted by angiotensinII type-1 receptor (AT-1R) blocker and ACE-2 upregulator. AT-1R blocker will prevent vasoconstriction, the proinflammatory effect seen otherwise upon its activation. ACE-2 upregulation will ensure less formation of angiotensin II, vasodilatory effects due to the formation of angiotensin (1-7), increased breakdown of bradykinin at lung level. Overall, decreased vasoconstriction of vessels supplying lungs and decreased vasodilation of lung tissues will ensure decreased pulmonary permeability and eventually relieve ARDS. It should also be considered that all components of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are located in the lung tissues. A drug with the least plasma protein binding is required to ensure its distribution across these lung tissues. Cotinine appears to be a promising candidate for COVID-19- induced ARDS. It acts across the board and acts as both an AT-1R blocker, ACE-2 upregulator. It also has a weak plasma protein binding that helps to spread through the lung tissues. In this review, we summarized that cotinine, along with COVID-19 virus replication blocker anti-virals, may prove to be a promising therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 induced ARDS.","output":"Possible therapeutic interventions in COVID-19 induced ARDS by cotinine as an ACE-2 promoter and AT-1R blocker"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The bicycle is a low-cost means of transport linked to low risk of COVID-19 transmission.

The ramp up speed of food production for 24/7 construction of the facilities over 6 years is estimated to be lower than other alternatives (3-10% of the global protein requirements could be fulfilled at end of first year), but the nutritional quality of the microbial protein is higher than for most other alternative foods for catastrophes. Results suggest that investment in SCP ramp up should be limited to the production capacity that is needed to fulfill only the minimum recommended protein requirements of humanity during the catastrophe.

Clinical and biological characteristics (including T cell phenotype and function and plasma concentrations of 30 cytokines) and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: At similar baseline respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients required mechanical ventilation for significantly longer than non-COVID-19 patients (15 [7C22] vs. 4 (0C15) days; p = 0.0049). COVID-19 patients had lower levels of most classical inflammatory cytokines (G-CSF, CCL20, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, TNF-, TGF-), but higher plasma concentrations of CXCL10, GM-CSF and CCL5, compared to non-COVID-19 patients.

INTRODUCTION: The pandemic situation in health centers has led to significant changes in the work environment, compromising care professionals' physical and psychological health and resulting in strong physical and mental exhaustion. METHODS: An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out, between February and April 2021, in a large sample of 1360 participants. The researchers conducted the dissemination of a validated questionnaire to working nurses in Spain. RESULTS: The sex variable in relation to the study dimensions (stressors, perceived emotions, and coping strategies) showed a mean for stressors of 62.2  10.5 in women and 59.8  12.5 in men (p = 0.010), showing statistically significant differences.

We intend to systematically weigh and analyze the existing evidence of HCQ in the light of published and pre-print data available so far. Methods: PubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases and official clinical trial Registries of the United States, China, WHO ICTRP were electronically searched for studies for the use of HCQ in patients with COVID-19. Pre-proof article repositories like MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and ChemRxiv were also included in the search. The literature was critically appraised. Results: Total 71 articles were available as of 15 th April of which articles of relevance (three invitro studies, two open label non-randomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one follow-up study, three reviews, ten short communications) and 88 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registries were analyzed.

In this review, we describe the implementation of an immunoinformatics-driven approach to systematically search for key determinants of immunity in newly available genome sequence data and design vaccines. This approach holds promise for the development of 21st century vaccines, improving human health everywhere.","output":"Time for T?

Respiratory injuries are major COVID-19 related complications, leading to poor lung circulation, tissue scarring, and airway obstruction. Despite an in-depth investigation of respiratory injurys molecular pathogenesis, effective treatments have yet to be developed. Moreover, early detection of viral infection is required to halt the disease-related long-term complications, including respiratory injuries. The currently employed detection technique (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or qRT-PCR) failed to meet this need at some point because it is costly, time-consuming, and requires higher expertise and technical skills. Polymer-based nanobiosensing techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations. Polymeric nanomaterials have the potential for clinical applications due to their versatile features like low cytotoxicity, biodegradability, bioavailability, biocompatibility, and specific delivery at the targeted site of action. In recent years, innovative polymeric nanomedicine approaches have been developed to deliver therapeutic agents and support tissue growth for the inflamed organs, including the lung. This review highlights the most recent advances of polymer-based nanomedicine approaches in infectious disease diagnosis and treatments. This paper also focuses on the potential of novel nanomedicine techniques that may prove to be therapeutically efficient in fighting against COVID-19 related respiratory injuries.","output":"Polymer-based nano-therapies to combat COVID-19 related respiratory injury: progress, prospects, and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globalization has sparked international collaboration in our field, and this trend is expected to continue in the years to come.

This phenomenon complicates not only comparisons across cultures, but also those across subpopulations and time periods within a population. Moreover, it may counteract the effectiveness of risk-reducing public health efforts.

However, it is usually not easy to fabricate a single hydrogel with all of the desirable functions at one time. Herein, a bilayer model with an outer layer for hydrogel wound dressing was proposed. The inner layer (Hm-PNn) was a hybrid hydrogel prepared by N-isopropylacrylamide and chitosan-N-2-hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride (HACC), and the outer layer (PVAo-PAmp) was prepared by polyvinyl alcohols and acrylamide. The two hydrogel layers of the bilayer model were covalently connected with excellent interfacial strength by photoinduced electron/energy transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization. The outer layer exposed to the ambient environment exhibited good stretchability and toughness, while the inner-layer hydrogel adhered to the skin exhibited excellent softness, antibacterial activity, thermoresponsivity, and biocompatibility. In particular, the inner layer of a hydrogel demonstrated excellent antibacterial capability toward both Staphylococcus aureus as Gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli as Gram-negative bacteria. Cell cytotoxicity showed that the cell viability of all Hm-PNn layer hydrogels exceeds 80%, confirming that the hydrogels bear excellent biocompatibility. In vivo experimental results indicated that the Hm-PNn/PVAo-PAmp bilayer hydrogel has a significant effect on the acceleration of wound healing, which was demonstrated in a full-thickness skin defect model showing improved collagen disposition and granulation tissue thickness.

These patients are at especially increased risk of morbidity and mortality during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review will focus on patients with diseases in which immunosuppression is a vital part of the treatment regimen, including those with solid organ transplants, rheumatologic disorders, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We will summarize the current knowledge of immunosuppression in these diseases and the risk of contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, we will discuss if immunosuppression increases severity of COVID-19 presentation. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number patients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our understanding of the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 is advancing at a rapid pace. Currently, a number of clinical trials are underway to investigate the role of immunosuppressive treatments in the management of this disease. SUMMARY: Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that solid organ transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppression are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes but the data are not consistent. There is evidence to suggest that patients with rheumatologic disorders or IBDs are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and do not necessarily experience worse clinical outcomes. Patients with sarcoidosis are not necessarily at increased risk of COVID-19, although there is limited data available to determine if immunosuppression worsens outcomes in this population.","output":"Management of immunosuppressants in the era of coronavirus disease-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the urgent need for effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the catastrophic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are still no proven effective and widely available antivirals for COVID-19 treatment. Favipiravir and Ivermectin are among common repurposed drugs, which have been provisionally used in some countries. There have been clinical trials with mixed results, and therefore, it is still inconclusive whether they are effective or should be dismissed. It is plausible that the lack of clear-cut clinical benefits was due to the finding of only marginal levels of in vivo antiviral activity. An obvious way to improve the activity of antivirals is to use them in synergistic combinations. Here we show that Favipiravir and Ivermectin had the synergistic effects against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. The combination may provide better efficacy in COVID-19 treatment. In addition, we found that Favipiravir had an additive effect with Niclosamide, another repurposed anti-parasitic drug with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. However, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Favipiravir was drastically reduced when tested in Calu-3 cells. This suggested that this cell type might not be able to metabolize Favipiravir into its active form, and that this deficiency in some cell types may affect in vivo efficacy of this drug.","output":"Favipiravir and Ivermectin Showed in Vitro Synergistic Antiviral Activity against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred scientific production in diverse fieldsof knowledge, including mental health.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of the Beirut blast on the COVID-19 situation in the country. Subject and Methods: Data on COVID-19 were retrieved from the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health (LMOPH), where all the COVID-19 positive cases were reported. The study was divided into two periods, considering the incubation period of the COVID-19 virus: (July 27-August 9, 2020) and (August 10-23, 2020). Information obtained included daily number of cases, tests, deaths, hospitalized patients, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and mode of acquisition (local vs. expat). Daily positivity rates were reported per 100 tests. An independent sample t-test and a Joinpoint regression analysis were used to determine significance. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 201,010 tests were conducted during our studied period, with 8993 positive cases, constituting a total positivity rate of 4.5 per 100 tests. Case fatality rate over the studied period was 0.8%. The positivity rate of the period prior to August 10, 2020, was 2.7 per 100 tests, significantly less than that of the period following the explosion, which was 6.4 per 100 tests (p < 0.001). During our studied period, daily positivity rates were significantly increasing at a slope of 0.29 (p < 0.001). A significant increase in slope was noted on August 13, 2020 (p < 0.001).

Social distancing measures meant that routine face-to-face outpatient appointments needed to be cancelled or reimagined. Telemedicine offered an attractive solution. Telemedicine uses technology to increase access to healthcare and has been used internationally in remote clinical settings, the National Health Services 111 as well as in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Methods The University Hospital Lewisham Rheumatology Department organised outpatient review of new and follow-up patients via a consultant-supervised registrar telephone clinic 5 days a week during the first-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. 278 patients had a telephone consultation with the registrar over a 3-month period (30 March to 30 June 2020): 197 new and 81 follow-up patients. Results Of the 197 new patient referrals: 2% required urgent face-to-face review (new inflammatory arthritis); 31% were provided with future routine clinic appointments and 44% were discharged: 35 patients without the need for any further investigations and 52 patients following subsequent investigations (e.g. phlebotomy and radiology). Patients were provided with management advice, links to online resources and referred to allied health professionals as indicated, e.g. physiotherapy. Patients were effectively discharged following telephone consultation if the history was sufficient to exclude a condition requiring secondary care management and if relevant community investigations were negative (including inflammatory markers and immunology). 62 of the 197 newly referred patients were offered a routine follow-up appointment. 36 of these patients were reviewed in person when COVID-19 restrictions eased. Of these 36 patients, 20 were subsequently discharged, diagnoses included: chronic pain (5), osteoarthritis (3), mechanical joint pain (6). 11 patients remained for follow up, diagnoses included: Sj?grens syndrome (2) and palindromic rheumatism (1). 5 patients did not attend. Conclusion The strengths of this model were: the ability to continue to provide an outpatient rheumatology service; provide safe and effective management for new and follow-up patients; provide patient specific advice pertaining to COVID-19 and to support patients and primary care clinicians. The weaknesses of this model were the use of a single practitioner. Video consultation was not available when this model was implemented, but should add further to subsequent services. Our experience with the tele-rheumatology model suggests that a telephone triage system, coupled with relevant investigations prior to referral could lead to an effective virtual management strategy with potential beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. It also has great promise with regards to managing chronic conditions in clinical remission with video or telephone consultations, utilising virtual disease activity scores (ePROMS now available via the BSR) and satellite monitoring of blood tests and urinalysis.

In Lombardia, Italy, a Regional Emergency Committee (REC) was established and the regional health system reorganized, with only three hospitals designated as hubs for trauma care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of this reorganization of regional care, comparing the distribution of patients before and during the COVID-19 outbreak and to describe changes in the epidemiology of severe trauma among the two periods. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted using retrospectively collected data from the Regional Trauma Registry of Lombardia (LTR). We compared the data of trauma patients admitted to three hub hospitals before the COVID-19 outbreak (September 1 to November 19, 2019) with those recorded during the pandemic (February 21 to May 10, 2020) in the same hospitals. Demographic data, level of pre-hospital care (Advanced Life Support-ALS, Basic Life Support-BLS), type of transportation, mechanism of injury (MOI), abbreviated injury score (AIS, 1998 version), injury severity score (ISS), revised trauma score (RTS), and ICU admission and survival outcome of all the patients admitted to the three trauma centers designed as hubs, were reviewed. Screening for COVID-19 was performed with nasopharyngeal swabs, chest ultrasound, and/or computed tomography. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, trauma patients admitted to the hubs increased (46.4% vs 28.3%, p < 0.001) with an increase in pre-hospital time (71.8 vs 61.3 min, p < 0.01), while observed in hospital mortality was unaffected. TRISS, ISS, AIS, and ICU admission were similar in both periods. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed substantial changes in MOI of severe trauma patients admitted to three hubs, with increases of unintentional (31.9% vs 18.5%, p < 0.05) and intentional falls (8.4% vs 1.2%, p < 0.05), whereas the pandemic restrictions reduced road- related injuries (35.6% vs 60%, p < 0.05). Deaths on scene were significantly increased (17.7% vs 6.8%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak affected the epidemiology of severe trauma patients. An increase in trauma patient admissions to a few designated facilities with high level of care obtained satisfactory results, while COVID-19 patients overwhelmed resources of most other hospitals.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on severe trauma trends and healthcare system reassessment in Lombardia, Italy: an analysis from the regional trauma registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental health conditions are prevalent among Canadians and are a leading cause of disability. Each year, 1 in 5 Canadians experiences a mental health issue. A total of 5% of people aged 65 years perceive their mental health as fair or poor, and 6.3% of them have mood disorders. Regarding older adults with cognitive impairments such as dementia, up to 40%-50% of them experience depression at some point. We believe that older adults can benefit significantly from information and telecommunication technologies as a strategy for improving mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, while simultaneously improving their quality of life. 3Scape Systems Inc is an Alberta-based private company that has produced a series of specialized 3D videos designed to simulate real-life events and engage individuals living with mental health disorders and cognitive impairments such as dementia. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the trial design and effects of 3Scape videos on older adults symptoms of depression and anxiety and the efficacy of this technology in improving the quality of life of patients attending the Short-Term Assessment, Rehabilitation, and Treatment Psychiatry Day Hospital program at Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital and to provide data to estimate the parameters required to design a definitive randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The trial will use a randomized controlled design comprising 15 intervention participants and 15 control group participants. The participants will be adults aged 65 years who are cognitively intact or have minimal cognitive impairment (ie, Montreal Cognitive Assessment score 18), and are clients of the Short-Term Assessment, Rehabilitation, and Treatment Psychiatry Day Hospital program at Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. This studys primary outcome variables are related to clients depressive and anxiety symptoms and their quality of life. The control group will receive the standard of care (ie, the Short-Term Assessment, Rehabilitation, and Treatment Psychiatry Day Hospital program at Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital). The intervention group will receive the same standard of care as the control group and will use 3Scape Systems videos for therapeutic activities. RESULTS: Our study is currently on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The recruitment process is expected to resume by November 2021, and the primary impact analysis is expected to be conducted by February 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide valuable information such as the measurement of comparative intervention effects, perception of older adults and mental health therapists about the 3Scape Systems, the associated costs of treatment, and product costs. This will contribute to the evidence planning process, which will be crucial for the future adoption of 3Scape Systems.

Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study included children who were hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of COVID-19 and had undergone PCR testing in the COVID-19 children's clinic. Probable case definition was made according to the COVID-19 diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey. Results A total of 133 patients were included in the study, of which 46 (34.6%) were negative for the PCR test and 87 (65.4%) were positive for the PCR test. white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet levels were significantly lower in the PCR positive group than in the PCR negative group. The platelet to mean platelet volume ratio (PLT/MPV) was significantly lower in the PCR positive group than the PCR negative group, whereas the platelet distribution width (PDW) of the PCR positive patient group was significantly higher than the PCR negative group. For the multivariable model with PDW and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio/age factors included, F1 score was 0.864, area under the receiver operating characteristics was 0.804, and area under the precision-recall curve was 0.873.

The success of this policy depends on most of the population accepting the vaccine and then being vaccinated. Understanding and predicting the motivation of individuals to be vaccinated is, therefore, critical in assessing the likely effectiveness of a mass vaccination programme in slowing the spread of the virus. In this paper we draw on the I3 Response Framework to understand and predict the willingness of New Zealanders to be vaccinated for Covid-19. The Framework differs from most studies predicting willingness to be vaccinated because it is based on the idea that the willingness to adopt a behaviour depends on both involvement (a measure of motivational strength) with the behaviour and attitudes towards the behaviour. We show that predictions of individuals willingness to be vaccinated are improved using involvement and attitudes together, compared to attitudes alone. This result has important implications for the implementation of mass vaccination programmes for Covid-19.","output":"Predicting willingness to be vaccinated for Covid-19: evidence from New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that are common in many animal species, including camels, cattle, cats and bats. Animal CoVs, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2, rarely infect and spread among humans. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the resulting disease from this new CoV called COVID-19, as a public health emergency of international concern. This global pandemic has affected almost the whole planet and caused the death of more than 315,131 patients as of the date of this article. In this context, publishers, journals and researchers are urged to research different domains and stop the spread of this deadly virus. The increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has addressed several medical problems. However, such applications remain insufficient given the high potential threat posed by this virus to global public health. This systematic review addresses automated AI applications based on data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. We aimed to obtain an overview of this critical virus, address the limitations of utilising data mining and ML algorithms, and provide the health sector with the benefits of this technique. We used five databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus and performed three sequences of search queries between 2010 and 2020. Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the obtained 1305 articles. Only eight articles were fully evaluated and included in this review, and this number only emphasised the insufficiency of research in this important area. After analysing all included studies, the results were distributed following the year of publication and the commonly used data mining and ML algorithms. The results found in all papers were discussed to find the gaps in all reviewed papers. Characteristics, such as motivations, challenges, limitations, recommendations, case studies, and features and classes used, were analysed in detail. This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment. The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered. Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements. The growing emphasis on data mining and ML techniques in medical fields can provide the right environment for change and improvement.","output":"Role of biological Data Mining and Machine Learning Techniques in Detecting and Diagnosing the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"S54 Table 1Patient characteristics and outcomes in the post-COVID-19 clinicVariableBaseline Demographics n = 643Age (mean  SD)62 3  15 6Male sex398 (61%)Caucasian ethnicity292 (45 4%)Hospital admissionReceived NIV or CPAP35 (5 4%)Admitted to intensive care72 (11 1%)Length of stay (median IQR) (days)8 (4C11) Symptom burden at follow-upCough - same or worse148 (23 0%)Breathlessness - same or worse 106 (16 5%)Fatigue - same or worse92 (14 4%)Myalgia101 (15 7%)Anosmia53 (8 2%)Diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain54 (8 4%)Fuzzy head76 (11 8%)Chest pain and/or chest tightness80 (12 4%)Risk of depression71 (11 0%)Risk of PTSD60 (9 3%)Do they feel back to normal284 (44 5%)Back at work (n=363)114/363 (31 4%)OutcomesDischarged372 (57 9%)Further follow up call180 (28%)Face to face respiratory appointment134 (20 8%)Repeat imaging C further CXR or CT chest151 (23 5%)DiscussionOur data demonstrates a significant proportion of hospital inpatients develop physical or psychological sequelae after COVID-19, Long-COVID A significant number felt unable to return to work 9 weeks after discharge Our virtual clinic provided a structured way to identify patients on-going symptoms and demonstrates the importance of establishing structured multi-disciplinary pathways, particularly with referrals to physiotherapy, cardiology and neurology We strongly recommend the development of clear follow-up protocols prior to the next wave of disease","output":"S54 Long-COVID: the need for multi-disciplinary working"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Multi-setting population-based studies on healthcare service presentations with self-harm covering the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic are yet to be published. Aims Ascertain changes across settings in healthcare service presentations with self-harm during Waves 1 and 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method E-cohort study using individual-level linked routine healthcare data from Wales, UK, 2016-March 2021. We measured weekly proportion of self-harm contacts and people who self-harmed in contact with general practice (GP), emergency department (ED) and hospital admissions. We modelled weekly trends using linear regression and generalised estimated equations, quantifying time differences using difference-in-difference (DiD). Results We included 3,552,210 Welsh residents aged []10 years. Counts of self-harm presentations across settings was at a minimum at the start of stay-at-home restrictions during both waves and recovered compared to previous years in 3-5 months. Those who self-harmed in April 2020 were more likely to be seen in GP compared to other settings and previous years - mean rate of OR=1.2, although actual numbers fell. The proportion of self-harm ED contacts admitted to hospital dropped from June 2020 (1.9 [1.5-2.3] pp/month). Self-harm and COVID-19 infection had a bidirectional effect - self-harm history had OR=1.4 [1.2-1.6] and incidence had DiD=1.1 [0.8-1.4]. Conclusions Those that self-harmed and sought help during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially encountered stringent criteria for hospitalisation, particularly in Wave 2, while in Wave 1 they preferentially presented to GP. Reductions in contacts likely resulted in unmet healthcare needs which may later emerge placing further burden on individuals and healthcare services.","output":"Healthcare presentations with self-harm and the association with COVID-19: an e-cohort whole-population-based study using individual-level linked routine electronic health records in Wales, UK, 2016 - March 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 so far and in the immediate future has brought significant uncertainties that negatively impact institutions and individuals in developing and planning their activities worldwide. The uncertainty of the effectiveness of vaccines has forced the authorities to adopt different protocols, the most relevant of which is the isolation of people through quarantine to avoid contagion, drastically affecting our way of life. For this reason, it is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of quarantines. In this paper, we analyze the spread of the disease in Chile according to the quarantines decreed by the sanitary authority. An inferential study is used to estimate the trend changes in COVID-19 cases and their basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers, which allows us to evaluate the decreed measures and establish vaccination policies. According to the data obtained until 03 March 2021 of confirmed COVID-19 cases disaggregated at a regional level in Chile, we observe a heterogeneous spread in most Chilean regions. When incorporating the dynamic quarantines decreed, effectiveness is detected in most regions, except in a few of them. Our results indicate that we are unable to identify the measures in the step-by-step protocols partly responsible for non-compliance with quarantines. However, our specific findings that can be extrapolated to daily practice and enlighten the ways of other countries are as follows. On the one hand, a measure that has been effective in curbing the spread of the disease is the strict early quarantine as detected in some Chilean regions. Therefore, indexes are needed to measure the mobility of citizens. On the other hand, as time passes without stopping infections, quarantines lose effectiveness even if the estimated instantaneous reproduction number is negligible and stable. In addition, other factors can cause this number to not be within the expected ranges, which must be further studied. Also, we have estimated the basic reproduction number whose value confirms the suitability of the pandemic declaration.

Active compounds (such as substrate analogues, natural products and inhibitors of related proteins) are often identified in low throughput validation studies on a biochemical target. Sometimes the additional structural information is also available from crystallographic studies on protein and ligand complexes. In addition, the structural or sequence similarity of various protein targets yields a novel possibility for drug discovery. Co-crystallized compounds from homologous proteins can be used to design leads for a new target without co-crystallized ligands. In this paper we evaluate how far such an approach can be used in a real drug campaign, with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus providing an example. Our method is able to construct small molecules as plausible inhibitors solely on the basis of the set of ligands from crystallized complexes of a protein target, and other proteins from its structurally homologous family. The accuracy and sensitivity of the method are estimated here by the subsequent use of an electronic high throughput screening flexible docking algorithm. The best performing ligands are then used for a very restrictive similarity search for potential inhibitors of the SARS protease within the million compounds from the Ligand.Info small molecule meta-database. The selected molecules can be passed on for further experimental validation.","output":"Modelling of potentially promising SARS protease inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this current pandemic of COVID-19, entire world is facing a huge crisis in healthcare and economic fronts.

METHODS: This cross-sectional correlational study gathered data via an online survey to explore the mental health of Bangladeshi adults with symptoms akin to COVID-19. Level of stress, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms were measured with the DASS-21. Chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the association of variables. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms of the overall population were 26.9% and 52.0% respectively and 55.6% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Multivariate logistic regression determined that respondents with COVID-19-like symptoms reported higher odds for stress level (AOR = 2.043, CI = 1.51 to 2.76), anxiety symptoms (AOR = 2.770, CI = 2.04 to 3.77) and depressive symptoms (AOR = 1.482, CI = 1.12 to 1.96) than asymptomatic respondents.

AIM: To estimate the costs related to SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection among HCP in Greece. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the national database of SARS-CoV-2 infections and from the database of HCP exposed to patients with COVID-19. A cost-of-illness analysis was performed to estimate total, direct and indirect costs. RESULTS: In total, 254 HCP with COVID-19 and 3332 HCP exposed to patients with COVID-19 during the first epidemic wave were studied. Of the 254 HCP with COVID-19, 49 (19.3%) were hospitalized (mean length of hospitalization 11.6 days) and four were admitted to intensive care units (mean duration 10.8 days). Overall, 1332 (40%) exposed HCP had a mean duration of absenteeism of 7.5 days, and 252 (99.2%) HCP with COVID-19 had a mean duration of absenteeism of 25.8 days. The total costs for the management of the two groups were estimated at ?1,735,830 (?772,890 Euros for HCP with COVID-19 and ?962,940 for exposed HCP). Absenteeism accounted for a large proportion of the total costs (80.4% of all expenditures), followed by costs for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and hospitalization (10.2% and 6.5% of all expenditures, respectively). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with increased rates and duration of absenteeism among HCP. Indirect costs, particularly absenteeism, are the major driver of total costs among exposed HCP and HCP with COVID-19. The estimated total costs are conservative.

Information about symptoms was released by 4379 (93%) athletes;of them, 1433 (33%) declared to be asymptomatic, whereas the remaining 2946 (67%) reported the occurrence of symptoms with mild (1315;45%), moderate (821;28%), severe (1;0%) and unknown (809;27%) severity. The most common symptoms were anosmia (33%), ageusia (32%) and headache (30%). Cardiac magnetic resonance identified the largest number of cardiorespiratory abnormalities (15.7%).

The study included all critically ill hospitalized patients between March 6, 2020, and May 5, 2020. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization included mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and mortality stratified by race. RESULTS: Of 288 patients included (mean age, 63  16 years; 45% female), 210 (73%) were African American. African Americans had significantly higher rates of comorbidities compared to other races, including hypertension (80% vs 59%, P = 0.001), diabetes (49% vs 34%, P = 0.026), and mean BMI (33 kg/m(2) vs 28 kg/m(2), P < 0.001).

A critical account of the circular economy might problematize things like the whole economic systems physical scale, spatial and temporal system boundaries, consumer culture, and the inherent politics of the circular economy.

In this study, we aimed to investigate if these specific VCs in chest CT correlate with clinical severity of the disease. METHODS: CT images of 102 patients who underwent low-dose noncontrast chest CT due to COVID-19 between 11 March 2020 and 11 April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of VCs in CT images. VCs in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 were defined using the following descriptors: decreased lumen caliber, vascular wall irregularity, angulation in the course of the vessel, vascular disruption, and/or interruption. The relationship of these VCs with disease symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath), comorbid conditions (diabetes, hypertension, asthma), smoking habit, disease-specific laboratory changes (white blood cell-lymphocyte count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin, procalcitonin), lung parenchymal infiltration pattern (ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation) and its distribution (peripheral, central, mixed, upper lobes, lower lobes, right middle lobe) on CT were investigated by comparison of these variables between patients with and without VCs in chest CT. RESULTS: VCs were observed in 18 out of 102 patients (18%) with typical parenchymal involvement for COVID-19. There was no significant difference in terms of age and sex. We found an irregularity in the wall of the vascular structures in the distal branches and decreased lumen caliber of the vessels related to ground-glass opacities in 15 patients, concentric luminal narrowing in annular form in 4 patients, angulation/traction or springiness in the vascular structures towards the active lesions in 3 patients, and interruptions along the vascular course in 1 patient. VCs were significantly correlated with fever (12/18, 66.7%) and shortness of breath (7/18, 39%). These changes were significantly more remarkable in common disease involving both upper and lower lobes (10/18, 56%). In these cases, there was a substantial increase in CRP (15/18, 83%; mean, 5.76.3 mg/dL) and LDH (8/18, 44%) values compared to those who did not have any VCs. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that specific VCs observed in chest CT may predict the disease severity in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. These changes may be related to respiratory distress in the disease.","output":"A new imaging sign in COVID-19 pneumonia: vascular changes and their correlation with clinical severity of the disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Critical care nurses have a burnout rate among the highest of any nursing field. Nurse burnout may impact care quality. Few studies have considered how temporal patterns may influence outcomes. OBJECTIVE To test a longitudinal model of burnout clusters and associations with patient and clinician outcomes. METHODS An observational study analyzed data from annual employee surveys and administrative data on patient outcomes at 111 Veterans Health Administration intensive care units from 2013 through 2017. Site-level burnout rates among critical care nurses were calculated from survey responses about emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Latent trajectory analysis was applied to identify clusters of facilities with similar burnout patterns over 5 years. Regression analysis was used to analyze patient and employee outcomes by burnout cluster and organizational context measures. Outcomes of interest included patient outcomes (30-day standardized mortality rate and observed minus expected length of stay) for 2016 and 2017 and clinician outcomes (intention to leave and employee satisfaction) from 2013 through 2017. RESULTS Longitudinal analysis revealed 3 burnout clusters among the 111 sites: low (n = 37), medium (n = 68), and high (n = 6) burnout. Compared with sites in the low-burnout cluster, those in the high-burnout cluster had longer patient stays, higher employee turnover intention, and lower employee satisfaction in bivariate models but not in multivariate models.

METHODS: Five mechanically ventilated piglets were subjected to stepwise increased and decreased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)), to atelectasis using a balloon catheter in the right bronchus, and to pneumothorax by injecting air in the pleural cavity. Two diode lasers (764 nm for O(2) gas absorption and 820 nm for H(2)O absorption) were combined in a probe delivering light either externally, on the skin, or internally, through the esophagus. The detector probe was placed dermally. RESULTS: Calculated O(2) concentrations increased from 20% (IQR 17?23%) when ventilated with room air to 97% (88?108%) at FiO(2) 1.0. H(2)O was only detectable with the internal light source. Specific light absorption and transmission patterns were identified in response to atelectasis and pneumothorax, respectively.

Most patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are now able to be remotely monitored using either scheduled, patient- or threshold-triggered transmissions. The validated Triage Heart Failure Risk Score (Triage-HFRS) is a medical algorithm within company-specific CIEDs that can risk-stratify patients as low-, medium- or high-risk of worsening heart failure (WHF) in the next 30 days based on integrated monitoring of physiological parameters. Building on a previous proof-of-concept of the Triage-HF Plus pathway, we integrated remote data with simple 5-question telephone triage within a clinical pathway to identify WHF during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. Purpose: Prospective evaluation of clinical remote monitoring pathway integrating Triage-HFRS with protocolised telephone triage (Triage-HF Plus pathway). Methods: Prospective, real-world evaluation of clinical pathway serving a large urban region over a 12-month period, using data from April 2020 to April 2021 (initiated during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic in the UK). From a population of 435 patients with CIEDs, 87 high Triage-HFRS alerts were received and patients contacted for telephone triage assessment. Screening questions were designed to identify episodes of WHF and non-HF events. Intervention was at discretion of the clinical practitioner and in line with guideline-directed practice. A consecutive sample of 115 medium risk scores received the same triage. Results: Successful contact was made with 72 (82.8%) high-risk patients. Classification for high scoring patients confirmed on triage included isolated heart failure (18.3%), heart failure concurrent to medical problem (5.7%), alternative medical problem (10.3%), and recent hospital admission (8.0%);triage reassured absence of acute cause of high score in 40.2%. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of WHF was 87.9% (0.77-0.99) and 59.4% (0.50-0.69) respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 40.3% and 94.0%, respectively. Overall accuracy was 66.2%. Conclusions: The Triage-HF Plus pathway served as a useful remote monitoring tool for identifying patients with WHF whose care had been otherwise disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, allowing timely intervention and cementing the longer-term role for such models of care delivery. Crucially, in this multimorbid, high-cost population, relevant non-HF issues were also identified. The high negative predictive value further highlights the potential of proactive surveillance over conventional, periodic follow up.","output":"Triage-HF plus: 12-month study of remote monitoring pathway for triage of heart failure risk initiated during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the prototype of the coronavirus family, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 276 kilobase. Infectious bronchitis virus causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory and urogenital disease of chickens which results in significant economic losses in commercial broilers, layers and breeders. A rapid, highly sensitive and specific method is needed in the differential diagnosis of infections of different serotypes. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect Massachusetts (Mass) and Arkansas (Ark) serotypes of IBV. One common primer and two serotype specific primers were chosen from the S1 gene sequences of IBV and used in one PCR reaction. Under optimized PCR conditions, two serotype specific PCR products, 1026 bp for Mass and 896 bp for Ark, respectively, were amplified and detected by agarose gel electrophoreses. The specificity of the technique was verified by using 20 different strains and isolates of IBV, and other avian bacterial and viral pathogens. Using a serial 10-fold dilution of the artificial mixture of both Mass and Ark samples, the detection limit was found to be 5 pg RNA after 35 cycles of PCR. The multiplex PCR was able to detect and differentiate both serotypes in embryonated eggs that were co-infected with different EID50virus titers of Mass 41 and Ark 99.

Despite a large number of infected people, particularly during the second wave associated with the spread of the Variant of Concern (VOC) Gamma (lineage P.1), SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate in the Amazonas. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 persisted in a human population with a high immunity barrier, we generated 1,188 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences from individuals diagnosed in the Amazonas state from 1st January to 6th July 2021, of which 38 were vaccine breakthrough infections. Our study reveals a sharp increase in the relative prevalence of Gamma plus (P.1+) variants, designated as Pango Lineages P.1.3 to P.1.6, harboring two types of additional Spike changes: deletions in the N-terminal (NTD) domain (particularly{Delta} 144 or{Delta} 141-144) associated with resistance to anti-NTD neutralizing antibodies or mutations at the S1/S2 junction (N679K or P681H) that probably enhance the binding affinity to the furin cleavage site, as suggested by our molecular dynamics simulations. As lineages P.1.4 (S:N679K) and P.1.6 (S:P681H) expanded (Re > 1) from March to July 2021, the lineage P.1 declined (Re < 1) and the median Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Amazonas significantly decreases. Still, we found no overrepresentation of P.1+ variants among breakthrough cases of fully vaccinated patients (71%) in comparison to unvaccinated individuals (93%). This evidence supports that the ongoing endemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazonas is driven by the spread of new local Gamma/P.1 sub-lineages that are more transmissible, although not more efficient to evade vaccine-elicited immunity than the parental VOC. Finally, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in human populations with a declining density of susceptible hosts, the risk of selecting new variants with higher infectivity are expected to increase.","output":"Spread of Gamma (P.1) sub-lineages carrying Spike mutations close to the furin cleavage site and deletions in the N-terminal domain drives ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Amazonas, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The declaration of COVID 19 as pandemic has impacted the society at large In what started with 17 cases in Wuhan spread its tentacles and has now over 4 million cases across the globe In this rapidly changing environment, it is extremely difficult to quantify the impacts that the virus has on many aspects of society The paper highlights the various challenges and the impact on society, economy and general health These are only initial levels impacts, and it goes on with greater implications on growth depends on many factors, including the social distancing norms and shutdown rules laid by countries Nonetheless, it is clear that the virus is here to stay and is likely to impact growth, health and society substantially","output":"COVID-19 -An Insight into Various Impacts on Health, Society and Economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract and causes related symptoms.

The final convenience sample was n=423; a response rate could not be calculated. Survey themes included: sociodemographic and financial information, access to contraceptive services/care, IPV, and pregnancy. Respondents who reported a loss of health insurance, difficulty accessing contraception, barriers to medical care, or IPV were characterized as having a negative sexual and reproductive health experience during the pandemic. We explored associations between sociodemographic variables and negative sexual and reproductive health experiences. RESULTS: Since March 2020, 66/436 (16%) of respondents lost their health insurance, and 45% (89/436) reported income loss. Of our sample, 144/436 people (33%) attempted to access contraception. The pandemic made contraceptive access more difficult for 38/144 (26%) of respondents; however, 106/144 (74%) said it had no effect or positive effect on access. Twenty-one respondents reported IPV (5%). COVID-19 amplified negative views of unplanned pregnancy. Seventy-six people (18%) reported at least one negative sexual and reproductive health experience during the pandemic; people in an urban setting and those identifying as homo/bisexual were more likely to report negative experiences (24%, 28% respectively). CONCLUSION: Urban and sexual minority populations had negative sexual and reproductive health experiences during COVID-19 more than their counterparts. The pandemic has shifted perspectives on family planning, likely due to the diverse impacts of COVID-19, including loss of health insurance and income.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on sexual and reproductive health in Georgia, USA: An exploration of behaviors, contraceptive care, and partner abuse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of pandemic policing occasioned by COVID-19, Nigeria police have been facing challenges of a lack of legitimacy, together with what is termed the militarization of police operations.

In reviewing one of the first police interventions on a public health crisis in Nigeria, a qualitative study was conducted among top-ranking police officers who supervised the enforcement of lockdown and other COVID-19 measures. Sixteen interviews were conducted and a thematic analysis of the narratives was carried out. Police unpreparedness for public health interventions, and public resistance to the use of repressive, force-led styles of policing were identified as major impediments to positive pandemic policing.

We report two cases of severe peri-partum COVID infection leading to extremity gangrene secondary to a pro-thrombotic coagulopathy. CASE ONE: A 37-year-old lady, day-2 postpartum, was brought with severe COVID infection & and respiratory failure. She developed progressive gangrene of the foot. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram confirmed the presence of thrombosis of the left external iliac & and common femoral artery. She was managed with catheter- directed thrombolysis and fasciotomy. The dry gangrene of the foot was managed with a Boyds amputation. At 1-year follow-up, she is ambulant with a healthy stump. CASE TWO: A 34-year-old lady, 36 weeks of gestation, presented with fulminant COVID infection with respiratory failure and pulmonary embolus. The lady developed gangrene of the B/L toes. A CT angiogram revealed thrombosis below the popliteal trifurcation in both limbs along with segmental pulmonary thrombo-embolism involving the right lung and multiple splenic infarcts. She succumbed to the overwhelming infection and sepsis. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of coagulopathy in pregnant COVID patients is attributed to the hypercoagulable effect, which leads to thrombo-embolisms and limb ischemia following a cytokine storm syndrome in severe infections. To date, this is the first experience detailing distal limb gangrene in fulminant COVID infection in peri-partum women. Although, cases have been reported on distal limb gangrene in severe COVID infection among non-pregnant individuals.

However, AZM-associated QT interval prolongation and arrhythmias have been reported. Integrated mechanistic information on AZM actions on human ventricular excitation and conduction is lacking. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the actions of AZM on ventricular cell and tissue electrical activity. The O'Hara- Virag-Varro-Rudy dynamic (ORd) model of human ventricular cells was modified to incorporate experimental data on the concentration-dependent actions of AZM on multiple ion channels, including INa, ICaL, IKr, IKs, IK1 and INaL in both acute and chronic exposure conditions. In the single cell model, AZM prolonged the action potential duration (APD) in a concentration-dependent manner, which was predominantly attributable to IKr reduction in the acute condition and potentiated INaL in the chronic condition. High concentrations of AZM also increased action potential (AP) triangulation (determined as an increased difference between APD30 and APD90) which is a marker of arrhythmia risk. In the chronic condition, the potentiated INaL caused a modest intracellular Na + concentration accumulation at fast pacing rates. At the 1D tissue level, the AZM-prolonged APD at the cellular level was reflected by an increased QT interval in the simulated pseudo-ECG, consistent with clinical observations. Additionally, AZM reduced the conduction velocity (CV) of APs in the acute condition due to a reduced INa, and it augmented the transmural APD dispersion of the ventricular tissue, which is also pro-arrhythmic. Such actions were markedly augmented when the effects of chronic exposure of AZM were also considered, or with additional IKr block, as may occur with concurrent use of other medications. This study provides insights into the ionic mechanisms by which high concentrations of AZM may modulate ventricular electrophysiology and susceptibility to arrhythmia.","output":"In silico investigation of pro-arrhythmic effects of azithromycin on the human ventricle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are the suggested natural hosts for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the causal agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, SARS-CoV-2.

Additionally, we used genetic and functional analyses to identify critical residues in bat ACE2 receptors associated with viral entry restrictions. Our results suggest that many bat species may not be the potential hosts of one or both viruses and that no correlation was identified between proximity to humans and probability of being natural hosts of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2.

The second determination is the separation of pneumonia caused by the COVID-19 virus and pneumonia caused by a bacteria or virus other than COVID-19. This distinction is key in determining the treatment and isolation procedure to be applied to the patient. In this study, which aims to diagnose COVID-19 early using X-ray images, automatic two-class classification was carried out in four different titles: COVID-19/Healthy, COVID-19 Pneumonia/Bacterial Pneumonia, COVID-19 Pneumonia/Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19 Pneumonia/Other Pneumonia. For this study, 3405 COVID-19, 2780 Bacterial Pneumonia, 1493 Viral Pneumonia, and 1989 Healthy images obtained by combining eight different data sets with open access were used. In the study, besides using the original X-ray images alone, classification results were obtained by accessing the images obtained using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Local Entropy (LE).

CASE REPORT This case series examines the history, presentation, and clinical course of 5 patients with SCD who tested positive for SAR-COV-2 during the spring and summer of 2020. These patients experienced COVID-19 severities ranging from a mild cough and congestion to 8-day hospitalizations requiring blood transfusions. CONCLUSIONS While there is still a great amount of research on the interaction between COVID-19 and SCD needed, from this study we have concluded that patients with SCD do not always present with the classic COVID-19 triad of cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Often, these patients present with symptoms of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), including severe leg, flank, and chest pain, as was seen in 4 of 5 of our patients. We, and several other researchers, believe that this association between COVID-19 and VOC could be due to COVID-19 triggering inflammatory cytokines (notably IL-6) leading to system-wide inflammation, which induces sickling of the red blood cells. Based on this report, we recommend that SCD patients presenting with VOC who have had exposure to SAR-COV-2 be promptly tested for SAR-COV-2 to guide treatment and reduce mortality and morbidity in this vulnerable population.","output":"COVID-19 Presentation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In COVID-19, the adaptive immune response is of considerable importance and detailed cellular immune reactions in the hematological system of patients with severe SARS-CoV2-infection are yet to be clarified.

Some institutions have turned to the electronic health record and predictive analytics in search of earlier and more accurate detection of patients at risk for decompensation. METHODS: Objective electronic health record data from 2011 to 2017 was utilized to develop an automated early warning system score aimed at identifying hospitalized children at risk of clinical deterioration. Five vital sign measurements and supplemental oxygen requirement data were used to build the Vitals Risk Index (VRI) model, using multivariate logistic regression. We compared the VRI to the hospitals existing early warning system, an adaptation of Monaghans Pediatric Early Warning Score system (PEWS). The patient population included hospitalized children 18 years of age and younger while being cared for outside of the ICU. This dataset included 158 case hospitalizations (102 emergent transfers to the ICU and 56 code blue events) and 135,597 control hospitalizations. RESULTS: When identifying deteriorating patients 2 hours before an event, there was no significant difference between Pediatric Early Warning Score and VRIs areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at false-positive rates  10% (pAUC(10) of 0.065 and 0.064, respectively; P = 0.74), a threshold chosen to compare the 2 approaches under clinically tolerable false-positive rates.

Methodology/project description: The teaching program in basic theory was didactically redesigned and asynchronously placed on a learning platform, while the practical program, which consisted of training in conducting history-taking interviews, took place with the help of video conferencing software during synchronous sessions. For the practical sessions, the lecturers received organizational and technical support. Results: Based on initial evaluation results, a positive picture of the conversion has emerged since the course was completed. The need to restructure the course and use new teaching methods because of the COVID-19 pandemic was well accepted by lecturers and students, and the course content was successfully adapted to an online format. Conclusion: Overall, the online format enabled the learning objectives of the course to be successfully achieved. For topics such as non-verbal communication, the evaluation results indicated that a classroom format is preferable. Asynchronous theory teaching was generally very well received.

Advances in our understanding of biological aging, the discovery of strategies for modifying its rate, and an appreciation of aging as a shared risk factor for chronic diseases have jointly led to the Geroscience Hypothesis. This hypothesis states that interventions modifying aging biology can slow its progression-resulting in the delay or prevention of the onset of multiple diseases and disorders.

Para tato foram colhidas 100 amostras fecais de c?es n?o vacinados, entre 1 e 180 dias de idade entre 2007 e 2008, sendo 50 com diarria e 50 sem diarria no momento da colheita, nos Municpios de S?o Paulo, S?o Bernardo do Campo, Santo Andr, S?o Caetano do Sul, Tabo?o da Serra, Itapecerica da Serra e uma aldeia indgena em Parelheiros. s amostras foi aplicada a tcnica de eletroforese em gel de poliacrilamida (PAGE) para a deteco de rotavrus e uma RT-PCR dirigida ao gene da protena de membrana M do CCoV (nucleotdeos 337 a 746) para a deteco deste vrus, sendo os fragmentos detectados submetidos a seqenciamento de DNA. As seqencias obtidas, traduzidas em aminocidos, foram utilizadas para a construo de uma rvore genealgica enraizada de distancia com o algoritmo Neighbor-Joning e modelo de Poisson com 100 repeties de bootstrap. Nenhuma das amostras resultou positiva para rotavirus, enquanto que 47 foram positivas para CCoV, com freqncia significativamente superior nos animais com diarria. Vinte e dois dos 47 fragmentos de DNA obtidos resultaram em seqncias viveis de DNA, sendo 12 classificadas como CCoV Tipo I e 10 como Tipo II, tendo sido encontrada uma sublinhagem exclusivamente brasileira para o Tipo II. Em relao  amostra vacinal de CCoV submetida ao seqenciamento de DNA, a maior identidade ocorreu com o grupo Tipo II sublinhagem 01, com um valor de 100%, seguido de 97,2% para o Tipo II sublinhagem 02 (a linhagem brasileira) e 93,2% para o Tipo I. Sugere-se que a diversidade de CCoV encontrada seja derivada da elevada freqncia de ocorrncia deste vrus, o que pode aumentar a probabilidade de divergncias e de possveis falhas vacinais por diferen?as entre a amostra vacinal (Tipo II) e as amostras de campo (Tipos I e II), e, dessa forma, a vacina n?o diminuiria a transmiss?o e novas linhagens de CCoV emergiriam.

This study examined characteristics of adolescent skin gamblers, their engagement in monetary gambling, and relationships between skin gambling and at risk/problem gambling. METHODS: Two samples of Australian adolescents aged 12C17 years were recruited to an online survey through advertisements (n = 843) and an online panel provider (n = 826). RESULTS: In both samples, past-month skin gamblers (n = 466 advertisements sample; n = 185 online panel sample) were more likely to have lower wellbeing, score as having an internet gaming disorder on the IGD, engage in more types of monetary gambling, and meet criteria for problem gambling on the DSM-IV-MR-J. Past-month skin gambling uniquely predicted problem gambling when controlling for past-month gambling on 11 monetary forms and the total number of monetary gambling forms. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Underage participation in skin gambling is a growing concern. The strong convergence between engagement in skin gambling and monetary gambling suggests common risk factors may increase the propensity of some adolescents to gamble on these multiple forms. Nonetheless, past-month skin gambling predicted problem gambling even when controlling for past-month monetary gambling, indicating its unique contribution to gambling problems and harm. While the study was based on non-probability samples, its results strengthen the case for regulatory reforms, age restrictions and public health education to prevent underage skin gambling and its potentially harmful consequences for children and young people.","output":"Skin gambling predicts problematic gambling amongst adolescents when controlling for monetary gambling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Working memory deficit is one of the most critical complex cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective adjuvant therapy, but not still unsatisfactory. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), which has recently been used in clinical practice, may have faster and stronger effects comparing the traditional model (10-Hz high-frequency rTMS). A large number of studies have showed that rTMS, especially iTBS, can enhance the neural plasticity of the brain, and cognitive training can improve the cognitive function of schizophrenia. Is there any facilitation effect of iTBS add on cognitive training (such as working memory training, WMT) on cognitive function enhancement in schizophrenia is still unknown. METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed study is designed of a double-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that will include 200 schizophrenia patients between 18 and 45 years of age. The patients will be randomized to four groups, i.e., the study group (iTBS+WMT), WMS control group (iTBS+ Simple Response Training (SRT)), iTBS control group (sham iTBS+WMT), and placebo control (sham iTBS+SRT). The patients will receive 3 min 20 s of real or sham stimulation, followed by a short 1-2-min rest and 40 min of WMT training or SRT immediately. Neuropsychological and clinical symptom assessments, with functional and structural MRI, will be performed on baseline, post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up periods. The primary outcome is cognitive function measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The secondary outcomes are changes in neuroplasticity, as measured by MRI and other behavioral assessments. DISCUSSION: The aim of our study is to explore the facilitation effects of iTBS added on WMT in improving cognitive function of schizophrenia. That means, patients with schizophrenia will benefit more in cognitive function improvement from the combination training mode of \\"preheating (iTBS stimulation changes the neural activity of working memory-related brain regions) and ironning (working memory training).\\" And the long-term effects of this combined training model will be assessed at a 6-month follow-up period. In case of a significant improvement of working memory with a prolonged effect, the iTBS combined with WMT protocol could be considered as a first-line clinical protocol in schizophrenia treatment. More broadly, the potential for increased universality and efficiency of rTMS with the iTBS model to enhance the neural plasticity of the brain should have a more positive effect on cognitive function in schizophrenia.

The downside of using such molecules is the potential risk of developing immune-related adverse events. Factors that trigger these autoimmune side effects are yet to be elucidated. Although any organ can potentially be affected, kidney involvement is usually rare. In this case report, we describe the first known instance of a patient being treated with an inhibitor of programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1, a checkpoint inhibitor) who develops acute tubulointerstitial nephritis after contracting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. PRESENTING CONCERNS OF THE PATIENT: A 62-year-old patient, on immunotherapy treatment for stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma, presents to the emergency department with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection. Severe acute kidney injury is discovered with electrolyte imbalances requiring urgent dialysis initiation. Further testing reveals that the patient has contracted the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. DIAGNOSIS: A kidney biopsy was performed and was compatible with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with high dose corticosteroid therapy followed by progressive tapering. OUTCOMES: Rapid and sustained normalization of kidney function was achieved after completion of the steroid course. NOVEL FINDINGS: We hypothesize that the viral infection along with checkpoint inhibitor use has created a proinflammatory environment which led to a loss of self-tolerance to renal parenchyma. Viruses may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity in this patient population than was previously thought.","output":"Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis in a Patient on Anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Triggered by COVID-19: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic pain is a widespread public and physical health crisis, as it is one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care and accounts for the largest medical reason for disability in the USA (Glombiewski et al., J Consult Clin Psychol. 86(6):533-545, 2018; Schemer et al., Eur J Pain. 23(3):526-538, 2019). Chronic pain is associated with decreased functional status, opioid dependence and substance abuse disorders, mental health crises, and overall lower perceived quality of life (Korff et al., J Pain. 17(10):1068-1080, 2016). For example, the leading cause of chronic pain and the leading cause of long-term disability is low back pain (LBP) (Bjorck-van Dijken et al. J Rehabil Med. 40:864C9, 2008). Evidence suggests that persistent low back pain (pLBP) is a multidimensional biopsychosocial problem with various contributing factors (Cherkin et al., JAMA. 315(12):1240-1249, 2016). Emotional distress, pain-related fear, and protective movement behaviors are all unhelpful lifestyle factors that previously were more likely to go unaddressed when assessing and treating patient discomfort (Pincus et al., Spine. 38:2118C23, 2013). Those that are not properly assisted with these psychosocial issues are often unlikely to benefit from treatment in the primary care setting and thus are referred to multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation physicians. This itself increases healthcare costs, and treatments can be invasive and have risks of their own. Therefore, less expensive and more accessible management strategies targeting these psychosocial issues should be started to facilitate improvement early. As a biopsychosocial disorder, chronic pain is influenced by a range of factors including lifestyle, mental health status, familial culture, and socioeconomic status. Physicians have moved toward multi-modal pain approaches in order to combat this public health dilemma, ranging from medications with several different mechanisms of action, lifestyle changes, procedural pain control, and psychological interventions (Fashler et al., Pain Res Manag. 2016:5960987, 2016). Part of the rehabilitation process now more and more commonly includes cognitive behavioral and cognitive functional therapy. Cognitive functional therapy (CFT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are both multidimensional psychological approaches to combat the mental portion of difficult pain control. While these therapies are quite different in their approach, they lend to the idea that chronic pain can and should be targeted using coping mechanisms, helping patients understand the pathophysiological process of pain, and altering behavior. RECENT FINDINGS: CFT differs from CBT functionally, as instead of improving managing/coping mechanisms of pain control from a solely mental approach, CFT directly points out maladaptive behaviors and actively challenges the patient to change them in a cognitively integrated, progressive overloading functional manner (Bjorck-van Dijken et al. J Rehabil Med. 40:864C9, 2008). This allows CFT to be targeted to each individual patient, with the goal of personalized reconceptualization of the pain response. The end goal is to overcome the barriers that prevent functional status improvement, a healthy lifestyle, and reaching their personal goals. SUMMARY: Chronic pain is a major public health issue. Cognitive functional therapy (CFT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are both multidimensional psychological approaches to combat the mental portion of difficult pain control. While these therapies are quite different in their approach, they lend to the idea that chronic pain can and should be targeted using coping mechanisms, helping patients understand the pathophysiological process of pain, and altering behavior.","output":"CBT and CFT for Chronic Pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing spondylodiscitis and its complications, such as epidural and paraspinal abscesses. METHODS From January 2006 to August 2013 patients with a clinical suspicion of spondylodiscitis, with an infection, or with fever of unknown origin were retrospectively included if 18F-FDG-PET/CT and MRI of the spine were performed within a 2-week time span. Imaging results were compared to the final clinical diagnosis and follow-up data were collected. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were included of whom 49 patients were diagnosed with spondylodiscitis. MRI showed an overall sensitivity of 67 % and specificity of 84 %. Diagnostic accuracy was 58 %, when MRI was performed within 2 weeks after the start of symptoms and improved to 82 %, when performed more than 2 weeks after onset of symptoms. 18F-FDG-PET/CT showed a sensitivity of 96 % and a specificity of 95 %, with no relation to the interval between the scan and the start of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS As compared to MRI, 18F-FDG-PET/CT has superior diagnostic value for detecting early spondylodiscitis.

This included restricted testing, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, and enforcement of a nation-wide lockdown starting 25 March 2020. The objectives of this study were to i) describe the age, gender distribution, and mortality among COVID-19 patients identified till 14 April 2020 and predict the range of contact rate;and ii) predict the number of COVID-19 infections after 40 days of lockdown. Methods: We used a cross-sectional descriptive design for the first objective and a susceptible-infected-removed model for in silico predictions. We collected data from government-controlled and crowdsourced websites. Results: Studying age and gender parameters of 1161 Indian COVID-19 patients, the median age was 38 years (IQR, 27-52) with 20-39 yearold males being the most affected group. The number of affected patients were 854 (73.6%) men and 307 (26.4%) women. If the current contact rate continues (0.25-27), India may have 110460 to 220575 infected persons at the end of 40 days lockdown.

This virus, which is called corona, is the most contagious type of virus that humanity has ever encountered. The virus has caused a huge crisis worldwide as it leads to severe infections and eventually death in humans. On March 11, 2020, it was announced by the World Health Organization that a COVID-19 outbreak has occurred. Computer-aided digital technologies, which eliminate many problems and provide convenience in people's lives, did not leave humanity alone in this regard and rushed to provide a solution for this unfortunate event. One of the important aspects in which computer-aided digital technologies can be effective is the diagnosis of the disease. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is a standard and precise technique for diagnosing the disease, is an expensive and time-consuming method. Moreover, its availability is not the same all over the world. For this reason, it can be very attractive and important to distinguish the COVID-19 disease from a cold or flu through a cough sound analysis via smartphones which have entered into the lives of many people in recent years. In this study, we proposed a machine learning-based system to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients by analyzing only a single cough sound. Two different data sets were used, one accessible for the public and the other available on request. After combining the data sets, the features were obtained from the cough sounds using the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) method, and then, they were classified with seven different machine learning classifiers. To determine the optimum values of hyperparameters for MFCCs and classifiers, the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) strategy was implemented. Based on the results, the k-nearest neighbors classifier based on the Euclidean distance (kNN Euclidean) with the accuracy rate, sensitivity of COVID-19, sensitivity of non-COVID-19, F-measure, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9833, 1.0000, 0.9720, 0.9799, and 0.9860, respectively, is more successful than other classifiers. Finally, the best and most effective features were determined for each classifier using the sequential forward selection (SFS) method. According to the results, the proposed system is excellent compared with similar studies in the literature and can be easily used in smartphones and facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In addition, since the used data set includes reflex and unconscious coughs, the results showed that conscious or unconscious coughing has no effect on the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients based on the cough sound.","output":"Diagnosis of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients by classifying only a single cough sound"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood parasites of the sub-genus Haemoproteus have been reported in seabirds, in particular in species in the Suliformes order.

Plasmodium was also detected in a frigatebird on Europa; however, its placement on the phylogenetic tree could not be resolved. We provide strong support for transmission of blood parasites in seabirds in the Western Indian Ocean and suggest that migrations between the Pacific and the Indian oceans could favor the large-scale distribution of Haemoproteus iwa in frigatebird populations.","output":"Haemoproteus iwa in Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) in the Islands of the Western Indian Ocean"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has greatly affected the normal production and life of the society Mental health conditions of military personnel are very important for the maintenance of the stability of the army Based on the previous studies, this study explored the mental health problems that may occur among first-line officers and soldiers, isolated personnel and stationed officers and soldiers, analyzed their causes, and proposed the coping strategies from the perspectives of problem solving and emotion regulation","output":"Mental health problems among military personnel during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019: cause analysis and coping strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The norovirus 3C-like protease is a member of the chymotrypsin-like serine protease superfamily.

Data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was pre-tested on 5% of the total sample size before actual data collection. Data were coded and entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Frequency distribution, descriptive statistics, and diagrams were used to summarize and present data. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess the association between independent variables and voluntary blood donation practice. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to identify factors associated with the outcome variables. And p-value < 0.05 was used to declare significance. RESULT: Of the total of 630 selected civil servants, 601 give a complete response to the questionnaire yielding a response rate of 95%. The mean age of participants was 34.19 years, and 328 (54.6%) of them were rural residents before they joined the governmental work.

This review explores the fabrication of cold spray coatings including the types of materials that have been used for biomedical purposes, provides a detailed analysis of the factors affecting cold spray coating performance, and gives an overview over the most recent developments related to the technology. Cold spray coatings that have been used until this point in time in biomedical applications can be broadly classified as biocompatible coatings, anti-infective coatings, anti-corrosive coatings, and wear-resistant coatings. In addition, this review discusses how these applications can be broadened, for example by providing antiviral effect against coronavirus (COVID-19). While we highlight examples for multifunctional cold spray coatings, we also explore the current challenges and opportunities for cold spray coatings in the biomedical field and predict likely future developments.","output":"Multifunctional cold spray coatings for biological and biomedical applications: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to partner with stakeholders to identify gaps in care for persons living with dementia and their family caregivers and from this list, identify priorities for dementia care research. METHODS: Using a community-engaged research approach, a Stakeholder Advisory Council (SAC) consisting of diverse membership including persons living with dementia and family caregivers was convened. Through our work with the SAC, along with input from the wider network through a symposium, webinars, and an online learning community, gaps in dementia care and a list of topics for dementia care research was generated. This list was reduced to 46 topics for dementia care research and sent to stakeholders (persons living with dementia, family caregivers, and health/social care professionals in dementia care) to be prioritized by rating each of the 46 topics as Not so important, Important, or Very important. Priorities for dementia care were summarized by frequencies and proportions. RESULTS: A total of 186 participants completed the survey from August through October 2020, including 23 (12.4%) persons living with dementia, 101 (54.3%) family caregivers, and 62 (33.3%) health/social care professionals. Consistent across stakeholder groups was the focus on research on how best to support families following a diagnosis of dementia. Among persons living with dementia, research focused on support for continuing to live in their own homes was ranked as the highest priority, rated by 91.3% as Very Important. High priority research areas for family caregivers included interventions to slow cognitive decline (76.3%) as well as non-pharmacological approaches to manage behavioral symptoms (74.7%). The highest priority research topics for health/social care professionals were focused on the diagnosis including benefits of an early diagnosis (71.4%), how best to deliver the diagnosis (70.9%), and supports needed following a diagnosis (78.6%). CONCLUSIONS: This project draws on the strengths of its multi-stakeholder perspective to support patient-centered outcomes research. Findings are intended to inform those who conduct research and those who fund research about which research topics stakeholders believe are most important and thus have greatest potential to improve the quality of life among people living with dementia and their families.

The reproduction number of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been found to vary over time, potentially being influenced by a multitude of factors such as varying control strategies, changes in public awareness and reaction or, as a recent study suggests, sensitivity to temperature or humidity changes. To take into consideration these constantly evolving factors, the paper introduces a time dynamic, humidity-dependent SEIR-type extended epidemiological model with range-defined parameters. Using primarily the historical data of the outbreak from Northern and Southern Italy and with the help of stochastic global optimization algorithms, we are able to determine a model parameter estimation that provides a high-quality fit to the data. The time-dependent contact rate showed a quick drop to a value slightly below 2. Applying the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in the northern region of Italy, we obtained parameters that suggest a slower shrinkage of the contact rate to a value slightly above 4. These findings indicate that model fitting and validation, even on a limited amount of available data, can provide useful insights and projections, uncover aspects that upon improvement might help mitigate the disease spreading.","output":"Estimation of parameters for a humidity-dependent compartmental model of the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing concerns arising from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have led to the emergence of virtual readouts in radiology training programs.

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique situation in which whole communities were suddenly and simultaneously exposed to both the virus and the societal changes required to combat the virus. We studied 27,537 population-based biobank participants for whom we have genetic data and extensive longitudinal data collected via 19 questionnaires over 10 months, starting in March 2020. This allowed us to explore the interaction between genetics and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals wellbeing over time. We observe that genetics affected many aspects of wellbeing, but also that its impact on several phenotypes changed over time. Over the course of the pandemic, we observed that the genetic predisposition to life satisfaction had an increasing influence on perceived quality of life. We also estimated heritability and the proportion of variance explained by shared environment using variance components methods based on pedigree information and household composition. The results suggest that peoples genetic constitution manifested more prominently over time, potentially due to social isolation driven by strict COVID-19 containment measures. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the relative contribution of genetic variation to complex phenotypes is dynamic rather than static.","output":"Increased genetic contribution to wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the possibilities for negotiating the UK?EU health-security relationship after 2020 Health security, in the sense of measures to prevent and mitigate health emergencies, had played a marginal role in the UK?EU negotiations, but COVID-19 has greatly amplified this policy area?s significance At the beginning of the pandemic, Brussels introduced significant measures to promote public health sovereignty, notably joint procurement and stockpiling of personal protective equipment The UK went against the grain by limiting its involvement in joint procurement at a time when other countries were rushing to participate UK participation in some EU health measures is possible on existing terms, but not joint procurement This leaves the UK facing an uncertain future because of the potential risks associated with not participating in EU programmes, notably in terms of access to personal protective equipment supplies and possible market distortion resulting from new EU policies promoting stockpiling and reshoring The politicisation of health security thus adds another complication to the post-Brexit EU?UK relationship","output":"The importance of health security in post-Brexit EUCUK relations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE Nearly half of intensive care unit (ICU) patients will develop delirium. Antipsychotics are used routinely for the management of ICU delirium despite limited reliable data supporting this approach. The unwarranted continuation of antipsychotics initiated for ICU delirium is an emerging transitions of care concern, especially considering the adverse event profile of these agents. We sought to evaluate the magnitude of this issue across 6 centers in New Jersey and describe risk factors for continuation. METHODS This multicenter, retrospective study examined adult ICU patients who developed ICU delirium from June 2016 to June 2018. Patients were included in the study if they received at least 3 doses of antipsychotics while in the ICU with presence of either a clinical diagnosis of delirium or a positive Confusion Assessment Method score. Patients were excluded if they were on an antipsychotic before ICU admission. RESULTS Of the 300 patients included and initiated on antipsychotics for ICU delirium, 157 (52.3%) were continued on therapy upon transfer from the ICU to another level of inpatient care. The number of patients continued on newly initiated antipsychotics further increased to 183 (61%) upon discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION The continuation of antipsychotics for the management of delirium during transitions of care was a common practice across ICUs in New Jersey. Several risk factors for continuation of antipsychotics were identified. Efforts to reduce unnecessary continuation of antipsychotics at transitions of care are warranted.","output":"Descriptive analysis of the unwarranted continuation of antipsychotics for the management of ICU delirium during transitions of care: A multicenter evaluation across New Jersey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental surveillance is a critical tool for combatting public health threats represented by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the continuous increase of antibiotic resistance in pathogens With its power to detect entire microbial communities, metagenomics-based methods stand out in addressing the need However, several hurdles remain to be overcome in order to generate actionable interpretations from metagenomic sequencing data for infection prevention Conceptually and technically, we focus on viability assessment, taxonomic resolution, and quantitative metagenomics, and discuss their current advancements, necessary precautions and directions to further development We highlight the importance of building solid conceptual frameworks and identifying rational limits to facilitate the application of techniques We also propose the usage of internal standards as a promising approach to overcome analytical bottlenecks introduced by low biomass samples and the inherent lack of quantitation in metagenomics Taken together, we hope this perspective will contribute to bringing accurate and consistent metagenomics-based environmental surveillance to the ground","output":"Toward Accurate and Robust Environmental Surveillance Using Metagenomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disinfectant-containing wastewaters have been generated from many places, including marine industries. The synthetic NaClO-containing wastewaters have been effectively treated in a saline MBBR-MBR (moving bed biofilm reactor & membrane bioreactor) system containing marine microorganisms.

A linear relationship has been obtained for the half-life of membrane biofouling as a function of the NaClO concentration (10-100 mg/L): [half-life] = 250.12[NaClO concentration]. The COD and NH(3)-N removals are the highest at a salinity of 30 g/L for the marine bioreactors. The behaviour of the typical biofoulants, measured real-timely by fluorescence spectroscopy, can indicate the levels of membrane biofouling and microbial activity, responding to the NaClO and NaCl influences.

More than half of the overdose-related deaths are related to synthetic opioids represented by fentanyl which is a potent agonist of mu-opioid receptor (mOR). In recent years, crystal structures of mOR complexed with morphine derivatives have been determined; however, structural basis of mOR activation by fentanyl-like synthetic opioids remains lacking. Exploiting the X-ray structure of mOR bound to a morphinan ligand and several state-of-the-art simulation techniques, including weighted ensemble and continuous constant pH molecular dynamics, we elucidated the detailed binding mechanism of fentanyl with mOR. Surprisingly, in addition to the orthosteric site common to morphinan opiates, fentanyl can move deeper and bind mOR through hydrogen bonding with a conserved histidine H297, which has been shown to modulate mORs ligand affinity and pH dependence in mutagenesis experiments, but its precise role remains unclear. Intriguingly, the secondary binding mode is only accessible when H297 adopts a neutral HID tautomer. Alternative binding modes and involvement of tautomer states may represent general mechanisms in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-ligand recognition. Our work provides a starting point for understanding mOR activation by fentanyl analogs that are emerging at a rapid pace and assisting the design of safer analgesics to combat the opioid crisis. Current protein simulation studies employ standard protonation and tautomer states; our work demonstrates the need to move beyond the practice to advance our understanding of protein-ligand recognition.","output":"How -Opioid Receptor Recognizes Fentanyl"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) in COVID\\\\19 critically ill patients with protracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) RNAemia.

In Turkana, livelihoods are increasingly under threat because of climate change, conflict, and the changing land use and management. There are complex interactions between the multiple drivers of change in landscapes and livelihoods in the region. The question addressed here is: How have external development interventions contributed to the changing pastoralist livelihoods in Turkana? This study is specific to the lower part of the Turkwel River basin, particularly the Nanyee irrigated area in Turkwel, Loima sub-County of Turkana County. This article examines the external development interventions during the colonial, post-independence, and contemporary periods to reveal the ways that land use practices and livelihoods have changed across these periods. Land use practices are changing due to the growing human population, droughts, urbanization, and dispossession of grazing areas through state and donor-supported interventions. It is suggested in this article that the change from a system of customary, unrestricted grazing to one of enclosed pastures has threatened pastoral territories, as well as cultures and livelihoods over the past six decades. The new set of development interventions introduced by international and national actors have failed to support local livelihoods, instead joining the list of existing problems that undermine pastoralism, including drought, livestock diseases, and cattle rustling.","output":"Effects of development interventions on pastoral livelihoods in Turkana County, Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two Coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, causing generally mild respiratory tract infections in humans, were described in the XX c Pandemic Coronaviruses were first discovered as late as in the XXI c : SARS-HCoV in 2002 - causing severe respiratory tract infections (SARS) in China;MERS-HCoV in 2012 - circulating mostly on the Arabian Peninsula The SARS epidemic ended in 2004 resulting in morbidity of &gt; 8000 and &gt; 770 deaths, while the MERS epidemic is still ongoing (&gt; 2000 ill, &gt; 700 deaths) although its intensity decreased Both viruses are zoonotic and require at least two host jumps for the transmission of the infection to humans: for HCoV-SARS - from bat to palm civet and then to human;for HCoV-MERS - from bats to camels and subsequently to humans Primary mode of transmission is droplet in close contact (&lt; 1 m), but both viruses remain active in aerosol (up to 24 h), so infection can be also spread by air (ventilation) The ability for human-to-human transmission is higher for HCoV-SARS than for HCoV-MERS (8 generations vs 4, respectively) Moreover, there are differences in genome structure and pathogenic mechanisms: different receptor, cell entry mechanism, different way of host response modulation (e g inhibition of IFN cascade), etc Probably, these differences influence the overall manifestation of the disease in humans Infection caused by HCoV-MERS might manifest itself as ARDS, a mild-mannered and asymptomatic disease HCoV-SARS infections seem to be associated with severe disease only In this paper, a comparison of the structure of these viruses, the mechanisms underlying their ability to cross the interspecies barrier and to multiply in the human body, including modulation of IFN cascade, as well as routes of infection transmission and symptoms caused, were presented","output":"Pandemic human coronavirus - Characterization and comparison of selected properties of HCoV-SARS and HCoV-MERS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Informed by evidence from past studies and experiences with epidemics, an intervention combining quarantine, lockdowns, curfews, social distancing, and washing of hands has been adopted as \\"international best practice\\" in COVID-19 response.

In this study, we aim to compare the reintubation rate in preterm babies with RDS who were extubated to Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) versus those extubated to Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV). METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Womens Wellness and Research Center (WWRC), Doha, Qatar. The medical files (n = 220) of ventilated preterm infants with gestational age ranging between 28 weeks 0 days and 36 weeks + 6 days gestation and extubated to non-invasive respiratory support (whether NCPAP, NIPPV, or Nasal Cannula) during the period from January 2016 to December 2017 were reviewed. RESULTS: From the study group of 220 babies, n = 97 (44%) babies were extubated to CPAP, n = 77 (35%) were extubated to NIPPV, and n = 46 (21%) babies were extubated to Nasal Cannula (NC). Out of the n = 220 babies, 18 (8.2%) were reintubated within 1 week after extubation. 14 of the 18 (77.8%) were reintubated within 48 h of extubation. Eleven babies needed reintubation after being extubated to NCPAP (11.2%) and seven were reintubated after extubation to NIPPV (9.2%), none of those who were extubated to NC required reintubation (P = 0.203). The reintubation rate was not affected by extubation to any form of non-invasive ventilation (P = 0.625). The mode of ventilation before extubation does not affect the reintubation rate (P = 0.877). The presence of PDA and NEC was strongly associated with reintubation which increased by two and four-folds respectively in those morbidities. There is an increased risk of reintubation with babies suffering from NEC and BPD and this was associated with an increased risk of hospital stay with a P-value ranging (from 0.02C0.003). Using multivariate logistic regression, NEC the NEC (OR = 5.52, 95% CI 1.26, 24.11, P = 0.023) and the vaginal delivery (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.07, 0.78, P = 0.018) remained significantly associated with reintubation. CONCLUSION: Reintubation rates were less with NIPPV when compared with NCPAP, however, this difference was not statistically significant. This study highlights the need for further research studies with a larger number of neonates in different gestational ages birth weight categories. Ascertaining this information will provide valuable data for the factors that contribute to re-intubation rates and influence the decision-making and management of RDS patients in the future.","output":"Reintubation rates after extubation to different non-invasive ventilation modes in preterm infants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 1965, Gordon Moore came up with a prediction that technology will double itself in every two year.

Clinical assessment tools have poor sensitivity for predicting clinical outcomes. Molecular measurements of bacterial load correlate closely with clinical outcome but require specialist facilities and expertise. This study describes how routine blood culture testing can estimate bacterial load and predict clinical outcome for invasive pneumococcal pneumonia. Between December 2009 to March 2014, clinical and laboratory data were collected for 50 patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteraemia secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. Fluorescence rates (FR) were calculated from growth curves generated by BACTEC blood culture analysers by dividing change in fluorescence units (FU), measured at the first point of detectable fluorescence and at the point of automated BACTEC positivity, by time in hours. The mean age of the patients was 70.6 years (49.6C86.3). Forty patients survived invasive pneumococcal disease and ten patients died. These two groups did not significantly differ by demographic or clinical characteristics. The mean FR for the non-survival group (3.62  10(?3) FU/h) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of the survival group (1.73  10(?3) FU/h). FR did not vary by serotype. We determined that an FR of 2.59  10(?3) FU/h might represent a useful threshold for predicting high mortality risk with a sensitivity of 91 % and a specificity of 97 %. Our FR calculation uses cheap and accessible routine blood culture techniques to predict mortality in a small retrospective cohort study.

RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 20.4 years (range 1-56 years). Laparoendoscopic single-site pyeloplasty was carried out on the right in nine cases and on the left in 17 cases. The operative time was 246  68 min. Regarding the 14 pediatric patients, the mean age was 7.1 years (range 1-14 years). The operative time was 243  49 min. As for the 12 adult patients, the mean age was 35.8 years (range 16-56 years). The operative time was 248  86 min. The mean operative time of the control group in age-matched laparoscopic pyeloplasty was 239  51 min. Times were 229  54 min for the pediatric patients and 253  45 min for the adult patients.

However, little is known about the mechanisms of action of these antibodies or their effective dosing windows. We report the discovery and development of SC31, a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgG1 antibody, originally isolated from a convalescent patient at day 27 after the onset of symptoms. Neutralization occurs via a binding epitope that maps within the ACE2 interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, conserved across all common circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutants. In SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice, SC31 demonstrated potent survival benefit by dramatically reducing viral load concomitant with attenuated pro-inflammatory responses linked to severe systemic disease, such as IL-6. Comparison with a Fc-null LALA variant of SC31 demonstrated that optimal therapeutic efficacy of SC31 requires intact Fc-mediated effector functions that can further induce an IFN-driven anti-viral immune response. Dose-dependent efficacy for SC31 was observed down to 5mg/kg when dosed before the activation of lung inflammatory responses. Importantly, despite FcR binding, no evidence of antibody dependent enhancement was observed with the Fc-competent SC31 even at sub-therapeutic doses. Therapeutic efficacy was confirmed in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, where SC31 again significantly reduced viral load, decreased lung lesions and inhibited progression to severe disease manifestations. This study underlines the potential for significant COVID-19 patient benefit for the SC31 antibody that justifies rapid advancement to the clinic, as well as highlighting the importance of appropriate mechanistic and functional studies during development.

Severely ill patients may present with thyroid function abnormalities, so-called nonthyroidal illness syndrome, and several studies have linked thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH) and the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) to homeostatic regulation and function of lymphocyte populations. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to test the hypothesis that abnormal thyroid function correlates with lymphopenia in patients with severe infections. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of absolute lymphocyte counts, circulating TSH, T4, free T4 (FT4), T3, albumin, and inflammatory biomarkers was performed in 2 independent hospitalized study populations: bacterial sepsis (na? =a? 224) and COVID-19 patients (na? =a? 161). A subgroup analysis was performed in patients with severe lymphopenia and normal lymphocyte counts. RESULTS: Only T3 significantly correlated (&#961;a? =a? 0.252) with lymphocyte counts in patients with bacterial sepsis, and lower concentrations were found in severe lymphopenic compared to nonlymphopenic patients (na? =a? 56 per group). Severe lymphopenic COVID-19 patients (na? =a? 17) showed significantly lower plasma concentrations of TSH, T4, FT4, and T3 compared to patients without lymphopenia (na? =a? 18), and demonstrated significantly increased values of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and ferritin. Remarkably, after 1 week of follow-up, the majority (12 of 15) of COVID-19 patients showed quantitative recovery of their lymphocyte numbers, whereas TSH and thyroid hormones remained mainly disturbed.

MEG's spatial resolution critically depends on the approach used to solve the ill-posed inverse problem in order to transform sensor signals into cortical activation maps. Over recent years non-globally optimized solutions based on the use of adaptive beamformers (BF) gained popularity. When operating in the environment with a small number of uncorrelated sources the BFs perform optimally and yield high spatial resolution. However, the BFs are known to fail when dealing with correlated sources acting like poorly tuned spatial filters with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output timeseries and often meaningless cortical maps of power distribution. This fact poses a serious limitation on the broader use of this promising technique especially since fundamental mechanisms of brain functioning, its inherent symmetry and task-based experimental paradigms result into a great deal of correlation in the activity of cortical sources. To cope with this problem, we developed a novel data covariance modification approach that allows to build beamformers that maintain high spatial resolution when operating in the environments with correlated sources. At the core of our method is a projection operation applied to the vectorized sensor-space covariance matrix. This projection does not remove the activity of the correlated sources from the sensor-space covariance matrix but rather selectively handles their contributions to the covariance matrix and creates a sufficiently accurate approximation of an ideal data covariance that could hypothetically be observed should these sources be uncorrelated. Since the projection operation is reciprocal to the PSIICOS method developed by us earlier (Ossadtchi et al., 2018) we refer to the family of algorithms presented here as ReciPSIICOS. We assess the performance of the novel approach using realistically simulated MEG data and show its superior performance in comparison to the classical BF approaches and well established MNE as a method immune to source synchrony by design. We have also applied our approach to the MEG datasets from the two experiments involving two different auditory tasks. The analysis of experimental MEG datasets showed that beamformers from ReciPSIICOS family, but not the classical BF, discovered the expected bilateral focal sources in the primary auditory cortex and detected motor cortex activity associated with the audio-motor task. In most cases MNE managed well but as expected produced more spatially diffuse source distributions. Notably, ReciPSIICOS beamformers yielded cortical activity estimates with SNR several times higher than that obtained with the classical BF, which may indirectly indicate the severeness of the signal cancellation problem when applying classical beamformers to MEG signals generated by synchronous sources.","output":"Modified covariance beamformer for solving MEG inverse problem in the environment with correlated sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mientras tanto, maldiciendo l'ennui invasor, descubro que el confinamiento me lleva a pensar el tiempo Es el tiempo de espera de los ancianos del geritrico, sumergidos en su agonizante tristeza Es el tiempo de espera de los ni?os migrantes aislados en sus jaulas, peque?as crceles que se sitan en la frontera de Arizona con Mxico Viven el tiempo del abandono en la ms absoluta soledad Soy un fleco en el ojo del otro, nada El tiempo de la cocina distrae del tiempo de la pandemia En Estados Unidos, el tiempo de la protesta se inici despus del asesinato del afroamericano George Floyd a manos de la polica Los jvenes, arriesgndolo todo, salen a la calle a protestar contra la violencia institucional;al mismo tiempo, se levanta la voz contra el racismo sistmico, acelerado, por cierto, por la mano del actual presidente As vivimos el tiempo del coronavirus a doble comps: por un lado, protestamos la falta de un programa de salud pblica adecuada que nos proteja del COVID (el alto nmero de muertos cae ms sobre las comunidades minoritarias y las personas encarceladas","output":"El aire y la piedra"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Naive CD4(+) T cells can differentiate into different cell subsets after receiving antigen stimulation, which secrete corresponding characteristic cytokines and thereby exert biological effects in various diseases.

The common denominator is metaflammation, a portmanteau of metabolism and inflammation, which is characterized by chronically elevated levels of leptin and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These induce the Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling 1 and 3 (SOCS1/3), which deactivates the leptin receptor and also other SOCS1/3 sensitive cytokine receptors in immune cells, impairing the type I and III interferon early responses. By also upregulating SOCS1/3, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 adds a significant boost to this. The ensuing consequence is a delayed but over-reactive immune response, characterized by high-grade inflammation (e.g., cytokine storm), endothelial damage, and hypercoagulation, thus leading to severe COVID-19. Superimposing an acute disturbance, such as a SARS-CoV-2 infection, on metaflammation severely tests resilience. In the long run, metaflammation causes the typical western conditions associated with metabolic syndrome. Severe COVID-19 and other serious infectious diseases can be added to the list of its short-term consequences. Therefore, preventive measures should include not only vaccination and the well-established actions intended to avoid infection, but also dietary and lifestyle interventions aimed at improving body composition and preventing or reversing metaflammation.","output":"Obesity and Leptin Resistance in the Regulation of the Type I Interferon Early Response and the Increased Risk for Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is a non-human pathogen betacoronavirus that is evolutionarily and structurally related to the human pathogenic viruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.

Interview transcripts were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Four themes reflecting the experiences of haematological cancer patients during the pandemic were identified: Fears about contracting COVID\\\\19' (behaviour changes to protect health, impact on daily routine and habits, annoyance at dismissive attitude of others toward COVID\\\\19); Reduced sense of connection and support (reduced social support and access to external support services); New challenges (increased financial hardship, worsened health), and; Underlying system and communication issues' (access to trusted information, satisfaction/dissatisfaction with care, navigating telehealth). Participants expressed a need for improved access to support services and trusted information. CONCLUSIONS: The findings emphasise the additional challenges experienced by haematological cancer patients during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and their impact on daily life. Results point to the importance of validation of increased distress during periods of uncertainty; reinforcing recommendations about high\\\\quality sources of information; and facilitating access to support services when face\\\\to\\\\face care is limited.","output":"Experiences and needs of people with haematological cancers during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background England has experienced high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting in particular minority ethnic groups and more deprived communities. A vaccination programme began in England in December 2020, with priority given to administering the first dose to the largest number of older individuals, healthcare and care home workers. Methods A cross-sectional community survey in England undertaken between 26 January and 8 February 2021 as the fifth round of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) programme. Participants completed questionnaires, including demographic details and clinical and COVID-19 vaccination histories, and self-administered a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test to detect IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There were sufficient numbers of participants to analyse antibody positivity after 21 days from vaccination with the PfizerBioNTech but not the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine which was introduced slightly later. Results The survey comprised 172,099 people, with valid IgG antibody results from 155,172. The overall prevalence of antibodies (weighted to be representative of the population of England and adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity) in England was 13.9% (95% CI 13.7, 14.1) overall, 37.9% (37.2, 38.7) in vaccinated and 9.8% (9.6, 10.0) in unvaccinated people. The prevalence of antibodies (weighted) in unvaccinated people was highest in London at 16.9% (16.3, 17.5), and higher in people of Black (22.4%, 20.8, 24.1) and Asian (20.0%, 19.0, 21.0) ethnicity compared to white (8.5%, 8.3, 8.7) people. The uptake of vaccination by age was highest in those aged 80 years or older (93.5%). Vaccine confidence was high with 92.0% (91.9, 92.1) of people saying that they had accepted or intended to accept the offer. Vaccine confidence varied by age and ethnicity, with lower confidence in young people and those of Black ethnicity. Particular concerns were identified around pregnancy, fertility and allergies. In 971 individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the proportion testing positive was high across all age groups. Following a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after 21 days or more, 84.1% (82.2, 85.9) of people under 60 years tested positive (unadjusted) with a decreasing trend with increasing age, but high responses to a single dose in those with confirmed or suspected prior COVID at 90.1% (87.2, 92.4) across all age groups. Conclusions There is uneven distribution of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population with a higher burden in key workers and some minority ethnic groups, similar to the pattern in the first wave. Confidence in the vaccine programme is high overall although it was lower in some of the higher prevalence groups which suggests the need for improved communication about specific perceived risks. Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or a single dose following previous infection, confers high levels of antibody positivity across all ages. Further work is needed to understand the relationship between antibody positivity, clinical outcomes such as hospitalisation, and transmission.","output":"REACT-2 Round 5: increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies demonstrate impact of the second wave and of vaccine roll-out in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for which Kary Mullis received the 1992 Novel Prize in Chemistry, revolutionized molecular biology At around the time that prize was awarded, research was being carried out by Russel Higuchi which led to the discovery that PCR can be monitored using fluorescent probes, facilitating quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) In addition, the earlier discovery of reverse transcriptase (in 1970) laid the groundwork for the development of RT-PCR (used in molecular cloning) The latter can be coupled to qPCR, termed RT-qPCR, allowing analysis of gene expression through messenger RNA (mRNA) quantitation These techniques and their applications have transformed life science research and clinical diagnosis","output":"A beginner's guide to RT-PCR, qPCR and RT-qPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundWith the looming threat of recurrent waves of COVID-19 in the presence of mutated strains, its of paramount importance to understand the demographic and clinical attributes of COVID-19 related mortalities in each pandemic waves. This could help policy makers, public health experts, and clinicians to better plan preventive and management strategies to curb COVID-19 related mortality. MethodThis was a hospital record based, retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study, at a tertiary care hospital in Rishikesh, India. The study included all deceased patients between March 2020 and January 2021 (first wave) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and were hospitalized. The study was done to describe demography, clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, treatment given and associated complications of all COVID-19 deaths. ResultOut of 424 mortalities, 298 (70.38%) were males and 126 (29.62%) were females. Mean age of patients was 55.85 {+/-} 16.24 years, out of which 19.5 percent were less than 45 years old, 33.6 percent were 45 to 60 years old and 41.8% were more than 60 years old. Comorbidity in the form of type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 41.4% [95% CI (41.4-51.1)], hypertension in 39.8% [95% CI (35.1-44.6)], and coronary artery disease in 15.2% [95% CI (11.8-18.8)]. At the time of presentation, shortness of breath was present in 73.6% [95% CI (69.1 -77.7)], fever in 64.92% [95% CI (60.1-69.4)], and cough in 46.1%, [95% CI (41.1-50.8)]. Deranged laboratory parameters were lymphopenia in 90.2% [95% CI (86.8-92.7)], transaminitis in 59.7% [95% CI (54.8-64.3)], and hypercreatinemia in 37.7% [95% CI (33.1-42.5)]. Complications manifested were acute respiratory distress syndrome in 78.3% [95% CI (74-82.1)] and shock in 54.7% [95% CI (49.8-59.5)].

As we adapt to function in the era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a better understanding of how surgical techniques generate potentially infectious aerosolized particles will enhance the safety of operating room (OR) staff and learners. OBJECTIVE To provide greater understanding of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk during endonasal surgeries by quantifying increases in airborne particle concentrations during endoscopic sinonasal surgery. METHODS Aerosol concentrations were measured during live-patient endoscopic endonasal surgeries in ORs with an optical particle sizer. Measurements were taken throughout the procedure at six time points: 1) before patient entered the OR, 2) before pre-incision timeout during OR setup, 3) during cold instrumentation with suction, 4) during microdebrider use, 5) during drill use and, 6) at the end of the case prior to extubation. Measurements were taken at three different OR position: surgeon, circulating nurse, and anesthesia provider. RESULTS Significant increases in airborne particle concentration were measured at the surgeon position with both the microdebrider (p = 0.001) and drill (p = 0.001), but not for cold instrumentation with suction (p = 0.340). Particle concentration did not significantly increase at the anesthesia position or the circulator position with any form of instrumentation. Overall, the surgeon position had a mean increase in particle concentration of 2445 particles/ft3 (95% CI 881 to 3955; p = 0.001) during drill use and 1825 particles/ft3 (95% CI 641 to 3009; p = 0.001) during microdebrider use. CONCLUSION Drilling and microdebrider use during endonasal surgery in a standard operating room is associated with a significant increase in airborne particle concentrations. Fortunately, this increase in aerosol concentration is localized to the area of the operating surgeon, with no detectable increase in aerosol particles at other OR positions.","output":"Quantification of Aerosol Particle Concentrations During Endoscopic Sinonasal Surgery in the Operating Room."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic swept through an immunologically na?ve human population, academics and public health professionals scrambled to establish methods and platforms for genomic surveillance and data sharing.

Here, we use population genetic and phylogenetic methodology to characterize the population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstruct patterns of virus introductions and local transmission in Norway against this backdrop. The analyses demonstrated that the epidemic in Norway was largely import driven and characterized by the repeated introduction, establishment, and suppression of new transmission lineages.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that a new pandemic situation had arisen, due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, whose probable origin was zoonotic. The largest number of cases of this disease is concentrated in the United States of America (USA), India, and Brazil. The mortality rate is estimated at 3.4%, but regional differences may exist, and places with a high demographic density have become true epicentres and may be related to higher rates of transmission. In addition to the above, lower human development indexes (HDI) can be related to worse outcomes, especially in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil since they are the least developed places. The Northeast region is the second-most-affected place in the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil.

During the study period, 84,325 cases of COVID-19 were identified, in which 2205 resulted in death. In most of the regions studied, there was a positive association between the number of cases and deaths and the greater the demographic density, but there was no increase in the risk of becoming ill, nor of dying the lower the HDI.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed with semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for HCoV subtypes OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1, and 13 other respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: HCoV was present in 9.1% (313/3458) of all RTI episodes: 46.6% OC43, 32.3% NL63, 16.0% HKU1, and 5.8% 229E.

Like other states around the country, the state of Colorado instituted a statewide lockdown to combat increasing case and hospitalization rates for COVID-19 throughout the state. The impact of this mandate on the ICU admission rates and outcomes of other medical problems has never been investigated. Our study aimed to determine the effects of stay-at-home orders on outcomes for other diagnoses by analyzing ICU admission rates and outcomes of patients presenting to the ICU for non-COVID related issues before, during, and after the statewide mandate. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all ICU admissions in three phases: before (2 months prior), during, and 1.5 months after the statewide lockdown (March 26 to April 27, 2020). We included all patients admitted to the University of Colorado Health System hospitals ICUs within this defined time period. A time-to-event analysis was performed with the date of index ICU stay set as time zero. Baseline characteristics were obtained. Primary outcome measures were 28-day mortality and all-time mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival probabilities, while Cox regression and multivariable logistic regression were utilized to model phase-specific mortality controlling for comorbidities, demographics, and admission diagnoses. Counts of typical ICU admission diagnoses were also analyzed to determine any changes across lockdown periods. RESULTS: 9201 total ICU admissions occurred, of which 8154 (88.6%) were non-COVID-19 related. Approximately 57.4% were male with a mean age of 60.4 years. 28-day mortality rates for non-COVID-19 ICU admissions were 475 (11.0%), 127 (13.8%), and 306 (10.5%) before, during, and after the lockdown, respectively. The increased mortality during lockdown persisted after adjustment for comorbidities and demographics (HR=1.23, 95% CI, 1.007 to 1.512, p = 0.043). Acute respiratory failure was the most common diagnosis in each time period, and increased during lockdown (p&lt;0.001). Admissions for sepsis increased during lockdown and decreased after (p = 0.001);myocardial infarction (MI) admission decreased during lockdown but increased after (p = 0.014);and alcohol withdrawal (AW) admission increased both during and after lockdown (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: For non-COVID-19 related ICU admissions, the mortality rate increased during the state-wide shutdown but decreased after shutdown, although this difference became insignificant after controlling for patient admission diagnoses. Admission diagnoses also differed with more admissions for sepsis and AW during lockdown and more admissions for MI and AW after lockdown.","output":"The impact of the colorado state-wide lockdown on non-COVID-19 related ICU admissions and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This report and literature review describes a case of a COVID-19 patient who suffered a cerebellar stroke requiring neurosurgical decompression. This is the first reported case of a sub-occipital craniectomy with brain biopsy in a COVID-19 patient showing leptomeningeal venous intimal inflammation. CLINICAL DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 48-year-old SARS-COV-2 positive male with multiple comorbidities, who presented with fevers and respiratory symptoms, and imaging consistent with multifocal pneumonia. On day 5 of admission, the patient had sudden change in mental status, increased C-Reactive Protein, ferritin and elevated Interleukin-6 levels. Head CT showed cerebral infarction from vertebral artery occlusion. Given subsequent rapid neurologic decline from cerebellar swelling and mass effect on his brainstem emergent neurosurgical intervention was performed. Brain biopsy found a vein with small organizing thrombus adjacent to focally proliferative intima with focal intimal neutrophils. CONCLUSION: A young man with COVID-19 and suspected immune dysregulation, complicated by a large cerebrovascular ischemic stroke secondary to vertebral artery thrombosis requiring emergent neurosurgical intervention for decompression with improved neurological outcomes.

Chest CT data of 128 cases of COVID-19 and 47 cases of non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia confirmed by several hospitals were retrospectively collected, the imaging performance was evaluated and recorded, different imaging features were statistically analyzed, and a prediction model and independent predicted imaging features were obtained by multivariable analysis. COVID-19 was more likely than non-COVID-19 pneumonia to have a high-grade ground glass opacities (P = .01), extensive lesion distribution (P < .001), mixed lesions of varying sizes (27.7% vs 57.0%, P = .001), subpleural prominence (23.4% vs 86.7%, P < .001), and lower lobe prominence (48.9% vs 82.0%, P < .001). However, peribronchial interstitial thickening was more likely to occur in non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia (36.2% vs 19.5%, P = .022). The statistically significant differences from multivariable analysis were the degree of ground glass opacities (P = .001), lesion distribution (P = .045), lesion size (P = .020), subpleural prominence (P < .001), and lower lobe prominence (P = .041).

Spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the primary determinant of its entry into the host as it consists of both receptor binding and fusion domain. While tissue tropism, host range, and pathogenesis of coronavirus are primarily controlled by the interaction of S protein with the cell receptor, it is possible that proteolytic activation of S protein by host cell proteases also plays a decisive role. The host-cell proteases have shown to be involved in the proteolysis of S protein and cleaving it into two functional subunits, S1 and S2, during the maturation process. In the present study, the interaction of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with different host proteases like furin, cathepsin B, and plasmin has been analyzed. Incorporation of the furin cleavage site (R-R-A-R) in the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 has been studied by mutating the individual amino acid. Our results suggest the polytropic nature of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis indicated that a single amino acid substitution in the polybasic cleavage site of S protein perturb the binding of cellular proteases. This mutation study might help to generate an attenuated SARS-CoV-2. Besides, targeting of host proteases by inhibitors may result in a practical approach to stop the cellular spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop its antiviral.","output":"Insight towards the effect of the multibasic cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on cellular proteases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039].

Demographic and clinical characteristics including laboratory measurements were collected and compared. RESULTS Four case series and three case reports involving 48 cases of VITT were included. Hepatosplenic thrombosis was present in eight cases (17%). Patients with hepatosplenic thrombosis had lower platelet counts (13,000 vs. 29,500/L, p=0.016) and higher D-dimer levels (140.0 vs. 57.3 times upper limit of normal range, p=0.028).

METHODS A mixed-methods approach was used. Virtual patient education was delivered during the coronavirus-19 pandemic. Phase 1 included a cross-sectional online survey completed by individuals who did and did not participate in these sessions. For phase 2, six virtual focus group sessions were conducted using the social-ecological framework to guide thematic analysis and interpretation of findings. RESULTS Overall, 106 online surveys were completed; 60 (57%) attended Cardiac College Learn Online (CCLO) sessions only, one (1%) Women with Heart Online (WwHO) only, 21 (20%) attended both, and 24 (22%) did not attend virtual sessions. Half of the participants who attended virtual sessions viewed between one and four sessions. Most participants were from Canada (95%) and included the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute/Toronto Western Hospital centers (76%). Focus group findings revealed six overarching themes: Intrapersonal (mixed emotions/feelings; personal learning preferences); Interpersonal (desire for warmth of human contact and interaction); Institutional (the importance of external endorsement of sessions); and Environmental (technology; perceived facilitators and barriers).

In an effort to minimize the risk of exposure and optimize patient care, we sought to develop, test, provide training, and implement a standardized algorithm for intubating these high-risk patients at our institution. METHODS: We developed an initial intubation algorithm, incorporating strategic use of equipment and incorporating emerging best practices. By combining simulation-based training sessions and rapid-cycle improvement methodology with physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, and incorporating their feedback into the development, we were able to optimize the process prior to implementation. Training sessions also enabled the participants to practice the algorithm as a team. Upon completion of each training session, participants were invited to complete a brief online survey about their overall experience. RESULTS: An algorithm and training system vetted by simulation and actual practice were developed. A training video and dissemination package were made available for other emergency departments to adopt. Survey results were overall positive, with 97.92% of participants feeling confident in their role in the intubation process, and many participants citing the usefulness of the multidisciplinary approach to the training. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary, team-based approach to the development and training of a standardized intubation algorithm combining simulation and rapid-cycle improvement methodology is a useful, effective process to respond to rapidly evolving clinical information and experiences during a global pandemic.","output":"A Multidisciplinary Intubation Algorithm for Suspected COVID-19 Patients in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare the user-rated benefit of two categories of hearing aids, mainly the basic and premium categories of hearing aids. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered on 102 hearing aids users (47 basic and 55 premium category users) with severity of hearing loss ranging from mild to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss. The questionnaire administered was divided into mainly seven subscales which included speech intelligibility in quiet and in noise, ease of communication, the efficiency of noise reduction, localization, quality of music perception and cost effectiveness. The effect of duration of daily usage of hearing aids on performance among these different subscales was also assessed. RESULTS: Ease of communication was rated better by premium hearing aid users, whereas the cost effectiveness was rated to be better by basic users. There was no significant difference observed between performances of basic versus premium category of hearing aids in other listening domains assessed. There was no significant difference in any of the listening domains with daily usage duration for both categories of hearing aid users. CONCLUSION: The users of premium category devices revealed better ease of communication in daily environments, whereas performance of these devices on other listening domains remains questionable. Cost effectiveness was reported to be better by the users of basic hearing aids.

One major factor that is important in the forecasts using the models is the dynamic nature of the disease spread. Unless we can come up with a way of estimating the parameters that guide this dynamic spread, the models may not give accurate forecasts. In this work, using the SEIRD model, attempts are made to forecast Infected, Recovered and Death rates of COVID-19 up to a week using an incremental approach.

Eighty-nine (4.75%) of those tested positive were hospitalized in the VA and 40 (2.1%) were in the ICU. The mean ICU stay was 5.8 days (SD 7.2). The most frequently identified comorbidities among AHOBPR cases were of bronchitis (n=112, 5.9%), COPD (n=100, 5.3%), and hypertension (n=604, 32.3%). Conclusion: Approximately 13.8% of AHOBPR participants who received testing within VHA tested positive for COVID-19. Demographic characteristics of these cases reflect those of the broader AHOBPR, and comorbidity burden appears similar to the larger VHA and civilian population. Ongoing efforts are underway to investigate the role for deployment exposures and risk of COVID-19 and its associated morbidity and mortality.","output":"Covid-19 infection among airborne hazards open burn pit registry participants utilizing the va"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Being expensive and time-consuming to collect massive COVID-19 image samples to train deep classification models, transfer learning is a promising approach by transferring knowledge from the abundant typical pneumonia datasets for COVID-19 image classification. However, negative transfer may deteriorate the performance due to the feature distribution divergence between two datasets and task semantic difference in diagnosing pneumonia and COVID-19 that rely on different characteristics. It is even more challenging when the target dataset has no labels available, i.e., unsupervised task transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Task Adaptation Network (TAN) to solve this unsupervised task transfer problem. In addition to learning transferable features via domain-adversarial training, we propose a novel task semantic adaptor that uses the learning-to-learn strategy to adapt the task semantics. Experiments on three public COVID-19 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance. Especially on COVID-DA dataset, TAN significantly increases the recall and F1 score by 5.0% and 7.8% compared to recently strong baselines. Moreover, we show that TAN also achieves superior performance on several public domain adaptation benchmarks.","output":"Learning Invariant Representations across Domains and Tasks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing emergency drugs in time is key to responding to public health emergencies such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

In the largest series of patients with HD managed by cervical duraplasty (CD), this study compares the outcomes between conservative and surgical management. Methods A retrospective case-control study was performed on 60 patients with HD. The cases consisted of 30 patients who underwent CD, and 30 age- and sex-matched controls who managed with long-term collar wear. Clinical improvement was recorded using two patient-reported outcome measures-the Odom's scale and a self-rated hand grip strength score. Median and ulnar compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes and various magnetic resonance imaging parameters were recorded. Results None of the controls experienced clinical improvement at follow-up; 90% remained status quo at 24.33  9.38 months. Seventy-six percent of the operated patients demonstrated clinical improvement at 29.61  12.78 months, and a majority of them reported moderately better grip strength. The preoperative anteroposterior diameter (APD) of the surgical group improved from 0.74  0.13 to 0.86  0.21 ( p = 0.01), and the cord demonstrated a significant decrease in forward migration on flexion (0.20  0.11 and 0.03  0.07 preoperatively and at follow-up, respectively, p < 0.0001). Patients with clinical improvement demonstrated significantly better mean APD and median and ulnar CMAP values than those who did not improve ( p < 0.0001). The mean cervical alignment did not change significantly at follow-up ( p = 0.13). Conclusions This study shows that CD can significantly alter the clinical course of patients with progressive symptoms of HD. This approach successfully arrests the forward migration of the cervical cord on flexion and promotes morphological recovery of the cord. A majority of the patients undergoing CD demonstrate clinical and electrophysiological improvement at mid-term follow-up.","output":"Outcomes after Cervical Duraplasty for Monomelic Amyotrophy (Hirayama Disease): Results of a Case-Control Study of 60 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although airborne transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized, the condition of ventilation for its occurrence is still being debated. We analyzed a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak involving three families in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, assessed the possibility of airborne transmission, and characterized the associated environmental conditions. We collected epidemiological data, obtained a full video recording and seating records from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the index case. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer gas concentration decay method. This outbreak involved ten infected persons in three families (A, B, C). All ten persons ate lunch at three neighboring tables at the same restaurant on January 24, 2020. None of the restaurant staff or the 68 patrons at the other 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the measured ventilation rate was 0.9 L/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was identified, aside from back-to-back sitting in some cases. Analysis of the airflow dynamics indicates that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of long-range transmission of exhaled virus-laden aerosols.

Cell viability was detected by the MTT assay and cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the associations between NEAT1 and miR-125b. The protein expression of Bcl-2 was detected by western blot analysis. In the present study, the expression of NEAT1 and Bcl-2 was reduced and that of miR-125b was increased in clinical samples of villus tissues from patients with RSAs. In vitro, overexpression of NEAT1 enhanced the viability and suppressed the apoptosis of JEG-3 cells. It was demonstrated that miR-125b acts as a molecular sponge of NEAT1 and its expression was negatively regulated by NEAT1. miR-125b overexpression reduced the viability and promoted the apoptosis of JEG-3 cells. The expression of BCL-2, a target gene of miR-125b, was inversely correlated with that of miR-125b. Overexpression of miR-125b and inhibition of BCL-2 partially reversed the effect of NEAT1 overexpression on the viability and apoptosis of JEG-3 cells. Collectively, it was demonstrated that the NEAT1/miR-125b/BCL-2 axis plays a pivotal role in regulating the viability and apoptosis of JEG-3 cells.

Zn is an important micronutrient for both plants and animals. An estimated 17% of the world population, or around 1.1 billion people, are at the risk of zinc (Zn) deficiency. The deficiency has been related to adverse pregnancy outcomes, stunted growth, premature deaths, immune system dysfunctions, neuro-behavioral disorders, and recently with the failure to recover from COVID-19. These health risks associated with Zn deficiency have compelled FAO and WHO to recommend Zn fortification of diet. Correcting Zn deficiency is a challenge due to several reasons. Close to half of the agricultural soils are Zn deficient, and chemical Zn fertilizers are costly and ineffective. Developing Zn-rich crops through plant breeding and genetic engineering is challenging. Zn-dense diet is costly and cannot be implemented in the low-income region most affected by Zn deficiency. Lack of consensus among regulatory bodies on defining and diagnosing Zn deficiency in plants and Humans. Awareness and other sociocultural issues. Among the most important available solutions are zinc biofortification of the cereal crops, use of zinc biofertilizers, development of Zn-efficient crops with reduced phytate content. The use of Zn supplements, dietary modification, and diversification, especially with fish, are proposed as the most accessible and affordable solutions. Awareness programs in areas suffering the most from Zn deficiency are required. Despite the suggestions from FAO and WHO, global efforts to combat Zn deficiency matching those for combating diseases like HIV are not in place.

We aimed to evaluate the association between COVID-19 surges and HAI and cluster rates. METHODS: In 148 HCA Healthcare-affiliated hospitals, 3/1/2020-9/30/2020, and a subset of hospitals with microbiology and cluster data through 12/31/2020, we evaluated the association between COVID-19 surges and HAIs, hospital-onset pathogens, and cluster rates using negative binomial mixed models. To account for local variation in COVID-19 pandemic surge timing, we included the number of discharges with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis per staffed bed per month. RESULTS: Central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia increased as COVID-19 burden increased. There were 60% (95% CI, 23-108%) more CLABSI, 43% (95% CI, 8-90%) more CAUTI, and 44% (95% CI, 10-88%) more cases of MRSA bacteremia than expected over 7 months based on predicted HAIs had there not been COVID-19 cases. Clostridioides difficile infection was not significantly associated with COVID-19 burden. Microbiology data from 81 of the hospitals corroborated the findings. Notably, rates of hospital-onset bloodstream infections and multidrug resistant organisms, including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and Gram-negative organisms were each significantly associated with COVID-19 surges. Finally, clusters of hospital-onset pathogens increased as the COVID-19 burden increased.

Even though automation in ALL prognosis is an essential aspect of cancer diagnosis, it is challenging due to the morphological correlation between malignant and normal cells. The traditional ALL classification strategy demands experienced pathologists to carefully read the cell images, which is arduous, time-consuming, and often suffers inter-observer variations. This article has automated the ALL detection task from microscopic cell images, employing deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We explore the weighted ensemble of different deep CNNs to recommend a better ALL cell classifier. The weights for the ensemble candidate models are estimated from their corresponding metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and kappa values. Various data augmentations and pre-processing are incorporated for achieving a better generalization of the network. We utilize the publicly available C-NMC-2019 ALL dataset to conduct all the comprehensive experiments. Our proposed weighted ensemble model, using the kappa values of the ensemble candidates as their weights, has outputted a weighted F1-score of 88.6 %, a balanced accuracy of 86.2 %, and an AUC of 0.941 in the preliminary test set. The qualitative results displaying the gradient class activation maps confirm that the introduced model has a concentrated learned region. In contrast, the ensemble candidate models, such as Xception, VGG-16, DenseNet-121, MobileNet, and InceptionResNet-V2, separately produce coarse and scatter learned areas for most example cases.

Comparative genomic hybridization was carried out to evaluate genomic instability signatures through homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score, genomic index, and somatic copy number alterations. The relationship between genomic instability and TME was explored. RESULTS Patients with high intratumoral CD3+ T lymphocytes had longer progression-free survival (32 vs. 19.6 months, p = 0.009) and overall survival (OS) (median not reached). High HLA-E expression on tumor cells was associated with a longer OS (median OS not reached vs. 52.9 months, p = 0.002). HRD profile was associated with high HLA-E expression on tumor cells and an improved OS. In the multivariate analysis, residual tumor, intratumoral CD3, and HLA-E on tumor cells were more predictive than other parameters. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest HLA-E/CD94-NKG2A/2C is a potential immune target particularly in the HRD positive ovarian carcinoma subgroup.","output":"Genomic Instability Is Defined by Specific Tumor Microenvironment in Ovarian Cancer: A Subgroup Analysis of AGO OVAR 12 Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The multidimensional motion ultrasonic motor with a single spherical stator is studied in this paper. It has the characteristics of miniaturization and can be used in precision motion applications. By bonding six identical pieces of piezoelectric ceramic onto the stator and applying the voltage signal of high frequency, the deformation of the inverse piezoelectric effect is used to excite the stator yaw vibration mode. The orthogonal superposition of the modes of the spherical stator on the driving foot produces elliptical trajectory around X, Y, and Z directions by different excitation methods. According to the yaw vibration mode of the spherical stator, 12 driving feet are designed to drive the rotation of the spherical rotor. The structure and mechanical characteristics of the motor are simulated by using simulation software, and the transient response of the stator driving foot was obtained, which proved its feasibility. Finally, the output performance of the motor in actual operation is given through experiments, which provides a new reference scheme in the field of precise multi-degree-of-freedom motion. At a voltage of 100 V and a frequency of 26.7 kHz, the prototype has a no-load speed of 73, 70, and 114 rpm around X, Y, and Z axes, respectively.","output":"Design and characteristic analysis of multi-degree-of-freedom ultrasonic motor based on spherical stator."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A description of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection comparing the first and second waves could help adapt health services to manage this highly transmissible infection. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the epidemiology of individuals with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the characteristics of patients with a positive test comparing the first and second waves in Catalonia, Spain. METHODS: This study had 2 stages. First, we analyzed daily updated data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals from Girona (Catalonia). Second, we compared 2 retrospective cohorts of patients with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2. The severity of patients with a positive test was defined by their admission to hospital, admission to intermediate respiratory care, admission to the intensive care unit, or death. The first wave was from March 1, 2020, to June 24, 2020, and the second wave was from June 25, 2020, to December 8, 2020. RESULTS: The numbers of tests and cases were lower in the first wave than in the second wave (26,096 tests and 3140 cases in the first wave versus 140,332 tests and 11,800 cases in the second wave), but the percentage of positive results was higher in the first wave than in the second wave (12.0% versus 8.4%). Among individuals with a positive diagnostic test, 818 needed hospitalization in the first wave and 680 in the second; however, the percentage of hospitalized individuals was higher in the first wave than in the second wave (26.1% versus 5.8%). The group that was not admitted to hospital included older people and those with a higher percentage of comorbidities in the first wave, whereas the characteristics of the groups admitted to hospital were more alike. CONCLUSIONS: Screening systems for SARS-CoV-2 infection were scarce during the first wave, but were more adequate during the second wave, reflecting the usefulness of surveillance systems to detect a high number of asymptomatic infected individuals and their contacts, to help control this pandemic. The characteristics of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first and second waves differed substantially; individuals in the first wave were older and had a worse health condition.","output":"Individuals With SARS-CoV-2 Infection During the First and Second Waves in Catalonia, Spain: Retrospective Observational Study Using Daily Updated Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of 31 October 2020 This is the tenth edition of this summary of rapid systematic reviews, which includes the results of a rapid systematic review of currently available literature More than 200 therapeutic options or their combinations are being investigated in more than 1,700 clinical trials In this review, 46 therapeutic options are examined The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is continually monitoring ongoing research on any possible therapeutic options As evidence emerges, then PAHO will immediately assess and update its position, and particularly as it applies to any special sub-group populations such as children, expectant mothers, those with immune conditions, etc","output":"Ongoing Living Update of Potential COVID-19 Therapeutics: summary of rapid systematic reviews - 9 October 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has influenced the daily life of urban residents worldwide.

Current findings regarding plasma/serum homocysteine (HCY) levels in AS patients are inconsistent. This study aims to systematically evaluate the association between circulating HCY levels and AS. METHODS: Online electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang data) were used to retrieve all relevant articles published up to May 7, 2020. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the random-effect model, Stata16 software. RESULTS: Nine articles containing 778 AS patients and 522 controls were included in this meta-analysis. No significant differences in HCY levels were found between AS and control groups (pooled SMD = 0.46, 95% CI = ? 0.30 to 1.23, P = 0.23). However, subgroup analysis suggested that HCY levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the AS group treated with methotrexate (MTX) compared with the control group. In contrast, HCY levels were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the AS group receiving anti-TNF- treatment compared with the control group. No significant differences were detected between HCY levels and disease activity scores (Bath AS disease activity index, BASDAI), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates that HCY levels are similar between AS and controls, and do not correlate with disease activity. However, different medical treatments cause fluctuations of circulating HCY levels in AS patients. Further and larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Yet, whether and to what extent a highly prevalent and more elusive environmental factor, such as psychosocial stress (PSS), can also increase ACM disease progression is unexplored. Here, we first quantified perceived stress levels in patients with ACM and found these levels correlated with the extent of arrhythmias and cardiac dysfunction. To determine whether the observed correlation is due to causation, we inflicted PSS-via the resident-intruder (RI) paradigmupon Desmoglein-2 mutant mice, a vigorously used mammalian model of ACM. We found that ACM mice succumbed to abnormally high in-trial, PSS mortality. Conversely, no sudden deaths occurred in wildtype (WT) counterparts. Desmoglein-2 mice that survived RI challenge manifested markedly worse cardiac dysfunction and remodeling, namely apoptosis and fibrosis. Furthermore, WT and ACM mice displayed similar behavior at baseline, but Desmoglein-2 mice exhibited heightened anxiety following RI-induced PSS. This outcome correlated with the worsening of cardiac phenotypes. Our mouse model demonstrates that in ACM-like subjects, PSS is incisive enough to deteriorate cardiac structure and function per se, i.e., in the absence of any pre-existing anxious behavior. Hence, PSS may represent a previously underappreciated risk factor in ACM disease penetrance.","output":"Psychosocial Stress Hastens Disease Progression and Sudden Death in Mice with Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In subjects with an infection with the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 disease, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases are highly prevalent comorbidities.

Subject and Methods: We analyzed three historical telemedicine cases (varying regarding time and place) and extracted their success factors and barriers as well as assessed their maturity by using the Telemedicine Community Readiness Model (TCRM). Evidence-based categories of success factors and barriers as well as the TCRM's dimensions were used as deductive categories to analyze the study material's content. Results: The analysis showed that the readiness for telemedicine is higher when the technology is the only option to access health care services. In all three cases, core readiness played a central role. However, the health sector, existing technology, and finance were barriers present at all times, while during pandemics, some barriers are only temporarily removed, for example, by putting legal issues on hold. The analyzed cases were all on lower levels of maturity as they mainly represent pilot tests or exceptional circumstances.

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to explore the health state utility values (HSUVs) associated with loneliness and/or social isolation. METHOD: Peer-reviewed journals published in English language that reported both HSUVs along with loneliness and/or social isolation scores were identified through five databases. No restrictions were made relating to the population, study design or utility estimation method used. RESULTS: In total, 19 papers were included; 12 included a measure of loneliness, four studies included a measure of social isolation and three studies considered both loneliness and social isolation. All studies focused on individuals with pre-existing health conditionswhere the EQ-5D-3L instrument was most frequently used to assess HSUVs. HSUVs ranged from 0.5 to 0.95 in those who reported not being lonely, 0.42 to 0.97 in those who experienced some level of loneliness, 0.3 to 0.87 in those who were socially isolated and 0.63 to 0.94 in those who were not socially isolated. CONCLUSION: There was significant variation in HSUVs complicated by the presence of co-morbidities, population heterogeneity, variations in methods used to derive utility scores and differences in the measurement of loneliness and/or social isolation. Nevertheless, the lower HSUVs observed should be considered to significantly impact quality of life, though we also note the need for further research to explore the unique impact of loneliness and social isolation on HSUVs that can be used in the future economic evaluations.

Schools pivoted to remote delivery of learning using a variety of online and offline resources. PE is vital in providing motor development opportunities for children and it is essential to ensure that the provision of quality PE experiences is continued, even in the context of a pandemic. It was in this context that the PE at Home lessons were developed.This study examined teachers' and parents experiences of using the PE at Home resource and contributes to documenting the PE home-learning experience and can inform how the education system might respond and incorporate remote teaching into the future.A mixed-methods study utilising online surveys with 29 teachers and 173 parents/guardians and online interviews with five teachers, five parents and seven resource developers was undertaken. Quantitative data were descriptively analysed while qualitative data were analysed using a thematic approach (Braun, V., and V. Clarke. 2006. Using Thematic Analysis in Psychology. Qualitative Research in Psychology 3 (2): 77C101).The PE at Home lessons had excellent viewership with over 27,000 Facebook and 937 website views. Three themes (i) ensuring the E remained in PE;(ii) home-schooling and physical education;(ii) and context and relatability were developed from the data. While some parents demonstrated that their knowledge of PE was that it consisted of physical activity, other parents along with teachers and developers reflected on the educative component of the lessons. The PE at Home lessons provided teachers with a resource to share with parents to support parents home-school during Covid-19 school closures. An Irish resource featuring Irish children and aligned with the Irish curriculum was seen as a strength by both parents and teachers.The PE at Home lessons address the teaching and learning of PE in multiple contexts, particularly in an online environment, and they can be used in multiple ways to promote learning.

However, success on this strategy depends not only on the timing of its implementation, but also on the relaxation measures adopted within each community. At the request of Sonoran Health Ministry, we developed a mathematical model to evaluate the impacts of the lockdown implemented in Hermosillo, Mexico. We compared this intervention with some hypothetical ones, varying the starting date and also the population proportion that is released, breaking the confinement. For this purpose, a Monte Carlo study was performed by considering three scenarios to define our baseline dynamics. Results showed that a hypothetical delay of two weeks, on the lockdown measures, would result in an early ACME around May 9 for hospitalization prevalence and an increase on cumulative deaths, 42 times higher by May 31, when compared to baseline. On the other hand, in respect of relaxation dynamics, the ACME levels depend on the proportion of people who gets back to daily activities or the individual behavior regarding prevention measures. It is important to stress that, according to information provided by health authorities, the ACME occurring time was closed to the one given by our model. Hence, we considered that our model resulted useful for the decision-making assessment, and that an extension of it can be used for the study of a potential second wave.","output":"Lockdown, relaxation, and ACME period in COVID-19: A study of disease dynamics on Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the Great Lockdown in 2020, it is important to take stock of lessons learned.

Methods: This was a phase 2/3 open-label, multi-centre study done across six hospitals in India. All children received two 0.5mL doses of BBV152 (Covaxin(R), Bharat Biotech International Ltd., Hyderabad, India), which is the same formulation indicated in adults. Participants were monitored for adverse events, and post-vaccination blood draws were collected to assess neutralising antibodies. A total of 526 children were enrolled into Group 1 (ages 12 through 18 years, n=176), Group 2 (ages 6 through 12 years, n=175), Group 3 (ages 2 through 6 years, n=175). Findings: There were no serious adverse events, deaths, or withdrawals due to an adverse event during the study. Vaccination with BBV152 was generally well tolerated, with no substantial difference in reactogenicity profiles between the different age groups. Similar immune responses were measured as microneutralisation (MNT) antibody titers in all three age groups. Vaccine-induced MNT responses in all groups were comparable to BEI reference sera run in the same assay. Seroconversion (measured by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT)) achieved high levels (95-98%) in all three groups four weeks after the second vaccination. The PRNT GMT ratio was 1.76 (95%CI: 1.32-2.33) (GMT all children subgroup / GMT in adults) had a lower limit [] 1, indicating superior antibodies in children when compared to adults. Vaccine responses were skewed towards a Th1 response with IgG1/IgG4 ratios above 1. Interpretation: BBV152 is well tolerated and immunogenic in children from 18 years down to 2 years of age. Immunogenicity analysis (by PRNT) shows superior antibody responses were observed in children compared to adults, suggesting that BBV152 will also be efficacious in this age group.","output":"Immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152) in children from 2 to 18 years of age: an open-label, age-de-escalation phase 2/3 study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses the impact of Covid-19 on medical and healthcare education, and the challenges that now face students, educational providers and the wider NHS.","output":"Covid-19 and the healthcare professionals of the future."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review focuses on 4'-hydroxymethyl- or nucleobase-transposed nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleoside phosphonates, their stereoisomers, and their close analogues.

Depending on the academic calendar schedule, some schools were interrupted in the middle of anatomy teaching while others had more lead time to prepare but schools suddenly faced an imposed demand for a transition to distance learning. SUNY Downstate had its anatomy education interrupted due to the Covid-19 shut down. To gap the previous laboratory experience of students and complete the semester anatomy curriculum, a series of dissected abdominal videos were created and distributed to all first-year medical students (n=208). The video-based curriculum and the current student experience taking anatomy without cadaveric dissections were assessed via pre/post-tests and a five-question survey. A paired single tailed t-test comparing student responses (n=164) in the pre- versus post-test was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.002) while 92% of students (n=136) reported that their previous time dissecting prepared them to learn through videos without the benefit of hands-on dissection. Icahn School of Medicine adopted digital Grant's Dissector utilizing their accompanying narrated videos. Faculty voiced over the narration, however, permitting emphasis of material, directing pacing of course, and tying content to lecture and physical exams. Complete anatomy was used to augment the experience, with 3D virtual dissections and enhance the visualization of the structures, however the videos remained as the driver of content delivery. Weill Cornell Medicine created, and customized anatomy prosected material videotaping the show and tell sessions integrating powerpoint slides to tie in lecture content and clinical correlates. Results from all three schools highlight the technical success of implementing an anatomy video-based curriculum in response to COVID-19. Survey findings describe a unique cohort of students who were compelled to participate in a video-based curriculum after having learned anatomy in a donor body laboratory environment and student performance on summative exams in general equaled or exceeded scores from previous years. Overall, anatomy education through videos, digital platforms, and apps can offer a reliable stop-gap solution in the absence of traditional cadaveric dissection in a short-term, provisional model. However, the experience of learning anatomy from a human body in laboratory is irreplaceable and the future now seems to point to a combination of these modalities, and others, such as virtual reality or augmented reality, yet to be adapted and customized to our educational settings.","output":"Discovering the Value of Anatomy Laboratory Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic from The Perspective of Three Medical Schools Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne transmission of respiratory diseases has been under intense spotlight in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) where continued resurgence is linked to the relaxation of social interaction measures. To understand the role of speech aerosols in the spread of COVID-19 globally, the lifetime and size distribution of the aerosols are studied through a combination of light scattering observation and aerosol sampling. It was found that aerosols from speaking suspended in stagnant air for up to 9 h with a half-life of 87.2 min. The half-life of the aerosols declined with the increase in air change per hour from 28 to 40 min (1 h(?1)), 10C14 min (4 h(?1)), to 4C6 min (9 h(?1)). The speech aerosols in the size range of about 0.3C2 m (after dehydration) witnessed the longest lifetime compared to larger aerosols (2C10 m). These results suggest that speech aerosols have the potential to transmit respiratory viruses across long duration (hours), and long-distance (over social distance) through the airborne route.

It is currently unknown whether immunosuppressive drugs are advantageous or detrimental in patients with COVID-19. Immunosuppressive drugs could be harmful in the initial phase of COVID-19. In this phase, the host immune response is necessary to inhibit viral replication. However, immunosuppressive drugs might have a beneficial effect in the later, more severe phase of COVID-19. In this phase, an overshoot of the host immune response (the cytokine storm) can cause ARDS, multiorgan failure and mortality. Aim: To summarize the available evidence on the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on infection with SARS-CoV-2. The effects of immunosuppressive drugs on similar pandemic coronaviruses may resemble the effects on SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we also included studies on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Methods: The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020181137). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies with a control group and case-control studies concerning humans  18 years old. We also included in-vitro studies and animal studies with a control group. Results and Conclusion: Sixty-nine studies were included. Interestingly, MPA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vitro. Clinical studies are needed to confirm the inhibitory effect of MPA on SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vivo. There are indications that corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, like tocilizumab, can reduce mortality and prevent mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19. However, observational studies have contradictory results and the risk of bias is high. Thus, these results have to be confirmed in high-quality clinical trials before these drugs can be implemented as standard care. Based on the positive results of CNIs, mTOR inhibitors and thiopurine analogues in in-vitro studies with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it would be interesting to investigate their effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication.","output":"Immunosuppressive Drugs and COVID-19: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Minimally invasive techniques have been applied with increasing frequency to stoma creation.

Although a few media reports mentioned the existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware, and there is no publicly accessible dataset that could be utilized to boost the related research. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed mobile malware. We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains $2,016$ COVID-19 themed apps and $277$ malware samples by the time of May 26, 2020. We then present an analysis of these apps from multiple perspectives including popularity and trends, installation methods, malicious behaviors and malicious campaigns. We observe that the growth of the number of COVID-19 themed apps is highly related to the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world. Most of them were released through distribution channels beyond app markets. A majority of the malicious apps (over 53%) are camouflaged as official apps using the same app identifiers and some of them use confusing similar app icons with the official ones to mislead users. Their main purposes are either stealing users' private information or making profit by using the tricks like phishing and extortion. Furthermore, we find that only 40\\\\% of the COVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers who are active for a long time, while 60\\\\% of them are new emerging ones in this pandemic and only released COVID-19 themed malware.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 202 COVID-19 patients without known cardiovascular disease (reduced ejection fraction, uncontrolled arrhythmia, pericardial effusion, cardiac block, valvular disease, or hypertension) were included. Patients were divided into three groups of insufficient (< 30 ng/mL), normal (30 to 50 ng/mL), and high (> 50 ng/mL) serum vitamin D levels. Clinical outcome was defined as severe if invasive respiratory intervention and ICU admission was required. RESULTS: The patients were divided into three groups based on their vitamin D level: 127 cases in the insufficient vitamin D group, 53 cases in the normal vitamin D group, and 22 cases in the high vitamin D group. The mean age of the population study was 56 years. Thirty-four patients had severe clinical outcomes. The distribution of this group was as follows: 21 patients in the insufficient vitamin D group (16.5%), eight patients in the normal vitamin D group (15.1%), and five patients in the high vitamin D group (22.7%); P = 0.74.

NAFLD status was determined biennially using the hepatic steatosis index (HSI), and subjects were clustered into seven groups according to changes in HSI, body mass index (BMI), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR): none, persistent, transient, transient resolved, resolved, incident, and recurrent NAFLD (Groups 1C7, respectively). Predictive abilities were compared between the dynamics of HSI and single time points. Regarding the changes in HSI, the risk of incident DM was highest in Group 2 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.710; P < 0.001), followed by Groups 7 (HR 2.062; P < 0.001) and 3 (HR 1.559; P = 0.027). The predictive ability for DM was powerful in order of HOMA-IR, HSI and BMI. The dynamics of NAFLD were less predictive of incident DM than single time-point NAFLD.

Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this study, we have used a survey of 17,764 adults in the United States from different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Through initial statistical analysis and Bayesian network inference, we have identified key factors affecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches led to effective modeling of the level of mental health prevalence. RESULTS: Overall, females were more stressed than males, and people in the age group 18-29 years were more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian network model, we found that people with a chronic mental illness were more prone to mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new realities of working from home; homeschooling; and lack of communication with family, friends, and neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during the COVID-19Cgenerated economic crises. Finally, using supervised machine learning models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors such as social isolation, digital communication, and working and schooling from home were identified as factors of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular in-person communication with friends and family, a healthy social life, and social security were key factors, and taking care of people with a history of mental disease appears to be even more important during this time.","output":"Learning the Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 in the United States With Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infections have threatened humanity since times immemorial.

METHODS: Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020, in all 3139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent the speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without SIP orders. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to &#8804;10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% compared with the counties that did not implement SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%.

PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: While the definitions and the major role of health literacy on the health of individuals are clearly established and seem to be in agreement, the same cannot be said for its measurement. There are only about fifteen tools for college students and none of them are in French. The purpose of this research is therefore to develop a measurement tool that can be used to assess the health literacy level of French schoolchildren.

However, the changes in the structure of the teachers' personality were not limited only to informational and methodological competences. The relevance of this research is to test the hypothesis about the emergence of a new type of teacher's pedagogical culture, characterized by a special awareness of the humanistic and social role of a teacher in the course of e-learning. The aim is to study the content of a new type of pedagogical culture, as well as its structural components performed by the competences, the presence of which was actualized during the pandemic. The theoretical research methods (study and analysis of scientific publications on the teachers' competences, especially in demand during the pandemic, synthesis, systematization, comparison, etc.) and empirical methods (conversation, questioning, observation) were used in the study. The conducted empirical research, as well as the analysis of domestic and foreign publications show that, despite a short-term nature of remote learning, the transformations in pedagogical culture have the character of a qualitative leap and are global in nature, as they have affected the teachers in all countries. This allows us to declare the emergence of a new type of pedagogical culture, namely the electronic pedagogical culture of a higher school teacher, which is a natural result of the development of basic culture and is characterized by a change in priorities in the structure and in the content of its constituent blocks of competences. The article compares real changes in the structure of a teacher's personality with forecasts regarding the competences of the future, as well as with the information pedagogical culture, which is believed to have arisen in the process of information technologies penetration into the educational process. The scientific novelty of the research consists in substantiating the possibility of transforming the basic pedagogical culture of the teacher under the influence of external and internal factors. In theoretical terms, the study expands the scientific understanding of the essence of the teacher's pedagogical culture, the patterns of its development and transformation, as well as its competence-based structural organization. ? 2021 Moscow Polytechnic University.

Positron emission tomography (PET) only gives functional information about a target organ/tissue by the distribution of a specific contrast agent, a radiotracer. Combining the two imaging techniques provides synergy and they can amplify each other. In clinical practice, this combined PETCCT technique is already broadly used. For monkeys, it is increasingly used, with procedures and protocols mainly based on clinical practice. In this publication, we make recommendations about key steps towards standardization and optimization of non-human primate PETCCT (from study preparation to image interpretation). ABSTRACT: Despite the possibilities of routine clinical measures and assays on readily accessible bio-samples, it is not always essential in animals to investigate the dynamics of disease longitudinally. In this regard, minimally invasive imaging methods provide powerful tools in preclinical research. They can contribute to the ethical principle of gathering as much relevant information per animal as possible. Besides, with an obvious parallel to clinical diagnostic practice, such imaging platforms are potent and valuable instruments leading to a more refined use of animals from a welfare perspective. Non-human primates comprise highly relevant species for preclinical research to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and/or the development of improved prophylactic or therapeutic regimen for various human diseases. In this paper, we describe parameters that critically affect the quality of integrated positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PETCCT) in non-human primates. Lessons learned are exemplified by results from imaging experimental infectious respiratory disease in macaques; specifically tuberculosis, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We focus on the thorax and use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose as a PET tracer. Recommendations are provided to guide various stages of PETCCT-supported research in non-human primates, from animal selection, scan preparation, and operation, to processing and analysis of imaging data.","output":"Recommendations for Standardizing Thorax PETCCT in Non-Human Primates by Recent Experience from Macaque Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Genomics, as a branch of genetics, uses Genome-Wide Association Studies and Whole-Genome Sequencing approaches to investigate how molecular structure, haplotype variation, and geneCenvironment complexity affect geno- and phenotypes, and invoke other life science system studies and -omics.

It has been used for the prevention and treatment of virus-related respiratory diseases such as influenza virus infection. BLG contains some antiviral compounds, but few evidence-based clinical studies have been conducted to assess its efficacy against influenza. We assessed the effects of BLG (including efficacy and safety) on the treatment of seasonal influenza in an evidence-based clinical trial. METHODS/DESIGN: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, oseltamivir- and placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trial. A total of 177 subjects are going to be recruited after satisfying the criteria: (i) 18 to 65 years of age; (ii) illness onset within 36 h; (3) axillary temperature 38.0C; and (iv) positive influenza (type A/B) virus test. Subjects will be assigned randomly into three groups in equal proportions: oseltamivir treatment, BLG granule treatment, and placebo treatment. Each group receives 5-day treatment and is followed up 1, 3, 5, 7 and 21 days later. Symptoms and patient compliance are recorded, and virus/serum viral antibodies tested. We will use the primary outcome, secondary outcome, and safety indicators to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BLG granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza. DISCUSSION: We have described the first clinical trial for treatment using a single herb against influenza A and B viruses in China. We will hold a large-scale clinical trial to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BLG against influenza infection based on the results of this pilot study. And this clinical trial will serve as an example for the study of other traditional herbal medicines in evidence-based clinical trials.

Certain individuals, when infected by SARS-CoV-2, tend to develop more severe forms of Covid-19 illness for reasons that remain unclear. Objective. To determine the demographic and pre-existing clinical characteristics associated with increased severity of Covid-19 infection. Design. Retrospective observational study. We curated data from the electronic health record, and used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of pre-existing traits with a Covid-19 illness severity defined by level of required care: need for hospital admission, need for intensive care, and need for intubation. Setting. A large, multihospital healthcare system in Southern California. Participants. All patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection (N=442). Results. Of all patients studied, 48% required hospitalization, 17% required intensive care, and 12% required intubation. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, patients requiring a higher levels of care were more likely to be older (OR 1.5 per 10 years, P<0.001), male (OR 2.0, P=0.001), African American (OR 2.1, P=0.011), obese (OR 2.0, P=0.021), with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, P=0.037), and with a higher comorbidity index (OR 1.8 per SD, P<0.001). Several clinical associations were more pronounced in younger compared to older patients (Pinteraction<0.05). Of all hospitalized patients, males required higher levels of care (OR 2.5, P=0.003) irrespective of age, race, or morbidity profile. Conclusion. In our healthcare system, greater Covid-19 illness severity is seen in patients who are older, male, African American, obese, with diabetes, and with greater overall comorbidity burden. Certain comorbidities paradoxically augment risk to a greater extent in younger patients. In hospitalized patients, male sex is the main determinant of needing more intensive care.

Following feature selection, multivariable logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the relationship between CAC scores and patient outcomes. RESULTS: The presence of any identified CAC was associated with intubation (AOR: 3.6, CI: 1.4C9.6) and mortality (AOR: 3.2, CI: 1.4C7.9). Severe CAC was independently associated with intubation (AOR: 4.0, CI: 1.3C13) and mortality (AOR: 5.1, CI: 1.9C15).

For the general public, although their physical health may not be directly affected, their mental health may be affected by stress, anxiety, and social panic caused by COVID-19. Controlling the pandemic should focus on not only physical health but also mental health. For the general public, mental health is even more important, as good mental health at the individual level can form a positive social mentality conducive to pandemic prevention and control. Therefore, it is important to assess mental health during the pandemic, and analyze risk and protective factors. Methods: A self-compiled COVID-19 Social Mentality Questionnaire was used to conduct an online survey. A total of 16,616 participants responded, with 13,511 valid questionnaires. Results: Results showed that 10.7% of participants rated their mental health as worse than usual during the pandemic, and there were gender, age, and educational differences. Social support was positively correlated with pandemic-related knowledge and self-efficacy, and could indirectly predict mental health. Pandemic-related knowledge was positively correlated with self-efficacy and mental health, and risk level was negatively correlated with mental health. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that pandemic-related knowledge played a partial mediating role in the relationship between social support and self-efficacy, while self-efficacy played a complete mediating role in the relationship between social support and mental health. Logistic regression analysis showed that risk level moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and mental health. Conclusions: Social support can increase pandemic-related knowledge, thus improving self-efficacy and maintaining/promoting mental health. High risk levels can undermine the role of self-efficacy in promoting mental health. Therefore, in the fight against the COVID-19, people need to support and cooperate with each other, to improve self-efficacy and reduce risk, thus maintaining and promoting mental health.","output":"Antecedents of Public Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediation of Pandemic-Related Knowledge and Self-Efficacy and Moderation of Risk Level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although not validated fully, recommendations are present for diagnosis, screening and treatment modalities of patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). OBJECTIVE: To review the current practices of clinicians regarding FMF and reveal their adherence to consensus guidelines. METHODS: Fifteen key points selected regarding the diagnosis and management of FMF were assessed by 14 paediatric rheumatologists with a three-round modified Delphi panel. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on the following aspects: genetic analysis should be ordered to all patients when clinical findings support FMF, but its result is not decisive alone. In the absence of clinical features, colchicine should be commenced when two pathogenic alleles and family history of amyloidosis are present. Serum amyloid A testing at each visit is recommended in patients resistant to colchicine, with subclinical inflammation and family history of amyloidosis. Consensus was reached on both the definition of colchicine resistance and starting biologic in resistant cases. Cost, efficiency, ease of use, treatment adherence, accessibility and emergence of adverse events are the factors affecting the choice of biologic agents. In patients without any attack and evidence of subclinical inflammation within the last 6 months following initiation of biologics, treatment dose intervals can be prolonged. CONCLUSION: A consensus was achieved regarding the routine diagnosis and screening and treatment of FMF patients. The definition of colchicine resistance was made and a protocol was created for prolongation of treatment intervals of biologic agents.

It is essential in predicting cancer patients' susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease outcomes due to varying furin expressions in tumor tissues. In this study, we analyzed furin's expression, methylation, mutation rate, functional enrichment, survival rate and COVID-19 outcomes in normal and cancer tissues using online databases, and our IHC. As a result, furin presented with biased expression profiles in normal tissues, showing 12.25-fold higher than ACE2 in the lungs. The furin expression in tumors were significantly increased in ESCA and TGCT, and decreased in DLBC and THYM, indicating furin may play critical mechanistic functions in COVID-19 viral entry into cells in these cancer patients. Line with furin over/downexpression, furin promoter hypo-/hyper-methylation may be the regulatory cause of disease and lead to pathogenesis of ESCA and THYM. Furthermore, presence of FURIN-201 isoform with functional domains (P_proprotein, Peptidase_S8 and S8_pro-domain) is highest in all cancer types in comparison to other isoforms, demonstrating its use in tumorigenesis and SARS-Cov-2 entry into tumor tissues. Furin mutation frequency was highest in UCES, and its mutation might elevate ACE2 expression in LUAD and UCEC, reduce ACE2 expression in COAD, elevate HSPA5 expression in PAAD, and elevate TMPRSS2 expression in BRCA. These results showed that furin mutations mostly increased expression of ACE2, HSPA5, and TMPRSS2 in certain cancers, indicating furin mutations might facilitate COVID-19 cell entry in cancer patients. In addition, high expression of furin was significantly inversely correlated with long overall survival (OS) in LGG and correlated with long OS in COAD and KIRC, indicating that it could be used as a favorable prognostic marker for cancer patients' survival. GO and KEGG demonstrated that furin was mostly enriched in genes for metabolic and biosynthetic processes, retinal dehydrogenase activity, tRNA methyltransferase activity, and genes involving COVID-19, further supporting its role in COVID-19 and cancer metabolism. Moreover, Cordycepin (CD) inhibited furin expression in a dosage dependent manner. Altogether, furin's high expression might not only implies increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and higher severity of COVID-19 symptoms in cancer patients, but also it highlights the need for cancer treatment and therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. CD might have a potential to develop an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug through inhibiting furin expression.","output":"COVID-19 disease and malignant cancers: The impact for the furin gene expression in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), early reports indicated that certain groups of patients were at risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections. This included patients with arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases [1]. Many of those patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme 1 inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). SARS-CoV2- utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a membrane receptor to enter target cells [2]. Due to different chemical structures with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs. ACEIs and ARBs may increase the amount of ACE-2 formation and, theoretically, increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, thus inducing inflammation [2]. The fear that ACEI or ARB might facilitate COVID-19 infections and increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection emerged [3]. The question is all the more delicate as arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are very common in the general population, especially in the elderly, for which ACEIs/ARBs are prescribed in 25-30% of cases [4]. In response, many scientific organizations and journals issued statements cautioning against discontinuation of these agents due to the lack of evidence of harm, and because discontinuation would predictably lead to uncontrolled blood pressure with its own cardiovascular disease risks.

Methods: We estimated the risk for prevalent hypertension with incident respiratory diseases over mean follow-up of 8 years among 377,143 British participants in the UK Biobank. Mendelian randomization of blood pressure on pneumonia was implemented using 75 independent, genome-wide significant variants associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures among 299,024 individuals not in the UK Biobank. Secondary analyses with pulmonary function tests were performed. Findings: In total, 107,310 participants (30%) had hypertension at UK Biobank enrollment, and 9,969 (3%) developed pneumonia during follow-up. Prevalent hypertension was independently associated with increased risk for incident pneumonia (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.29-1.43; p < 0.001), as well as other incident respiratory diseases. Genetic predisposition to a 5 mm Hg increase in blood pressure was associated with increased risk for incident pneumonia for systolic blood pressure (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04-1.13; p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20; p = 0.005). Additionally, consistent with epidemiologic associations, increased blood pressure genetic risk was significantly associated with reduced performance on pulmonary function tests (p < 0.001).

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Despite great advances in therapy, multiple myeloma is still a largely incurable disease, therefore the importance of salvage therapies is paramount. The first oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide-dexamethasone is a tolerable, orally administered regime, which has become available for Hungarian relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma patients from April 2015 in the Named Patient Program. OBJECTIVE Our goal was to investigate the long-time progression-free surviving patient population treated with the ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone triplet. METHOD We retrospectively studied a total of 80 patients from 7 centers who received the triplet combination. Survival analyses were performed. RESULTS Two-third of the patients responded: the overall response rate was 63.75%. 14 patients (17.5%) did not respond/had stable disease and 15 patients (18.75%) outright progressed upon therapy. Although progression-free survival was only 10.6 months for the entire patient cohort, the disease in a subgroup of 16 patients did not progress within two years. In fact, 11 of them were still in sustained remission after 3 years of therapy. Our goal was to analyze the characteristics of this subgroup. DISCUSSION The idea of long-term therapy of multiple myeloma is gaining widespread acceptance. Therefore it is important to know which patients may benefit the most from certain therapies. Among these 16 long-term responder patients, reciprocal translocation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain seemed to lack an adverse impact on progression-free survival; comparable to trisomies, both curves had a progression-free plateau. The International Staging System (ISS) score at the start of therapy did not predict long-term survivorship. Most of the side effects in this subgroup were mild, manageable, none led to therapy discontinuation. CONCLUSION Ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone was confirmed to be an effective and safe combination for relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma, and one-sixth of the treated patients were able to receive it for several years, effectively. This fully oral therapeutic option is at its best during the present COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, attempts were made to decipher the codon usage trends and discover the major evolutionary forces that influence the patterns of codon usage in MCV with special reference to sub-types 1 and 2, MCV-1 and MCV-2, respectively. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) codon usage patterns of MCV-1 and MCV-2 are identical; (2) SCUB (synonymous codon usage bias) patterns of MCV-1 and MCV-2 slightly deviate from that of human host to avoid affecting the fitness of host; and (3) translational selection predominantly shapes the SCUB of MCV-1 and MCV-2. Various codon usage indices viz. relative codon usage value, effective number of codons and codon adaptation index were calculated to infer the nature of codon usage. Correspondence analysis and correlation analysis were performed to assess the relative contribution of silent base contents and significance of codon usage indices in defining bias in codon usage. Among the tested hypotheses, only the second and third hypotheses were accepted.","output":"Strategies and Patterns of Codon Bias in Molluscum Contagiosum Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, resources in intensive care units (ICUs) have the potential to be inadequate to treat all those who might benefit. Therefore, it is paramount to identify the views of the community regarding how to allocate such resources. This study aims to quantify Australian community preferences for ventilation allocation. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was designed and administrated to an adult Australian online panel. Each survey respondent answered 12 choice sets from a total design of 120. Each choice set placed the respondent in the role of hypothetical decision maker, prioritising care between two patients. Conditional logit, mixed logit regression and latent class analysis were used to analyse the data. Additionally, we asked a series of attitudinal questions about different methods of making such decisions in practice, focusing on who should be responsible. RESULTS: A total of 1050 community members completed the survey and responded to each choice. Dimensions considered most important were age, likely effectiveness, smoking status, whether the person has dependents, whether they are a healthcare worker, and whether they have a disability or not. Estimating marginal rates of substitution between patient characteristics and chance of survival if ventilated yielded values of up to 30 percentage points if the patient was 70 years old relative to being 30. However, respondents typically said they would prefer such decisions to be made by medical professionals. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the preferences of the community to allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of such information should be treated with some caution as the underlying reason for such preferences are unclear, and respondents themselves preferred the decision to be made by others.","output":"Public Preferences for Allocating Ventilators in an Intensive Care Unit: A Discrete Choice Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To address the policy question of how e-scooters interact with existing public mobility options, we conduct a spatiotemporal analysis of e-scooters relationships with public transit and station-based bikeshare in Washington DC. Results suggest that e-scooters have both competing and complementary effects on transit and bikeshare. The service areas of the three modes largely overlap, and most e-scooter trips could have been made by transit or bikeshare. A travel-time-based analysis further reveals that when choosing e-scooters over transit, travelers pay a price premium but save some travel time. The price premium was greater during COVID-19 but the associated travel-time savings were smaller. This implies that public health considerations rather than time-cost tradeoffs were the main determinant of travel behavior during COVID-19. In addition, we find that e-scooters enhance mobility services for some underserved neighborhoods. Before COVID-19, about 10% of all e-scooter trips were taken to connect with the Metrorail system. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"A spatiotemporal analysis of e-scooters relationships with transit and station-based bikeshare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) replication in actively growing DBT and 17Cl-1 cells resulted in the inhibition of host cellular DNA synthesis and the accumulation of infected cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle. UV-irradiated MHV failed to inhibit host cellular DNA synthesis. MHV infection in quiescent 17Cl-1 cells that had been synchronized in the G(0) phase by serum deprivation prevented infected cells from entering the S phase after serum stimulation. MHV replication inhibited hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), the event that is necessary for cell cycle progression through late G(1) and into the S phase. While the amounts of the cellular cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1), and p16(INK4a) did not change in infected cells, MHV infection in asynchronous cultures induced a clear reduction in the amounts of Cdk4 and G(1) cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, D3, and E) in both DBT and 17Cl-1 cells and a reduction in Cdk6 levels in 17Cl-1 cells. Infection also resulted in a decrease in Cdk2 activity in both cell lines. MHV infection in quiescent 17Cl-1 cells prevented normal increases in Cdk4, Cdk6, cyclin D1, and cyclin D3 levels after serum stimulation. The amounts of cyclin D2 and cyclin E were not increased significantly after serum stimulation in mock-infected cells, whereas they were decreased in MHV-infected cells, suggesting the possibility that MHV infection may induce cyclin D2 and cyclin E degradation. Our data suggested that a reduction in the amounts of G(1) cyclin-Cdk complexes in MHV-infected cells led to a reduction in Cdk activities and insufficient hyperphosphorylation of pRb, resulting in inhibition of the cell cycle in the G(0)/G(1) phase.","output":"Murine coronavirus replication induces cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The social well-being and health of citizens of all countries has been greatly tested during the pandemic of COVID-19.

Until that point there existed no evidence concerning the views of health professionals on decriminalisation or on their willingness to be involved in abortion care. The purpose of this study was to address this lack of evidence, including all categories of health professionals working in obstetrics and gynaecology units in Northern Ireland. METHODS: The online survey was targeted at medical, nursing and midwifery staff working in the obstetrics and gynaecology units in each Health and Social Care (HSC) Trust in Northern Ireland. The survey was issued via clinical directors in each Trust using the REDCap platform. RESULTS: The findings showed widespread support for decriminalisation of abortion up until 24 weeks' gestation (n=169, 54%). The majority of clinicians stated they were willing to provide abortions in certain circumstances (which were undefined) (n=188, 60% medical abortions; n=157, 50% surgical abortions). Despite regional variation, the results show that there are sufficient numbers of clinicians to provide a service within each HSC Trust. The results indicate that many clinicians who report a religious affiliation are also supportive of decriminalisation (n=46, 51% Catholic; n=53, 45% Protestant) and are willing to provide care, countering the assumption that those of faith would all raise conscientious objections to service provision. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study are very encouraging for the development, implementation and delivery of local abortion care within HSC Trusts in Northern Ireland and should be of value in informing commissioners and providers about the design of a service model and its underpinning training programmes.","output":"Abortion provision in Northern Ireland: the views of health professionals working in obstetrics and gynaecology units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Current simulations for laparoscopic suturing do not reflect the complexity of the skills required in the operating room. The purpose of this study was to develop three novel advanced suturing tasks with assessment metrics and to collect validity evidence for their measures of suturing skill. METHODS We developed three tasks based on training gaps identified through a previous needs assessment: needle handling (NH), suturing under tension (UT), and continuous suturing (CS). Minimally invasive surgeons (MIS) and senior surgical residents (SR) completed these tasks and a questionnaire regarding their educational value. Performance was assessed by two raters based on time and accuracy. Validity was assessed by comparing performance according to the level of training and self-reported experience. The inter-rater reliability and internal consistency of the tasks were calculated. RESULTS Thirty-one subjects (13 MIS, 18 SR) were enrolled in the study (median age 32; 77% male). Compared to the SR group, the MIS group had significantly greater scores on all tasks. While all MIS surgeons completed the three tasks within the allotted time, six (33%) residents could not complete at least one out of the three tasks. Laparoscopic suturing experience correlated positively with the scores of all tasks (NH 0.51, UT 0.70, CS 0.65. p < 0.01). Inter-rater reliability for all tasks was 0.99, and internal consistency was 0.80. The majority of participants agreed that the tasks were relevant to practice, helped improve technical competence, and adequately measured suturing ability. CONCLUSIONS This study provides validity evidence for three novel advanced laparoscopic suturing tasks. Performance on all tasks correlated significantly with training level and self-reported experience. Integrating these tasks into educational curricula may help improve residents' suturing skills and better prepare residents for the operating room.","output":"New models for advanced laparoscopic suturing: taking it to the next level."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The treatment of measles pneumonitis in immunocompromised adults is not established.

At a theoretical level, we build the cooperative game, and compute the Shapley values, within a milestone model in drug combination theory, the Bliss independence model.

SARS-CoV-2 entry was facilitated by DNA damage caused by telomere attrition or extrinsic genotoxic stress and hampered by inhibition of DNA damage response (DDR). Mechanistic analysis revealed that DDR increased expression of ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, by activation of transcription factor c-Jun in vitro and in vivo.

Nurses meet patients with coronavirus disease and offer care for newly communicable diseases. Despite global and national efforts to prevent the spread, the outbreak is still on a rise, and studies on the health care behaviors of nurses were scarce in the study setting. Therefore, this study was intended in addressing nurses intention to care for coronavirus disease 19 patients and its determinants among nurses working at Debre Tabor town Health Care Institutions, 2020. METHODOLOGY: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 163 nurses working at health care institutions of Debre Tabor Town, from June 01 to 15/2020. The data were collected using tools with a self-administration questionnaire adapted from the theory of planned behavior and different kinds of literatures. All nurses working at Debre Tabor health care institutions were included. Data were entered using Epi-data 4.2.0.0 statistical software, and analysis was done by Stata version 14 statistical software. Binary logistic regression model was used for analysis. Strength of association was measured using the odds ratio with 95% CI, and the level of significance was estimated at P-value 0.05. RESULTS: Nurses intention to care for COVID-19 patient was 59.5% (95% CI; 58.7:60.3). Having better working experience (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =2.3:95% CI; 1.120, 4.910), caring experience for infectious disease (AOR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.10, 5.50), good perceived behavioral control (AOR=2.33; 95% CI: 1.13, 4.8), and subjective norms (AOR= 2.14; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.36) were significantly associated with intention of caring behavior. CONCLUSION: Nurses intention to care for COVID-19 patients was low. Working experience, the experience of caring for infectious disease, self-efficacy, and subjective norm were independently related with nurses caring intention.

As public health courses in Ontario universities have moved online due to this pandemic, instructors were required to simulate their teaching online while maintaining student engagement. Previous research has shown that there is a lack of description for the development of online public health courses. As such, the objective of this article is to outline the development and layout of a Professional Development Studio course offered in the Masters of Public Health program at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. We use the Salmon model, previously described by Salmon and colleagues in 2013, to form the course outline. The Salmon model provides a five-stage framework for the development of a concise, engaging, and impactful online course. Based on student feedback, we found that the Salmon model positively shaped the development of the course by aiding the formulation of a course layout that was easily accessible, discussion threads to communicate in an inclusive and safe space, and relevant assessments requiring the use of tools to make judgments and appropriately disseminate information publicly. We conclude that the Salmon model is a helpful framework to use in developing an engaging online public health course. Further assessments based on student feedback should be completed to continually evolve the online course to better tailor the needs and interests of public health students preparing them for the public health workforce.

From casual cursing and negative remarks to more targeted and damaging cyberbullying cases, the gaming industry continues to see an increasing number of players engaging in these exchanges. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in the number of active gamers due to social distancing and stay-at-home orders. As a result, cases of cyberbullying and toxicity have increased by 40% on popular gaming platforms such as Discord [4].

As the principal proteolytic pathway in the cytosol and the nucleus, the UPS serves two main functions: the quality control function (i.e., removal of damaged, misfolded, and functionally incompetent proteins) and a major regulatory function (i.e., targeted degradation of a variety of short-lived regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle control, signal transduction cascades, and regulation of gene expression and metabolic pathways). Aberrations in the UPS are implicated in numerous human pathologies such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmunity, inflammation, or infectious diseases. Therefore, the UPS has become an attractive target for drug discovery and development. For the past two decades, much research has been focused on identifying and developing compounds that target specific components of the UPS. Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of both second-generation proteasome inhibitors and inhibitors of ubiquitinating/deubiquitinating enzymes. With the feature of unique structure and bioactivity, secondary metabolites (natural products) serve as the lead compounds in the development of new therapeutic drugs. This review, for the first time, summarizes fungal secondary metabolites found to act as inhibitors of the UPS components.","output":"Fungal Secondary Metabolites as Inhibitors of the UbiquitinCProteasome System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with 2019 novel Coronavirus infection are probably showing positive testing results again.

The chemotaxonomic properties of strain CYP1-5T were consistent within the genus Actinomadura. Cell-wall peptidoglycan of this strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. Galactose, madurose, and ribose were presented as the diagnostic sugars in whole-cell hydrolysates. The major menaquinone was MK-9(H6). Major cellular fatty acids were iso-C16:0 and C16:0. Phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylinositol mannoside were observed as predominant phospholipids. Based on the results of phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain CYP1-5T was constituent with the genus Actinomadura and was closely related to Actinomadura syzygii GKU157T (99.5%) and Actinomadura chibensis IFM 10266T (= JCM 14158T) (98.2%). The draft genome size of strain CYP1-5T was 9.30 Mb with 72.2 mol% of G + C content. Strain CYP1-5T showed ANIb values of 94.9% with A. syzygii GKU157T and 93.2% with A. chibensis JCM 14158T. Phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and genome data support that strain CYP1-5T could be discriminated from its closest relatives, representing a novel species of the genus Actinomadura, for which the name Actinomadura decatromicini sp. nov. is proposed.

Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a key transcription factor activated in response to virus infection and is largely responsible for establishing an antiviral state in the infected host. Studies in Irf3(?/?) mice have demonstrated the absence of IRF3 imparts a high degree of susceptibility to a wide range of viral infections. Virus infection causes the activation of IRF3 to transcribe type-I interferon (e.g., IFN), which is responsible for inducing the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which act at specific stages to limit virus replication. In addition to its transcriptional function, IRF3 is also activated to trigger apoptosis of virus-infected cells, as a mechanism to restrict virus spread within the host, in a pathway called RIG-I-like receptor-induced IRF3 mediated pathway of apoptosis (RIPA). These dual functions of IRF3 work in concert to mediate protective immunity against virus infection. These two pathways are activated differentially by the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of IRF3. Moreover, PTMs regulate not only IRF3 activation and function, but also protein stability. Consequently, many viruses utilize viral proteins or hijack cellular enzymes to inhibit IRF3 functions. This review will describe the PTMs that regulate IRF3s RIPA and transcriptional activities and use coronavirus as a model virus capable of antagonizing IRF3-mediated innate immune responses. A thorough understanding of the cellular control of IRF3 and the mechanisms that viruses use to subvert this system is critical for developing novel therapies for virus-induced pathologies.","output":"Transcriptional and Non-Transcriptional Activation, Posttranslational Modifications, and Antiviral Functions of Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 and Viral Antagonism by the SARS-Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: to investigate both muscular manifestations and CK levels of a large cohort of patients with COVID-19 infection and to determine whether hyperckemia is associated with morbidity and mortality. Methods: Data of 615 patients discharged from ASST Ovest Milanese (Milan, Lombardy, Italy) with final diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were retrospectively extracted from electronical medical records from 21 February to 1 May 2020. Patients were descriptively analyzed with respect to the following variables: sex, age, muscular manifestations (including myalgia/arthralgia and fatigue), respiratory involvement (SARS pneumonia or respiratory failure) and history of falls. Association between patients characteristics and CK levels was investigated. In addition, the proportion of patients who died following access to the ER was calculated. Finally, the effect of CK levels and other patients features on mortality was estimated using a logistic regression model. Results: 176 (28.6%) patients had raised serum CK levels. 88 (14.3%) had muscular manifestations, of which 81 (13.2%) complained fatigue and 17 (2.8%) had myalgia and/or arthralgia. CK levels were significantly associated with respiratory involvement and fatal outcome. Conclusions: Our study provides preliminary evidence that hyperckemia is a predictor of respiratory involvement and fatal outcome in patients with COVID-19 infection. For patients with muscle damage symptoms, screening for COVID-19 infection is recommended together with the dosage of CK level.","output":"Muscle manifestations and CK levels in COVID infection: results of a large cohort of patients inside a Pandemic COVID-19 Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this communication is to present a universal model for disseminating awareness on AR across the globe at every stratum of the socioeconomic spectrum by increasing the knowledge gap.

We were set to follow 24 students from diverse admissions channels for three years, during which we held meetings and collected writing materials. In October 2019, an unprecedented wave of civil unrest led to the closure of the campus and ended face-to-face meetings. In early 2020, just as the university was resuming contact with students, the COVID-19 pandemic again forced the suspension of in-person meetings. This article addresses methodological, ethical, and epistemological dilemmas involved in researching literacy in higher education under challenging circumstances. Moreover, understanding literacy as a social practice provided a theoretical framework useful to recognise emerging results as valuable information on literacy knowledge. The unexpected findings on student writing were shaped by the context of the crisis, in which agency, student engagement, and sponsorship became intrinsically linked to national events.

An in-depth qualitative case study of two purposely selected state-funded schools, including interviews with teachers, observations of school activities including meal breaks and a qualitative survey with parents was done. Inductive thematic analysis was used to explore emerging themes. Additional interviews with the leadership team from four further schools were used to develop and refine emerging themes. Four main themes emerged from the data: competing pressures, school environment, personnel and policy. Results demonstrate that schools recognize they have role to play in promoting healthy lifestyle behaviours to pupils; however, several significant barriers were identified such as lack of government support and regulation, school structures and organization, focus on core subjects, business-run canteens and lack of family and community engagement. Given the importance of maintaining a healthy weight throughout the life course, schools have an important role to play in creating healthy environments in which students can easily make a healthy choice. Future school promotion initiatives need to consider addressing the barriers that schools face by working with them and the communities in which they are embedded.","output":"Enablers and barriers English secondary schools face in promoting healthy diet and physical activity behaviours"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a theoretical framework for the study of spreading processes in structured metapopulations, with heterogeneous agents, subjected to different recurrent mobility patterns. We propose to represent the heterogeneity in the composition of the metapopulations as layers in a multiplex network, where nodes would correspond to geographical areas and layers account for the mobility patterns of agents of the same class. We analyze classical epidemic models within this framework and obtain an excellent agreement with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. This agreement allows us to derive analytical expressions of the epidemic threshold and to face the challenge of characterizing a real multiplex metapopulation, the city of Medelln in Colombia, where different recurrent mobility patterns are observed depending on the socioeconomic class of the agents. Our framework allows us to unveil the geographical location of those patches that trigger the epidemic state at the critical point. A careful exploration reveals that social mixing between classes and mobility crucially determines these critical patches and, more importantly, it can produce abrupt changes of the critical properties of the epidemic onset.","output":"Spreading Processes in Multiplex Metapopulations Containing Different Mobility Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has disrupted cervical screening in several countries, due to a range of policy-, health-service and participant-related factors. Using three well-established models of cervical cancer natural history adapted to simulate screening across four countries, we compared the impact of a range of standardised screening disruption scenarios in four countries that vary in their cervical cancer prevention programs. All scenarios assumed a 6- or 12-month disruption followed by a rapid catch-up of missed screens. Cervical screening disruptions could increase cervical cancer cases by up to 5-6%. In all settings, more than 60% of the excess cancer burden due to disruptions are likely to have occurred in women aged less than 50 years in 2020, including settings where women in their 30s have previously been offered HPV vaccination. Approximately 15-30% of cancers predicted to result from disruptions could be prevented by maintaining colposcopy and precancer treatment services during any disruption period. Disruptions to primary screening had greater adverse effects in situations where women due to attend for screening in 2020 had cytology (vs. HPV) as their previous primary test. Rapid catch-up would dramatically increase demand for HPV tests in 2021, which it may not be feasible to meet because of competing demands on the testing machines and reagents due to COVID tests. These findings can inform future prioritisation strategies for catch-up that balance potential constraints on resourcing with clinical need.","output":"Impact of disruptions and recovery for established cervical screening programs across a range of high-income country program designs, using COVID-19 as an example: A modelled analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Iron deficiency is common in patients with heart failure (HF).

The objective of this study was to estimate the cost\\\\effectiveness of FCM compared with placebo in iron\\\\deficient patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, stabilised after an episode of acute HF, using data from the AFFIRM\\\\AHF trial from Italian, UK, US and Swiss payer perspectives. METHODS AND RESULTS: A lifetime Markov model was built to characterise outcomes in patients according to the AFFIRM\\\\AHF trial. Health states were defined using the 12\\\\item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ\\\\12). Subsequent HHF were incorporated using a negative binomial regression model with cardiovascular and all\\\\cause mortality incorporated via parametric survival analysis. Direct healthcare costs (2020 GBP/USD/EUR/CHF) and utility values were sourced from published literature and AFFIRM\\\\AHF. Modelled outcomes indicated that treatment with FCM was dominant (cost saving with additional health gains) in the UK, USA and Switzerland, and highly cost\\\\effective in Italy [incremental cost\\\\effectiveness ratio (ICER) EUR 1269 per quality\\\\adjusted life\\\\year (QALY)]. Results were driven by reduced costs for HHF events combined with QALY gains of 0.43C0.44, attributable to increased time in higher KCCQ states (representing better functional outcomes). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses demonstrated data robustness, with the ICER remaining dominant or highly cost\\\\effective under a wide range of scenarios, including increasing treatment costs and various patient subgroups, despite a moderate increase in costs for de novo HF and smaller QALY gains for ischaemic aetiology.

In the last 30a?years, patient navigation in oncological care has expanded internationally and has been shown to significantly improve patient care experience, especially in the United States cancer care system. Like oncology care, patients who require epilepsy care face socioeconomic and healthcare system barriers and are at significant risk of morbidity and mortality if their care needs are not met. Although shortcomings in epilepsy care are longstanding, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues as both patients and providers have reported significant delays in care secondary to the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, preliminary studies had shown the potential efficacy of patient navigation in improving epilepsy care.

While several vaccines for prevention of COVID-19 have already been registered by the regulatory authorities, the problem is that the substitution rate of this virus is estimated to be one change per 2 weeks, thus mutations could arise that threaten the efficacy of vaccines. Unfortunately, there is no current evidence from random clinical trials to recommend any specific post-exposure treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease. Here we propose an innovative superinfection therapeutic (SIT) strategy, which could complement the development of prophylactic vaccines. SIT is based on clinical observations that unrelated harmless viruses might interact in patients infected with pathogenic virus. During SIT, the patient benefits from superinfection with an apathogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus such as the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), which is a powerful activator of the interferon-dependent antiviral gene program.

Various outbreak models for COVID-19 are being utilized by researchers throughout the world to get well-versed decisions and impose significant control measures. Amid the standard methods for COVID-19 worldwide epidemic prediction, easy statistical, as well as epidemiological methods have got more consideration by researchers and authorities. One main difficulty in controlling the spreading of COVID-19 is the inadequacy and lack of medical tests for detecting as well as identifying a solution. To solve this problem, a few statistical-based advances are being enhanced and turn into a partial resolution up-to some level. To deal with the challenges of the medical field, a broad range of intelligent based methods, frameworks, and equipment have been recommended by Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning. As ML and DL have the ability of identifying and predicting patterns in complex large datasets, they are recognized as a suitable procedure for producing effective solutions for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, a perspective research has been conducted in the applicability of intelligent systems such as ML, DL and others in solving COVID-19 related outbreak issues.

The early symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. Therefore, during the epidemic, patients with similar symptoms will be tested for multiple pathogens at the same time. In order to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, China has taken many measures. Under this special situation, have the types and epidemic characteristics of respiratory viruses changed? The nucleic acid test results of influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as the antibody test results of 8 common respiratory viruses of Jinan Central Hospital were collected before and after the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, and age distribution and time distribution characteristics were statisticed. Furthermore the epidemiological characteristics of this new virus before and after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was compared. In the early stage of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus nucleic acid test samples were large, and the positive rate of the three viruses was high. After that, the sample size and positive rate decreased significantly. No co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses was found in our hospital. The sample size before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was larger than that after the outbreak, but the positive rate of the outbreak was lower than that after the outbreak. And the infection rate of children decreased in the middle and late stages of the epidemic. This is because since January 23, in order to prevent the spread of the new crown epidemic, my country has adopted measures such as wearing masks, not gathering together, and quarantining at home. This not only prevents the spread of the new crown virus, but also prevents the common respiratory tract. The spread of the virus has reduced the incidence of residents.","output":"Epidemic characteristics of respiratory viruses in hospitals in a Chinese city during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Informed by the differential susceptibility to media effects model (DSMM), the current study aims to investigate associations of COVID-19-related social media use with mental health outcomes and to uncover potential mechanisms underlying the links. METHODS: A sample of 512 (62.5% women; Mage = 22.12 years, SD = 2.47) Chinese college students participated in this study from 24 March to 1 April 2020 via online questionnaire. They completed measures of social media use, the COVID-19 stressor, negative affect, secondary traumatic stress (STS), depression, and anxiety as well as covariates. RESULTS: As expected, results from regression analyses indicated that a higher level of social media use was associated with worse mental health. More exposure to disaster news via social media was associated with greater depression for participants with high (but not low) levels of the disaster stressor. Moreover, path analysis showed negative affect mediated the relationship of social media use and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the disaster stressor may be a risk factor that amplifies the deleterious impact of social media use on depression. In addition, excessive exposure to disaster on social media may trigger negative affect, which may in turn contribute to mental health problems. Future interventions to improve mental health should consider elements of both disaster stressor and negative affect.","output":"Social Media Use and Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Moderator Role of Disaster Stressor and Mediator Role of Negative Affect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study aims to follow the fluctuations in affective responses to COVID-19 such as anxiety, stress, anger, and fear of the community parallel to the changes in the regulations and the course of the pandemic.

Accumulating data suggest that the incidence of cardiac arrest and its outcome are adversely affected during the Covid-19 period. This may be further exacerbated by drug-related cardiac toxicity of Covid-19 treatment regimens. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to Covid-19 associated cardiac arrest is imperative, not only in order to improve its effective management but also to maximize preventive measures. Herein we discuss available epidemiological data on cardiac arrest during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as possible associated causes and pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight gaps in evidence warranting further investigation. The risk of transmission during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is also discussed in this review. Finally, we summarize currently recommended guidelines on CPR for Covid-19 patients including CPR in patients with cardiac arrest due to suspected drug-related cardiac toxicity in an effort to underscore the most important common points and discuss discrepancies proposed by established international societies.","output":"Cardiac arrest and drug-related cardiac toxicity in the Covid-19 era.

Overexpression of this kinase is linked with various cancers in humans due to its dual involvement in cell development. Furthermore, emerging evidence has revealed that inhibiting CDK7 has anti-cancer effects, driving the development of novel and more cost-effective inhibitors with enhanced selectivity for CDK7 over other CDKs. In the present investigation, a pharmacophore-based approach was utilized to identify potential hit compounds against CDK7. The generated pharmacophore models were validated and used as 3D queries to screen 55,578 natural drug-like compounds. The obtained compounds were then subjected to molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to predict their binding mode with CDK7. The molecular dynamics simulation trajectories were subsequently used to calculate binding affinity, revealing four hitsZINC20392430, SN00112175, SN00004718, and SN00262261having a better binding affinity towards CDK7 than the reference inhibitors (CT7001 and THZ1). The binding mode analysis displayed hydrogen bond interactions with the hinge region residues Met94 and Glu95, DFG motif residue Asp155, ATP-binding site residues Thr96, Asp97, and Gln141, and quintessential residue outside the kinase domain, Cys312 of CDK7. The in silico selectivity of the hits was further checked by docking with CDK2, the close homolog structure of CDK7. Additionally, the detailed pharmacokinetic properties were predicted, revealing that our hits have better properties than established CDK7 inhibitors CT7001 and THZ1.

This study aimed to investigate the suitable timing to transfer D6 blastocysts in FET cycles and to identify factors affecting clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and early miscarriage rate (EMR) in FET cycles with blastocysts. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1788 FET cycles with blastocysts. There were 518 cycles with D6 blastocysts, and 1270 cycles with blastocysts formed and cryopreserved on day 5 (D5 blastocysts) (D5 group). According to the blastocyst transfer timing, the cycles with D6 blastocysts were divided into cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 5 (D6-on-D5 group, 103 cycles) and cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 6 (D6-on-D6 group, 415 cycles). The chi-square test, independent t-test or Mann-Whitney test, and logistic regression analysis were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The CPR and implantation rate (IR) were significantly higher in the D6-on-D5 group than in the D6-on-D6 group (55.3% vs. 37.3%, 44.8% vs. 32.6%, P < 0.01). The CPR and IR were significantly higher in the D5 group than in the D6-on-D5 group (66.0% vs. 55.3%, 62.1% vs. 44.8%, P < 0.05), and the EMR was significantly lower in the D5 group than in the D6-on-D5 group (11.2% vs. 21.1%, P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that transfer D6 blastocysts on day 5, instead of day 6, could significantly increase the CPR (odds ratio[OR]: 2.031, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.296-3.182, P = 0.002). FET cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 5 had a higher EMR than those with D5 blastocysts (OR: 2.165, 95% CI: 1.040-4.506, P = 0.039).

The scatter correction algorithm (SCA) is a post-processing algorithm aiming to reduce scatter within portable images. This study aimed to assess whether the SCA improved image quality (IQ) in portable CXRs. METHODS: Objective and subjective IQ assessments were undertaken on both phantom and clinical images, respectively. For objective analysis, attenuators were placed on the anterior surface of the patients thorax to simulate pathologies present within uniform regions of the phantoms lung and heart. Phantom CXRs were acquired with three different tube-current-times (mAs). Phantom images were processed with different SCA strengths. Contrast to noise ratios (CNR) within the attenuator were determined for each algorithm strength and compared to non-SCA images. For subjective analysis, two independent radiologists graded 30 clinical images with and without the SCA activated. The images were graded for IQ in different anatomical structures and overall diagnostic confidence. RESULTS: Objectively, most strengths of the SCA improved the CNR in both regions. However, a detrimental effect was recorded for some algorithm strengths in regions of high contrast. Subjectively, both observers recorded the SCA significantly improved IQ in clinical CXRs in all anatomical regions. Observers indicated the greatest improvement in the lung and hilar regions, and least improvement in the chest wall and bone. All images with and without the SCA were deemed diagnostic.

There has been a surge in the antiviral compounds from natural resources along with some therapies. Cyanobacteria are the fruitful reservoir of many metabolites like sulfated polysaccharides and lectins that possess strong antiviral activities and immunity boosting effects. However, the research in this field has been relatively under-developed. The current research highlights important features of cyanobacterial antiviral biomaterials, benefits and drawbacks of cyanobacterial drugs, challenges, future perspectives as well as overview of drugs against COVID-19. In addition, we have described mutated variants and transmission rate of coronaviruses. The current research suggests that cyanobacterial species and their extracts have promising applications as potentially antiviral drug biomaterials against COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This identity construction is complex and may encompass contradicting and competing goals. The adjustment to school is seen as a relevant acculturation marker. An increasingly prominent multidimensional construct is students school engagement because it can provide an insight into the way students feel and interact with the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral domains of school. Successful adjustment to school culture, and acculturation in general, can be closely related to school engagement. There is yet no common knowledge about the role bicultural national and/or ethnic identity plays for the three dimensions of school engagement. The present study focusses on minority students in Germany who report a strong bicultural identity (in comparison with single stronger ethnic or national identities, as well as weaker bicultural identification) to explain students emotional, cognitive, and behavioral school engagement when controlling for gender, SES, and cultural capital. Data is derived from paperCpencil questionnaires administered in secondary schools in Germany. Regression analyses show that students with a stronger bicultural identity have a significantly higher emotional, cognitive, and behavioral school engagement than their peers with a weaker bicultural identity, when controlling for gender, SES, and cultural capital. The results hint at the relevance of fostering students ethnic, but also their national, cultural identity to support their school engagement.

However, heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 testing may introduce biased estimates depending on analytic design. We aimed to explore the potential for collider bias in a large study of disease determinants, and evaluate individual, environmental and social determinants associated with SARS-CoV-2 testing and diagnosis among residents of Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We explored the potential for collider bias and characterized individual, environmental and social determinants of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using cross-sectional analyses among 14.7 million community-dwelling people in Ontario, Canada. Among those with a diagnosis, we used separate analytic designs to compare predictors of people testing positive versus negative; symptomatic people testing positive versus testing negative; and people testing positive versus people not testing positive (i.e., testing negative or not being tested). Our analyses included tests conducted between Mar. 1 and June 20, 2020. RESULTS: Of 14 695 579 people, we found that 758 691 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 25 030 (3.3%) had a positive test result. The further the odds of testing from the null, the more variability we generally observed in the odds of diagnosis across analytic design, particularly among individual factors. We found that there was less variability in testing by social determinants across analytic designs. Residing in areas with the highest household density (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75-1.98), highest proportion of essential workers (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.48-1.69), lowest educational attainment (adjusted OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26-1.41) and highest proportion of recent immigrants (adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15) were consistently related to increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis regardless of analytic design. INTERPRETATION: Where testing is limited, our results suggest that risk factors may be better estimated using population comparators rather than test-negative comparators. Optimizing COVID-19 responses necessitates investment in and sufficient coverage of structural interventions tailored to heterogeneity in social determinants of risk, including household crowding, occupation and structural racism.","output":"Individual and social determinants of SARS-CoV-2 testing and positivity in Ontario, Canada: a population-wide study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has forced GME programs and medical students to make last-minute adjustments in the resident selection process","output":"A Perfect Match?

This study developed a research model by integrating perceived quality into the TPB and examined the relation between HSR passengers service quality and intention to travel in the future and the mediating effect of TPB attributes. It is found that perceived train service quality and perceived travel quality have a significant influence on the TPB attributes, which further influence HSR travelers travel intention. This study contributes practical implications to destinations and the travel industry that they might attract visitors by marketing the corresponding HSR train service quality and travel experience quality.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the characteristics, changes over time, outcomes, and severity risk factors of children with SARS-CoV-2 within the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study of encounters with end dates before September 24, 2021, was conducted at 56 N3C facilities throughout the US. Participants included children younger than 19 years at initial SARS-CoV-2 testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Case incidence and severity over time, demographic and comorbidity severity risk factors, vital sign and laboratory trajectories, clinical outcomes, and acute COVID-19 vs multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and Delta vs pre-Delta variant differences for children with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 1 068 410 children were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 167 262 test results (15.6%) were positive (82 882 [49.6%] girls; median age, 11.9 [IQR, 6.0-16.1] years). Among the 10 245 children (6.1%) who were hospitalized, 1423 (13.9%) met the criteria for severe disease: mechanical ventilation (796 [7.8%]), vasopressor-inotropic support (868 [8.5%]), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (42 [0.4%]), or death (131 [1.3%]). Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.21-1.56), Black/African American race (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06-1.47), obesity (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.41), and several pediatric complex chronic condition (PCCC) subcategories were associated with higher severity disease. Vital signs and many laboratory test values from the day of admission were predictive of peak disease severity. Variables associated with increased odds for MIS-C vs acute COVID-19 included male sex (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.33-1.90), Black/African American race (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.17-1.77), younger than 12 years (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.51-2.18), obesity (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.40-2.22), and not having a pediatric complex chronic condition (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.80). The children with MIS-C had a more inflammatory laboratory profile and severe clinical phenotype, with higher rates of invasive ventilation (117 of 707 [16.5%] vs 514 of 8241 [6.2%]; P < .001) and need for vasoactive-inotropic support (191 of 707 [27.0%] vs 426 of 8241 [5.2%]; P < .001) compared with those who had acute COVID-19. Comparing children during the Delta vs pre-Delta eras, there was no significant change in hospitalization rate (1738 [6.0%] vs 8507 [6.2%]; P = .18) and lower odds for severe disease (179 [10.3%] vs 1242 [14.6%]) (decreased by a factor of 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.79; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of US children with SARS-CoV-2, there were observed differences in demographic characteristics, preexisting comorbidities, and initial vital sign and laboratory values between severity subgroups. Taken together, these results suggest that early identification of children likely to progress to severe disease could be achieved using readily available data elements from the day of admission. Further work is needed to translate this knowledge into improved outcomes.","output":"Characteristics, Outcomes, and Severity Risk Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Children in the US National COVID Cohort Collaborative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to compare open and laparoscopic sigmoid resection for diverticulitis with the patient and the nursing staff blinded to the surgical approach. METHODS A total of 113 patients scheduled for an elective sigmoidectomy were randomized to receive either a conventional open (54 patients) or a laparoscopic (59 patients) approach. Postoperatively, an opaque wound dressing was applied and left in place for 4 days, and patients from both groups were managed similarly. The primary endpoints for analysis were (1) postoperative pain; (2) duration of postoperative ileus; and (3) duration of hospital stay (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 00453830). RESULTS The median duration of procedure was 165 minutes (range, 90-285) in the laparoscopy group and 110 minutes (range, 70-210) in the open group (P < 0.0001). The median delay between surgery and first bowel movement was 76 (range, 31-163) hours in the laparoscopy group versus 105 (range, 53-175) hours in the open group (P < 0.0001). The median score for maximal pain (assessed by a visual analog scale) was 4 (range, 1-10) in the laparoscopy group and 5 (range, 1-10) in the open group (P = 0.05). Finally, the median duration of hospital stay was 5 days (range, 4-69) in the laparoscopy group versus 7 days (range, 5-17) in the open group (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sigmoid resection is associated with a 30% reduction in duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay; by comparison, benefits in terms of postoperative pain appear less impressive, when the patient is blinded to the surgical technique.","output":"A prospective, randomized, single-blind comparison of laparoscopic versus open sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although numerous reports predict huge growth potential for online shopping under COVID-19 pandemic, many do not know about determinants of user intention to continue using online shopping under such a pandemic.

The effects of therapeutic endothelial cell application alone and in combination with microcapsulotomy were investigated in a xenogenic murine model of 45-min warm renal ischemia. Renal function and perfusion were determined before as well as 2 and 18 days postischemia by (99m)Tc-MAG3 imaging and laser Doppler. Histological analysis included H&E stains and immunohistology for endothelial marker MECA-32, cell proliferation marker Ki-67, and macrophage marker F4/80. Histomorphological changes were quantified using a tubular injury score. Ischemia of 45 min led to severe tissue damage and a significant decrease in renal function and perfusion. Microcapsulotomy and cell therapy alone had no significant effect on renal function, while only surgical decompression significantly increased blood flow in ischemic kidneys. However, the combination of both microcapsulotomy and cell therapy significantly improved kidney function and perfusion. Combination therapy significantly reduced morphological injury of ischemic kidneys as determined by a tubular injury score and MECA-32 staining. Macrophage infiltration evidenced by F4/80 staining was significantly reduced. The Ki-67 proliferation index was increased, suggesting a regenerative environment. While microcapsulotomy and cell therapy alone have limited effect on renal recovery after IRI, combination therapy showed synergistic improvement of renal function, perfusion, and structural damage.

The calicivirus capsid is composed of 180 copies of VP1 with a molecular weight of ~58 kDa. This coat protein is divided into the N-terminus (N), the shell (S) and C-terminal protruding (P) domains. The S domain forms a shell around the viral RNA genome, while the P domains dimerize to form protrusions on the capsid surface. The P domain is subdivided into P1 and P2 subdomains, with the latter containing the binding sites for cellular receptors and neutralizing antibodies. Reviewed here are studies on murine norovirus (MNV) showing that the capsid responds to several physiologically relevant cues; bile, pH, Mg(2+), and Ca(2+). In the initial site of infection, the intestinal tract, high bile and metal concentrations and low pH cause two significant conformational changes: (1) the P domain contracts onto the shell domain and (2) several conformational changes within the P domain lead to enhanced receptor binding while blocking antibody neutralization. In contrast, the pH is neutral, and the concentrations of bile and metals are low in the serum. Under these conditions, the loops at the tip of the P domain are in the open conformation with the P domain floating on a linker or tether above the shell. This conformational state favors antibody binding but reduces interactions with the receptor. In this way, MNV uses metabolites and environmental cues in the intestine to optimize cellular attachment and escape antibody binding but presents a wholly different structure to the immune system in the serum.

Specific reasons for vaccine hesitancy among people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) have not been fully described. Notably, pwMS may experience higher morbidity from vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated warts and malignancies. Furthermore, screening for immunity against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) is not standard practice, despite a resurgence of measles and mumps outbreaks in Europe and worldwide. We aimed to evaluate general vaccination status among pwMS to better inform vaccine practices in this cohort. METHODS: This was a prospective audit of pwMS attending an Irish tertiary referral MS centre. We designed a questionnaire that explored awareness, uptake, and hesitancy for the influenza, pneumococcal, SARS-CoV-2, HPV, and MMR vaccines. The clinician administered the questionnaire during the outpatient MS clinic. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-five pwMS participated in the audit, mean (SD) age 47.3 (12.8) years, mean MS disease duration 14.1 (9.5) years, median Expanded Disability Severity Scale (EDSS) score 2.0 (IQR 1.0-6.0), forty-nine (46.7%) were taking either maintenance immunosuppressive or immune reconstitution therapies. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine willingness among pwMS was higher (90.5% vs 60%-80%) than that reported in other Western countries, and higher than that for the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines (80%) for which perceived unnecessity and unfamiliarity respectively were the main limiting factors. The primary reason for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy was safety concern. PwMS who were explicitly advised by a healthcare professional to obtain the influenza vaccine were more likely to do so than those who were not (odds ratio, 8.1, 95% CI 2.8 C 23.4, p<0.001). Of pwMS currently receiving B-cell therapy (ocrelizumab/rituximab, n=12), all but one (n=11, 91.7%) have never received the pneumococcal vaccine, and a quarter (n=3) were uncertain whether to obtain this in the future. Patient-reported uptake of HPV (1.0%) and MMR (51.4%) vaccines were suboptimal. Prevalence of vaccine promotion among healthcare professionals was low (influenza vaccine, 4.8 C 32.4%; pneumococcal vaccine, 0 C 18.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy is common (10-20%) in pwMS, consequent to insufficient knowledge and misconceptions about vaccination among pwMS and suboptimal vaccine promotion by healthcare professionals that manage pwMS. Conscientious and context-specific vaccination counselling is necessary to tackle vaccine hesitancy among pwMS, including (i) avoiding infection-associated disability accrual during MS relapses, (ii) reducing the potentially higher risk of life-threatening/treatment-refractory complications that may be observed in those who develop vaccine-preventable infections while receiving certain DMTs, and (iii) avoiding attenuated avoiding attenuated vaccine responses or delayed/interrupted DMT with early pre-treatment vaccine delivery where possible.

Several studies indicated that children seem to be less frequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and potentially less contagious.

From April 14, 2020 to May 12, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional prospective, multicenter study. Healthy controls and pauci-symptomatic children from birth to age 15 years were enrolled by 27 ambulatory pediatricians.

While the risk of COVID-19 mortality is known to increase with age, age-specific COVID-19 death rates across Europe were similarly unevenly distributed. To explain these mortality distributions, we present a simple model where more favorable survival environments promote longevity and the accumulation of health frailty among the elderly while less favorable survival environments induce a mortality selection process that results in lower health frailty. Because the age-related conditions of frailty render the elderly less resistant to SARS-CoV-2, pre-existing survival environments may be non-obviously positively related to the COVID-19 death rate. To quantify the survival environment parameter of our model, we leveraged historic cohort- and period-based age-specific probabilities of death and life expectancies at age 65 across Europe. All variables are significantly correlated with indicators of frailty like elderly dependence on others for personal and household care for a subset of European countries. With respect to COVID-19 death rates, we find significant positive relationships between our survival indicators and COVID-19 death rates across Europe, a result that is robust to statistical control for the capacity of a healthcare system to treat and survive infected persons, the timing and stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions, population density, age structure, case rates and the volume of inbound international travelers, among other factors. To address possible concerns over reporting heterogeneity across countries, we show that results are robust to the substitution of our response variable for a measure of cumulative excess mortality. Also consistent with the intuition of our model, we also show a strong negative association between age-specific COVID-19 death rates and pre-existing all-cause age-specific mortality rates for a subset of European countries. Overall, results support the notion that variation in pre-existing frailty, resulting from heterogeneous survival environments, partially accounts for striking differences in COVID-19 death during the first wave of the pandemic.","output":"The Longevity-Frailty Hypothesis: Evidence from COVID-19 Death Rates in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECT: To summarize the administration model of a COVID-19 designated hospital transformed from a community hospital to improve the emergency capacity of community hospitals and the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of medical staff in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Analyze the surrounding environment, ward layout, area management, treatment process, medical staff and patient management of the designated community hospital. RESULTS: From February 5, 2020, to February 18, 2020, the designated community hospital has received 198 COVID-19 mild and general patients (including 41 in the hospital at the beginning of the period). Among them, 39 were transferred to module hospitals, 131 were discharged, and 28 were in the hospital at the end of the period, and none of them became severe. There were 41 medical staff, and none of them had COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: We have achieved excellent results in the prevention and control stratagems implemented in this new community-designated hospital that specializes in treating patients with COVID-19. Its diagnosis and treatment model has completed the treatment of COVID- 19 patients successfully. After adjustment, this community hospital can shoulder the critical task of being a designated hospital for COVID-19, which includes admission, isolation, and therapy of suspected and mild COVID-19 patients, reducing the medical burden of superior hospitals. Furthermore, our experience provides concepts for community hospitals to temporarily undertake medical responsibilities to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","output":"Experience summary of a COVID-19 designated community hospital and its operation model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral entry encompasses the initial steps of infection starting from virion host cell attachment to viral genome release.

Here we review possible life-threating immune events that can occur during disease progression to uncover key factors behind COVID-19 severity and provide suggestions for interventions with repurposed drugs in well-controlled and randomized clinical trials. These drugs include therapeutics with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells such as serine protease inhibitors of the cellular protease TMPS2 and drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system; antivirals with potential to block SARS-CoV-2 replication or factors that could boost the antiviral response; monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive the hyperinflammatory response during COVID-19 progression toward the severe stage and therapeutics that could ameliorate the function of the lungs. Furthermore, in order to help make more informed decisions on the timing of the intervention with the drugs listed in this review, we have grouped these therapeutics according to the stage of COVID-19 progression that we considered most appropriate for their mechanism of action.","output":"Lessons Learned to Date on COVID-19 Hyperinflammatory Syndrome: Considerations for Interventions to Mitigate SARS-CoV-2 Viral Infection and Detrimental Hyperinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent diseases in women. Prevention and treatments have lowered mortality; nevertheless, the impact of the diagnosis and treatment continue to impact all aspects of patients lives (physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and spiritual). OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to explore the experiences of the different stages women with breast cancer go through by means of a patient journey. METHODS: This is a qualitative study in which 21 women with breast cancer or survivors were interviewed. Participants were recruited at 9 large hospitals in Spain and intentional sampling methods were applied. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview that was elaborated with the help of medical oncologists, nurses, and psycho-oncologists. Data were processed by adopting a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer entails a radical change in patients day-to-day that linger in the mid-term. Seven stages have been defined that correspond to the different medical processes: diagnosis/unmasking stage, surgery/cleaning out, chemotherapy/loss of identity, radiotherapy/transition to normality, follow-up care/the new day-to-day, relapse/starting over, and metastatic/time-limited chronic breast cancer. The most relevant aspects of each are highlighted, as are the various cross-sectional aspects that manifest throughout the entire patient journey. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehending patients experiences in depth facilitates the detection of situations of risk and helps to identify key moments when more precise information should be offered. Similarly, preparing the women for the process they must confront and for the sequelae of medical treatments would contribute to decreasing their uncertainty and concern, and to improving their quality-of-life.","output":"Breast cancer patient experiences through a journey map: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 caused a global pandemic problem No confident management is introduced for it yet This study aimed to propose a dietary protocol for hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of acute respiratory infectious disease caused by COVID-19 based on Persian Medicine METHODS: This study was conducted in three phases In the first phase, any diseases that could be matched with the clinical features of infection with COVID-19 were searched in selected PM references In the second phase, medicinal herbs and foods that were available and could be used in the hospital diet were extracted and summarized In the third phase, the new documentation of these pharmaceutical and food items was conducted RESULTS: The signs and symptoms of infectious respiratory disease caused by COVID-19 can be categorized in the field of Zato al-rieh that can mainly be matched with pneumonia Based on the described criteria, some nutrients and medicinal materia medica have been introduced for acute respiratory infection including Cydonia oblonga, Honey, Citrus sinensis, Malus domestica, Citrus medica, Crocus sativus, Raisin, Rosa Damas Cena, D Carota, Camellia Sinensis, Anethum graveolens dhi, Punica granatum, Petroselinum Crispum, Coriandrum sativum, Urtica dioica, Allium sativum, Sesamum indicum CONCLUSION: Most materia medica has documents in current articles including anti-cough suppressants, antiviral properties, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory etc A protocol of hospital diet for patients with infectious respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19 has been introduced in this manuscript","output":"Hospital diet for COVID-19, an acute respiratory infectious disease: An evidence-based Protocol of a Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been stuck indoors with their partners for months.

However, there have been few reports which evaluated the results of long-term mild intradialytic exercises in elderly patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in body weight, body composition, and laboratory data in elderly hemodialysis patients after 1-year intradialytic leg exercises with resistance bands. METHODS: A retrospective study. Twenty-one outpatients, aged 65 or older (mean  SD, 75.2  5.1 years), received intradialytic leg exercises with resistance bands for a year were analyzed. The values of dry weight, body composition, and laboratory data were collected from the year-ago period, at baseline and 1 year after baseline. Fat and muscle mass were evaluated by using a multi-frequency bioimpedance device. RESULTS: Physical performance changed and body weight increased after 1-year resistance band exercises. However, the participants gained fat mass, not muscle mass. Although the changes in biochemical data related to protein intake were equivocal, triglyceride levels increased significantly after 1-year exercises. An elevation in serum creatinine levels was observed, even if solute clearance increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: One-year intradialytic leg exercises with resistance bands may have a potential clinical benefit for body mass index even in elderly hemodialysis patients. However, optimal dietary modification is needed to achieve a balanced increase of muscle and fat mass. An increase of serum creatinine levels does not always mean muscle mass hypertrophy.

AIM To compare the efficacy of infliximab (IFX) and vedolizumab (VDZ) in UC patients who failed a first subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosing factor (TNF) agent. METHODS Consecutive UC patients from 12 French centres starting IFX or VDZ after at least one injection of adalimumab or golimumab have been included in a retrospective study. Outcomes were clinical remission at week 14, survival without treatment discontinuation and survival without UC-related event. RESULTS Among the 225 patients included, clinical remission at week 14 was achieved in 40/154 (26%) patients treated with IFX and in 35/71 (49%) treated with VDZ (P = 0.001). After a propensity score matching analysis, this difference remained significant (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.08-2.56; P = 0.02). With a median follow-up of 117 weeks, survival rates without treatment discontinuation at years 1 and 3 were 50% and 29% with IFX, and 80% and 55% with VDZ, respectively (P < 0.001). Regarding survival without UC-related event, they were 49% and 27% with IFX, and 74% and 52% with VDZ (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION After failure of a first subcutaneous anti-TNF agent, UC patients were more likely to achieve clinical remission with VDZ than those treated with IFX. Although due to prescription habits patients in the IFX group had a significantly more severe disease, these differences remained after adjustments and subgroup analyses.

This study, thus, aimed to survey the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines among Japanese citizens and discuss relevant ethical issues. A cross-sectional survey was conducted via an online platform. An anonymous, quantitative, self-administered online questionnaire was sent to 6965 registered Japanese residents (20C79 years of age), which included questions regarding the respondents general knowledge, experience, and opinions of vaccines, vaccine development, COVID-19, and COVID-19 vaccines. Of the 1569 respondents, 730 (46.5%) and 839 (53.5%) were categorized into the younger and older groups, respectively. Most of the respondents possessed general knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines and their features. Of the respondents, 57.8% definitely agreed (10.5%) or somewhat agreed (47.3%) to receive COVID-19 vaccines. The older group showed significantly greater willingness to receive vaccines and higher literacy regarding vaccines in general. Possible reasons for the older groups greater willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccines are a high risk of severe COVID-19 infection and their past accumulated experience of receiving various vaccinations. Although active public intervention could increase vaccination rates, most of the respondents did not agree with mandatory vaccination. Furthermore, a gap between the participants in the COVID-19 vaccine trials and the prioritized population in real-world vaccination should be adjusted in future vaccine development.

We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of PXL770, a novel direct AMPK activator, in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: STAMP-NAFLD, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a study, was done across 15 US clinical sites. Patients aged 18-75 years with liver fat content of at least 10% at baseline when assessed by MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1), via an interactive web response system, to receive oral PXL770 250 mg once daily, 250 mg twice daily, or 500 mg once daily, or matched placebo. Patients were stratified according to type 2 diabetes status and study site. The primary endpoint was relative change in liver fat content from baseline compared with placebo at week 12, assessed by MRI-PDFF. The primary endpoint was analysed in an ANCOVA model with treatment and stratification criteria as factors and baseline liver fat content as a covariate in the modified intention-to-treat population, defined as all as-randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Safety was analysed in the safety population, defined as all as-treated patients receiving at least one dose of the study treatment. The trial has been completed and the final results are reported. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03763877. FINDINGS: Between March 29, 2019, and March 13, 2020, 387 patients were screened, of whom 120 were included in the modified intention-to-treat and safety analyses (30 in the 250 mg once daily group, 30 in the 250 mg twice daily group, 29 in the 500 mg once daily group, and 31 in the placebo group). The mean relative change from baseline in liver fat content at week 12 was -11% in the placebo group, -10% in the 250 mg once daily group (mean difference versus placebo 01% [95% CI -154 to 157], p=099), -143% in the 250 mg twice daily group (-131% [-281 to 18], p=0084), and -147% in the 500 mg once daily group (-135% [-285 to 14], p=0076). At least one treatment-emergent adverse event occurred in 23 (77%) of 30 patients in the 250 mg once daily group, 20 (67%) of 30 patients in the 250 mg twice daily group, 21 (72%) of 29 patients in the 500 mg once daily group, and 21 (68%) of 31 patients in the placebo group. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was diarrhoea (five [17%] of patients in the 250 mg once daily group, seven [23%] in the 250 mg twice daily group, six [21%] in the 500 mg once daily group, and none in the placebo group). No life-threatening events or treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: PXL770 treatment did not meet the primary outcome of liver fat improvement compared with placebo. Treatment was well tolerated. Given indications that metabolic features improved with PXL770 treatment, AMPK activation might be a promising pharmacological target for patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD, and could also be considered for further assessment in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

To this end, an ambitious, far-reaching project was launched by the Labor Network for Sustainability, a non-governmental organization dedicated to bridging the labor and climate movements, in Spring 2020 called the Just Transition Listening Project'' (JTLP). Over the course of several months, the JTLP interviewed over 100 individuals, including rank-and-file union members, union officials, environmental and climate justice advocates, and Indigenous and community advocates to understand what makes transition just, what opportunities exist for a broad coalition to advance a GND-style proposal, and to document the struggles facing working people and communities across the U.S. In doing so, we utilize the tools of political geography to examine the politics of spatiality, networks, and scale as well as the geographical and spatial dimensions of policy and political-economic institutions. We are particularly mindful of two spatial dynamics. First, that transition policies, particularly in a hegemonic country like the USA, have global implications. The industrial transition that took place from the 1970s to the 1990s, for example, bred nativism because it cast other countries as the cause of the problem. Second, critical geographers have pointed out that environmental justice (EJ) has been neoliberalized in the U.S. as a result of its operationalization, spatialization, and administration, starting with the Clinton Administration.

WBE efforts to date have primarily focused on sewer-transported wastewater in high-income countries, but at least 1.8 billion people in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) use onsite sanitation systems such as pit latrines and septic tanks. Like wastewater, fecal sludges from such systems offer similar advantages in community pathogen monitoring and other epidemiological applications. To evaluate the distribution of enteric pathogens inside pit latrinesCwhich could inform sampling methods for WBE in LMIC settings unserved by sewersCwe collected fecal sludges from the surface, mid-point, and maximum-depth of 33 pit latrines in urban and peri-urban Malawi and analyzed the 99 samples for 20 common enteric pathogens via multiplex quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Using logistic regression adjusted for household population, latrine sharing, the presence of a concrete floor or slab, water source, and anal cleansing materials, we found no significant difference in the odds of detecting the 20 pathogens from the mid-point (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 1.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.73, 1.6) and surface samples (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.54, 1.2) compared with those samples taken from the maximum depth. Our results suggest that, for the purposes of routine pathogen monitoring, pit latrine sampling depth does not strongly influence the odds of detecting enteric pathogens by molecular methods.

Using a phenomenological approach, we documented the procedures and conducted interviews (all inductively coded in Nvivo) with the centre's coordinator, seven psychosocial staff members and three doctors. Though fewer people requested and had an abortion, the pressure on the staff was high due to changed procedures. A substantial change was the substitution of telephone for in-person consultations, which the staff perceived as less suited for discussing worries, contraception counselling, and building trust. The centre remained accessible, but the staff perceived an influence on the emotional reactions of clients. Staff agreed that the lockdown did not negatively influence the abortion procedure itself. However, they felt a negative influence on the level of psychological support they could offer, especially in interactions with clients who were less certain of their choice and clients with whom there was no common language.

We propose a clinical workflow in managing such patients based on available evidence from literature review. We also highlight the importance of early recognition and intervention for disease control, dialysis support in an acute hospital isolation facility, deisolation protocol, and discharge planning due to prolonged viral shedding. The case highlights important points specific to a HD patient with a COVID-19 diagnosis, tailored interventions for each stage of the disease, and deisolation considerations in the recovery phase.","output":"Critical Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a Hemodialysis Patient: A Proposed Clinical Management Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Abnormal liver chemistries are common findings in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the association of these abnormalities with the severity of COVID-19 and clinical outcomes is poorly understood AIM: We aimed to assess the prevalence of elevated liver chemistries in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and compare the serum liver chemistries to predict the severity and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study included 3380 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in the Johns Hopkins Health System (Baltimore, MD, United States). Demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment measures, and outcome data were collected. Cox regression modeling was used to explore variables associated with abnormal liver chemistries on admission with disease severity and prognosis RESULTS: A total of 2698 (70.4%) had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at the time of admission. Other more prevalent abnormal liver chemistries were aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (44.4%), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (16.1%), and total bilirubin (T-Bil) (5.9%). Factors associated with liver injury were older age, Asian ethnicity, other race, being overweight, and obesity. Higher ALT, AST, T-Bil, and ALP levels were more commonly associated with disease severity. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that abnormal AST and T-Bil were associated with the highest mortality risk than other liver injury indicators during hospitalization. Abnormal AST, T-Bil, and ALP were associated with a need for vasopressor drugs, whereas higher levels of AST, T-Bil, and a decreased albumin levels were associated with mechanical ventilation CONCLUSION: Abnormal liver chemistries are common at the time of hospital admission in COVID-19 patients and can be closely related to the patients severity and prognosis. Elevated liver chemistries, specifically ALT, AST, ALP, and T-Bil levels, can be used to stratify risk and predict the need for advanced therapies in these patients.","output":"Abnormal liver chemistries as a predictor of COVID-19 severity and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This netnographic study examines Reform Jewish rituals transmitted by virtual platforms, Facebook and Zoom, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reform Judaism, which supports modern liberal theology, has adopted the usage of technology for Shabbat services. The transition from the physical space to the virtual one challenges the performance of the ritual: Rabbis change the ritual's structure, and during online services, the congregants have different feelings toward the congregation and their own spiritual worship, made manifest in changes in their usual religious gestures. A positive result of the move to the virtual space is that though the Reform Jewish congregations, as non-Orthodox communities, have been excluded by the state, virtual prayers further expose Reform services to Israeli society. However, this might hinder societal support if it is shown that the community can conduct its services without an actual formal space.

Our aim was to determine the value of incorporating a chest computed tomography (CT) scan during acute stroke imaging, and the factors that influence this decision. METHODS: We constructed a probabilistic decision tree of the value of acquiring a chest CT scan or not, expressed in quality-adjusted life months (QALM) of patients and medical professionals. The model was based on the chance of detecting infection by chest CT scan, the case fatality rates of COVID-19 infection, the risk of COVID-19 infection after exposure, the expected proportion of medical professionals exposed, and the exposure reduction derived from early disease detection. RESULTS: The decision to incorporate the chest CT scan was superior to not doing so (12.00 QALM vs 11.99 QALM, respectively), when the probability of patients having undetected COVID-19 infection is 3.5%, potentially exposing 100% of medical professionals, and if early detection reduces exposure by 50%. The risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 infection following exposure casts uncertainty on the results, but this is offset by the potential for reducing exposure.

METHODS: An ambispective cohort study of pneumonia patients aged 1 month to  18 years admitted over the period from May to September 2020. Data were collected from history, physical examination, laboratory examination, and chest radiography. Based on bivariate analysis (p<0.05 and relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval), variables of each PIRO component that were significant for mortality were assigned a value of 1. The cut-off score for predictor of mortality was calculated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the scores were stratified into three degrees of risk based on interquartile range, score Q1 was categorized as low risk; Q1-Q3 was categorized as moderate risk; and score >Q3 was categorized as high risk. RESULTS: Out of the 80 subjects enrolled, 6 months-5 years was the largest age group (56.3%). The observed mortality was 15/80 (18.8%). The modified PIRO severity score was compiled from significant variables of predisposition (malnutrition), insult (chest radiograph), response (hypoxemia, hypotension, CRP >0.5 mg/dL, PCT >0.5 ng/dL) and organ dysfunction, with range of score 0-7. Score >3 was categorized as a cut-off point score for predictor of mortality with AUC 0.919 (95% CI 0.836C0.968), sensitivity of 80%, and specificity of 84.62%.

This qualitative study shows the way in which these migrants experience their sociocultural integration in Chilean society, which could be typified as nostalgic since it is characterized by the idealization of and the longing for their society of origin. Another key characteristic is the eventual return to the country of origin, in which the desynchronization they experience is especially remarkable: after a long period abroad, they feel disconnected from the transformations that have taken place in their original environment, which leads them to experience a difficult process of readjustment to Spanish society that sometimes is even more complex than that experienced abroad.","output":"Our Life Is Not Here: Migration and Return of Young Spaniards Living in Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Due to the minimal blood supply and other reasons, stable reconstruction of interdental papilla is difficult. This article presented three cases, which describe a customized subepithelial connective tissue graft aiming to overcome the clinical challenge, with the combination of tunneling technique. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS: An original customized subepithelial connective tissue graft combined with tunnel technique aimed to reconstruct interdental papilla (IP). The subepithelial connective tissue graft was partially spilt to create a bowtie-like shape, with four lateral wings and a main body. The four wings were tightly wrapped around the adjacent abutments, and the body part was used to reconstruct the IP. CONCLUSIONS: With the customized subepithelial connective tissue graft, a favorable outcome has been preliminarily confirmed in these cases.

Respiratory protection devices, when properly fitted and used, can prevent this type of illness transmission. METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) within the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is responsible for the certification and approval of respirators for use in occupational settings. NPPTL maintains webpages with information on respiratory protection devices. We monitored the number of webpage views for several NPPTL webpages from January 1, 2020 to May 8, 2020. The number of webpage visits was then compared to significant events during the COVID-19 outbreak as well as the previous years webpage visits. RESULTS: The landing page for NIOSH-approved N95 respirators received the most visits. This page received a total of 1,637,250 webpage visits with a peak of 63,715 on February 26, 2020, a 38,989% increase from the average daily page visits for that same month in 2019. This occurred on the same day as the White House gave its first televised briefing on COVID-19. The page providing general information on filtering facepiece respirators, including N95 respirators received 834,186 webpage visits with a peak of 20,520 on April 3, 2020, a 13,659% increase from the average daily webpage visits for that same month in 2019. This occurred on the same date as new CDC recommendations were provided for using cloth face masks in public places.

Disease-related malnutrition is associated with impaired respiratory function and increased all-cause morbidity and mortality. Patients with COVID-19 infection carry a high nutritional risk. After designing a specific nutritional support protocol for this disease, we carried out a retrospective study on malnutrition and on the use of nutritional support in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to determine whether nutritional support positively affected hospital stay, clinical complications, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. We compared the results with those of standard nutritional management. Our secondary objectives were to determine the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with COVID-19 and the value of nutritional support in the hospital where the study was performed. RESULTS: At least 60% of patients with COVID-19 experience malnutrition (up to 78.66% presented at least 1 of the parameters studied). The specialized nutritional support protocol was indicated in only 21 patients (28%) and was started early in only 12 patients (16%). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in patients managed with the early protocol (5.09 days, 95% CI, 1.338-8.853, p<0.01). Similarly, in this group, respiratory distress was less severe and less frequent (41% vs 82.5%, p<0.007), and statistically significantly fewer complications were recorded (9/12 vs 91/63; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with high rates of disease-related malnutrition. Early implementation of a specialized nutritional support plan can improve the prognosis of these patients by reducing hospital stay, the possibility of more severe respiratory distress, and complications in general.","output":"Malnutrition and nutrition support in COVID-19: The results of a nutrition support protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 epidemic was declared a Global Pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020 By 24 March 2020, over 440,000 cases and almost 20,000 deaths had been reported worldwide In response to the fast-growing epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei, China imposed strict social distancing in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 followed closely by similar measures in other provinces These interventions have impacted economic productivity in China, and the ability of the Chinese economy to resume without restarting the epidemic was not clear Methods: Using daily reported cases from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, we estimated transmissibility over time and compared it to daily within-city movement, as a proxy for economic activity Results: Initially, within-city movement and transmission were very strongly correlated in the five mainland provinces most affected by the epidemic and Beijing However, that correlation decreased rapidly after the initial sharfall in transmissibility In general, towards the end of the study period, the correlation was no longer apparent, despite substantial increases in within-city movement A similar analysis for Hong Kong shows that intermediate levels of local activity were maintained while avoiding a large outbreak At the very end of the study period, when China began to experience the re-introduction of a small number of cases from Europe and the United States, there is an apparent up-tick in transmission Conclusions: Although these results do not preclude future substantial increases in incidence, they suggest that after very intense social distancing (which resulted in containment), China successfully exited its lockdown to some degree Elsewhere, movement data are being used as proxies for economic activity to assess the impact of interventions The results presented here illustrate how the eventual decorrelation between transmission and movement is likely a key feature of successful COVID-19 exit strategies","output":"Evidence of initial success for China exiting COVID-19 social distancing policy after achieving containment [version 1;peer review: awaiting peer review]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The continent ileostomy allows evacuation of an ileal reservoir at a time convenient to the patient. It is a surgical option for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) when a restorative option is not suitable or has not succeeded and the patient does not want a conventional end ileostomy. Continent ileostomy types include the Kock pouch, Barnett continent intestinal reservoir and T-pouch. All of the published evidence on the long-term outcome and quality of life after continent ileostomy for UC was systematically reviewed. METHODS A systematic review was performed in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies published between 1990 and 2020 were included. A descriptive synthesis was used due to the clinical heterogeneity. RESULTS The search returned 1,655 abstracts and after screening of abstracts and full text review, 19 were included in the final review, involving 1,602 patients. Operative mortality is low (0-3.6%) after all types of continent ileostomy but re-operation rates are high (20.8-65%) because of valve mechanism failures. Rates of fistulae (0-25.5%) and stomal stenosis (0-25%) can be relatively high post-operatively. Quality of life scores improve for most patients undergoing continent ileostomy, especially for patients converted from ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Overall, continent ileostomy retention is high in the long-term. DISCUSSION In the long-term patients report high satisfaction and a good quality of life with continent ileostomy, despite high re-operation rates and complications.

LPV plasma concentrations in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution were prospectively collected. Lopinavir-ritonavir was administered every 12 hours, 800/200 mg on day 1 and 400/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24, and 48 h.

The median age of study participants was 59 (range, 24 to 85) years, and 71% were male. The median durations from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation were 7 days (interquartile range [IQR], 4 to 10) and 8 days (IQR, 5 to 10), respectively.

We demonstrated that, in the DI RNA-transfected cells, the leader sequence of these DI RNAs was switched to that of the helper virus during one round of replication.

The lack of initial knowledge on its management has led to a great effort in developing vaccines and in finding therapeutic weapons capable of improving the clinical outcome of the affected patients. In particular, the possible role of vitamin D status in the management of COVID-19 has been widely analysed, resulting in a great amount of data. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess whether hypovitaminosis D is a risk factor for developing SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether it affects the worsening of the clinical course of COVID-19. METHODS: Data were extracted through extensive searches in the Pubmed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Academic One Files, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases from December 2019 to January 2021, using the keywords: Vitamin D, 25 hydroxy Vitamin D, 25 hydroxycholecalciferol, cholecalciferol, COVID 19, SARS-CoV-2. We included observational cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies that evaluated differences in serum levels of 25?hydroxy-cholecalciferol [25(OH)D] in patients who were positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2, in patients with mild or severe forms of COVID-19, and in patients who died or were discharged from the hospital. Finally, studies that evaluated the risk of developing severe illness or death in patients with vitamin D deficiency (VDD), defined as levels of 25(OH)D <20 ng/ml, were also included. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for quantitative variables such as 25(OH)D levels in patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection, in those with mild vs. severe COVID-19, or those who have died vs. those who have been discharged. Instead, we calculated odds ratios and 95% CI for qualitative ones, such as the number of patients with severe illness/death in the presence of VDD vs. those with normal serum 25(OH)D levels. A p-value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021241473). FINDINGS: Out of 662 records, 30 articles met inclusion criteria and, therefore, were included in the meta-analysis. We found that the serum levels of 25(OH)D were significantly lower in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection than in negative ones [MD -3.99 (-5.34, -2.64); p <0.00001; I(2)= 95%]. Furthermore, its levels were significantly lower in patients with severe disease [MD -6.88 (-9.74, -4.03); p <0.00001; I(2)=98%] and in those who died of COVID-19 [MD -8.01 (-12.50, -3.51); p = 0.0005; I(2)=86%]. Finally, patients with VDD had an increased risk of developing severe disease [OR 4.58 (2.24, 9.35); p <0.0001; I(2)=84%] but not a fatal outcome [OR 4.92 (0.83, 29.31); p = 0.08; I(2)=94%]. INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis revealed a large heterogeneity of the studies included due to the different enrolment criteria of patient samples (age, body mass index, ethnicity, comorbidities), the country where they live, all factors influencing serum 25(OH)D levels, and the different criteria used to define the severity of COVID-19. Furthermore, the observational nature of these studies does not allow to establish a cause-effect relationship, even taking into account that 25(OH)D represents a marker of acute inflammation. Treatment with vitamin D might be considered for the primary prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the management of patients with COVID-19. However, further intervention studies are needed to prove this hypothesis.","output":"Influence of 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol levels on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer is one of the most leading causes of death and a major public health problem, universally.

However, little is known about cardiac injury in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. This study is to investigate the incidence and characteristics of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients admitted in hospital. METHODS: Fifty-four COVID-19 patients were enrolled in one ward in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, and 5 were excluded caused by missing cardiac troponin I levels. Forty-nine participants were included in the final analysis. The clinical manifestations of hospitalised patients were analysed. Patients were divided into two groups, cardiac injury group and non-cardiac injury group, based on whether cardiac troponin I was elevated. Epidemic characteristics and laboratory test results were analysed in these two group. RESULTS: The average age of patients in the cardiac injury group was older (68.0 years old) than that in the non-cardiac injury group (61.5 years old). The percentages of patients with diabetes and critically severe pneumonia in the cardiac injury group were 38.5% and 38.5% respectively. Lymphocytes were decreased in 53.1% of all enrolled patients, but this decrease was more prominent (76.9%) in the cardiac injury group than the non-cardiac injury group (44.4%). Patients in the cardiac injury group also had lower platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 can cause cardiac injury in many patients.

Previous study has shown that after multiple dosages, alflutinib exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics and displays a time- and dose-dependent increase in the apparent clearance, probably due to its self-induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme. In this study, we investigated the CYP isozymes involved in the metabolism of alflutinib and evaluated the enzyme inhibition and induction potential of alflutinib and its metabolites. The data showed that alflutinib in human liver microsomes (HLMs) was metabolized mainly by CYP3A4, which could catalyze the formation of AST5902. Alflutinib did not inhibit CYP isozymes in HLMs but could induce CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes. Rifampin is a known strong CYP3A4 inducer and is recommended by the FDA as a positive control in the CYP3A4 induction assay. We found that the induction potential of alflutinib was comparable to that of rifampin. The E(max) of CYP3A4 induction by alflutinib in three lots of human hepatocytes were 9.24-, 11.2-, and 10.4-fold, while the fold-induction of rifampin (10 M) were 7.22-, 19.4- and 9.46-fold, respectively. The EC(50) of alflutinib-induced CYP3A4 mRNA expression was 0.25 M, which was similar to that of rifampin. In addition, AST5902 exhibited much weak CYP3A4 induction potential compared to alflutinib. Given the plasma exposure of alflutinib and AST5902, both are likely to affect the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrates.

In this review, we focus on the recent development of selective CCR2/CCR5 receptor ligands and dual antagonists. Several compounds targeting CCR2, e.g., INCB8761 and MK0812, were developed as promising candidates for clinical trials, but failed to show clinical efficacy as presumed from preclinical models. The role of CCR5 receptors as the second co-receptor for the HIV-host cell fusion led to the development of various CCR5-selective ligands. Maraviroc is the first CCR5-targeting drug for the treatment of HIV-1 infections on the market. The role of CCR5 receptors in the progression of inflammatory processes fueled the use of CCR5 antagonists for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, the use of maraviroc for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis failed due to its inefficacy. Some of the ligands, e.g., TAK-779 and TAK-652, were also found to be dual antagonists of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors.

The advancing obesity epidemic is now threatening the gains in CVD risk reduction brought about by contemporary pharmaceutical and surgical interventions. There are sex differences in the development and outcomes of CVD; premenopausal women have significantly lower CVD risk than men of the same age, but women lose this advantage as they transition to menopause, an observation suggesting potential role of sex hormones in determining CVD risk. Clear differences in obesity and regional fat distribution among men and women also exist. While men have relatively high fat in the abdominal area, women tend to distribute a larger proportion of their fat in the lower body. Considering that regional body fat distribution is an important CVD risk factor, differences in how men and women store their body fat may partly contribute to sex-based alterations in CVD risk as well. This article presents findings related to the role of obesity and sex hormones in determining CVD risk. Evidence for the role of sex hormones in determining body composition in men and women is also presented.

In this review, we suggest potential molecular mechanisms that could account for this association. We have focused on the potential effect of exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), ozone (O3 ), and particulate matter (PM) since there are studies investigating how exposure to these pollutants affects the life cycle of other viruses. We have concluded that pollutant exposure may affect different stages of the viral life cycle, including inhibition of mucociliary clearance, alteration of viral receptors and proteases required for entry, changes to antiviral interferon production and viral replication, changes in viral assembly mediated by autophagy, prevention of uptake by macrophages, and promotion of viral spread by increasing epithelial permeability. We believe that exposure to pollutants skews adaptive immune responses toward bacterial/allergic immune responses, as opposed to antiviral responses. Exposure to air pollutants could also predispose exposed populations toward developing COIVD-19-associated immunopathology, enhancing virus-induced tissue inflammation and damage.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 pathogenesis, and exposure to air pollution: What is the connection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus detected in China at the end of 2019.

METHODS: We developed a novel hybrid C-Chart and I-Chart to detect within a geographic area the start and end of exponential growth in reported deaths.

Here we apply ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and parallel RNA sequencing (RNASeq) to characterise the transcriptome and translatome of both species of PRRSV and to analyse the host response to infection. We calculated programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) efficiency at both sites on the viral genome. This revealed the nsp2 PRF site as the second known example where temporally regulated frameshifting occurs, with increasing ?2 PRF efficiency likely facilitated by accumulation of the PRF-stimulatory viral protein, nsp1. Surprisingly, we find that PRF efficiency at the canonical ORF1ab frameshift site also increases over time, in contradiction of the common assumption that RNA structure-directed frameshift sites operate at a fixed efficiency. This has potential implications for the numerous other viruses with canonical PRF sites. Furthermore, we discovered several highly translated additional viral ORFs, the translation of which may be facilitated by multiple novel viral transcripts. For example, we found a highly expressed 125-codon ORF overlapping nsp12, which is likely translated from novel subgenomic RNA transcripts that overlap the 3 end of ORF1b. Similar transcripts were discovered for both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2, suggesting a potential conserved mechanism for temporally regulating expression of the 3-proximal region of ORF1b.

CONCLUSIONS: Policies concerning companionship and visiting have been inconsistently applied within English maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, policies were not justified by the level of risk, and were applied indiscriminately regardless of need. There is an urgent need to determine how to sensitively and flexibly balance risks and benefits and optimise outcomes during the current and future crisis situations.","output":"Companionship for women/birthing people using antenatal and intrapartum care in England during COVID-19: a mixed-methods analysis of national and organisational responses and perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Gallstone-related disease accounts for a third of the admissions to the Surgical Department. In June 2019, an audit was undertaken at Great Western Hospital assessing the number of patients who underwent cholecystectomy, following initial diagnosis, in accordance to current guidelines. The results demonstrated a very low number of patients had cholecystectomy, within the targeted timeframe, which led to the implementation of a dedicated operative hot gallbladder list weekly. In June 2020, we re-audit the service to evaluate the impact of the change implemented. METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis of patients admitted to the Hospital in June 2020 with gallstone-related disease. Data was collected using the Surgical on-call lists, these were analysed and patients selected according to the reason for admission. Only gallstone related issues were considered in this analysis. Finally, via Medway, the time from admission to surgery was assessed. RESULTS: Despite the disruption in service provision due to COVID-19, the implementation of the hot gallbladder list led to a 10.7% increase in timely cholecystectomies, bringing the overall compliance to 14%. There was also a significant reduction in biliary related re-admissions, from 58% to 37%. Despite 47.3% of patients were still awaiting surgery, the waiting list was reduced by 5.2% in only 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the implementation of the hot gallbladder list has improved the compliance with the current guidelines.

Controlling for air-pollution, rainfall, temperature, demographic factors that measure population density, the proportion of the elderly, and health infrastructure including per capita health spending and the proportion of respiratory cases, does not diminish the predictive power of BMI in influencing the spatial incidence and spread of the virus. The association between adult BMI and measures of spatial outcomes is especially pronounced among educated populations in urban settings, and impervious to conditioning on differences in testing rates across states. We find that among women, BMI proxies for a range of comorbidities (hemoglobin, high blood pressure and high glucose levels) that affects the severity of the virus while among men, these health indicators are also important, as is exposure to risk of contracting the virus as measured by work propensities. We conduct sensitivity checks and control for differences that may arise due to variations in timing of onset.

Without an effective vaccine or treatment, the primary objective of negative countries is to prevent African swine fever virus infection in pigs. Significant quantities of feed ingredients used for swine diets are traded worldwide and may be imported from countries with African swine fever. If feed ingredients are contaminated with the virus, they can serve as potential routes for the introduction and transmission of African swine fever virus. This review provides information on the risk of African swine fever virus in feed and the mitigation strategies that may help protect the global swine population from introduction and spread through feed. ABSTRACT: Since the 2013 introduction of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus into the United States (U.S.), feed and feed ingredients have been recognized as potential routes for the introduction and transmission of foreign animal diseases of swine. Feed ingredients for swine diets are commodities traded worldwide, and the U.S. imports thousands of metric tons of feed ingredients each year from countries with circulating foreign animal diseases. African swine fever (ASF) is the most significant foreign animal disease threat to U.S. swine production, and the recent introduction of ASF into historically negative countries has heightened the risk for further spread. Laboratory investigations have characterized the stability of the ASF virus (ASFV) in feed ingredients subjected to transoceanic shipment conditions, ASFV transmissibility through the natural consumption of plant-based feed, and the mitigation potential of certain feed additives to inactivate ASFV in feed. This review describes the current knowledge of feed as a risk for swine viruses and the opportunities for mitigating the risk to protect U.S. pork production and the global swine population from ASF and other foreign animal diseases.","output":"Risk and Mitigation of African Swine Fever Virus in Feed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 is of great concern to the scientific community. This mainly affects the elderly and people with underlying diseases. People with obesity are more likely to experience unpleasant disease symptoms and increased mortality. The severe oxidative environment that occurs in obesity due to chronic inflammation permits viral activation of further inflammation leading to severe lung disease. Lifestyle affects the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress. It has been shown that a careful diet rich in antioxidants, regular exercise, and fasting regimens, each and/or together, can reduce the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress and strengthen the immune system as they lead to weight loss and activate cellular antioxidant mechanisms and reduce oxidative damage. Thus, a lifestyle change based on the three pillars: antioxidants, exercise, and fasting could act as a proactive preventative measure against the adverse effects of COVID-19 by maintaining redox balance and well-functioning immunity. Moreover, because of the observed diversity in the expression of COVID-19 inflammation, the role of genetics of innate immune molecules, surfactant protein A (SP-A)1 and SP-A2, and their differential impact on the local lung microenvironment and host defense is reviewed as genetics may play a major role in the diverse expression of the disease.","output":"The importance of redox status in the frame of lifestyle approaches and the genetics of the lung innate immune molecules, SP-A1 and SP-A2, on differential outcomes of covid-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency, which is a major cause of death worldwide and the second highest cause of mortality in the United States. Researching the optimal control treatment or intervention strategy on the comprehensive sepsis system is key in reducing mortality. For this purpose, first, this paper improves a complex nonlinear sepsis model proposed in our previous work. Then, bifurcation analyses are conducted for each sepsis subsystem to study the model behaviors under some system parameters. The bifurcation analysis results also further indicate the necessity of control treatment and intervention therapy. If the sepsis system is without adding any control under some parameter and initial system value settings, the system will perform persistent inflammation outcomes as time goes by. Therefore, we develop our complex improved nonlinear sepsis model into a sepsis optimal control model, and then use some effective biomarkers recommended in existing clinic practices as optimization objective function to measure the development of sepsis. Besides that, a Bayesian optimization algorithm by combining Recurrent neural network (RNN-BO algorithm) is introduced to predict the optimal control strategy for the studied sepsis optimal control system. The difference between the RNN-BO algorithm from other optimization algorithms is that once given any new initial system value setting (initial value is associated with the initial conditions of patients), the RNN-BO algorithm is capable of quickly predicting a corresponding time-series optimal control based on the historical optimal control data for any new sepsis patient. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the RNN-BO algorithm on solving the optimal control solution on the complex nonlinear sepsis system, some numerical simulations are implemented by comparing with other optimization algorithms in this paper.","output":"An Improved Mathematical Model of Sepsis: Modeling, Bifurcation Analysis, and Optimal Control Study for Complex Nonlinear Infectious Disease System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the similarities with other pandemics due to respiratory virus infections and subsequent development of neurological disorders (e.g. encephalitis lethargica after the 1918 influenza), there is growing concern about a possible new wave of neurological complications following the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, data on COVID-19-related encephalitis and movement disorders are still limited. Herein, we describe the clinical and neuroimaging (FDG-PET/CT, MRI and DaT-SPECT) findings of two patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy who developed prominent parkinsonism. None of the patients had previous history of parkinsonian signs/symptoms, and none had prodromal features of Parkinson's disease (hyposmia or RBD). Both developed a rapidly progressive form of atypical parkinsonism along with distinctive features suggestive of encephalitis. A possible immune-mediated etiology was suggested in Patient 2 by the presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, but none of the patients responded favorably to immunotherapy. Interestingly, FDG-PET/CT findings were similar in both cases and reminiscent of those observed in post-encephalitic parkinsonism, with cortical hypo-metabolism associated with hyper-metabolism in the brainstem, mesial temporal lobes, and basal ganglia. Patient's FDG-PET/CT findings were validated by performing a Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis and comparing the results with a cohort of healthy controls (n = 48). Cerebrum cortical thickness map was obtained in Patient 1 from MRI examinations to evaluate the structural correlates of the metabolic alterations detected with FDG-PET/CT. Hypermetabolic areas correlated with brain regions showing increased cortical thickness, suggesting their involvement during the inflammatory process. Overall, these observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger an encephalitis with prominent parkinsonism and distinctive brain metabolic alterations.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-related encephalitis with prominent parkinsonism: clinical and FDG-PET correlates in two patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forecasting about the Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic involves high uncertainty and may be affected by measures taken by the government to fight the disease.

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of vaccination status and confidence on dietary practices. An online survey was conducted in August 2021. We collected data on dietary intake, diversity and behaviors, vaccination status and confidence and socio-demographic characteristics. Among the 5107 responses received, a total of 4873 study participants were included in the final analysis. Most of our participants aged between 18 and 45 years and 82% of them were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Household level dietary diversity was found to be higher among people who were fully vaccinated ( = 0.321, 95%CI: 0.024 to 0.618) or who were more confident in the protectiveness of the vaccine ( for tertile 3 comparing with lowest tertile = 0.544, 95%CI: 0.407, 0.682). Vaccination promoted the intake of seafood, but it was also positively associated with the consumption of sugar, preserved, fried and barbequed foods and reduced vegetable intake. Higher vaccination confidence was associated with increased consumption of seafood, bean, fruits and vegetables and reduced fat intake. Changes in dietary behaviors compared with early 2021 (when vaccination was not common) were observed and differed by vaccination status and confidence level. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination status and confidence had varied, and possibly negative, impacts on dietary intake and behaviors.

Patients included in the study presented between March and June 2020. Details obtained from the medical record included demographics, radiology, laboratory investigations, clinical management and survival. RESULTS: 71 patients from 16 centres were included in the study, of whom 60 had pneumothoraces (six with pneumomediastinum in addition) and 11 had pneumomediastinum alone. Two of these patients had two distinct episodes of pneumothorax, occurring bilaterally in sequential fashion, bringing the total number of pneumothoraces included to 62. Clinical scenarios included patients who had presented to hospital with pneumothorax, patients who had developed pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum during their inpatient admission with COVID-19 and patients who developed their complication while intubated and ventilated, either with or without concurrent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Survival at 28a? days was not significantly different following pneumothorax (63.16.5%) or isolated pneumomediastinum (53.018.7%; p=0.854).

The virus is shed into various body fluids including saliva, which represents a possible source of viral transmission. Thus, we here explored whether human saliva affects ZIKV infectivity. We found that physiological concentrations of pooled saliva dose-dependently inhibit ZIKV infection of monkey and human cells by preventing viral attachment to target cells. The anti-ZIKV activity in saliva could not be abrogated by boiling, suggesting the antiviral factor is not a protein. Instead, we found that purified extracellular vesicles (EVs) from saliva inhibit ZIKV infection. Salivary EVs (saEVs) express typical EV markers such as tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81 and prevent ZIKV attachment to and infection of target cells at concentrations that are naturally present in saliva. The anti-ZIKV activity of saliva is conserved but the magnitude of inhibition varies between individual donors. In contrast to ZIKV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), predominantly spreading via respiratory droplets, is not affected by saliva or saEVs.

We have carried out detailed in silico Virtual high-throughput screening using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs from the Zinc database, COVID-19 clinical trial compounds from Pubchem database, Natural compounds from Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) database and Maybridge database against PLPRO and 3CLPRO proteases. After thoroughly analyzing the screening results, we found five compounds, Bemcentinib, Pacritinib, Ergotamine, MFCD00832476, and MFCD02180753 inhibit PLPRO and six compounds, Bemcentinib, Clofazimine, Abivertinib, Dasabuvir, MFCD00832476, Leuconicine F inhibit the 3CLPRO. These compounds are stable within the protease proteins' active sites at 20ns MD simulation. The stability is revealed by hydrogen bond formations, hydrophobic interactions, and salt bridge interactions. Our study results also reveal that the selected five compounds against PLPRO and the six compounds against 3CLPRO bind to their active sites with good binding free energy. These compounds that inhibit the activity of PLPRO and 3CLPRO may, therefore, be used for treating COVID-19 infection.","output":"Virtual high throughput screening: Potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 PLPRO and 3CLPRO proteases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prolonged sitting is an independent risk behavior for the development of chronic disease. With most interventions focusing on physical activity and exercise, there is a separate need for investigation into innovative and accessible interventions to decrease sedentary behavior throughout the day. Twitter is a social media platform with application for health communications and fostering of social support for health behavior change. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aims to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of delivering daily behavior change strategies within private Twitter groups to foster peer-to-peer support and decrease sedentary behavior throughout the day in women. The Twitter group was combined with a Fitbit for self-monitoring activity and compared to a Fitbit-only control group. METHODS: In a 2-group design, participants were randomized to a Twitter + Fitbit treatment group or a Fitbit-only control group. Participants were recruited via the Stanford Research Repository System, screened for eligibility, and then invited to an orientation session. After providing informed consent, they were randomized. All participants received 13 weeks of tailored weekly step goals and a Fitbit. The treatment group participants, placed in a private Twitter support group, received daily automated behavior change tweets informed by theory and regular automated encouragement via text to communicate with the group. Fitbit data were collected daily throughout the treatment and follow-up period. Web-based surveys and accelerometer data were collected at baseline, treatment end (13 weeks), and at 8.5 weeks after the treatment. RESULTS: The initial study design funding was obtained from the Womens Heart Clinic and the Stanford Clayman Institute. Funding to run this pilot study was received from the National Institutes of Healths National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute under Award Number K01HL136702. All procedures were approved by Stanford Universitys Institutional Review Board, #32127 in 2018, prior to beginning data collection. Recruitment for this study was conducted in May 2019. Of the 858 people screened, 113 met the eligibility criteria, 68 came to an information session, and 45 consented to participate in this pilot study. One participant dropped out of the intervention, and complete follow-up data were obtained from 39 of the 45 participants (87% of the sample). Data were collected over 6 months from June to December 2019. Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy results are being analyzed and will be reported in the winter of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study is assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of delivering behavior change strategies in a Twitter social support group to decrease sedentary behavior in women. These findings will inform a larger evaluation. With an accessible, tailorable, and flexible platform, Twitter-delivered interventions offer potential for many treatment variations and titrations, thereby testing the effects of different behavior change strategies, peer-group makeups, and health behaviors of interest.

After hospitalization for COVID-19, a number of patients are referred to medical rehabilitation centers or skilled nursing facilities for further treatment, while others go home with or without aftercare. The aftercare paths include 1] community-based rehabilitation; 2] in- and outpatient medical rehabilitation; 3] inpatient rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities; and 4] sheltered care (inpatient). These aftercare paths and the trajectories of recovery after COVID-19 urgently need long-term in-depth evaluation to optimize and personalize treatment. CO-FLOW aims, by following the outcomes and aftercare paths of all COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge, to systematically study over a 2-year period: 1] trajectories of physical, cognitive, and psychological recovery; 2] patient flows, healthcare utilization, patient satisfaction with aftercare, and barriers/facilitators regarding aftercare as experienced by healthcare professionals; 3] effects of physical, cognitive, and psychological outcomes on participation and HRQoL; and 4] predictors for long-term recovery, health care utilization, and patient satisfaction with aftercare. METHODS: CO-FLOW is a multicenter prospective cohort study in the mid-west of the Netherlands with a 2-year follow-up period. Measurements comprise non-invasive clinical tests and patient reported outcome measures from a combined rehabilitation, pulmonary, and intensive care perspective. Measurements are performed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after hospital discharge and, if applicable, at rehabilitation discharge. CO-FLOW aims to include at least 500 patients who survived hospitalization for COVID-19, aged &#8805;18 years. DISCUSSION: CO-FLOW will provide in-depth knowledge on the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 and the quality of current aftercare paths for patients who survived hospitalization. This knowledge is a prerequisite to facilitate the right care in the right place for COVID-19 and comparable future infectious diseases.

Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.","output":"Assessing the Impact of Reduced Travel on Exportation Dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization announce that novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is pandemic worldwide on March 11, 2020. In this pandemic, cancer patients are prone to become critically ill after being infected with COVID-19 due to special immune conditions, and cannot effectively benefit from the treatment plan designed for normal people. However, only a few literatures report the differences between cancer patients and normal people after being infected with COVID-19. There is no systematic review to evaluate the clinical, inflammatory, and immune differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer. The systematic review aims to summarize and analyze the clinical, inflammatory, and immune differences between them. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We plan to conduct a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Several databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, CBM, VIP, WanFang) were searched for relevant eligible observational studies on COVID-19 patients with cancer published from December 2019 to September 2020. Two researchers (Y.ZY and W.PP) will independently complete search strategy formulation, literature selecting, Information extraction, data collation, and quality assessment. The primary outcome will be the clinical characteristics differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer. Secondary outcomes will include immune function regulation characteristics such as T cell subset status, inflammation and other factors for COVID-19 patients with cancer. We intend to perform a meta-analysis of studies calculating odds ratio differences (Hedge g) for comparison in Forest plots and subgroup analysis after assessment of heterogeneity using I statistics based on compatibility on the basis of population and outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We will use the information from published researches with no need for ethical assessment. Our findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal according to the PRISMA guidelines.

The working patterns and professional practice of the radiography workforce (RW) has been altered during the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on radiography practice in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey of the UK RW was performed (March 25th to April 26th, 2020). The survey sought information regarding 1. Demographics 2. Impact of the pandemic on professional practice 3. Infection prevention/control and 4. COVID-19 related stress. Data collected was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (v.26). RESULTS: A total of 522 responses were received, comprising n = 412 (78.9%) diagnostic and n = 110 (21.1%) therapeutic RW categories from across the UK. 12.5% (65/522) of the respondents were redeployed. Redeployment did not appear to contribute (p = 0.31) to work-related stress. However, fear of contracting the infection and perceived inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) were identified as key contributors to stress during the study period. Compared to the therapeutic RW, a significantly higher proportion of the diagnostic RW identified fear of being infected as a major stressor (166/412 (40.3%) vs 30/110 (27.3%), p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: This survey has demonstrated changes to clinical practice, in particular to working patterns, service delivery and infection prevention and control were key contributors to workplace-related stress during the pandemic.

A concrete case of a violation of relevant regulations during COVID-19 epidemic that sparked public sentiment in China is introduced as a study sample to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. By running the model, the results show that an increase in government responsiveness contributes to the spread of positive social sentiment but also promotes negative sentiment. Positive individual behavior suppresses negative emotions while promoting the spread of positive emotions.

Inclusion of various pulse/oilseed/vegetables/cereals/medicinal/aromatic crops with sugarcane brings forth cultivation of these crops in irrigated agro-system and improves the yields of component crops. Besides, the component crops improve soil fertility and create a favorable environment for the further growth of sugarcane crops. Sprouting in winter-initiated sugarcane ratoon could be enhanced by adopting fodder legumes such as Indian clover and Egyptian clover. Intercropping vegetables provides an ample opportunity for mid-season income generation and improves profitability. Besides, high-value medicinal and aromatic crops such as tulsi (holy basil), mentha could also be included in the sugarcane-based system. Crop residue management has been recognized as a critical issue in managing the crops in the various cropping systems. Including multiple bio-agents for fast decomposition of crop residues provides scope for managing soil organic carbon through crop residue recycling in the system. Resource use efficiencies, nutrient use, water use, and weed control could be increased by adopting suitable crops in intercropping systems. An integrated farming system involving crop, livestock, and fisheries options could improve farmers profit besides employment generation in rural India. Recycling of bye products and co-products of other enterprises influences the viability and farmers profitability of the system. Trash, press mud cake, vinasse, composted bagasse, rhizodeposition of stubble play a significant role in sustaining soil fertility and increasing crop productivity. New emerging crop diversification options, viz., intercropping of rajmash, winter maize, and garlic in autumn cane generate mid-season income and enhance the system's profitability for small and marginal cane growers. Dual-purpose legumes, viz., cowpea, and green gram as intercrops with spring-planted cane increase the pool of soil microbial biomass nitrogen capitalize allelopathic effects and sustain soil health. In the present paper, these issues have been discussed.

It is designed particularly for wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms that otherwise would be difficult to treat. There is a paucity of follow-up data in the literature due to the novelty of this technique. The authors reviewed their data from cases involving patients treated at Leeds General Infirmary with the WEB device. They assessed the safety and complication risk associated with the device and clinical and radiological follow-up outcomes in their patients. This is, to their knowledge, the first publication to include the new single-layer sphere device (WEB SLS) in addition to the original dual-layer (WEB DL) and the (nonsphere) single-layer (WEB SL) devices. METHODS Data from 22 patients who underwent 25 WEB treatments were analyzed. Of the 25 WEB procedures, 3 were performed on an acute basis, 1 was performed on a semiacute basis, and the remaining 21 were elective. A novel 6-point scoring system called the Leeds WEB aneurysm occlusion scale was created to ensure accurate assessment based on the morphology of the WEB device. Outcome was assessed at follow-up by MR angiography with or without digital subtraction angiography and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS Deployment of the WEB device was successful in 22 (88%) of 25 procedures; 3 (12%) of the attempts at WEB treatment were abandoned. One of the patients in whom treatment was abandoned underwent a successful second attempt. Immediately after the 22 procedures with successful deployment, 4 (18%) of the patients had a complete occlusion of the aneurysm and WEB device; 10 (45%) had varying degrees of occlusion within the WEB device but no aneurysm neck or remnant; 3 (14%) had a neck remnant; and 5 (23%) had an aneurysm remnant. Of the patients with an aneurysm remnant, 1 had a complete aneurysm occlusion at  3-months follow-up. In total, 6 (27%) patients had a residual aneurysm at  3-months radiological follow-up. One of these patients was admitted with hydrocephalus secondary to a recurrent aneurysm and later received a second WEB treatment with additional coiling. Only 1 patient developed new neurological symptoms. This patient went from an mRS score of 0 to a score of 1 and had radiological evidence of a thromboembolic event. Two patients showed radiological evidence of a new thromboembolic event on follow-up MRI but were clinically asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS The WEB has shown itself to be a promising new device with the potential to increase the scope of treatment for difficult wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. The technique is safe, and short-term results show effective occlusion of complex aneurysms with minimal complications associated with the procedure. Long-term efficacy, however, still needs to be assessed.","output":"Endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms using the Woven EndoBridge technique in a single center: preliminary results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encoding a D614G mutation in the viral spike (S) protein predominate over time in locales where it is found, implying that this change enhances viral transmission.

This phenomenon needed a change in the nursing care of older frail people. Health policies have tried to mitigate the frequent use of ER by implementing community care to meet the care demands of older adults. The present study aimed to investigate the predictors of emergency room access (ERA) and not-urgent emergency room access (NUERA) of community-dwelling frail older adults in order to provide an indication for out-of-hospital care services. Method: Secondary analysis of an observational longitudinal cohort study was carried out. The cohort consisted of 1,246 community-dwelling frail older adults (over 65 years) in the Latium region in Italy. The ER admission rate was assessed over 3 years from the administration of the functional geriatric evaluation (FGE) questionnaire. The ordinal regression model was used to identify the predictors of ERA and NUERA. Moreover, the ERA and NUERA rate per 100 observations/year was analyzed. Results: The mean age was 73.6 (SD  7.1) years, and 53.4% were women. NUERAs were the 39.2% of the ERAs; robust and pre-frail individuals (79.3% of the sample) generated more than two-third of ERAs (68.17%), even if frails and very frails showed the higher ER rates per observation/year. The ordinal logistic regression model highlighted a predictive role on ERAs of comorbidity (OR = 1.13, p < 0.001) and frailty level (OR = 1.29; p < 0.001). Concerning NUERAs, social network (OR 0.54, P = 0.015) and a medium score of pulmo-cardio-vascular function (OR 1.50, P = 0.006) were the predictors. Conclusion: Comorbidity, lack of social support, and functional limitations increase both ERA and NUERA rates generated by the older adult population. Overall, bio-psycho-social frailty represents an indicator of the frequency of ERAs. However, to reduce the number of ERAs, intervention should focus mainly on the robust and pre-frail needs for prevention and care.","output":"Predictors of Emergency Room Access and Not Urgent Emergency Room Access by the Frail Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM recent studies regarding COVID-19 experiences of nursing students highlighted the effect of the transition from face-to-face to online education, rather than the complexity of the overall quality of educational life.

Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms may be useful in this context as they can automatically classify large volumes of narrative data. However, it is unknown if NLP models can accurately evaluate surgical trainee feedback. This study evaluated which NLP techniques best classify the quality of surgical trainee formative feedback recorded as part of a workplace assessment. METHOD During the 2016-2017 academic year, the SIMPL (Society for Improving Medical Professional Learning) app was used to record operative performance narrative feedback for residents at 3 university-based general surgery residency training programs. Feedback comments were collected for a sample of residents representing all 5 postgraduate year levels and coded for quality. In May 2019, the coded comments were then used to train NLP models to automatically classify the quality of feedback across 4 categories (effective, mediocre, ineffective, or other). Models included support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression, gradient boosted trees, naive Bayes, and random forests. The primary outcome was mean classification accuracy. RESULTS The authors manually coded the quality of 600 recorded feedback comments. Those data were used to train NLP models to automatically classify the quality of feedback across 4 categories. The NLP model utilizing an SVM algorithm yielded a maximum mean accuracy of 0.64 (standard deviation, 0.01). When the classification task was modified to distinguish only high quality vs. low-quality feedback, maximum mean accuracy was 0.83, again with SVM. CONCLUSIONS To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the use of NLP for classifying feedback quality. SVM NLP models demonstrated the ability to automatically classify the quality of surgical trainee evaluations.

Study Design: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of all pregnant women delivering at three hospitals in a large not-for-profit health care organization from March through July 2020. We compared outcomes between women with and without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Coarsened exact matching was performed to match women with and without SARS-CoV-2 using maternal age, body mass index, gestational age at delivery, parity and institution of delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of maternal complications including stillbirth, postpartum hemorrhage, intraamniotic infection, endometritis and ICU admission. Secondary outcomes of neonatal complications included Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes and low birth weight. Outcomes were examined by adjusted binomial logistic regression analysis incorporating matched weights. Result(s): Of 2,714 women who delivered at the three hospitals, a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was made in 122 (4.5%) women during the pregnancy. After coarsened exact matching, the study cohort included 486 women, 91 (18.7%) with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and 395 (81.3%) without this diagnosis.

In contrast, a decades-long pursuit of the neoliberal agenda has failed to deliver such prosperity and, in many ways, has actually moved the United States further from PKIs conception of a better world. In an effort to bring economics back in touch with reality, this article describes the economic insecurity that has been a central problem confronting Americans for more than a generation. It then shows how PKI explains that insecurity as a consequence (in fact, the flip side) of a key aim of neoliberalism: financialization.

We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out jointly in test settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the test-negative case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only requires collecting information about potential risk factors for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population controls. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be identified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional case-control studies. We describe two options for population control groups: one composed of accompanying persons to the test facilities, the other drawn from existing country-wide healthcare databases. We also describe other possibilities for population controls. Combining the TND with population controls yields a triangulation approach that distinguishes between exposures that are risk factors for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, and exposures that are risk factors for just COVID-19.

All proteins of C. chauvoei strains were retrieved from the NCBI Microbial Genome Database containing both genomic and proteomic data of prokaryotes. The proteins were analyzed to exclude non-redundant sequences and to determine antigenic, virulent, and non-allergenic vaccine candidates through several online tools, resulting in seven protein candidates. Cytotoxic T and B cell epitopes of these proteins were evaluated through the tools present in the immune epitope database and the prioritized antigenic epitopes were then conjugated via appropriate linkers to construct the vaccine candidate. After the evaluation of physicochemical properties of the construct, the tertiary structure was modeled and refined through trRosetta and GalaxyRefine, respectively. The quality of the 3D structure was validated by ERRAT score, z-score, and Ramachandran plot and the construct was then docked with bovine Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) using ClusPro.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to (1) determine the most commonly searched phrases related to COVID-19 in the United States and (2) identify the sources of information for these web searches. METHODS: Search terms related to COVID-19 were entered into Google. Questions and websites from Google web search were extracted to a database using customized software. Each question was categorized into one of 6 topics: clinical signs and symptoms, treatment, transmission, cleaning methods, activity modification, and policy. Additionally, the websites were categorized according to source: World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), non-CDC government, academic, news, and other media.

Although Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is important in recognizing S. aureus, its function during S. aureus infection remains controversial. We aimed to examine the association of TLR2 expression and associated cytokine responses with clinical SAB outcomes. METHODS Patients from a prospective SAB cohort at two tertiary-care medical centers were enrolled. Blood was sampled at several timepoints (5 d, 6-9 d, 10-13 d, 14-19 d, and  20 d) after SAB onset. TLR2 mRNA levels were determined via real-time PCR and serum tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-, interleukin [IL]-6, and IL-10 levels were analyzed with multiplex-high-sensitivity electrochemiluminescent ELISA. RESULTS TLR2 levels varied among 59 SAB patients. On days 2-5, TLR2 levels were significantly higher in SAB survivors than in healthy controls (p = 0.040) and slightly but not significantly higher than non-survivors (p = 0.120), and SAB patients dying within 7 d had lower TLR2 levels than survivors (P = 0.077) although statistically insignificant. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors on days 2-5 post-bacteremia (P = 0.010 and P = 0.021, respectively), and those dying within 7 d of SAB (n = 3) displayed significantly higher IL-10/TNF- ratios than the survivors did (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION TLR2 downregulation and IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations suggestive of immune dysregulation during early bacteremia may be associated with mortality from SAB.

Here, CO2 and HCO3 - membrane permeabilities were measured using an 18 O-exchange technique on two species of haptophyte algae, Emiliania huxleyi and Calcidiscus leptoporus, which showed that the plasma membranes of these species are also highly permeable to CO2 (0.006 to 0.02 cm  s-1 ) but minimally permeable to HCO3 - . Increased temperature and CO2 generally increased CO2 membrane permeabilities in both species, possibly due to changes in lipid composition or CO2 channel proteins. Changes in CO2 membrane permeabilities showed no association with the density of calcium carbonate coccoliths surrounding the cell, which could potentially impede passage of compounds. Haptophyte plasma membrane permeabilities to CO2 were somewhat lower than those of diatoms but generally higher than membrane permeabilities of green algae. One caveat of these measurements is that the model used to interpret 18 O-exchange data assumes that carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes 18 O-exchange, is homogeneously distributed in the cell. The implications of this assumption were tested by using a two-compartment model with an inhomogeneous distribution of carbonic anhydrase to simulate 18 O-exchange data and then inferring plasma-membrane CO2 permeabilities from the simulated data.

Gap junctions are prevalent in most animal organs and tissues, providing a direct diffusion pathway for both electrical and chemical communication between cells. Most analytical models of gap junctions focus on the steady-state diffusive flux and the associated effective diffusivity. Here we investigate the relaxation to steady state in terms of the so-called local accumulation time. The latter is commonly used to estimate the time to form a protein concentration gradient during morphogenesis. The basic idea is to treat the fractional deviation from the steady-state concentration as a cumulative distribution for the local accumulation time. One of the useful features of the local accumulation time is that it takes into account the fact that different spatial regions can relax at different rates. We consider both static and dynamic gap junction models. The former treats the gap junction as a resistive channel with effective permeability $\\\\mu$, whereas the latter represents the gap junction as a stochastic gate that randomly switches between an open and closed state. The local accumulation time is calculated by solving the diffusion equation in Laplace space and then taking the small-$s$ limit. We show that the accumulation time is a monotonically increasing function of spatial position, with a jump discontinuity at the gap junction. This discontinuity vanishes in the limit $\\\\mu \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty$ for a static junction and $\\\\beta \\\\rightarrow 0$ for a stochastically-gated junction, where $\\\\beta$ is the rate at which the gate closes.

This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above. The respondents were grouped as 'affected group' and 'unaffected group' on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined. RESULTS Among 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%). Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS. People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020.

The past year has highlighted risks to immunosuppressed cancer patients and shown the need for health equity among vulnerable groups. In this study, we describe the utilization of virtual visits by patients with gynecologic malignancies and assess their social vulnerability. METHODS: Virtual visit data of 270 gynecology oncology patients at a single institution from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 was obtained by querying a cohort discovery tool. Through geocoding, the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was utilized to assign social vulnerability indices to each patient and the results were analyzed for trends and statistical significance. RESULTS: African American patients were the most vulnerable with a median SVI of 0.71, Asian 0.60, Hispanic 0.41, and Caucasian 0.21. Eighty-seven percent of patients in this study were Caucasian, 8.9% African American, 3.3% Hispanic, and 1.1% Asian, which is comparable to the baseline institutional gynecologic cancer population. The mean census tract SVI variable when comparing patients to all census tracts in the United States was 0.31 (range 0.00 least vulnerable to 0.98 most vulnerable). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual visits were utilized by patients of all ages and gynecologic cancer types. African Americans were the most socially vulnerable patients of the cohort.

There is a dire need for novel effective antivirals to treat COVID-19, as the only approved direct-acting antiviral to date is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CLpro regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the pre-clinical 3CLpro inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549+ACE2 cells). We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549+ACE2 cells and validates PF-00835231's early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231's efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549+ACE2 cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in non-human in vitro models.Importance:The arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CLpro (Mpro), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CLpro-targeting regimen in clinical trials. Using 3D in vitro models of the human airway epithelium, we demonstrate the antiviral potential of PF-00835231 for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals characterizes 3CLpro inhibitor PF-00835231 as a potential new treatment for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC)-202012/01 (also known as B.1.1.7), first collected in United Kingdom on September 20, 2020, is a rapidly growing lineage that in January 2021 constituted 86% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in England. The VOC has been detected in 40 out of 46 countries that reported at least 50 genomes in January 2021. We have estimated that the replicative advantage of the VOC is in the range 1.83-2.18 [95% CI: 1.71-2.40] with respect to the 20A.EU1 variant that dominated in England in November 2020, and in range 1.65-1.72 [95% CI: 1.46-2.04] in Wales, Scotland, Denmark, and USA.

We have estimated growth rates of expanding mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that the L18F substitution in spike has initiated a substrain of high replicative advantage in relation to the remaining VOC substrains. The L18F substitution is of significance because it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. Of concern are immune escape mutations acquired by the VOC: E484K, F490S, S494P (in the receptor binding motif of spike) and Q677H, Q675H (in the proximity of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary).

Methods: A prospective cohort of 332 COVID-19 patients was followed beyond one year. Plasma neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV-based reporter pseudoviruses expressing different SARS-CoV-2 spikes and was longitudinally analyzed using mixed-effects models. Findings: Long-term neutralizing activity was stable beyond one year after infection in mild/asymptomatic and hospitalized participants. However, longitudinal models suggest that hospitalized individuals generate both short- and long-lived memory B cells, while outpatient responses were dominated by long-lived B cells. In both groups, vaccination boosted responses to natural infection, although viral variants, mainly B.1.351, reduced the efficacy of neutralization. Importantly, despite showing higher neutralization titers, hospitalized patients showed lower cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variant compared to outpatients. Multivariate analysis identified severity of primary infection as the factor that independently determines both the magnitude and the inferior cross-neutralization activity of long-term neutralizing responses. Conclusions: Neutralizing response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneous in magnitude but stable beyond one year after infection. Vaccination boosts these long-lasting natural neutralizing responses, counteracting the significant resistance to neutralization of new viral variants.

Methods Serum and PBMC were collected from mild-COVID-19 convalescents at ~6 and 12 months after a COVID-19 positive PCR (n=43) and from healthy SARS-CoV-2-seronegative controls (n=15-40). Serum titers of RBD and Spike-specific Ig were quantified by ELISA. Virus neutralisation was assessed against homologous, pseudotyped virus and homologous and VoC live viruses. Frequencies of Spike and RBD-specific memory B cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Magnitude of memory T cell responses was quantified and phenotyped by activation-induced marker assay, while T cell functionality was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining using peptides specific to homologous Spike virus antigen and four VoC Spike antigens. Findings At 12 months after mild-COVID-19, >90% of convalescents remained seropositive for RBD-IgG and 88.9% had circulating RBD-specific memory B cells. Despite this, only 51.2% convalescents had serum neutralising activity against homologous live-SARS-CoV-2 virus, which decreased to 44.2% when tested against live B.1.1.7, 4.6% against B.1.351, 11.6% against P.1 and 16.2%, against B.1.617.2 VoC.

Interpretations SARS-CoV-2 immunity is retained in a significant proportion of mild COVID-19 convalescents 12 months post-infection in the absence of re-exposure to the virus.

Three randomized controlled trials have been conducted with IV cetirizine versus IV diphenhydramine in the ambulatory care setting. A phase 3 trial of IV cetirizine 10 mg versus IV diphenhydramine 50 mg was conducted in 262 adults who presented to the urgent care/emergency department with acute urticaria requiring antihistamines. For the primary efficacy endpoint, defined as change from baseline in a 2-h patient-rated pruritus score, non-inferiority of IV cetirizine to IV diphenhydramine was demonstrated (score ? 1.6 vs ? 1.5, respectively; 95% CI ? 0.1, 0.3).

Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management. OBJECTIVES: Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta2-agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta2-agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta2-agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta2-agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.","output":"Interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children: an overview of Cochrane Reviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single incision laparoscopy is currently performed mostly for basic laparoscopic procedures involving single abdominal quadrants.

STUDY DESIGN: Children ages 0-22 years with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presenting to urgent care clinics or being hospitalized for confirmed/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at Massachusetts General Hospital were offered enrollment in the Massachusetts General Hospital Pediatric COVID-19 Biorepository. Enrolled children provided nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and/or blood specimens. SARS-CoV-2 viral load, ACE2 RNA levels, and serology for SARS-CoV-2 were quantified. RESULTS: A total of 192 children (mean age, 10.2  7.0 years) were enrolled. Forty-nine children (26%) were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; an additional 18 children (9%) met the criteria for MIS-C. Only 25 children (51%) with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with fever; symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, if present, were nonspecific. Nasopharyngeal viral load was highest in children in the first 2 days of symptoms, significantly higher than hospitalized adults with severe disease (P = .002). Age did not impact viral load, but younger children had lower angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression (P = .004). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were increased in severe MIS-C (P < .001), with dysregulated humoral responses observed.

Our empirical results show that, compared with cities without SARS case reports, exogenous health shocks significantly increased the affected cities' medical resources supply. We provide multiple robustness tests to examine the validity of the main findings. Further study shows that the mechanism is because the SARS event increased the financial autonomy of the epidemic-affected cities, thus providing an incentive for local governments to increase health resources. Meanwhile, health shocks have little influence on the regions with only imported cases than the infected area. These findings provide a possible explanation for the inequality in the distribution of health resources.","output":"Health Shocks and Unbalanced Growth of Medical Resources: Evidence From the SARS Epidemic in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meaningful social interactions are a fundamental human need, the lack of which can pose serious risks to an individual's physical and mental health. Across species, peer-oriented social behaviors are dramatically reshaped during adolescence, a developmental period characterized by dynamic changes in brain structure and function as individuals transition into adulthood. Thus, the experience of social isolation during this critical developmental stage may be especially pernicious, as it could permanently derail typical neurobiological processes that are necessary for establishing adaptive adult behaviors. The purpose of this review is to summarize investigations in which rodents were isolated during adolescence, then re-housed in typical social groups prior to testing, thus allowing the investigators to resolve the long-term consequences of social adversity experienced during adolescent sensitive periods, despite subsequent normalization of the social environment. Here, we discuss alterations in social, anxiety-like, cognitive, and decision-making behaviors in previously isolated adult rodents. We then explore corresponding neurobiological findings, focusing on the prefrontal cortex, including changes in synaptic densities and protein levels, white matter and oligodendrocyte function, and neuronal physiology. Made more urgent by the recent wave of social deprivation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially amongst school-aged adolescents, understanding the mechanisms by which even transient social adversity can negatively impact brain function across the lifespan is of paramount importance.","output":"Persistent behavioral and neurobiological consequences of social isolation during adolescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: A frequently overlooked factor contributing to traffic crashes is driver medical conditions, including cognitive and physical impairments, which can compromise individuals' ability to drive safely. Clinicians are in a critical position (and often legally mandated) to identify patients with impairments that may affect their driving ability and counsel them on appropriate next steps. However, prior studies revealed that provider-patient discussions about driving occurred relatively infrequently and that clinician recommendations about when patients could resume driving varied substantially (Chen et al. 2008; Drazkowski et al. 2010). This research aimed to document current driver fitness assessment practices among neurology and neurosurgery clinicians at an academic medical center, with the overall purpose of informing quality improvement efforts.Methods: A cross-sectional, anonymous survey was distributed to physicians and advanced practice providers working in the neurosurgery and neurology departments of a large, Pennsylvania-based academic medical center. Survey question domains included: 1) frequency of discussions about driving, 2) comfort discussing driving with patients, 3) criteria used to assess patient fitness to drive, 4) driver rehabilitation program referral practices, and 5) Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) reporting.Results: The survey revealed that although most providers (68%) had high levels of perceived responsibility for counseling patients about driving, a minority regularly discussed driving issues with their patients (19% prior to discharge, 49% during clinic visits). In addition, only about half (54%) of providers reported having ever filed a report about a patient with the PennDOT, despite Pennsylvania's mandatory driver reporting law. Likelihood of PennDOT reporting was found to be strongly associated with provider knowledge of Pennsylvania unsafe driver reporting laws (p < 0.001).Conclusions: These findings highlight a need to enhance standard of care practices related to driver screening, counseling, and reporting. Overall, providers recognized the importance of their role in advising patients about safe driving and desired standardized protocols for guiding conversations about driving with patients, PennDOT reporting, and referring patients to driver rehabilitation services.","output":"Understanding clinician strategies for discussing driving fitness with patients: An initiative to improve provider-patient discussions about safe driving."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, an infection caused by SARS CoV2, is a worldwide public health problem at present. Pandemic of this respiratory viral infection has occurred since 2020. Recently, in late 2021, the new variant of SARS CoV2, omicron, was reported from Africa and already cause problems in many countries. Regarding omicron variant, there are many mutations within the molecule of SARS CoV2. The effect of molecular change is unknown and the study on its clinical impact is interesting. An important possible clinical impact of the mutation in omicron is a change of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy. Herein, we used a clinical mathematical model to assess the effect of mutations in omicron variants on vaccine efficacy. Compared to classical SARS CoV2, the omicron form has a large estimated decrease, believed to be roughly 12 times normal. Therefore, it is necessary to find out a new effective vaccine for controlling of the new omicron variant.","output":"Estimated change of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy due to omicron variant SARS CoV2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of November 25, 2020, over 60 million people have been infected worldwide by COVID-19, causing almost 1.43 million deaths. Puzzling low incidence numbers and milder, non-fatal disease have been observed in Thailand and its Southeast (SE) Asian neighbors. Elusive genetic mechanisms might be operative, as a multitude of genetic factors are widely shared between the SE Asian populations, such as the more than 60 different thalassemia syndromes (principally dominated by the HbE trait). In this study, we have plotted COVID-19 infection and death rates in SE Asian (SEA) countries against heterozygote HbE and thalassemia carrier prevalence. COVID-19 infection and death incidence numbers appear inversely correlated with the prevalence of HbE and thalassemia heterozygote populations. We posit that the evolutionary protective effect of the HbE and other thalassemic variants against malaria and the dengue virus may extend its advantage to resistance to COVID-19 infection, as HbE heterozygote population prevalence appears to be positively correlated with immunity to COVID-19. Host immune system modulations induce antiviral interferon responses and alter structural protein integrity, thereby inhibiting cellular access and viral replication. These changes are possibly engendered by HbE carrier miRNAs. Proving this hypothesis is important, as it may shed light on the mechanism of viral resistance and lead to novel antiviral treatments.

Unfortunately, it can also be argued that these statements are in clear misalignment between the words described and the environments that faculty, students, trainees, and staff of color face. The purpose of this study was to analyze academic medicine institutional statements that responded to 2020 racial tensions following the murders of George Floyd, among others, and the subsequent nationwide protests against police brutality. Methods We conducted a manifest content analysis of institutional statements generated by academic medical centers after George Floyd's murder. We used manifest content analysis to gain insights into how institutional statements connect structural racism to the mission of academic medicine. We collected and examined institutional statements from 26 academic medicine centers. Selection parameters included statements that were publicly available and published by the institutions during a 2-week period. We conducted a four-stage analysis: decontextualization, recontextualization, categorization, and compilation. To better understand the collection of statements, we plotted these institutional statements according to the most salient discussed themes. Results Overall, institutional statements discussed racism through three subthemes: identifying the racial implications of health disparities, issuing a call to action to address racism, and decentering race. Absent language is also noted. Second, institutional statements evoked institutional values by expressing an explicit connection with the academic medicine mission, naming the value of social justice, and emphasizing the concept of community. Finally, institutional statements largely discussed public health in connection with racism or with institutional values. Conclusion Our study determines a much-needed reconnection to the mission of academic medicine. Reclaiming the social mission will be a major step toward recentering the foundation of institutional actions. This call is what ultimately will improve the health and well-being of marginalized populations.","output":"Reclaiming the mission of academic medicine: An examination of institutional responses to (anti)racism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A meta-analysis was performed to identify patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during the first and second pandemic waves and investigate their association with the disease outcomes.

The pooled prevalence of the GI presentations was estimated using the random-effects model. Pairwise comparison for the outcomes was performed according to the GI manifestations' presentation and the pandemic wave of infection. Data were reported as relative risk (RR), or odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Of 125 articles with 25,252 patients, 20.3% presented with GI manifestations. Anorexia (19.9%), dysgeusia/ageusia (15.4%), diarrhea (13.2%), nausea (10.3%), and hematemesis (9.1%) were the most common. About 26.7% had confirmed positive fecal RNA, with persistent viral shedding for an average time of 19.2 days before being negative.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can modify the cortical excitability of gait-related brain regions. In this study, we investigated whether multichannel tDCS with simultaneous treadmill gait training could improve gait in PD. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with PD were assigned randomly to a real or sham tDCS group. Before intervention, one patient of the real tDCS group was dropped out, leaving 23 patients to be analyzed in this study. Each patient underwent 30 min of treadmill gait training for 10 sessions over four consecutive weeks. Multichannel 4x1 tDCS was applied using five 6-cm-diameter round electrodes. One anode was placed on the CZ, and four cathodes were positioned symmetrically over the FZ, C5, C6, and PZ. Anodal tDCS (2mA) and sham tDCS were delivered for 20 min. The secondary outcomes were gait performance, as measured by the timed up and go test (TUG) and freezing of gait questionnaire (FOG-Q), and balance was assessed using the dynamic gait index (DGI), Berg balance scale (BBS), and functional reach test (FRT). Motor and non-motor performance of patients with PD were assessed using the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Participants were assessed before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 4 weeks after completion of the intervention. RESULTS: The real tDCS group showed a significant improvement in the 10-m walk test, but the sham group did not. Among the secondary outcome measures, MDS-UPDRS part II, TUG, and BBS were improved only in the real tDCS group. Particularly, MDS-UPDRS part II showed a significant group(*)time interaction effect, indicating that real tDCS demonstrated a better effect on the activities of daily living patients with PD. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest that multichannel tDCS applied on the leg motor cortex during treadmill gait training is a safe and effective means to improve gait velocity in patients with PD. Additional rigorous, large-sample, multicenter, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effect of tDCS as a therapeutic adjunct for gait rehabilitation of patients with PD.","output":"Multichannel Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Combined With Treadmill Gait Training in Patients With Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess the regenerative properties and potential therapeutic value of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the bottlenose dolphin, there is a need to determine whether an adequate adipose depot exists, in addition to the development of a standardized technique for minimally invasive adipose collection.

Understanding differences between face-to-face and telehealth consulting is an important component for planning the future use of telehealth services beyond the pandemic. However, there is limited evidence on whether telehealth consulting impacts medication prescribing under pandemic circumstances. AIM: To compare medication prescribing in face-to-face consultations with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australian general practice. DESIGN & SETTING: A multisite, retrospective observational study. De-identified routinely collected electronic health data were used, which were extracted from 806 general practices in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), Australia, between April and December 2020. METHOD: The primary outcome measure was whether at least one medication was prescribed following a telehealth or face-to-face consultation. Data were reported by medication and for each of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system level 1 groups. The secondary outcome measure was first-time prescribing. Telehealth included both telephone and video consultations. RESULTS: A total of 13 608 216 consultations satisfied the inclusion criteria (61.0% face to face and 39.0% telehealth). Most telehealth consultations were conducted via telephone (97.8%). Overall, 39.3% of face-to-face and 33.0% of telehealth consultations prescribed at least one medication, which is a statistically significant difference (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.379 to 1.381). The prescribing rate was greater for face-to-face versus telehealth consultations for all drug groups except ATC level 1N (nervous system). CONCLUSION: Under COVID-19 restrictions in the states of Victoria and NSW, Australia, medication prescribing was higher in face-to-face consultations when compared with telehealth consultations in the study population.","output":"Medication prescribing in face-to-face versus telehealth consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australian general practice: a retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background and aims Healthcare delivery requires the support of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and Machine Learning to fight and look ahead against the new diseases. We aim to review the role of AI as a decisive technology to analyze, prepare us for prevention and fight with COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and other pandemics. Methods The rapid review of the literature is done on the database of Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar using the keyword of COVID-19 or Coronavirus and Artificial Intelligence or AI. Collected the latest information regarding AI for COVID-19, then analyzed the same to identify its possible application for this disease. Results We have identified seven significant applications of AI for COVID-19 pandemic. This technology plays an important role to detect the cluster of cases and to predict where this virus will affect in future by collecting and analyzing all previous data. Conclusions Healthcare organizations are in an urgent need for decision-making technologies to handle this virus and help them in getting proper suggestions in real-time to avoid its spread. AI works in a proficient way to mimic like human intelligence. It may also play a vital role in understanding and suggesting the development of a vaccine for COVID-19.

Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest a link between SARS-CoV-2 and cool weather. One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in a population equilibrium. While these issues should be considered, climate still may be important for predicting the future distribution of SARS-CoV-2. To further examine if there is a link, we model with raw cases and population scaled cases for SARS-CoV-2 county-level data from the United States. We show that SDMs built from population scaled cases data cannot be distinguished from control models built from raw human population data, while SDMs built on raw data fail to predict the current known distribution of cases in the US. The population scaled analyses indicate that climate may not play a central role in current US viral distribution and that human population density is likely a primary driver. Still, we do find slightly more population scaled viral cases in cooler areas. This coupled with our geographically constrained focus make it so we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the US SARS-CoV-2 distribution. Climate's role on SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS-CoV-2 can spread anywhere in the US.","output":"Spatial modeling cannot currently differentiate SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and human distributions on the basis of climate in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, I describe how the theory of integrative learning frames student learning in a course on climate leadership The course is grounded in the theory of strong sustainability, which is sustainability for the planet rather than for individual companies alone In a description of Beta, an MBA course on climate leadership, I show how these theories interact to enhance the student experience Implications for the theories of integrative learning and strong sustainability as emerging pedagogies are discussed This course can be adapted for undergraduate and executive audiences Course content emphasizes what leaders need to know to make effective decisions in their organizations and communities, with an emphasis on applying a range of social sciences, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, and economics A description of the pedagogical content is embedded in the article, and includes learning objectives, assignments, the main topics, a short book aligned with these topics, other readings, and an array of media Additional pedagogical materials, including experiential exercises, are available directly from the author","output":"Teaching Climate Leadership: Promoting Integrative Learning in Courses on Strong Sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In 2019, we used the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Quality Training Program (QTP) as an instrument to improve the inclusion rate in clinical trials (CTs) for bladder cancer patients from 24% in 2018 to 43,75% in 2019. CTs play an important role in developing new treatments, expanding or refining treatments that are already available, and/or identifying behavioral changes that can prolong or improve the lives of subjects. Therefore, we believe it is important for patients and for society to maintain the inclusion rate in clinical trials despite COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We collected the number of bladder cancer patients evaluated for the first time in the Oncology department, the number of patients who were offered a clinical trial, the screen failures and the number of patients enrolled in CTs. Results: In 2019, we were able to increase the enrollment rate in CTs for bladder cancer patients to from 24% to 43,75% thanks to the ASCO-QTP. With this program we created a list of measures and identified the ones that would have a greater impact. The one that seems to have had the highest impact is the diffusion of CTs in the Investigation Unit and the Genitourinary (GU) board. In 2020, thanks to this measure and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to maintain a 40,81% enrollment rate. When analyzing the patients evaluated for the first time in the Oncology department, 48 in 2019 and 49 in 2020, there were some interesting differences. In 2020, 42,86% had stage IV disease with respect to 39,6% in 2019, and only 22,44% had non-muscle invasive disease (NMIBC) versus 33,33% in 2019. However, thanks to the diffusion of CTs in the Investigation Unit and in the GU-board, which translates in an early derivation of patients to Medical Oncology and an increase in the number of available CTs, we were able to offer a CT to 73,5% of patients in 2020 against 60,4% in 2019. Although there was an increase of screen failures in 2020 (32,65% vs. 16,66%), 50% of them were due to the absence of a biomarker in a biomarker driven CT, with respect to 25% in 2019. Conclusions: Using ASCO-QTP as an instrument, we identified the importance of the diffusion of CTs and the close collaboration between departments. Maintaining these measures, we were able to uphold the inclusion rate in CTs for bladder cancer patients in 40,81% despite the later diagnosis of patients due to COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Improving the inclusion rate in clinical trials of bladder cancer despite COVID-19 pandemic by using ASCO quality training program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduccin La pandemia COVID-19 que se declar el 11 de marzo de este a?o, se extendi desde China a todo el mundo rpidamente, y la gran cantidad de pacientes infectados ha saturado nuestro precario sistema de salud, lo que ha obligado a restringir la actividad quirrgica electiva y de emergencia El objetivo del presente estudio fue describir las caractersticas clnicas y quirrgicas de los pacientes con COVID-19 operados en el servicio de emergencia del Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins - EsSalud Mtodo Se realiz un estudio descriptivo, observacional y retrospectivo, donde se incluyeron los pacientes con diagnstico de COVID-19 operados por el servicio de emergencia, entre el 6 de marzo y el 8 de junio de 2020 Se analizan las caractersticas clnicas, hallazgos en los exmenes diagnsticos y caractersticas quirrgicas Resultados Se operaron de emergencia 26 pacientes y se realizaron 17 cesreas, 4 apendicectomas, 2 resecciones intestinales con ostoma, una herniorrafia inguinal, una rafia vesical y una laparotoma exploradora Todas tu-vieron abordaje abierto Los sntomas ms frecuentes fueron tos y fiebre;23% los pacientes fueron asintomticos El diagnstico de COVID-19 se confirm con pruebas rpidas o serolgicas En el grupo de patologa abdominal se elevaron la protena C reactiva y el dmero D ms que en el grupo de cesreas Se encontr una complicacin (infeccin del sitio operatorio) y no se observ fallecimientos Conclusin La adopcin de medidas restrictivas en la indicacin quirrgica de emergencia en los pacientes puede explicar la ausencia de complicaciones severas y fallecimientos en esta serie Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic that was declared on March 11 of this year, spread from China to the entire world rapidly, and the large number of infected patients has saturated our precarious health system, which has forced to restrict the elective and emergency surgical activity The objective of this study was to describe the clinical and surgical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 operated on in the emergency service of the Edgardo Rebagliati Martins National Hospital - EsSalud Method A descriptive, observational and retrospective study was performed, which included patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 operated by the emergency service, between March 6 and June 8, 2020 The clinical characteristics, diagnostic tests and surgical findings were analyzed Results 26 patients underwent emergency surgery and 17 caesarean sections, four appendectomies, two intestinal resections with ostomy, an inguinal herniorrhaphy, a bladder raffia and an exploratory laparotomy were performed All had an open approach The most frequent symptoms were cough and fever;23% of the patients were asymptomatic The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed with rapid or serological tests In the abdominal pathology group, C-reactive protein and D-dimer were elevated more than in the cesarean section A complication was found (infection of the surgical site) and no deaths were observed Conclusion The adoption of restrictive measures in surgical indications for emergency patients may explain the absence of severe complications and deaths in this series","output":"Emergency abdominopelvic operations in patients with COVID-19at Hospital Edgardo Rebagliati Martins - EsSalud"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: During the first months of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, numerous concerns about the nursing workforce were reported. Nursing education programs have reported that their students were not able to continue their clinical education due to worries about infection risks within hospitals and some have cancelled or reduced entering cohorts. At the same time, anecdotal reports suggested that some RNs near retirement chose to retire early to reduce the risk of infection with SARS\\\\Cov2. These changes, if true, could undermine the progress made over the past 20 years toward a balanced nursing labor market and lead to shortages of RNs in the near future. STUDY DESIGN: This study uses data from two surveys conducted in California to assess the current and future supply of RNs, and to learn how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting this essential workforce. Early data from two surveys have been analyzed to provide a rapid assessment of the workforce: (1) the biennial Survey of California Registered Nurses, and (2) the Board of Registered Nursing Annual Schools Survey. Data from the Survey of California RNs, which is based on a stratified sample of the state's nurses, are weighted to represent the total population of nurses. Analysis methods include tabulating means and frequency distributions for the 2020 surveys and comparing the results to prior years. The data from these surveys are then used in a stock\\\\and\\\\flow supply projection model to learn the extent to which RN shortages might emerge in the future. POPULATION STUDIED: Registered nurses and nursing education programs in California. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Approximately 2000 RNs responded to the biennial Survey by November 2020. The data indicate that: (1) employment rates of older nurses dropped substantially: 6 percentage points for RNs 60\\\\64 years old and 10 percentage points for RNs 65 years and older. Employment rates for nurses younger than 30 years also dropped, but not significantly. Employment of nurses 30\\\\49 years increased approximately 6 percentage points, making up for the decreases of older RNs. Among RNs 55\\\\64 years old, the percent reporting they intend to retire or leave nursing within two years increased from 11.4% in 2018 to 24.5% in 2020. The survey of RN education programs finds that 16 of California's 147 nursing programs skipped a cohort of students in 2020 and another 18 programs enrolled fewer students than the prior academic year. The estimated decrease in students statewide is approximately 350 \\\\ 2.3% of ~15,000 new enrollments in 2018\\\\2019. CONCLUSIONS: Although RN enrollments decreased only negligibly, the rapid decrease in employment of older nurses and increase in projected retirements suggest that RN shortages may rapidly emerge. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: Over the past five years, hospitals have been increasingly uninterested in hiring newly\\\\graduated nurses, even while reporting shortages of experienced RNs. Hospitals need to rapidly hire newly\\\\graduated RNs in order to compensate for the rapid outflow of older RNs from the labor supply.","output":"Changes in Registered Nurse Employment and Education Capacity during the COVID\\\\19 Pandemic and the Risk of Future Shortages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a pandemic, science literacy is transformed from a subject of sociological research into a question of the survival of society itself.

Despite improvement in standardized screening methods and the development of promising therapies, the 5-year survival rates are as low as 10% in the metastatic setting. The increasing life expectancy of the general population, higher rates of obesity, poor diet, and comorbidities contribute to the increasing trends in incidence.

Secondly, an initial oow of 60 L/min and 37 should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased. Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease.

The impaired balance of the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio obtained from spectral components of RR intervals can be a diagnostic test for sepsis. In addition, it is known that a reduction of heart rate variability (HRV) is useful in identifying septic patients at risk of the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). We have reported a non-contact method using a microwave radar to monitor the heart and respiratory rates of a healthy person placed inside an isolator or of experimental animals exposed to toxic materials. APPARATUS DESIGN AND TESTING. With the purpose of preventing secondary exposure of medical personnel to toxic materials under biochemical hazard conditions, we designed a novel apparatus for non-contact measurement of HRV using a 1215 MHz microwave radar, a high-pass filter, and a personal computer. The microwave radar monitors only the small reflected waves from the subject's chest wall, which are modulated by the cardiac and respiratory motion. The high-pass filter enhances the cardiac signal and attenuates the respiratory signal. In a human trial, RR intervals derived from the non-contact apparatus significantly correlated with those derived from ECG (r=0.98, P<0.0001). The non-contact apparatus showed a similar power spectrum of RR intervals to that of ECG. CONCLUSIONS. Our non-contact HRV measurement apparatus appears promising for future pre-hospital monitoring of septic patients or for predicting MODS patients, inside isolators or in the field for mass casualties under biochemical hazard circumstances.","output":"A novel apparatus for non-contact measurement of heart rate variability: a system to prevent secondary exposure of medical personnel to toxic materials under biochemical hazard conditions, in monitoring sepsis or in predicting multiple organ dysfunction syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The REDS-IV-P Epidemiology, Surveillance and Preparedness of the Novel SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic (RESPONSE) seroprevalence study conducted monthly cross-sectional testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on blood donors in six U.S. metropolitan regions to estimate the extent of SARS-COV-2 infections over time. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: During March-August 2020, approximately &#8805;1,000 serum specimens were collected monthly from each region and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a well-validated algorithm. Regional seroprevalence estimates were weighted based on demographic differences with the general population. Seroprevalence was compared with reported COVID-19 case rates over time. RESULTS/FINDINGS: For all regions, seroprevalence was <1.0% in March 2020. New York experienced the biggest increase (peak seroprevalence, 15.8 % in May). All other regions experienced modest increases in seroprevalence(1-2% in May-June to 2-4% in July-August). Seroprevalence was higher in younger, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic donors. Temporal increases in donor seroprevalence correlated with reported case rates in each region. In August, 1.3-5.6 estimated cumulative infections (based on seroprevalence data) per COVID-19 case reported to CDC. CONCLUSION: Increases in seroprevalence were found in all regions, with the largest increase in New York. Seroprevalence was higher in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic blood donors than in non-Hispanic White blood donors.

In the technological challenge, the reason for the priority and more widespread loss of jobs by women is due to the fact that they are more often than men engaged in routine work in which is a large proportion of repetitive operations that are easy to automate and delegate to robots or artificial intelligence (AI) During the epidemiological challenge, more female than male jobs fell into the risk zone of unemployment, because as a result of self-isolation most enterprises and organizations in the service sphere, such as shopping centers, hairdressers and beauty salons, hotels and boarding houses, museums and libraries were closed, as well as airports and travel agencies - and all these enterprises employed mainly women On account of the high risk of unemployment, these activities were included in the List of economy sectors most affected by coronavirus developed by the Government to provide priority targeted support However, according to the information from the Ministry of Finance, less than a fifth of the service sector organizations and individual entrepreneurs will be able to receive this assistance, and therefore it is unlikely to avoid an increase in female unemployment ߧӧߧ ӧ, ѧާ֧ߧߧ  ѧ -  ӧ٧է֧ۧӧڧ ߧ ٧ѧߧ ا֧ߧڧ  ާاڧ ֧ߧݧԧڧ֧ܧԧ  ڧէ֧ާڧݧԧڧ֧ܧԧ ӧ٧ӧ,  ѧܧا ڧڧߧ ڧ ѧڧާާ֧ڧߧԧ ӧݧڧߧڧ ߧ ѧҧߧڧܧ  ٧ѧӧڧڧާ  ݧ ҧ ڧ էӧ ӧ٧ӧ ҧݧӧݧ֧,  էߧ ߧ - ڧ ѧܧѧݧߧ,   էԧ - ֧,   ߧ ڧߧڧڧѧݧߧ ݧڧѧ  ѧѧܧ֧   էݧڧ֧ݧߧ ӧ٧է֧ۧӧڧ ߧ ߧ է, ߧ ݧ֧էӧڧ ڧ ӧݧڧߧڧ ߧ ٧ѧߧ ا֧ߧڧ ӧѧէѧ   ҧڧ ݧѧ ڧӧէ  ֧ ѧҧڧ ާ֧ էڧߧѧܧӧ ݧ֧էӧڧ էݧ ٧ѧߧ ا֧ߧڧ  ݧ ѧ٧ߧ ӧ٧ӧ ߧ ݧѧۧߧ  ӧ٧ѧߧ  ֧,  ڧڧߧ  ѧܧ ڧܧ ֧ӧ֧֧էߧ ֧ ѧҧ էݧ ا֧ߧڧ ҧݧӧݧ֧ߧ ԧ֧ߧէ֧ߧ ֧ԧ֧ԧѧڧ֧ ٧ѧߧ, ܧѧ է֧ݧڧ ѧҧڧ ާ֧  ֧ݧ ѧݧ ߧ ?ا֧ߧܧڧ?  ?ާاܧڧ?  ֧ߧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ӧ٧ӧ ڧڧߧ ҧݧ֧ ާѧӧ ֧ ѧҧڧ ާ֧ ا֧ߧڧߧѧާ ӧ٧ѧߧ  ֧,  ߧ ѧ, ֧ ާاڧߧ ٧ѧߧ ӧݧߧ֧ߧڧ֧ ڧߧߧ ѧҧ (ܧѧߧ֧ݧܧ, ԧӧ  ާ էҧߧ),  ܧ ӧ֧ݧڧܧ էݧ ӧڧ ֧ѧڧ, ڧ ݧ֧ԧܧ ѧӧާѧڧ٧ڧӧѧ ڧݧ ֧֧ڧ ԧѧާާѧ ڧܧӧ֧ߧߧԧ ڧߧ֧ݧݧ֧ܧ  ڧէ֧ާڧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ӧ٧ӧ ҧݧ ?ا֧ߧܧڧ?, ֧ ?ާاܧڧ? ѧҧڧ ާ֧ ѧݧ  ٧ߧ ڧܧ ҧ֧٧ѧҧڧ ڧ-٧ ԧ,   ӧ٧  ѧާڧ٧ݧڧ֧ ٧ѧܧ ҧݧڧߧӧ ֧էڧڧ  ԧѧߧڧ٧ѧڧ ֧ ݧ ߧѧ֧ݧ֧ߧڧ (ԧӧ ֧ߧ, ѧڧܧާѧ֧ܧڧ, ާ٧֧, ѧԧ֧ߧӧ  ѧ էѧݧ֧),  ܧ ѧҧѧݧ ֧ڧާ֧ӧ֧ߧߧ ا֧ߧڧߧ  ӧ٧  ӧܧڧ ڧܧ ҧ֧٧ѧҧڧ, ѧܧڧ ӧڧէ է֧֧ݧߧ ѧݧ  ?֧֧֧ߧ ߧѧڧҧݧ֧ ѧէѧӧڧ  ܧߧѧӧڧ ѧݧ֧ ܧߧާڧܧ?, ѧ٧ѧҧѧߧߧ ѧӧڧ֧ݧӧ էݧ ݧ֧ߧڧ ֧ӧ֧֧էߧ ѧէ֧ߧ էէ֧اܧ էߧѧܧ,  ڧߧާѧڧ ڧߧڧ֧ӧ ڧߧѧߧ,  ާ ާا֧ ݧڧ ާ֧ߧ֧  ѧ ԧѧߧڧ٧ѧڧ  ڧߧէڧӧڧէѧݧߧ ֧էڧߧڧާѧ֧ݧ֧ ֧ ݧ,  ݧ֧էӧѧ֧ݧߧ  ҧ֧٧ѧҧڧ ا֧ߧڧ ڧ٧ҧ֧اѧ ӧ ݧ էѧ","output":"Actual challenges of labor market and their gender implications for employment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic following its initial emergence in China. SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus genome of around 30Kb. Using next-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes are being sequenced at an unprecedented rate and being deposited in public repositories. For the de novo assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a myriad of assemblers is being used, although their impact on the assembly quality has not been characterized for this virus. In this study, we aim to understand the variabilities on assembly qualities due to the choice of the assemblers. RESULTS: We performed 6648 de novo assemblies of 416 SARS-CoV-2 samples using eight different assemblers with different k-mer lengths. We used Illumina paired-end sequencing reads and compared the assembly quality of those assemblers. We showed that the choice of assembler plays a significant role in reconstructing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Two metagenomic assemblers, e.g. MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes, performed better compared with others in most of the assembly quality metrics including, recovery of a larger fraction of the genome, constructing larger contigs and higher N50, NA50 values, etc. We showed that at least 09% (259/2873) of the variants present in the assemblies between MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes are unique to one of the assembly methods. CONCLUSION: Our analyses indicate the critical role of assembly methods for assembling SARS-CoV-2 genome using short reads and their impact on variant characterization. This study could help guide future studies to determine the best-suited assembler for the de novo assembly of virus genomes.","output":"Choice of assemblers has a critical impact on de novo assembly of SARS-CoV-2 genome and characterizing variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The quality of healthcare in Israel is considered high, and this achievement is due to the structure and organization of the healthcare system. The goal of the present review is to describe the major achievements and challenges of quality improvement in the Israeli healthcare system. BODY: In recent years, the Ministry of Health has made major strides in increasing the publics access to comparative data on quality, finances and patient satisfaction. Several mechanisms at multiple levels help promote quality improvement and patient safety. These include legislation, financial incentives, and national programs for quality indicators, patient experience, patient safety, prevention and control of infection and accreditation. Over the years, improvements in quality indicators, infection prevention and patient satisfaction can be demonstrated, but other fields show little change, if at all. Challenges and barriers include reluctance by unions, inconsistent and unreliable flow of information, the fear of overpressure by management and the loss of autonomy by physicians, and doubts regarding gaming of data. Accreditation has its own challenges, such as the need to adjust it to local characteristics of the healthcare system, its high cost, and the limited evidence of its impact on quality. Lack of interest by leaders, lack of resources, burnout and compassion fatigue, are listed as challenges for improving patient experience. CONCLUSION: Substantial efforts are being made in Israel to improve quality of care, based on the use of good data to understand what is working and what needs particular attention. Government and health care providers have the tools to continue to improve. However, several mechanisms for improving the quality of care, such as minimizing healthcare disparities, training for quality, and widespread implementation of the choosing wisely initiative, should be implemented more intensively and effectively.","output":"National initiatives to promote quality of care and patient safety: achievements to date and challenges ahead"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infectious complications, especially febrile neutropenia, in hemato-oncological patients are associated with considerable morbidity, mortality and expenses. Remote monitoring of physiological functions and thus early detection of adverse events via telemedicine could improve the safety of these high-risk patients and save financial resources by shortening the time-to-antibiotics. METHODS: Patients undergoing active cancer treatment in high risk of acquiring severe infection are selected and enrolled in this project. Each patient receives a digital blood pressure monitor, an infrared thermometer and a mobile hub (cell phone). In the comfort of their homes, patients measure their blood pressure/pulse and body temperature regularly or whenever they feel unwell. The obtained data are encrypted and forwarded via the mobile hub to the password-protected portal. The values registered outside the set-up range trigger the alarms, which are immediately sent to the designated physician who can check the portal in real-time from any device with an Internet connection, contact the patient, if need be, and initiate the anti-infective therapy almost instantly after the first symptoms occur. RESULTS: Fifty hemato-oncological patients were recruited between March 1, 2018 and August 1, 2020. Two hundred ninety-seven alarms of body temperature were registered and checked by the physician and patients were contacted in 18.5% of the cases (55/297). Among these 55 events, 13 required medical assistance, which makes it approximately one-quarter of all conducted telephone interventions (23.4%) and neither septic shock nor death due to treatment-related toxicity occurred.

Here, we constructed a reporter replicon of SARS-CoV-2, which can be handled in a BSL-2 laboratory. The Renilla luciferase activity effectively reflected the transcription and replication levels of the replicon genome. We identified the suitability of the replicon in antiviral screening using the known inhibitors, and thus established the replicon-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for SARS-CoV-2. The application of the HTS assay was further validated using a few hit natural compounds, which were screened out in a SARS-CoV-2 induced cytopathic-effect-based HTS assay in our previous study.

Outcome measures such as return to employment and body mass index (BMI) have not been reported and are necessary for comparison with open transcranial approaches. Most prior reports of the endoscopic, endonasal approach have reported unacceptably high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak rates. OBJECTIVE To assess the outcome of endoscopic, endonasal surgery in a consecutive series of craniopharyngiomas with special attention to extent of resection, CSF leak, return to employment, and BMI. METHODS Twenty-six surgeries were performed on 24 patients at Weill Cornell Medical College-New York Presbyterian Hospital. Five patients had recurrent lesions. Gross-total resection (GTR) was attempted in 21 surgeries. Indications for intended subtotal resection were advanced age, medical comorbidities, preservation of pituitary function, and hypothalamic invasion. RESULTS Mean tumor diameter was 2.9 cm. GTR (18 surgeries) or near-total (>95%) resection (2 surgeries) was achieved in 95% when GTR was the goal. Seven patients received postoperative radiation therapy. Mean follow-up was 35 months with no recurrences in GTR cases and stable disease in all patients at last follow-up. Vision improved in 77%. Diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism developed in 42% and 38%, respectively. A more than 9% increase in BMI occurred in 39%; 69% returned to their preoperative profession/schooling. The postoperative CSF leak rate was 3.8%. CONCLUSION Minimal-access, endoscopic, endonasal surgery for craniopharyngioma can achieve high rates of GTR with low rates of CSF leak. Return to employment and obesity rates are comparable to microscope-assisted transcranial and transsphenoidal reports.","output":"Endoscopic, endonasal resection of craniopharyngiomas: analysis of outcome including extent of resection, cerebrospinal fluid leak, return to preoperative productivity, and body mass index."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clustering is the task that has been used in numerous applications including digital image analysis and processing.

The first infection (confirmed case) was detected in the City Wuhan, Hubei, China. First, it was an epidemic in China, but in the first quarter of 2020, it evolved into a pandemic, which continues to this day. The COVID-19 pandemic with its incredible speed of spread shows the vulnerability of a globalized and networked world. The first months of the pandemic were characterized by heavy burden on health systems. Worldwide, the population of countries was affected with severe restrictions, like educational system shutdown, public traffic system breakdown or a comprehensive lockdown. The severity of the burden was dependent on many factors, e.g. government, culture or health system. However, the burden happened regarding each country with slight time lags, cf. Bracke et al. (2020). This paper focuses on data analytics regarding infection data of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a continuation of the research study COVID-19 pandemic data analytics: Data heterogeneity, spreading behavior, and lockdown impact, published by Bracke et al. (2020). The goal of this assessment is the evaluation/analysis of infection data mining considering model uncertainty, pandemic spreading behavior with lockdown impact and early second wave in Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and France.

Therefore, there are great concerns about the mental health of physicians. In this research, we aimed to reveal the factors that affect the burnout among physicians working during the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving physicians working during the pandemic in health institutions that admit COVID-19 patients. A questionnaire form consisting of the Sociodemographic Data Form and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used. The questionnaire was sent to the contact numbers of physicians via the internet. The target population was reached through the communication groups of the Turkish Thoracic Society and other professional associations, the communication groups of health institutions, and also through personal correspondence. Burnout was evaluated with the scores of each participant from the 3 subscales of Emotional Exhaustion (EE), Depersonalization (DP), and Lack of Accomplishment (LA). RESULTS: Of the 1177 physicians who participated in the survey, 893 answered the survey completely. Females comprised 56.70% (n = 506) of the respondents, and the mean age was 38.63 (11.65). The residents (41%, n = 366) and specialists (31%, n = 277) made up the majority of the physicians. Eighty-six percent (n = 768) of the physicians had difficulty in obtaining personal protective equipment (PPE). It was determined that 81.7% (n = 730) of the 893 physicians were actively working in pandemic units (outpatient clinics, emergencies, inpatient clinics, intensive care units), and burnout was significantly higher in these physicians (P < .01). After excluding other confounding factors by regression analysis, their Maslach total scores and EE scores were found to be significantly high (P = .001). CONCLUSION: Working in pandemic units and facing difficulty in accessing PPE are identified as the most important risk factors for burnout. Hence, we can say that working with PPE, and with the managers discretion and support, the physicians burnout can be prevented.","output":"Facing the pandemic: Burnout in physicians in turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan, a national COVID-19 cluster taskforce (comprising governmental and nongovernmental experts) was established to support the countrys Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in conducting daily risk assessment.

Even after adjustment for other variables, men were significantly more likely to over-rate their symptoms in comparison with the clinical observer than were women.

There are many indicators that are used in the decision making for the investment in the power sector, however, predominant are the economic indicators which underestimate the depreciation of natural capital (environment) and the value added generated by the public services. Many research studies have been carried out in an attempt to demonstrate the versatility of the EF by extending its applicability not only to environmental assessment, but also to use it, among other economic indicators, when assessing sustainable investment. Sustainable investment (SI) combines fundamental analysis and engagement with an evaluation of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors. The purpose of this article is, upon evaluating the EF, to identify the opportunities for the EF reduction through sustainable investment in the electricity production sector in EU countries. Environmental footprint analysis has been performed by using sustainable process index program SPIonExcel (SPI), which is one of the methods in the EF family. SPI is a useful tool for assessing ecological problems and finding sustainable solutions in the life cycle of energy production process. This research has revealed that the function of the footprint reduction depends directly on investments in renewable energy source (RES) technologies, but not all investments can be sustainable. Countries mainly invest in the development of wind energy and solar PV technologies and gradually reduce their inland production capacities from fossil fuel. Although SI in RES technologies reduces the EF, this is not enough to reduce it substantially because there are limitations for installing new power capacities. Consequently, countries tend to invest in the development of electricity networks. The conclusion can be drawn as follows: the reduction of the EF of electricity could be achieved by developing RES technologies since the major part of electricity is produced by using non-renewable resources. It is essential to develop new technologies as soon as possible in order to reduce EF as much as possible, and this can only be achieved through systematic sustainable investment.","output":"Sustainable InvestmentA Solution to Reduce Environmental Footprint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medicinal plants are a two-edged sword that might be exploited as a treatment specific dosage, and as deadly poisonous substances to commit murder or suicide when administered in high doses.

Although scientific evidence supports claims of negative effects of BPA on humans, there is also evidence suggesting that a low level of BPA is safe. However, numerous in vivo trials contraindicate with this claim and there is a high possibility of BPA exposure could lead to obesity. It has been speculated that this does not stop with the exposed subjects only, but may also cause transgenerational effects. Direct disruption of endocrine regulation, neuroimmune and signaling pathways, as well as gut microbiata, has been identified to be interrupted by BPA exposure, leading to overweight or obesity. In these instances, cardiovascular complications are one of the primary notable clinical signs. In regard to this claim, this review paper discusses the role of BPA on obesity in the perspective of endocrine disruptions and possible cardiovascular complications that may arise due to BPA. Thus, the aim of this review is to outline the changes in gut microbiota and neuroimmune or signaling mechanisms involved in obesity in relation to BPA. To identify potentially relevant articles, a depth search was done on the databases Nature, PubMed, Wiley Online Library, and Medline & Ovid from the past 5 years. According to Boolean operator guideline, selected keywords such as (1) BPA OR environmental chemical AND fat OR LDL OR obese AND transgenerational effects or phenocopy (2) Endocrine disruptors OR chemical AND lipodystrophy AND phenocopy (3) Lipid profile OR weight changes AND cardiovascular effect (4) BPA AND neuroimmune OR gene signaling, were used as search terms. Upon screening, 11 articles were finalized to be further reviewed and data extraction tables containing information on (1) the type of animal model (2) duration and dosage of BPA exposure (3) changes in the lipid profile or weight (4) genes, signaling mechanism, or any neuroimmune signal involved, and (5) transgenerational effects were created. In toto, the study indicates there are high chances of BPA exposure affecting lipid profile and gene associated with lipolysis, leading to obesity. Therefore, this scoping review recapitulates the possible effects of BPA that may lead to obesity with the evidence of current in vivo trials.

Recent studies have shown improvement of survival and quality of life when radiopharmaceuticals were given repeatedly or in combination with chemotherapy. We designed a phase I study combining docetaxel and (186)Re-labelled hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (HEDP) in men with CRPC and bone metastases to evaluate toxicity. METHODS A dose escalation schedule was designed consisting of four dose levels with a standard dosage of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) 3-weekly). (186)Re-HEDP was given in increasing activities (1,250 MBq up to 2,500 MBq) after the third and sixth cycle of docetaxel. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any grade 4 toxicity lasting more than 7 days or any grade 3 toxicity that did not recover within 10 days. Three patients were planned for each dose level expanding to six if a DLT occurred. RESULTS Fourteen patients were recruited with a median age of 64.6 years. One DLT, grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting >10 days, occurred at dose level 3 leading to expansion of this group to six. One of these patients had an episode of acute renal failure which resolved. Because of production problems of (186)Re-HEDP dose level 4 was not started. CONCLUSION Combined therapy with docetaxel and (186)Re-HEDP is generally well tolerated in patients with CRPC metastatic to bone. We will conduct a randomized phase II study using three cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) 3-weekly followed by (188)Re-HEDP 40 MBq/kg body weight, followed by another three cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), followed by (188)Re-HEDP 20 MBq/kg body weight.","output":"A phase I study of combined docetaxel and repeated high activity 186Re-HEDP in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) metastatic to bone (the TAXIUM trial)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During COVID-19 pandemic, Italian pediatric oncology departments were obliged to adopt restrictive measures to minimize the risk of in-hospital infections in frail patients and staff members.

High flow local extraction (HFLE) is a standard in other industries that deal with airborne contaminants. This study provides a quantitative evaluation of an HFLE concept feasible to implement in most real clinical settings. Method A unique combined experimental model of Laser sheet illumination videography paired with continuous nanoparticle counts was used to quantitatively assess the impact of HFLE in an operating theatre. Propylene Glycol was aerosolised via a customised physiological lung simulator and dispersion was measured in 3 dimensions. Cumulative probability heat maps were generated to describe aerosol behaviour. Continuous particle counts were made at 15 locations throughout the room to validate laser assessments. Results HFLE effectively reduced dispersion of simulated exhaled aerosols to undetectable levels. With the HFLE in operation and optimally positioned, the aerosol plume was tightly controlled. Particle counts remained at baseline when HFLE was active. HFLE becomes less effective with increasing distance from source. Plume behaviour in the absence of HFLE was highly variable and unpredictable. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates great potential for HFLE to have a significant impact in reducing aerosol transmission. Simple HFLE devices can be easily engineered and could be widely deployed without impacting on the safe delivery of care.

Staff testing is critical in identifying and isolating infected individuals while also reducing unnecessary workforce depletion. Tygerberg Hospital implemented an online pre-registration system to expedite staff and cluster testing. Objectives: We aimed to identify (1) specific presentations associated with a positive or negative result for SARS-CoV-2 and (2) staff sectors where enhanced strategies for testing might be required. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study involving all clients making use of the hospital's pre-registration system during May 2020. Results: Of 799 clients, most were young and female with few comorbidities. The most common occupation was nurses followed by administrative staff, doctors and general assistants. Doctors tested earlier compared to other staff (median: 1.5 vs 4 days). The most frequent presenting symptoms were headache, sore throat, cough and myalgia. Amongst those testing positive (n=105), fever, altered smell, altered taste sensation, chills and history of fever were the most common symptoms. Three or more symptoms was more predictive of a positive test, but 12/145 asymptomatic clients also tested positive. Conclusion: Staff coronavirus testing using an online pre-registration form is a viable and acceptable strategy. While some presentations are less likely to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, no symptom can completely exclude it.

Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of human cancer, associated with metastasis and therapeutic resistance.

Loss of centrosome integrity activates the p38-p53-p21 pathway, which results in cell-cycle arrest or senescence and acts as a cell-cycle checkpoint pathway. Structural and numerical centrosome abnormalities can lead to aneuploidy and CIN. New findings derived from studies on cancer and rare genetic disorders suggest that centrosome dysfunction alters the cellular microenvironment through Rho GTPases, p38, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase)-dependent signaling in a way that is favorable for pro-invasive secretory phenotypes and aneuploidy tolerance.

Our study encompasses several different phases since the National Lockdown in Italy. The primary outcome is (I) to analyze the prevalence of positive NST (Nasopharyngeal Swab Test) among the largest Italian Pediatric cohort admitted to a single regional PED Hub for COVID-19 during an eight-month period. Secondary outcomes are: (II) the description of trend of admissions in our PED and (III) the categorization of the positive patients according to clinical manifestations and epidemiological link. METHODS: We described 316 patients with a positive NST for SARS-CoV2, on a total of 5001 nasopharyngeal swabs performed among 13,171 admissions at our PED, over a period starting from March 17th, 2020 to December 1st, 2020. Age, epidemiological link, clinical features and hospitalizations were analyzed according to different lockdown phases. Data were collected anonymously from electronic records and analyzed using SPSS 22.00 statistics software (Chicago, IL). RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of total admissions have been tested. During the post lockdown period, we performed the highest percentage of NST (Nasopharyngeal Swab Test) 49.7%, and among them 7.9% were positive. The prevalence of infection during a 10-month period was 2.3%. Mean age was 6.5 years old. Familial Link accounted for the 67.7% of infection, while Extrafamilial and Unknown link accounted for 17 and 14.9%, respectively. Familial link is predominant during all phases. Seventeen patients showed an intra-scholastic link, and the highest prevalence was observed in the 7C10 years age group, with a prevalence of 12.8% (5 patients). Fever was the most frequent symptom (66%), in particular among preschooler children aged 0C6 years (71.9%). Older children were more frequently symptomatic. Seven patients were admitted with MIS-C diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Different levels of containment measures caused important changes in number of positive NST for SARS-CoV2.

China has experienced the unprecedented epidemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in an era when social media has fundamentally transformed information production and consumption patterns. OBJECTIVE: This study examined public engagement and government responsiveness in the communications about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage based on an analysis of data from Sina Weibo, a major social media platform in China. METHODS: Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020, were retrieved. Engagement data (likes, comments, shares, and followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. Latent class analysis further explored main content patterns, and chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study time frame. RESULTS: The public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier for Weibo than the government. Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant to COVID-19 from government agency accounts. The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situations; general knowledge of the new disease; and policies, guidelines, and official actions. However, personal posts were more likely to show empathy to affected people (&#967;21=13.3, P<.001), attribute blame to other individuals or government (&#967;21=28.9, P<.001), and express worry about the epidemic (&#967;21=32.1, P<.001), while government posts were more likely to share instrumental support (&#967;21=32.5, P<.001) and praise people or organizations (&#967;21=8.7, P=.003). As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation updates (for trend, &#967;21=19.7, P<.001) and policies, guidelines, and official actions (for trend, &#967;21=15.3, P<.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts. Moreover, as the epidemic evolved, showing empathy and attributing blame (for trend, &#967;21=25.3, P<.001) became more frequent in personal posts, corresponding to a slight increase in sharing instrumental support, praising, and empathizing in government posts (for trend, &#967;21=9.0, P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: The government should closely monitor social media data to improve the timing of communications about an epidemic. As the epidemic evolves, merely sharing situation updates and policies may be insufficient to capture public interest in the messages. The government may adopt a more empathic communication style as more people are affected by the disease to address public concerns.","output":"Public Engagement and Government Responsiveness in the Communications About COVID-19 During the Early Epidemic Stage in China: Infodemiology Study on Social Media Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims To review the evidence regarding the possibility of fetal vertical transmission in COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers by diagnosing through placental swabs.

Disease heterogeneity and various comorbidities are challenges for the management of the generally elderly patients. Therefore, experienced physicians and multidisciplinary teams should be involved in the establishment of the correct diagnosis, risk-assessment and personalized treatment plan. Next-generation sequencing allows for early detection of clonal hematopoiesis and monitoring of clonal evolution, but also poses new challenges for its appropriate use. At present, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment option for a minority of fit MDS patients. All others receive palliative treatment and will eventually progress, having an unmet need for novel therapies. Targeting compounds are in prospect for precision medicine, however, abrogation of clonal evolution to acute myeloid leukemia remains actually out of reach. ABSTRACT: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of clonal disorders caused by sequential accumulation of somatic driver mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). MDS is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with cytopenia, dysplasia, inflammation, and a variable risk of transformation into secondary acute myeloid leukemia. The advent of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of the disease. Nevertheless, the biology of clonal evolution remains poorly understood, and the stochastic genetic drift with sequential accumulation of genetic hits in HSPCs is individual, highly dynamic and hardly predictable. These continuously moving genetic targets pose substantial challenges for the implementation of precision medicine, which aims to maximize efficacy with minimal toxicity of treatments. In the current postgenomic era, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative option for younger and fit MDS patients. For all unfit patients, regeneration of HSPCs stays out of reach and all available therapies remain palliative, which will eventually lead to refractoriness and progression. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in our understanding of MDS pathophysiology and its impact on diagnosis, risk-assessment and disease monitoring. Moreover, we present ongoing clinical trials with targeting compounds and highlight future perspectives for precision medicine.","output":"Myelodysplastic Syndromes in the Postgenomic Era and Future Perspectives for Precision Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Passive immunotherapy with plasma derived from convalescent patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a promising approach in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Very limited data are available regarding the utilization of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in patients with severe post-cardiotomy acute respiratory distress syndrome (PC-ARDS). METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients with PC-ARDS managed with VV-ECMO from 2014-2020 at a single institution was performed. Data were collected from the institutional ELSO registry and supplemented with chart review. Survival to key time-points was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients (mean age 6015 years, 73% male) with PC-ARDS were managed with VV-ECMO during the study period. Their mean Respiratory ECMO Survival Prediction (RESP) score was -5.93.5. ECMO support was initiated in 11/22 (50%) patients within 24h of the index operation, and between 2-23 days postoperatively (median 4 days) in the remaining patients. VV-ECMO was the initial cannulation strategy in 16/22 (73%) cases. In the remaining 6/22 (27%) cases, VA-ECMO was initiated and then transitioned to VV-ECMO after median 3 days (range 0.5-13 days). Survival to decannulation and to discharge occurred in 15/22 (68%) and 8/21 (38%) patients, respectively. One patient is still admitted to the hospital and has been decannulated from VV-ECMO. After median follow-up 545 days (range 11-1306 days) among survivors to hospital discharge, 60-day and 1-year survival were 86% and 67%, respectively. Patients surviving to hospital discharge were younger than non-survivors (mean age 5015 versus 6513 years, p=0.03), but there was no difference in RESP score among these groups (survivors: -5.82.8 versus non-survivors: -6.04.8, p=0.90). CONCLUSION: Although post cardiotomy ARDS is associated with a high mortality, VV-ECMO should be considered as a potential rescue strategy, especially in younger patients.","output":"Outcomes of Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Post-Cardiotomy Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-tech start-ups are emerging rapidly all over the world, particularly in the developed world and emerging economies, since the early 2010s. So are the entrepreneurial ecosystems. Despite the growth in ecosystems, the rate of success of high-tech start-ups has hardly experienced an increase during this period. As a result, while an innumerable number of high-tech start-ups emerge, a considerably small proportion of the emerged ones is able to survive, and only a negligible proportion of the survived ones scale up. Though the number of Unicorns emerged from the start-up hubs has increased significantly in 2021, these Unicorns still account for a minute proportion of the emerged high-tech start-ups in almost every start-up hub recognized globally. This brings to the fore the critical importance of competitiveness of high-tech start-ups, and the need to explore the factors which determine the competitiveness, in the context of entrepreneurial ecosystems. It is against this backdrop that we invited scholarly articles, empirical studies, reviews and perspective papers based on the theme Competitiveness of High-tech Start-ups and Entrepreneurial Ecosystems.

In contrast, Reston ebolavirus (REBOV), the only species found outside Africa, is lethal to some NHPs but has never been linked to clinical disease in humans despite documented exposure. REBOV was isolated from pigs in the Philippines and subsequent experiments confirmed the susceptibility of pigs to both REBOV and ZEBOV with predilection for the lungs. However, only ZEBOV caused severe lung pathology in 5C6 weeks old pigs leading to respiratory distress. To further elucidate the mechanisms for lung pathology, microarray analysis of changes in gene expression was performed on lung tissue from ZEBOV-infected pigs. Furthermore, systemic effects were monitored by looking at changes in peripheral blood leukocyte subsets and systemic cytokine responses. Following oro-nasal challenge, ZEBOV replicated mainly in the respiratory tract, causing severe inflammation of the lungs and consequently rapid and difficult breathing. Neutrophils and macrophages infiltrated the lungs but only the latter were positive for ZEBOV antigen. Genes for proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins, known to attract immune cells to sites of infection, were upregulated in the lungs, causing the heavy influx of cells into this site. Systemic effects included a decline in the proportion of monocyte/dendritic and B cells and a mild proinflammatory cytokine response. Serum IgM was detected on day 5 and 6 post infection. In conclusion, a dysregulation/over-activation of the pulmonary proinflammatory response may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ZEBOV infection in 5C6 weeks old pigs by attracting inflammatory cells to the lungs.","output":"Immunopathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Disease in Zaire ebolavirus-Infected Pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a unique educational circumstance in which medical students, residents, and fellows find themselves with a gap in their surgical training.

During Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, Texas power-generating plant operators resorted to rolling blackouts to prevent wider collapse of the whole power grid when power demand overwhelmed supply. In this study, we collected community-scale big data (e.g., digital trace and crowdsourced data) in the context of the winter storm, which brought historically low temperatures, snow, and ice to the entire state of Texas. By analyzing this data, we can infer the extent of disparities in storm-related impacts on vulnerable populations. In addition to assessing disparate impacts of the managed power outage, this study also examined the extent of burst pipes and disrupted access to food. Using statistical and trend classification analyses, the results highlight the spatial and temporal patterns of impacts for subpopulations in Harris County, Texas, within which the city of Houston is located. In particular, findings show significant disparity in the extent and duration of power outages experienced by low-income and minority groups. This finding suggests that the existence of inequality in the management and implementation of the power outage. Also, the extent of burst pipes and disrupted food access were more severe for low-income and minority groups. These findings suggest implications for understanding the disparate impacts of extreme weather events on vulnerable populations; in particular, the findings could provide insights allowing infrastructure operators to enhance social equality considerations during managed service disruptions in such events.

This study describes the experiences after repurposing a PICU and its staff for adult critical care within a state mandated COVID-19 hospital and compares the outcomes to adult patients admitted to the institution's MICU during the same period. Design: A retrospective chart review was performed to analyze outcomes for the adults admitted to the PICU and MICU during the 27-day period the PICU was incorporated into the institution's adult critical care surge plan. Setting: Tertiary care state University hospital. Patients: Critically ill adult patients with proven or suspected COVID-19. Interventions: To select the most ideal adult patients for PICU admission a tiered approach that incorporated older patients with more comorbidities at each stage was implemented. Measurements and Main Results: There were 140 patients admitted to the MICU and 9 patients admitted to the PICU during this period. The mean age of the adult patients admitted to the PICU was lower (49.1 vs. 63.2 p = 0.017). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of comorbidities, intubation rates, days of ventilation, dialysis or LOS.

The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change.","output":"Global Warming and Its Health Impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Despite significant improvements in early detection and treatment, the disparities seen among cancer patients have persisted Sepsis and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) / Pulmonary Embolus (PE) remain leading causes of death among cancer patients Emergency departments (ED) serve as critical entry points into the inpatient acute care setting The novel SARS-COV2 virus has intensified the risk facing these patients The purpose of this study is to characterize the mortality and morbidity rates in cancer patients admitted through the ED of an urban academic hospital Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of cancer patients seen in the ED in 2019 Billing data was used to identify the cohort of cancer patients using the terms Neoplasm, Malignant, Malignancy or Cancer Excluded were terms like benign, family history or screening The final cohort included patients with both active cancer as well as those with a history of cancer Results: Of the 27,327 unique patients seen in the ED, 1,597 (5 8%) were cancer patients, accounting for 3,135 (6 9%) visits Of the total of 133 deaths seen in patients admitted through the ED, 29 (21 8%) were in cancer patients This represents a mortality rate of 9 3 per 1000 visits (18 2 per 1000 patients) This is in contrast to an overall mortality rate of 2 9 per 1000 visits (4 9 per 1000 patients) Among the cancer cohort, the mortality rate increased to 20% (7/35) with a sepsis diagnosis and 4 8% (2/41) with a diagnosis of DVT/PE Conclusion: Understanding the significant risk associated with cancer patients requiring inpatient admission highlights the needs for screening protocols for early detection of life-threatening conditions such as sepsis and DVT/PE upon entry into the inpatient setting, especially among populations at risk for poor outcomes","output":"Understanding Mortality and Morbidity Rates among Cancer patients from the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic made working from home (WFH) the new way of working.

Design: A worldwide, 2-day point prevalence study. Setting: The study was carried out on June 3, 2020, and July 1, 2020. A total of 212 ICUs in 38 countries participated. Clinicians in each participating ICU completed web-based online surveys. Patients: The ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main results: The implementation rate for the elements of the ABCDEF bundle, other supportive ICU care measures, and implementation-associated structures were investigated. Data were collected for 262 patients, of whom 47.3% underwent mechanical ventilation and 4.6% were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Each element was implemented for the following percentages of patients: elements A (regular pain assessment), 45%; B (both spontaneous awakening and breathing trials), 28%; C (regular sedation assessment), 52%; D (regular delirium assessment), 35%; E (early mobility and exercise), 47%; and F (family engagement and empowerment), 16%. The implementation of element E was 4% for patients on mechanical ventilation and 8% for patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Supportive care, such as protein provision throughout the ICU stay (under 1.2 g/kg for more than 50% of the patients) and introduction of ICU diary (25%), was infrequent. Implementation rates of elements A and D were higher in ICUs with specific protocols and fewer ICU beds exclusively for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Element E was implemented at a higher rate in ICUs that had more ICU beds assigned for them. Conclusions: This point prevalence study showed low implementation of the ABCDEF bundle. Specific protocols and the number of ICU beds reserved for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection might be key factors for delivering appropriate supportive care.","output":"ABCDEF Bundle and Supportive ICU Practices for Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection: An International Point Prevalence Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Intestinal schistosomiasis was not considered endemic in Lake Malawi until November 2017 when populations of Biomphalaria pfeifferi were first reported; in May 2018, emergence of intestinal schistosomiasis was confirmed. This emergence was in spite of ongoing control of urogenital schistosomiasis by preventive chemotherapy. Our current study sought to ascertain whether intestinal schistosomiasis is transitioning from emergence to outbreak, to judge if stepped-up control interventions are needed. METHODS: During late-May 2019, three cross-sectional surveys of primary school children for schistosomiasis were conducted using a combination of rapid diagnostic tests, parasitological examinations and applied morbidity-markers; 1) schistosomiasis dynamics were assessed at Samama (n = 80) and Mchoka (n = 80) schools, where Schistosoma mansoni was first reported, 2) occurrence of S. mansoni was investigated at two non-sampled schools, Mangochi Orphan Education and Training (MOET) (n = 60) and Koche (n = 60) schools, where B. pfeifferi was nearby, and 3) rapid mapping of schistosomiasis, and B. pfeifferi, conducted across a further 8 shoreline schools (n = 240). After data collection, univariate analyses and Chi-square testing were performed, followed by binary logistic regression using generalized linear models, to investigate epidemiological associations. RESULTS: In total, 520 children from 12 lakeshore primary schools were examined, mean prevalence of S. mansoni by positive urine circulating cathodic antigen (CCA)-dipsticks was 31.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.5C35.5). Upon comparisons of infection prevalence in May 2018, significant increases at Samama (relative risk [RR] = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.4C2.2) and Mchoka (RR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.7C4.3) schools were observed. Intestinal schistosomiasis was confirmed at MOET (18.3%) and Koche (35.0%) schools, and in all rapid mapping schools, ranging from 10.0 to 56.7%. Several populations of B. pfeifferi were confirmed, with two new eastern shoreline locations noted. Mean prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was 24.0% (95% CI: 20.3C27.7). CONCLUSIONS: We notify that intestinal schistosomiasis, once considered non-endemic in Lake Malawi, is now transitioning from emergence to outbreak. Once control interventions can resume after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suspensions, we recommend stepped-up preventive chemotherapy, with increased community-access to treatments, alongside renewed efforts in appropriate environmental control.","output":"An outbreak of intestinal schistosomiasis, alongside increasing urogenital schistosomiasis prevalence, in primary school children on the shoreline of Lake Malawi, Mangochi District, Malawi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ideas about morality are deeply entrenched into political opinions.

Importantly, the article shows imams, educators and Muslim scholars largely prioritise face-to-face learning as a more reliable and effective method of teaching and establishing rapport among Muslims compared to eclectic internet-based information dissemination. At the same time, religious actors are not averse to Muslims using digital platforms so long as they possess the skills to cross-examine online content and verify the credentials of religious actors.

DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional study. STUDY SAMPLE: Individuals with permanent hearing loss (n = 278) answered a questionnaire designed to identify potential obstacles caused by using hearing aids during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the reasons and deleterious effects associated with the devices. Each category reflected challenges in communicating, learning, and working during the pandemic. Different response categories were compared using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: The duration of daily device usage before the imposed lockdown was significantly higher than that during (Z = -2.01, p < 0.05), potentially attributable to the pandemic-induced difficulties faced by hearing-technology users. Such challenges include the shortage of batteries for hearing devices, limited access to repair or programming services of said devices and accessories, termination of speech therapy sessions, and obstacles to employment and education.

This article divides all non-pharmaceutical interventions into three types according to their different roles. The results show that type-A and type-B non-pharmaceutical interventions both can delay the timing of large-scale infections of the susceptible population, timing of the number of exposed individuals to peak, and timing of peaking of the number of infected cases, as well as decrease the peak number of exposed cases. Moreover, type-B non-pharmaceutical interventions have more significant effects on susceptible and exposed populations. Type-C non-pharmaceutical interventions for improving the recovery rate of patients are able to effectively reduce the peak number of patients, greatly decrease the slope of the curve for the number of infected cases, substantially improve the recovery rate, and lower the mortality rate; however, these non-pharmaceutical interventions do not greatly delay the timing of the number of infected cases to peak.

Method This study was part of a large school simulation exercise conducted in Toronto, Ontario. Kindergarten to grade 12 teachers taught in classrooms with either masked students, or students who were un-masked or only masked when physical distancing was not possible. A qualitative descriptive phenomenology approach was utilized, and data were collected via virtual focus groups. Qualitative data analysis involved multiple rounds of inductive coding to generate themes. Results The sample included 14 teachers (92.9% female; 85.7% White), with a median of 9.5 years teaching experience. Three primary themes emerged: 1) learning to navigate public health measures, 2) needing to adapt teaching strategies and 3) striving to manage conflicting priorities. The majority of teachers reported that mask-wearing and physical distancing impacted their classroom teaching, communication and connection with students. Conclusions As schools transition to in-person instruction, teachers will be required to play dual roles in education and public health, with implications on safety, teaching and professional identity.

Therefore, early evaluation and monitoring of both liver and kidney functions, as well as hematologic parameters, are pivotal to forecast the progression of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between several complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute liver injury (ALI), and coagulopathy, with poor outcomes in COVID-19. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis SETTING: Observational studies reporting AKI, ALI, and coagulopathy along with the outcomes of clinically validated death, severe COVID-19, or intensive care unit (ICU) care were included in this study. The exclusion criteria were abstract-only publications, review articles, commentaries, letters, case reports, non-English language articles, and studies that did not report key exposures or outcomes of interest. PATIENTS: Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Data extracted included author, year, study design, age, sex, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, respiratory comorbidities, chronic kidney disease, mortality, severe COVID-19, and need for ICU care. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC, and the Cochrane Central Database. AKI and ALI follow the definition of the included studies. Coagulopathy refers to the coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation defined in the included studies. The outcome of interest was a composite of mortality, need for ICU care, and severe COVID-19. We used random-effects models regardless of heterogeneity to calculate risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables. Heterogeneity was assessed using I(2). Random effects meta-regression was conducted for comorbidities and the analysis was performed for one covariate at a time. RESULTS: There were 3615 patients from 15 studies. The mean Newcastle-Ottawa scale of the included studies was 7.3  1.2. The AKI was associated with an increased the composite outcome (RR: 10.55 [7.68, 14.50], P < .001; I(2): 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that AKI was associated with increased mortality (RR: 13.38 [8.15, 21.95], P < .001; I(2): 24%), severe COVID-19 (RR: 8.12 [4.43, 14.86], P < .001; I(2): 0%), and the need for ICU care (RR: 5.90 [1.32, 26.35], P = .02; I(2): 0%). The ALI was associated with increased mortality (RR: 4.02 [1.51, 10.68], P = .005; I(2): 88%) in COVID-19. Mortality was higher in COVID-19 with coagulopathy (RR: 7.55 [3.24, 17.59], P < .001; I(2): 69%). The AKI was associated with the composite outcome and was not influenced by age (P = .182), sex (P = .104), hypertension (P = .788), cardiovascular diseases (P = .068), diabetes (P = .097), respiratory comorbidity (P = .762), and chronic kidney disease (P = .77). LIMITATIONS: There are several limitations of this study. Many of these studies did not define the extent of AKI (grade), which may affect the outcome. Acute liver injury and coagulopathy were not defined in most of the studies. The definition of severe COVID-19 differed across studies.

The effect of this model on the mental health of patients with chronic diseases has been unanimously recognized by researchers. In this study, a dual-track interactive nursing model intervention was conducted on the anxiety and depression in elderly patients with coronary heart disease to verify the psychological effect of the model. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From June 2018 to June 2019, 136 elderly patients with coronary heart disease (mean age of 63.58.26 years) from three communities in Changsha, Hunan Province, China were selected as subjects. A total of 53 and 50 patients were identified in the intervention and the control groups, respectively. The control group underwent routine longitudinal referral, whereas the intervention group was subjected to a two-track interactive nursing model intervention. The Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and related questionnaires were used to monitor and compare the two groups before and after the intervention and employed for scoring and comparative analysis. RESULTS: After the intervention, the mental health scores of the intervention group in total score, somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, and paranoia are significantly lower than those of the control group (P<0.05). The intervention group has scored significantly higher in coping style but significantly lower in negative coping than the control group (P<0.05).

METHODS A retrospective multicenter non-randomised consecutive case series study was designed to collect information on all cases of RRD and PVD-VH requiring surgery presenting to the vitreoretinal departments of Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, East Lancashire NHS Foundation Trust and the Lancashire NHS Foundation Trust from 11th February to 4th May 2020. RESULTS A total of 137 eyes of 137 patients were identified between the three centres of which 132 eyes were operated for RRD. Of these, 86 (64.7%) were operated pre-LD compared with 46 eyes (34.8%) during LD. Forty-five out of 86 eyes (52.3%) were macula-off pre-LD compared with 31 out of 46 eyes (67.3%) during LD (p = 0.06). There was lower proportion of non-PVD related RRD during LD (11 pre-LD to 1 during LD, p = 0.05). PVR was present in four cases during LD compared to 2 before (p = 0.19).

METHODS: Aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific IgG (S-IgG) antibody titers in 478 residents and 649 health care workers of a large Italian long-term care facility two months after complete vaccination with BNT162b2. Associations among resident-related factors and predictors of humoral response were investigated. RESULTS: By stratifying levels of humoral responses, we found that 62.1%, 21.6%, 12.1% and 4.2% of residents had high (>1,000 BAU/ml), medium (101-1,000), low (1-100) and null (<1 BAU/mL) S-IgG titers, respectively. Residents with documented previous COVID-19 and those with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG (N-IgG) positive serology showed higher level of serological response, while significant associations were observed for cancer with suboptimal response (p = 0.005) and the administration of corticosteroid for suboptimal response (p = 0.028) and a null one (p = 0.039). According to multivariate logistic regression, predictors of an increased risk of null response were advanced age (Odd ratio, OR: 2.630; Confidence interval, CI: 1.13-6.14; p = 0.025), corticosteroid therapy (OR: 4.964; CI: 1.06-23.52; p = 0.042) and diabetes mellitus (OR:3.415; CI:1.08-10.8; p = 0.037). In contrast, previous diagnosis of COVID-19 was strongly associated with a reduced risk of null response to vaccination (OR:0.126; CI:0.02-0.23; p < 0.001).

Here, we show that increased autophagy in Bassoon knockout neurons depends on poly-ubiquitination and that the loss of Bassoon leads to elevated levels of ubiquitinated synaptic proteins per se. Our data show that Bassoon knockout neurons have a smaller SV pool size and a higher turnover rate as indicated by a younger pool of SV2. The E3 ligase Parkin is required for increased autophagy in Bassoon-deficient neurons as the knockdown of Parkin normalized autophagy and SV protein levels and rescued impaired SV recycling.

Here we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explore the activity of the main inhibitory intracortical circuits within the primary motor cortex (M1) in a sample of patients complaining of fatigue and presenting executive dysfunction after resolution of COVID-19 with neurological manifestations. METHODS: Twelve patients who recovered from typical COVID-19 pneumonia with neurological complications and complained of profound physical and mental fatigue underwent, 9 to 13 weeks from disease onset, a psychometric evaluation including a self-reported fatigue numeric-rating scale (FRS, Fatigue Rating Scale) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Intracortical activity was evaluated by means of well-established TMS protocols including short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), reflecting GABAA-mediated inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), a marker of GABAB receptor activity, and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) that indexes central cholinergic transmission. TMS data were compared to those obtained in a control group of ten healthy subjects (HS) matched by age, sex and education level. RESULTS: Post-COVID-19 patients reported marked fatigue according to FRS score (8.1  1.7) and presented pathological scores at the FAB based on Italian normative data (12.2  0.7).

Patients were classified into two groups; one that underwent treatment in the 16 weeks before the implementation of lockdown in Argentina (Group 1) and another that underwent treatment in the 16 weeks after (Group 2). Demographic, clinical and surgical variables were evaluated. Results Overall, 91 patients underwent surgery, 61 and 30 patients in each group, showing a 51% drop in the incidence. The second group delayed seeking medical care longer (mean 46 h vs. 27 h, P < 0.05), had a higher rate of perforated appendicitis (30% vs. 11%, P < 0.05) and a higher rate of complicated appendicitis (56.6% vs. 18%, P < 0.01).

Since PBPK models seek to capture complex physiology, parameter uncertainty and variability is a prevailing challenge: there are often more compartments (e.g., organs, each with drug flux and retention mechanisms, and associated model parameters) than can be simultaneously measured. To improve the fidelity of PBPK modeling, one approach is to search and optimize within the high-dimensional model parameter space, based on experimental time-series measurements of drug distributions. Here, we employ Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) on a PBPK model of PEG-liposomes (PL) that tracks biodistribution in an 8-compartment mouse circulatory system, in the presence (APA+) or absence (na?ve) of anti-PEG antibodies (APA). Near-continuous experimental measurements of PL concentration during the first hour post-injection from the liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, lung, and blood plasma, based on PET/CT imaging in live mice, are used as truth sets with LHS to infer optimal parameter ranges for the full PBPK model. The data and model quantify that PL retention in the liver is the primary differentiator of biodistribution patterns in na?ve versus APA+ mice, and spleen the secondary differentiator. Retention of PEGylated nanomedicines is substantially amplified in APA+ mice, likely due to PL-bound APA engaging specific receptors in the liver and spleen that bind antibody Fc domains. Our work illustrates how applying LHS to PBPK models can further mechanistic understanding of the biodistribution and antibody-mediated clearance of specific drugs.

At our institution, actively infected patients with COVID-19 and a spike antibody <80 U/mL are considered for convalescent plasma administration. After multidisciplinary discussion with the patient and given the limited evidence available at the time, the patient opted not to receive this unless she became symptomatic from reactivation of a COVID infection.Post-transplantation, she remained asymptomatic without clinical suspicion for reactivation. Regular endomyocardial biopsies have been performed per our institution protocol with SARS coronavirus-2 PCR testing prior to presentation and have remained undetected. Biopsies have not shown evidence of allograft rejection to date. She will be eligible to receive the COVID vaccination three months post-transplant. After receiving the second dose, antibody levels will be checked to determine if she mounted an appropriate antibody response. Conclusion We have demonstrated successful heart transplantation without reactivation of COVID-19 with immunosuppression. Patient and donor selection will remain crucial to determine optimal management strategies of recipients who have recovered from COVID-19. Given the lack of data on the management of transplant patients within the COVID era, particularly in the peri-operative setting, findings from individual experiences and case reports will be useful until more guidance is established.","output":"Successful Heart Transplantation Following COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]it asks what was the context for establishing a national adult learning association, the Australian Association of Adult Education (AAAE) in 1960, renamed the Australian Association for Adult and Community Education (AACE) in 1989, and then Adult Learning Australia (ALA) in 1998?

We base our study on a sample of 295 prefecture (and above) cities in 31 provinces in China. A distribution dynamics approach is employed to reveal the trend and movement of disposable income per capita in each city before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the period when the COVID-19 was under the control. The findings reveal significant negative economic consequences of the COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 and show that most cities will converge to a level of disposable income which is much less than the Pre-COVID level if the COVID pandemic persists. Regional income inequality has intensified in the cities that have a longer duration of stringent social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and disappeared in the cities with policies of short duration. Disposable income per capita for urban residents recovered quickly when the transmission of coronavirus was effectively contained; and yet the impact of the pandemic on rural residents remains unresolved, if not intensified. This study demonstrates a significant divergence of the trend of disposable income across cities with different durations of social distancing policies and between urban and rural residents. It also highlights the importance of stringent social distancing policies in containing the spread of virus in a short time and calls for special policy attention for rural regions in the recovery from the COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and Regional Income Inequality in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper will focus on the impact that the COVID-19 emergency and the policies and decisions taken to deal with it (mostly lockdown and social distancing) have had on interpersonal relationships In particular, it will explore the changes and relational scenarios which have emerged within the patterns of daily family life in the context of a temporary social deprivation caused by the pandemic To explore this topic, the following contribution will draw on the most recent scientific literature on the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects moving within the theoretical framework of the sociology of emotions The paper will also discuss how the exploration of emotional life, given its relational nature, can offer interesting sociological reflections on the consequences of COVID-19 on individuals' perceptions of others and, in doing so, can also suggest new research paths to follow","output":"Families, Relational Scenarios and Emotions in the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new approach was developed to achieve the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)-PD-116740, an angucyclinone from the actinomycete isolate (WP 4669).

Due to the timeline of the study, started in Feb2020, the collected data offer an insight of patients' perception and attitude during the 1 st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as opposed to other DCE results available in CLL (1-2). Methods: This cross-sectional multi-center observational study enrolled patients (pts) with CLL, WATCH&WAIT (W&W) or already TREATED (around 50% each, controlled at site level), who signed the informed consent for study participation. Exclusion criteria were inability to take oral drugs, cognitive disorders that could impair questionnaire's comprehension and concomitant therapy for other malignancies. Pts were asked to fill in 3 QoL questionnaires: EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ CLL-16, described elsewhere. DCE Questionnaire was composed of 9/10 blocks (for W&W/TREATED, respectively) each composed of 8 comparisons between 2 profiles with the following attributes: Treatment and relevant duration, PFS, Possibility of infections, Possible occurrence of organ damage, Possible occurrence of diarrhea, with levels specified in Fig1. Each patient (pt) was centrally assigned to 1 block of 8 comparisons. Each pt could ask questionnaire explanations to the medical staff but self-completed it on an App specifically developed for the study. Results: 401 pts were enrolled in Italy across 16 centers (Feb-Jul 2020),199 W&W and 198 TREATED pts completed the DCE questionnaire and were included in the evaluable population. Main pts' characteristics are shown in Table 1. 73.7% of TREATED pts were ON-treatment (30.8% in 1st-line, 69.2% in further lines) and 26.3% were OFF-treatment. DCE results showed that W&W pts rated as most important the Possibility of infections (relative importance, RI=36.2%), followed by Treatment and Relevant duration (RI=28.0%), PFS (RI=16.9%), while Possible occurrence of organ damage (RI=12.5%) and Possible occurrence of Diarrhea (RI=6.4%) had lower impact on the preference (Fig 1A). DCE in TREATED pts showed that they gave more importance to Treatment and relevant duration (RI =33.3%) followed by Possibility of infections (RI =28.8%). The RI of the other attributes was lower: Possible occurrence of organ damage (RI =19.4%), PFS (RI =9.8%), Possible occurrence of diarrhea (RI =8.7%, Fig 1B). A sub-analysis stratifying pts from Northern regions (more impacted during the 1 st wave of the pandemic) and Center-Southern regions showed that in W&W pts from North Regions the attribute with a higher impact is Treatment and Relevant duration (RI=40.3%) followed by Possibility of infection (RI=27.2%), while in W&W pts from Central-Southern area, the attribute with a higher impact is Possibility of infection (RI=43.4%) followed by Possible occurrence of Organ damage (RI=21.6%). In TREATED pts no difference between the 2 groups has been shown and the results are consistent with the total population. Conclusions: CHOICE study was planned to understand CLL patients' preferences towards different treatment attributes, but the results have been impacted by the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to previously published DCEs (1-2), where PFS was the most important attribute, in the CHOICE study pts put much more emphasis on their concerns about possible infections: this could be due to the influence of the 1 st Covid-19 pandemic wave, with the relevant feeling of uncertainty, also due to the great attention that media has dedicated to the issue of infection in general, especially for vulnerable individuals such as CLL pts. The limitation in hospital access during the 1 st wave and the overall need of personal protection (masks usage) and social distancing might have influenced patients' responses too. The infodemic and the uncertainty had probably such a strong effect on patient's feelings, that PFS was no longer the most important attribute being substituted by the fear of hospitals access and infections. We thereby suggest that the pandemic had a great impact not only on the conduct of the study but also on patients' perception of their disease, if not properly reassured.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ReIMAGINE Prostate Cancer Screening Study is a prospective single-centre feasibility study. Eligible men aged 50C75 years with no prior prostate cancer diagnosis or treatment will be identified through general practitioner practices and randomly selected for invitation. Those invited will be offered an MRI scan and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The screening MRI scan consists of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and research-specific sequences, without the use of intravenous contrast agents. Men who screen positive on either MRI or PSA density will be recommended to have standard of care (National Health Service) tests for prostate cancer assessment, which includes multiparametric MRI. The study will assess the acceptability of an MRI-based prostate screening assessment and the prevalence of cancer detected in MRI-screened men. Summary statistics will be used to explore baseline characteristics in relation to acceptance rates and prevalence of cancer. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: ReIMAGINE Prostate Cancer Screening is a single-site screening study to assess the feasibility of MRI as a screening tool for prostate cancer. Ethical approval was granted by LondonCStanmore Research Ethics Committee Heath Research Authority (reference 19/LO/1129).

Here, we investigated the abundance and activation of T cells in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with T2D. We then verified the human data in a murine model and tested if the activation of T cells can be rescued by treating mice with abatacept, an immunomodulatory drug employed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical evidence indicated abatacept can slow the decline in beta-cell function. Methods: A cohort of 24 patients (12 with T2D) undergoing hip replacement surgery was enrolled in the study. Flow cytometry and cytokine analyses were performed on BM leftovers from surgery. We next compared the immune profile of db/db and control wt/db mice. In an additional study, db/db mice were randomized to receive abatacept or vehicle for 4 weeks, with endpoints being immune cell profile, indices of insulin sensitivity, and heart performance. Results: Patients with T2D showed increased frequencies of BM CD4(+) (2.8-fold, p = 0.001) and CD8(+) T cells (1.8-fold, p = 0.01), with the upregulation of the activation marker CD69 and the homing receptor CCR7 in CD4(+) (1.64-fold, p = 0.003 and 2.27-fold, p = 0.01, respectively) and CD8(+) fractions (1.79-fold, p = 0.05 and 1.69-fold, p = 0.02, respectively). These differences were confirmed in a multivariable regression model. CCL19 (CCR7 receptor ligand) and CXCL10/11 (CXCR3 receptor ligands), implicated in T-cell migration and activation, were the most differentially modulated chemokines. Studies in mice confirmed the activation of adaptive immunity in T2D. Abatacept reduced the activation of T cells and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and improved cardiac function but not insulin sensitivity. Conclusions: Results provide proof-of-concept evidence for the activation of BM adaptive immunity in T2D. In mice, treatment with abatacept dampens the activation of adaptive immunity and protects from cardiac damage.","output":"Activation of Bone Marrow Adaptive Immunity in Type 2 Diabetes: Rescue by Co-stimulation Modulator Abatacept"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exposure to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during childhood is nearly ubiquitous by age two, and infants who develop severe RSV bronchiolitis are more likely to develop asthma later in life. In the Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma (FIPA) study including 319 children from a Northern Plains American Indian community, we found 73% of children to have high concentrations of RSV-specific IgG (>40 IU/mL). High concentration of RSV-specific IgG was associated with increased exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke (p=7.5x10-4), larger household size (p=4.0x10-3), and lower levels of total serum IgE (p=5.1x10-3). Parents of children with asthma more often reported an RSV diagnosis and/or hospitalization due to RSV, and children with asthma had lower concentrations of RSV IgG as compared to those without asthma among RSV-exposed individuals (mean 117 IU/mL vs. 154, p=7.1x10-4). However, lower RSV IgG was surprisingly exclusive to children with asthma recruited during the winter months when RSV is thought to circulate more broadly. Multivariate regression indicated the strongest predictors of RSV-specific IgG concentration included asthma status (p=0.040), per cent eosinophils (p=0.035), and an asthma x RSV season interaction (p=3.7x10-3). Among candidate genes, we identified a genetic association between an intronic variant in IFNL4 and RSV-specific IgG concentration whereby the minor allele (A) was associated with higher concentration (rs12979860, p=4.3x10-3). Overall our findings suggest there are seasonal differences in immunological response to RSV infection in asthma cases vs. controls, and identify both environmental and genetic contributions that warrant further investigation.","output":"Respiratory syncytial virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations associate with environmental and genetic factors: the Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monitoring acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic diversity and emerging mutations in this ongoing pandemic is crucial for understanding its evolution and assuring the performance of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapies against coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The purpose of this report was to present a case of ethanol-induced hand sanitizer intoxication after spine surgery in a patient with a postoperative delirious state. Presentation of case: A 63-year-old man was admitted to the spine department with intractable back pain as the main symptom and diagnosed with infectious spondylitis with discitis. The patient suddenly showed mental changes, resulting in a semi-comatose mental state the first day after surgery, without seizure-like activity and asphyxia. We subsequently discovered the patient had consumed half of an ethanol hand sanitizer bottle (about 300-400 ml) which was placed at the foot of the bed to prevent infection transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient did not tend to depend on alcohol or psychiatric medication in the past, and had no addiction. After seven months, the patient had complete bone union and independent ambulation. Discussion: Acute ethanol intoxication can result in life-threatening clinical effects. One of the major problems after orthopedic surgery is delirium, with the largest number appearing after spine surgery. Conclusion: Hand sanitizer, mainly composed of ethanol, did not cause abnormal findings or interfere with the course of treatment of infectious spondylitis. However, it is expected that such accidents will increase, due to the increase in the use of hand sanitizers caused by COVID-19. It is, therefore, necessary to avoid potential patient abuse, especially after spinal surgery in patients at risk of delirium.","output":"Intoxication by hand sanitizer due to delirium after infectious spondylitis surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Infrastructure must become more resilient as the global climate changes and also more affordable in the economic and political context of a post-COVID world.

The richest dietary sources of resveratrol are berries and grapes, their juices and wines. Good bioavailability of resveratrol is not reflected in its high biological activity in vivo because of resveratrol isomerization and its poor solubility in aqueous solutions. Proteins, cyclodextrins and nanomaterials have been explored as innovative delivery vehicles for resveratrol to overcome this limitation. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated beneficial effects of resveratrol in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Main beneficial effects of resveratrol intake are cardioprotective, anti-hypertensive, vasodilatory, anti-diabetic, and improvement of lipid status. As resveratrol can alleviate the numerous factors associated with CVD, it has potential as a functional supplement to reduce COVID-19 illness severity in patients displaying poor prognosis due to cardio-vascular complications. Resveratrol was shown to mitigate the major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 including regulation of the renin-angiotensin system and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, stimulation of immune system and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, several studies already have anticipated potential implementation of resveratrol in COVID-19 treatment.

However, the three loneliness dimensions differed in their prevalence during the contact restrictions and their associations with age and personality. Physical loneliness was higher during the contact restrictions whereas emotional and social loneliness remained on a normal level.

In adjusted models, odds of vaccination were lower in men (odds ratio [OR] 0.89 [0.85-0.94]) than women, and in people of Black (0.41 [0.34-0.49]) compared to white ethnicity. There was higher vaccine coverage in the least deprived and highest income households. People who reported a history of COVID-19 were less likely to be vaccinated (OR 0.61 [0.55-0.67]). There was high coverage among health workers (OR 9.84 [8.79-11.02] and care workers (OR 4.17 [3.20-5.43]) compared to non-key workers, but lower in hospitality and retail workers (OR 0.73 [0.64-0.82] and 0.77 [0.70-0.85] respectively) after adjusting for age and key covariates.

Following a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech positivity ranged from 100.0% (91.1-100.0) in those aged 18-29 to 32.2% (18.2-51.1) in those aged 70-79 years. For AstraZeneca this was 72.2% (68.5-75.9) in the youngest and 46.2% (40.0-52.7) in the oldest age group. DiscussionThe successful roll out of the vaccination programme in England has led to a high proportion of individuals having detectable antibodies, particularly in older age groups and those who have had two doses of vaccine. This is likely to be associated with high levels of protection from severe disease, and possibly from infection. Nonetheless, there remain some key groups with a lower prevalence of antibody, notably unvaccinated younger people, certain minority ethnic groups, those living in deprived areas and workers in some public facing employment. Obtaining improved rates of vaccination in these groups is essential to achieving high levels of protection against the virus through population immunity.

Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, new effective antiviral drugs are still needed. Some repurposed drugs including Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir were immediately used to treat COVID-19 after the pandemic. However, the therapeutic effects of these drugs have not been fully demonstrated in clinical studies. In this paper, we found an antimalarial drug, Naphthoquine, showed good broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity. Naphthoquineinhibited HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, with IC(50) = 2.05  1.44 M, 5.83  0.74 M, and 2.01  0.38 M, respectively. Time-of-addition assay was also performed to explore at which stage Naphthoquine functions during SARS-CoV-2 replication. The results suggested that Naphthoquine may influence virus entry and post-entry replication.

Therefore, emergency medical supplies enterprises have faced challenges in decision making and need to consider more corporate social responsibility (CSR) in production. At the same time, the government needs to take considerable measures to support emergency medical supplies enterprises. As such, our paper researches the decision and coordination problems for emergency medical supply chain considering CSR with the government, manufacturer, and retailer. The manufacturer produces emergency medical supplies. It has additional production technological innovation efforts to improve supply efficiency and assume CSR. The retailer faces uncertain demands and is responsible for undertaking CSR to meet the demands. The government must implement a certain degree of subsidies to ease the impact of the pandemic on emergency medical supply chain enterprises. Meanwhile, our paper further explores the obligations of the economy, society, and efficiency of enterprises under the COVID-19 pandemic and the decision making of enterprises for the implementation of CSR. Based on the principle of maximizing social welfare, we discuss decentralized decision making (without government and with government) and centralized decision making, respectively. On this basis, our paper not only designs a wholesale priceCcost sharing joint contract coordination mechanism but also proves that a joint contract can achieve supply chain coordination under certain conditions. Through the analysis, we observe: (1) Government subsidies can improve the enthusiasm of supply chain members to undertake CSR;(2) With the improvement of the retailers CSR level, the profits of supply chain members and overall performance have improved to a certain degree;(3) To improve supply efficiency and assume social responsibility, the manufacturer implements technological innovation investment.

Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a promising cytokine that is critical in protecting the lung during infection. This cytokine is strongly regulated by the soluble receptor IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP), which is constitutively expressed in the lungs where it inhibits IL-22 activity. The IL-22/IL-22BP axis is thought to prevent chronic exposure of epithelial cells to IL-22. However, the importance of this axis is not understood during an infection such as influenza. Here we demonstrate through the use of IL-22BP-knockout mice (il-22ra2(?/?)) that a pro-IL-22 environment reduces pulmonary inflammation during H1N1 (PR8/34 H1N1) infection and protects the lung by promoting tight junction formation. We confirmed these results in normal human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro demonstrating improved membrane resistance and induction of the tight junction proteins Cldn4, Tjp1, and Tjp2.

Although it is branded as a safer alternative to cigarette smoking, murine and rat models of sub-acute and chronic e-cigarette vaping exposure have shown many pro-inflammatory changes in the respiratory tract. An acute vaping exposure paradigm has not been demonstrated in the golden Syrian hamster, and the hamster is a readily available small animal model that has the unique benefit of becoming infected with and transmitting SARS-CoV-2 without genetic alteration to the animal or virus. Methods Using a two-day, whole-body vaping exposure protocol in male golden Syrian hamsters, we evaluated serum cotinine, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, lung and nasal histopathology, and gene expression in the nasopharynx and lung through RT-qPCR. Depending on the presence of nonnormality or outliers, statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests. For tests that were statistically significant (p-value <0.05), post-hoc Tukey-Kramer and Dunns tests, respectively, were performed to make pairwise comparisons between groups. Results In nasal tissue, RT-qPCR analysis revealed nicotine-dependent increases in genes associated with type 1 inflammation (CCL-5 and CXCL-10), fibrosis (TGF-), and a nicotine-independent decrease in the vasculogenesis/angiogenesis gene VEGF-A. In the lung, nicotine-dependent increases in the expression of genes involved in the renin-angiotensin pathway (ACE, ACE2), coagulation (tissue factor, Serpine-1), extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP-2, MMP-9), type 1 inflammation (IL-1, TNF-, and CXCL-10), fibrosis (TGF- and Serpine-1), oxidative stress response (SOD-2), neutrophil extracellular traps release (ELANE), and vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (VEGF-A) were identified. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the Syrian hamster is a viable model of e-cig induced inhalational injury. In addition, this is the first report that e-cig vaping with nicotine can increase tissue factor gene expression in the lung.

Pandemic-related restrictions regarding in-person teaching activities at our medical college required adoption of an online, live, virtual format for all activities in our preclinical Pathology-Pathophysiology (PP) courses. Adaptation of teaching approaches using available technology allowed for uninterrupted learning and may serve to contribute to future innovations in medical education. METHODS/CASE REPORT: Using Zoom as a platform, all lectures and interactive group exercises were converted to a live virtual format. Live Zoom lectures were also recorded and, subsequently, made available to students, in order to provide additional opportunities for engaged learning. Interactive, case-based and self-directed exercises, and gross specimen reviews were also held using the live virtual format. Fourth year students enrolled in our education concentration helped provide intermittent virtual peer reviews for the 2(nd) year students. All exams were administered via an electronically monitored virtual format. RESULTS (IF A CASE STUDY ENTER NA): Overall, performance of the 2020-2021 class on in-house, multiple choice question (MCQ) exams in our PP courses was typically at or above the performance of prior classes, while class performance on a standardized national subject exam (NBME) in Pathology was above the national average, which was consistent with prior class performances, and significantly higher (p = 0.01) on average in 2021 than in 2019 (2.28 points) and 2020 (2.27 points).

However, internationally, there are many examples of smart city developments that have attracted criticism, concerns, and community backlash over issues such as data ethics, privacy, mass surveillance, commodification, and social control. In response, this chapter presents DataCarea model for cities to practically implement technological sovereignty as a way to renew and maintain the social licence to operate smart city technology. Grounded in a critical review of the literature, the chapter argues that data collection and automation in smart cities must be more citizen and community-oriented. Informed by smart city developments in Toronto and Barcelona, the chapter introduces DataCarea model for a dedicated facility hosted by the city and offered to citizens, communities, and businesses. The envisaged DataCare space can be tailored to raise awareness of data ethics, to run data literacy training seminars, to engage in participatory data analytics, and to speculate about city data futures.

However, the pathogenic mechanism is still not fully understood. In the present study, we identified 1,631 upregulated and 1,515 downregulated genes and found that cell cycle and metabolism-related pathways or biological processes highly dysregulated in HCC. To assess the biological importance of these DEGs, we carried out weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the functional modules potentially involved in HCC pathogenesis or progression. The five modules were detected with Dynamic Tree Cut algorithm, and GO enrichment analysis revealed that these modules exhibited different biological processes or signaling pathways, such as metabolism-related pathways, cell proliferation-related pathways, and molecules in tumor microenvironment. Moreover, we also observed two immune cells, namely, cytotoxic cells and macrophage enriched in modules grey and brown, respectively, while T helper cell-2 (Th2) was enriched in module turquoise. Among the WGCNA network, four hub long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified to be associated with HCC prognostic outcomes, suggesting that coexpression network analysis could uncover lncRNAs with functional importance, which may be associated with prognostic outcomes of HCC patients. In summary, this study demonstrated that network-based analysis could identify some functional modules and some hub-lncRNAs, which may be critical for HCC pathogenesis or progression.","output":"Network-Based Coexpression Analysis Identifies Functional and Prognostic Long Noncoding RNAs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health care delivery system in the United States, structured to provide single-disease care, presents unique challenges for patients with complex physical and psychiatric comorbidities. Patients in these populations are often referred to multiple specialty clinics, encounter little continuity of care or collaboration among their providers, incur high health care costs, and experience poor treatment outcomes. Given these barriers, questions remain about the extent to which siloed and fragmented care, as opposed to the complex nature of the illnesses themselves, contribute to poor outcomes. If given the opportunity to receive well-integrated, consistent, and personalized care, can patients with historically difficult-to-treat comorbid medical and mental illnesses make progress? This article describes an innovative model of care called functional rehabilitation that is designed to address existing barriers in treatment. The functional rehabilitation program seeks to disrupt the escalating effects of interacting comorbidities by offering highly collaborative treatment from a small team of clinicians, personalized interventions using a shared decision-making framework, multipronged treatment options, colocation in a large hospital system, and significant 1:1 time with patients. The article includes a case example with longitudinal outcome data that illustrates how progress can be made with appropriate programmatic supports. Future research should examine the cost-effectiveness of this model of care.","output":"Functional Rehabilitation: An Integrated Treatment Model for Patients With Complex Physical and Psychiatric Conditions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regulation of apoptosis during infection has been observed for several viral pathogens. Programmed cell death and regulation of apoptosis in response to a viral infection are important factors for host or virus survival. It is not known whether Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection regulates the apoptosis process in vitro. This study for the first time suggests that CCHFV induces apoptosis, which may be dependent on caspase-3 activation. This study also shows that the coding sequence of the S segment of CCHFV contains a proteolytic cleavage site, DEVD, which is conserved in all CCHFV strains. By using different recombinant expression systems and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that this motif is subject to caspase cleavage. We also demonstrate that CCHFV nucleocapsid protein (NP) is cleaved into a 30-kDa fragment at the same time as caspase activity is induced during infection. Using caspase inhibitors and cells lacking caspase-3, we clearly demonstrate that the cleavage of NP is caspase-3-dependent. We also show that the inhibition of apoptosis induced progeny viral titers of 80-90%. Thus, caspase-3-dependent cleavage of NP may represent a host defense mechanism against lytic CCHFV infection. Taken together, these data suggest that the most abundant protein of CCHFV, which has several essential functions such as protection of viral RNA and participation in various processes in the replication cycle, can be subjected to cleavage by host cell caspases.","output":"Induction of caspase activation and cleavage of the viral nucleocapsid protein in different cell types during Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One major concern in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic has been to ensure the protection of certain categories of population considered to be at especially high risk in the event of an infection.

Late referral to higher levels of care may be one of the factors associated with higher mortality. Therefore, we aimed to find simple demographic and laboratory parameters which predict the requirement of admission to a critical care unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A caseCcontrol study was undertaken in adult age population >18 years, admitted in a dedicated COVID hospital in South India. A total of 50 patients with severe disease (cases) were compared with 143 mild or asymptomatic cases (controls). Those demographic and laboratory parameters that were found to be significant on univariate analysis were used for multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Univariate analysis of demographic and laboratory data showed higher age, male sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, higher values of C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, neutrophilClymphocyte ratio (NLR), and lactate dehydrogenase to be significantly associated with cases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of these significant variables showed NLR and ferritin to be the independent predictors of the requirement of admission to a critical care unit. The receiver-operating characteristic curve showed an NLR value of 5.2 and a ferritin value of 462 g/L that were able to predict the requirement of admission in critical care units. CONCLUSION: High ferritin and NLR were independent predictors of the requirement of admission in critical care units. NLR is a simple tool that can be used in resource-limited settings for triage and early referral to higher levels of care.

Incorporating this methodology into the decision-making routine of clinical practice will improve the patients health care, increase patient safety, and optimize resources use. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a new tool (KNOWBED system) as a clinical decision support system to support scientific knowledge, enabling health care professionals to quickly carry out decision-making processes based on EBM during their routine clinical practice. METHODS: Two components integrate the KNOWBED system: a web-based knowledge station and a mobile app. A use case (bronchiolitis pathology) was selected to validate the KNOWBED system in the context of the Paediatrics Unit of the Virgen Macarena University Hospital (Seville, Spain). The validation was covered in a 3-month pilot using 2 indicators: usability and efficacy. RESULTS: The KNOWBED system has been designed, developed, and validated to support clinical decision making in mobility based on standards that have been incorporated into the routine clinical practice of health care professionals. Using this tool, health care professionals can consult existing scientific knowledge at the bedside, and access recommendations of clinical protocols established based on EBM. During the pilot project, 15 health care professionals participated and accessed the system for a total of 59 times.

The transition rates were modeled from the 63,927 French patients who began dialysis or were registered on the waiting list for KT between 2011 and 2019. Findings: Among the 8,350 patients active on the waiting list at the time of the French KT moratorium decided on March 16, 2020, for 2.5-months, we predicted 4.0 additional months [CI: 2.9, 5.1] on the waiting list and 45 additional deaths [CI: -52, 142] up to March 16, 2030.

OBJECTIVES To describe the characteristics, outcomes, and potential associations of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel. METHODS We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of 58 consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Laniado Hospital, Israel, between 14 March 2020 and 14 May 2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on admission were collected and analyzed, and the association to subsequent respiratory failure was assessed. RESULTS Mean age of patients was 70.7  16.9 years (53% males, 47% females.); 74% had at least one co-morbidity. Most patients were of Jewish Ashkenazi descent. During hospitalization 15 patients (mean age 78.18  10.35 years); 80% male, 73% Sephardi descent developed respiratory failure rates of 60% occurring on average 10.6 days following intubation. Laboratory tests at admission displayed a significant increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatine kinase (CK) and a decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in patients who eventually developed respiratory failure (163.97 mg/L, 340.87 IU/L, 0.886 K/l vs. 50.01 mg/L and 123.56 IU/L, 1.28 K/l, respectively). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed an integrated parameter of CRP, CK, and ALC highly correlated with respiratory failure. Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed the area under the curve of CRP, CK, and ALC and the integrated parameter to be 0.910, 0.784, and 0.754, respectively. CRP was the strongest predictor to correlate with respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS CRP, CK, and ALC levels on admission could possibly be used to detect high-risk patients prone to develop respiratory failure.","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients Infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Israel: Correlation between Laboratory Findings on Admission to Emergency Department and Subsequent Respiratory Failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Later touted as the US's greatest ever bipartisan foreign aid success since its World War II Marshall Plan to revive Europe, Bush's announcement changed millions of lives for good in the following decades.

Here, we examined plasma versus saliva Ab responses in vaccinated and convalescent patients. Although saliva levels were significantly lower, a strong correlation was observed between plasma and saliva total Ig levels against all SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested. Virus-specific IgG1 responses predominated in both saliva and plasma, while a lower prevalence of IgM and IgA1 Abs was observed in saliva. Antiviral activities of plasma Abs were also studied. Neutralization titers against the initial WA1 (D614G), B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) strains were similar but lower against the B.1.351 (beta) strain. Spike-specific antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activities were also detected and the levels correlated with spike-binding Ig titers. Interestingly, while neutralization and ADCP potencies of vaccinated and convalescent groups were comparable, enhanced complement deposition to spike-specific Abs was noted in vaccinated versus convalescent groups and corresponded with higher levels of IgG1 plus IgG3 among the vaccinated individuals. Altogether, this study demonstrates the detection of Ab responses after vaccination or infection in plasma and saliva that correlate significantly, although Ig isotypic differences were noted.

Patients with COVID-19 were older and had a longer duration from intubation to ECMO initiation, but had similar illness severity and APACHE IV scores at the time of initiation. Overall disability, health-related quality of life, and mortality were similar, but ICU and hospital length of stay were significantly longer in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Six-month functional outcomes and mortality were similar between COVID-19 and viral pneumonitis patients treated with VV-ECMO. However, length of stay was longer in COVID-19 patients, which may have resource implications.","output":"Six-month outcomes following venovenous ECMO for severe COVID-19 and viral pneumonitis: 2019-2020 Australian experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated primarily with pneumonia, recent data show that the causative agent of COVID-19, the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can infect a large number of vital organs beyond the lungs, such as the heart, kidneys, and the brain. Thus, there is evidence showing possible retrograde transmission of the virus from the olfactory epithelium to regions of the brain stem. METHODS: This is a literature review article. The research design method is an evidence-based rapid review. The present discourse aim is first to scrutinize and assess the available literature on COVID-19 repercussion on the central nervous system (CNS). Standard literature and database searches were implemented, gathered relevant material, and extracted information was then assessed. RESULTS: The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors being the receptor for the virus, the threat to the central nervous system is expected. Neurons and glial cells express ACE2 receptors in the CNS, and recent studies suggest that activated glial cells contribute to neuroinflammation and the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS. The SARS-CoV-2-induced immune-mediated demyelinating disease, cerebrovascular damage, neurodegeneration, and depression are some of the neurological complications discussed here. CONCLUSION: This review correlates present clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients with possible neurological consequences in the future, thus preparing healthcare providers for possible future consequences of COVID-19.","output":"Does COVID-19 contribute to development of neurological disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA virus genomes contain cis-acting sequence and structural elements that participate in viral replication. We previously identified a bulged stem-loop secondary structure at the upstream end of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the genome of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). This element, beginning immediately downstream of the nucleocapsid gene stop codon, was shown to be essential for virus replication. Other investigators discovered an adjacent downstream pseudoknot in the 3' UTR of the closely related bovine coronavirus (BCoV). This pseudoknot was also shown to be essential for replication, and it has a conserved counterpart in every group 1 and group 2 coronavirus. In MHV and BCoV, the bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot are, in part, mutually exclusive, because of the overlap of the last segment of the stem-loop and stem 1 of the pseudoknot. This led us to hypothesize that they form a molecular switch, possibly regulating a transition occurring during viral RNA synthesis. We have now performed an extensive genetic analysis of the two components of this proposed switch. Our results define essential and nonessential components of these structures and establish the limits to which essential parts of each element can be destabilized prior to loss of function. Most notably, we have confirmed the interrelationship of the two putative switch elements. Additionally, we have identified a pseudoknot loop insertion mutation that appears to point to a genetic interaction between the pseudoknot and a distant region of the genome.","output":"Characterization of the RNA components of a putative molecular switch in the 3' untranslated region of the murine coronavirus genome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Guidance from the BOAST helped structure our paediatric orthopaedic service n response to COVID-19.

In each nation was calculated the proportion of Covid-19 deaths divided per new cases x 100 and the proportion of new cases per 1.000 inhabitant on 10 January 2021 (before vaccinations distribution) and 8 August 2021 (when large percentage of the population had been vaccinated in many countries). Results: The study shows that in the countries with the highest number of cases as of 8 August 2021, the proportion of vaccinations carried out in the population correlates negatively with both the proportion between Covid-19 dead people x100 infected people and with the rate of new cases. However, the proportion of vaccinations does not correlate with the differences in the two same indicators considered in the weeks observed, thus additional factors seem to play an important role.

Advances in in vitro library display screening and next-generation sequencing have enabled accelerated development of strong binders, yet identifying their binding sites still remains a major challenge. The differentiation, or binning, of binders into different groups that recognize distinct binding sites on their target is a promising approach that facilitates high-throughput screening of binders that may show different biological activity. Here we study the extent to which the information contained in the amino acid sequences comprising a set of target-specific binders can be leveraged to bin them, inferring functional equivalence of their binding regions, or paratopes, based directly on comparison of the sequences, their modeled structures, or their modeled interactions. Using a leucine-rich repeat binding scaffold known as a repebody as the source of diversity in recognition against interleukin-6 (IL-6), we show that the Epibin approach introduced here effectively utilized structural modelling and docking to extract specificity information encoded in the repebody amino acid sequences and thereby successfully recapitulate IL-6 binding competition observed in immunoassays. Furthermore, our computational binning provided a basis for designing in vitro mutagenesis experiments to pinpoint specificity-determining residues. Finally, we demonstrate that the Epibin approach can extend to antibodies, retrospectively comparing its predictions to results from antigen-specific antibody competition studies. The study thus demonstrates the utility of modeling structure and binding from the amino acid sequences of different binders against the same target, and paves the way for larger-scale binning and analysis of entire repertoires.","output":"Computational epitope binning reveals functional equivalence of sequence-divergent paratopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report presents the special characteristics of the psychotherapy process with patients who are grieving the loss of a loved one Because of the special background circumstances in which these losses have occurred-the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the 3 months lockdown because of it-I have called these griefs suspended In the article I offer the social background circumstances, the personal circumstances of the loss, and the therapeutic intervention with the special characteristics for both the therapist and the therapeutic setting Finally, I offer some specific tools for working with this type of grief All these considerations are made from the approach of Gestalt therapy as well as with the working model proposed by Dr Elisabeth Kubler-Ross This is coupled with my experience of more than 20 years in psychotherapeutic work with people who are living a grieving process (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Only the living can witness the passing of death: Mourning in times of pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The disease caused by Coronavirus (COVID- 19), is now pandemic all over the world including India There are different manifestations of the disease from asymptomatic and mild to severe form Clinical severity varies from country to country This study was conducted to document different clinical and biochemical profiles in this Tertiary Care Hospital of Kolkata Aim: The study was done to observe and to compare the clinical and biochemical profile in asymptomatic to mild and moderate to severe symptomatic patients Materials and Methods: This was an observational study conducted in Medical College, Kolkata, West Bengal, India The study was conducted from June 2019 to mid-August 2019 Total 573 Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR) positive COVID patients were included in this study All patients were examined and investigated with blood parameters Patients were divided into two groups (Group A-asymptomatic and mild symptoms and Group B moderate and severe symptoms) clinically Statistical calculators like Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and Soccalculator were used and different biochemical parameters were analysed using Chisquare, unpaired T-test to find out significance among these two groups Results: Among 573 patients, 222 were in group A and 351 were in group B Fever was the most common presenting feature (69 6%) followed by dry cough and shortness of breath Other features were malaise/fatigability, diarrhoea and anosmia Among the co-morbidities hypertension and diabetes were significantly different between the two groups Among the biochemical parameters Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), C-Reactive Protein (CPR), D-dimer, Prothrombin time, Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT), Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT) were significantly different between the two groups Conclusion: In a tertiary care hospital of Kolkata, fever is the most common presentation followed by dry cough and fatigability in COVID patients Diabetes and hypertension are the common co morbidities CRP, NLR, D-dimer, prothrombin time, SGOT and SGPT should be monitored to differentiate between mild and severe cases [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Clinical & Diagnostic Research is the property of JCDR Research & Publications Private Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Clinical and Biochemical Profile of COVID-19 Patients Admitted in a Tertiary Care Hospital of Kolkata"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In this article, we assess the resources, strategies, laboratory testing, awareness campaigns, and different treatment plans initiated by the government of Pakistan.

Methods: A prospective regional collaborative was queried to assess practice pattern variations relative to the initial COVID-19 lockdown (March 16 to May 15, 2020). The preceding 10 months were selected for comparison. The impact of the lockdown was evaluated on the basis of 1) weekly trends in biopsy and radical prostatectomy volumes, 2) comparisons between those undergoing prostate biopsy, and 3) clinicopathological characteristics within radical prostatectomy patients. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact and Pearson's chi-square tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum test to evaluate continuous covariates. Results: Overall, there was a 55% and 39% decline in biopsy and prostatectomy volumes, respectively. During the pandemic, biopsy patients were younger with fewer COVID-19 severity risk factors (17.0% vs 9.7% no risk factors, p=0.023) and prostatectomy patients had higher grade group (GG;45.6% >GG 4 vs 28%, p=0.01).

Accurate and useful indicators are needed for the effective use of resources. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also produced endogenously without exogenous exposure. Studies confirm that endogenous CO increases in conditions such as pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. This study aimed to compare patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and healthy people to reveal whether endogenous carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels differ. It was also to determine whether it could be a helpful indicator for the clinician in predicting disease severity in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study included 72 patients admitted to the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and a control group of 75 healthy people. The research data was collected retrospectively in a tertiary emergency department. The patients' demographic data, pneumonia severity index (PSI) score, CURB-65 score, 30-day mortality, hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation (MV), and COHb levels were recorded. RESULTS: While the COHb level was 0.9% (min-max, 0.1 - 4.0) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, it was 1% (min-max, 0.1 - 2.6) in the control group. No significant difference was found between the patients and the control group in terms of COHb levels (p = 0.341). Also, there was no correlation between COHb levels and PSI and CURB-65 scores. No significant difference was detected between COHb levels and patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia in terms of mortality, need for MV, or hospitalization (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that COHb levels alone could not be used to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia or predict disease severity. Besides, in COVID-19 pneumonia, the COHb level was not a useful indicator of mortality, need for MV, or hospitalization decision.

Infection of untreated A/J animals and vehicle controls with MHV3 resulted in marked and reproducible activation of peritoneal macrophages, observed in vitro as resistance to MHV3-cytopathic effects 48 hr after rechallenge with the virus, whereas exposure to dieldrin resulted in apparent loss of the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict replication of MHV3 and to protect them from cytolysis. In addition, in vitro treatment of MHV3 virus-activated macrophages with dieldrin, mitomycin C and X-irradiation, inhibited the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict MHV3 replication. This mechanism of cellular restriction of the virus by MHV3-activated macrophages from the resistant A/J strain appeared to be one of the sensitive targets for the suppressive action of dieldrin on host resistance, as (i) no major changes in macrophage cellular parameters were observed in in vitro studies of cell viability, adherence to plastic, and Superoxide anion generation; (ii) the increased cell yield in the peritoneal exudates during MHV3 virus infection was not affected by dieldrin exposure; and (iii) the attachment and uptake of [3H]MHV3 by virus-activated macophages was shown to be unchanged by dieldrin exposure.","output":"Suppression of MHV3 virus-activated macrophages by dieldrin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Given that obesity is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19, bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS) has become increasingly critical. Computed tomography (chest CT scan) may be a valuable preoperative screening method for BMS candidates during this COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : A prospective, single-center study was conducted in June 2020. Two study cohorts were evaluated: a surgical team group and a BMS patient group. Screening was performed with RT-PCR and a CT scan. The COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) assessment was used as mandatory COVID-19 screening. Patients classified as category 1 and 2 were considered safe to undergo BMS;category 3 surgery was canceled. The BMS patient group was monitored for 28 days after surgery for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, postoperative complications, adverse effects, and deaths were tracked. Results: : The study included 240 participants, comprising the surgical team group (n = 6) and the BMS patient group (n = 234). In total, 213 were female (88.8%), the median age was 40 years, and the median weight and BMI were 111.1 kg and 40.23 kg/m 2 respectively. Only CO-RADS category 1 was reported in the surgical team group, while in the BMS patient group, category 1 was reported in 231 participants (98.7%). In the BMS patient group, during the follow-up period, only two participants (0.83%) tested positive for COVID-19 (RT-PCR). No deaths were reported. Conclusion: Chest CT scans are useful for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing BMS, therefore enable healthcare and surgical teams to perform surgeries safely during this COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Chest Computed Tomography for SARS-CoV-2 Screening before Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study was conducted in order to evaluate the association between metformin use and clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Patients with T2DM with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and admitted between January 21, 2020, and January 31, 2021 in Hong Kong were identified in our cohort. Exposure was defined as metformin use within 90 days prior to admission until hospital discharge for COVID-19. Primary outcome was defined as clinical improvement of 1 point on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (CPS). Other outcomes were hospital discharge, recovery, in-hospital death, acidosis, hyperinflammatory syndrome, length of hospitalization, and changes in WHO CPS score. RESULTS: Metformin use was associated with greater odds of clinical improvement (OR = 2.74, p = 0.009), hospital discharge (OR = 2.26, p = 0.009), and recovery (OR = 2.54, p = 0.005), in addition to lower odds of hyperinflammatory syndrome (OR = 0.71, p = 0.021) and death (OR = 0.41, p = 0.010) than control. Patients on metformin treatment had a shorter hospital stay (?2.76 days, p = 0.017) than their control counterparts. The average WHO CPS scores were significantly lower in metformin users than non-users since day 15 (p < 0.001). However, metformin use was associated with higher odds of acidosis.

But there is more and more evidence that progenitors of a yet uncommitted stem cell population do not express this surrogate marker. The bone marrow and other sites of hematopoiesis consist also of fibroblast-like stromal cells, quiescent hematopoietic stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. Depending on their stage of differentiation, CD34- stem cells cannot only generate hematopoietic progenitors, but also more specified mesenchymal precursors, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, adipocyts, and others. The stromal cell compartment produces not only matrix proteins, such as collagens, fibronectin and others, but also the essential growth factors, which initiate and support the differentiation of primary quiescent, but eventually activated CD34- stem cells into CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. In vivo studies have shown that long-term hematopoietic and mesenchymal reconstitution can be achieved with CD34- stem cell lines, isolated from various sources, although the frequency of CD34- stem cells seams to be quite low among the progenitor population. Some authors deny the reconstitution ability of CD34- cells. The majority of CD34- stem cells are quiescent fibroblast-like cells, which can be identified in the bone marrow biopsy as \\"bone lining cells\\".

METHODS: We did a single-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled trial to investigate cytokine adsorption in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ECMO. Patients with COVID-19 selected for ECMO at the Freiburg University Medical Center (Freiburg, Germany) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive cytokine adsorption using the CytoSorb device or not. Randomisation was computer-generated, allocation was concealed by opaque, sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. The CytoSorb device was incorporated into the ECMO circuit before connection to the patient circuit, replaced every 24 h, and removed after 72 h. The primary endpoint was serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration 72 h after initiation of ECMO analysed by intention to treat. Secondary endpoints included 30-day survival. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04324528) and the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00021300) and is closed. FINDINGS: From March 29, 2020, to Dec 29, 2020, of 34 patients assessed for eligibility, 17 (50%) were treated with cytokine adsorption and 17 (50%) without. Median IL-6 decreased from 3570 pg/mL to 986 pg/mL in patients randomly assigned to cytokine adsorption and from 2890 pg/mL to 1120 pg/mL in the control group after 72 h. One patient in each group died before 72 h. Adjusted mean log IL-6 concentrations after 72 h were 030 higher in the cytokine adsorption group (95% CI ?070 to 130, p=054). Survival after 30 days was three (18%) of 17 with cytokine adsorption and 13 (76%) of 17 without cytokine adsorption (p=00016). INTERPRETATION: Early initiation of cytokine adsorption in patients with severe COVID-19 and venovenous ECMO did not reduce serum IL-6 and had a negative effect on survival. Cytokine adsorption should not be used during the first days of ECMO support in COVID-19.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Methods: Genome-wide screening was used to establish intraviral and viral-host interactomes. Quantitative proteomics was used to investigate the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteome signature in COVID-19. Findings: We elucidated 286 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and >350 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19-derived PBMCs. This signature in severe COVID-19 PBMCs reveals a significant upregulation of cellular proteins related to neutrophil activation and blood coagulation, as well as a downregulation of proteins mediating T cell receptor signaling. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein 10 interacts with NF-&#954;B-repressing factor (NKRF) to facilitate interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction, which potentially contributes to IL-8-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and the overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Our study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks but it also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms, representing a powerful resource in the pursuit of therapeutic interventions.

Rather clear evidence was found for regional strains of NNV. Interestingly, most of the geographic defining characteristic attributes were in codon position three, and not translated into differences for the protein capsid (i.e. they were synonymous variations), suggesting that while NNV strains were geographically isolated and had diverged in different regions for RNA sequences, selection had largely conserved the protein sequences among regions. The apparent selection constraint on the capsid protein may mitigate the risk that despite geographic subdivision, NNV strain variability will confound genetic selection for host resistance.

However, the air transport response to the pandemic condition is very diverse among different countries. The major airports in the WATN fluctuate gradually in different pandemic stages, which is further influenced by the domestic pandemic situation that restricts airport operations. Also, the restoration speed of local connectivity is faster than that of global connectivity because the recovery of international aviation is geographically dependent on different policies of travel restriction, conditional openings, and the number of COVID-19 cases.

It identifies several of the most common pathogens associated with gastroenteritis. However, it is expensive, and test results may not impact care, given that several of the pathogens in the panel are managed expectantly. We describe our experience with a diagnostic stewardship initiative to resolve the overuse of this testing method. METHODS: We performed a pre/post study of GIPs ordered for inpatients 18 years old and older from December 19, 2018, to December 18, 2020, at Mayo Clinic hospital in Rochester, Minnesota. GIP orders for inpatients were limited to the first 72 hours of hospitalization starting December 19, 2019. Orders after 72 hours were encouraged to be changed to Clostridioides difficile NAAT testing or sent to an infectious disease provider to override on a case-by-case basis. Our hospitals used BioFire? FilmArray? Gastrointestinal Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah). RESULTS: A total of 2,641 GIPs were performed during the study period. There were 1,568 GIPs (3.3/100 hospitalizations) in the pre-intervention period compared to 1,073 (2.6/100 hospitalizations) post-intervention, representing a drop of 21.2%. The most common pathogen detected was C. difficile (toxin A/B) (48.8%, n=402), followed by norovirus (17.5%, n=144). The overall test positivity rate was 27.9% (n=736). The test positivity rate decreased 1.8% from 28.6% (n=448) to 26.8% (n=288) after the restriction (p=0.33). The proportion of C. difficile among all pathogens detected increased from 48.5% to 49.7% (p=0.67). Table 1. Pre- and Post-Intervention Test Positivity Rate of Specific Pathogens in GIP [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our study showed that restricting the ordering of GIP to the first 72 hours of hospitalization and directing providers to standalone C. difficile NAAT testing resulted in a reduction of GIPs performed. There were marginal changes in the test positivity rate of GIP. A limitation of our study is that the timing of post-intervention coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which had unpredictable effects on hospital practice and patient admissions.

The impact of shelter-in-place orders on QoL was evaluated with the question ?How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting your QoL, to which participants could respond ?not at all?, ?to some extent?, or ?to a great extent?. We used ordinal logistic regressions to investigate the relationship between restricted life-space mobility and impact on QoL, adjusting our analyses for demographics, frailty, comorbidities, cognition, functionality, loneliness, depression, and anxiety. We explored whether frailty modified the association between life-space mobility and impact on QoL. RESULTS: Participants were on average 808 years old, 65% were women, and 33% were frail. The COVID-19 quarantine led to a restriction of community mobility in 79% of participants and affected the QoL for 77% of participants. We found that restricted life-space mobility was associated with impact on QoL in older adults during the pandemic, although frailty modified the magnitude of the association (P-value for interaction=0.03). Frail participants who experienced restricted life-space mobility had twice the odds of reporting an impact on QoL when compared with non-frail individuals, with respective adjusted odds ratios of 4.20 (95% CI=2.36-7.50) and 2.18 (95% CI=1.33-3.58). CONCLUSION: Older adults experienced substantial decreases in life-space mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this unexpected change impacted their QoL. Providers should be particularly watchful for the consequences of abrupt life-space restrictions on frail individuals.","output":"The Impact of Frailty on the Relationship between Life-Space Mobility and Quality of Life in Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To explore the homogenized management method of infection prevention and control in medical resident under COVID-19 epidemic situation Methods: Overall, 268 members in Ningbo Medical Group which was participating in the management of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China were managed homogeneously in terms of personal cleaning and disin-fection of articles, prevention and control of infection in life, training and assessment of relevant infection knowledge in hospitals Results: In the epidemic situation, the homogenization management of infection prevention and control in the resident of medical team is an important measure to block the transmission link Conclusion: 1 Conduct homogenization management on the training of hospital infection knowledge for medical staff 2 Conduct homogeneous management of effective assessment of training knowledge 3 Conduct homogenization management from personal cleaning and disinfection, as well as infection prevention and control in daily life ? 2020, Iranian Journal of Public Health All rights reserved","output":"Discussion on the management method of covid-19 infection prevention in medical residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expatriates comprise a diverse set of travelers who face unique medical, psychiatric, and non-health-related risks as a result of increased exposure to host country environment and associated lifestyle.

In fact, studies investigating the effects of the lockdown on problem gamblers (PGs) under treatment are missing. The aims of this study were to analyze patients gambling behavior and craving during the lockdown and to conduct a comparison between gambling disorder (GD) symptoms at the beginning of the treatment and during lockdown. The study was conducted in Italy, the European country with the largest gambling market and the first to be affected by the virus. Data were collected through a semi-structured telephone interview conducted by healthcare professionals. Participants were 135 PGs under treatment (109 males, mean age = 50.07). Results showed that most PGs achieved a significant improvement in their quality of life, with less gambling behavior, GD symptoms, and lower craving. No shift toward online gambling and very limited shift towards other potential addictive and excessive behaviors occurred.

An interesting approach (DiffPool) utilises a differentiable graph pooling technique which learns 'differentiable soft cluster assignment' for nodes at each layer of a deep graph neural network with nodes mapped on sets of clusters. However, effective control of the learning process is difficult given the inherent complexity in an 'end-to-end' model with the potential for a large number parameters (including the potential for redundant parameters). In this paper, we propose an approach termed FPool, which is a development of the basic method adopted in DiffPool (where pooling is applied directly to node representations). Techniques designed to enhance data classification have been created and evaluated using a number of popular and publicly available sensor datasets. Experimental results for FPool demonstrate improved classification and prediction performance when compared to alternative methods considered.

Fewer than 60% of patients with decompensated cirrhosis survive after two years, with patients often experiencing distressing symptoms impairing quality of life. Early advanced care planning and timely palliative care referral can improve quality of life and the end of life experience. We aimed to determine palliative care referral rates and patterns for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis, and to identify the factors associated with referral. METHODS This was a retrospective, single-centre study undertaken at a metropolitan tertiary referral hospital. Patients admitted between the 1st June 2016 to 31st January 2019 with a Child-Pugh score of B or C, and a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score 15 were included. We assessed survival and compared those referred and not referred to palliative care, adjusting for lag-time to referral (Kaplan-Meier analysis). RESULTS One-hundred-and-sixteen admissions met eligibility criteria for referral. The median age at admission was 59 years, with 76% male. Only a fifth of eligible patients (25/116) were referred to palliative care. The median survival (from referral) for those referred to palliative care was 20 days, versus 148 days for those not referred. CONCLUSIONS Despite benefits from timely referral, less than one-quarter of palliative care eligible patients were referred. Referral appears reserved for those facing imminent death - surviving just under three weeks post-referral, yet mortality in non-referred patients remained high (148-day median).

CASE PRESENTATION: Here we described the clinical characteristics and outcomes from two patients-a female aged 40-year-old and an 83-year-old male-who were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with history of chronic renal insufficiency. The female was admitted for dry cough and shortness of breath and the male was admitted for fever. The thorax computed tomography revealed patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacity in both scattered lobes and the throat swab sample for coronavirus nucleic acid was positive. They were diagnosed with COVID-19 and their renal function became progressively worse after infection with COVID-19. After symptomatic support treatment, in both the patients, renal function was obviously restored, and both recovered from this pneumonia and conformed to the discharge criteria. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection may aggravate renal function impairment. It is crucial to monitor changes of renal function in patients with COVID-19, especially those with primary kidney disease.

Early results of the MonarchE trial investigating the addition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy indicated a lower recurrence rate in the combination group in a high-risk population of patients with early stage hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative BC. In contrast, the PALLAS study evaluating adjuvant palbociclib could not confirm these results. Subtle differences in the respective trial populations, a higher discontinuation rate in PALLAS, or substance-specific differences may be responsible. In HER2-positive early stage BC, long-term results of the ADAPT-TP trial support the notion that chemotherapy-free treatment may be possible in a subset of patients with favourable response to HER2-directed therapy without compromising long-term outcome. The phase III IMpassion031 trial evaluated the addition of atezolizumab to neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-containing chemotherapy in triple-negative BC (TNBC). A significant improvement in terms of pathologic complete remission rate was observed but data concerning long-term outcome must be awaited. Final overall survival (OS) analysis of IMpassion130 confirmed the clinically relevant OS improvement observed with the addition of atezolizumab to first-line nab-paclitaxel in metastatic PD-L1 positive TNBC. In contrast, no benefit was observed with the addition of atezolizumab to solvent-based paclitaxel in a similar population. This contradiction is commonly explained by the need for corticosteroid co-medication with conventional paclitaxel, but the exact reason remains poorly understood.

There are no data on the incidence of LAR in Asian subjects, or its risk factors and associated clinical outcomes. METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-centre case-+control study to investigate the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of LAR in Chinese kidney transplant recipients. Subjects with or without LAR were matched for age, gender, era of transplantation, allograft type, and maintenance immunosuppression regimen. RESULTS Thirty-two episodes of LAR occurred within an observation period of 12 years giving an incidence rate of 0.46 episodes per 1000 patient-years. Acute rejection within the first year after transplantation was associated with an increased risk of LAR (OR 3.59, P = 0.041). In patients receiving maintenance immunosuppression regimen with steroid, cyclosporin A (CsA) and mycophenolate or an m-TOR inhibitor, patients with LAR showed lower trough CsA levels prior to and at the time of rejection compared to Controls (86.0  26.1 vs. 105.6  13.3 g/L, P = 0.049; and 75.7  35.7 vs. 106.0  20.5 g/L, P = 0.032, respectively).

This brief report sought to describe the potential of 5-ALA and sodium-ferrous citrate (5-ALA/SFC) to ameliorate the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AREAS COVERED : Studies have shown that 5-ALA is converted to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), then to heme. Recent studies have demonstrated that PPIX has antiviral effects against several viruses, including Zika virus, dengue virus, and influenza A virus. The anti-inflammatory effects of 5-ALA have also been reported in humans. Preliminary in vitro and clinical studies have shown that the combination of 5-ALA/SFC could reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-mediated insults. The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains guanine-quadruplex sequences, and the administration of 5-ALA/SFC can lead to the generation of porphyrins that have the ability to bind to guanine-quadruplexes and reduce the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, 5-ALA is a metabolic precursor of heme, which is a potent inducer of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1, the levels of which are decreased in patients with severe COVID-19. Oral administration of 5-ALA/SFC induced heme oxygenase-1 in the peripheral blood of uninfected healthy individuals. This brief report was constructed by a literature search using PubMed database, related to 5-ALA/SFC, published until September 2021. EXPERT OPINION : Based on the available information, it appears likely that 5-ALA/SFC has therapeutic value in clinically controlling SARS-CoV-2-mediated insults in COVID-19 patients. Multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed for determining the long-term clinical utility of 5-ALA/SFC.","output":"Therapeutic potential of 5-aminolevulinic acid and sodium-ferrous citrate for viral insults: relevance to the COVID-19 crisis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 59-year old incarcerated woman who was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma in 2016 was brought in for evaluation of the breast cancer.

RESULTS Results from a regression analysis showed that the interaction between mental contamination and cognitive fusion predicted anxiety ( = 0.15, p < 0.001). Simple slopes analysis revealed a positive association between mental contamination and anxiety that was significant at higher ( = 0.25, p < 0.001), but not lower ( = 0.01, p = 0.88), levels of cognitive fusion. CONCLUSION The development of risk profiles that incorporate mental contamination and cognitive fusion may be beneficial for early identification of individuals at high risk for anxiety.","output":"The interactive effect of mental contamination and cognitive fusion on anxiety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Case fatality rates (CFRs) and case recovery rates (CRRs) are frequently used to define health consequences related to specific disease epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic This study aimed to compare various methods and models for calculating CFR and CRR related to COVID-19 based on the global and national data available as of April 2020 Methods: This analytical epidemiologic study was conducted based on detailed data from 210 countries and territories worldwide in April 2020 We used three different formulas to measure CFR and CRR, considering all possible scenarios Results: We included information for 72 countries with more than 1,000 cases of COVID-19 Overall, using first, second, and third estimation models, the CFR were 6 22%, 21 20%, and 8 67%, respectively;similarly, the CRR was estimated as 23 21%, 78 86%, 32 23%, respectively We have shown that CFRs vary so much spatially and depend on the estimation method and timing of case reports, likely resulting in overestimation Conclusion: Even with the more precise method of CFRs estimation, the value is overestimated Case fatality and recovery rates should not be the only measures used to evaluate disease severity, and the better assessment measures need to be developed as indicators of countries' performance during COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Estimating Case Fatality and Case Recovery Rates of COVID-19: is this the right thing to do?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the next few years, smart farming will reach each and every nook of the world.

Previous estimates that smear-negative patients contribute 13C20% of transmissions and are, on average, 20 to 25% as infectious as smear-positive cases are understood to be high. Herein, we use an ideal real-world setting, a comprehensive dataset, and new high-resolution techniques to more accurately estimate the true transmission risk of smear-negative cases. METHODS: We treated all adult culture-positive pulmonary TB patients diagnosed in the province of Alberta, Canada from 2003 to 2016 as potential transmitters. The primary data sources were the Alberta TB Registry and the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health. We measured, as primary outcomes, the proportion of transmissions attributable to smear-negative sources and the relative transmission rate. First, we replicated previous studies by using molecular (DNA) fingerprint clustering. Then, using a prospectively collected registry of TB contacts, we defined transmission events as active TB amongst identified contacts who either had a 100% DNA fingerprint match to the source case or a clinical diagnosis. We supplemented our analysis with genome sequencing on temporally and geographically linked DNA fingerprint clusters of cases not identified as contacts. FINDINGS: There were 1176 cases, 563 smear-negative and 613 smear-positive, and 23,131 contacts. Replicating previous studies, the proportion of transmissions attributable to smear-negative source cases was 16% (95% CI, 12C19%) and the relative transmission rate was 0.19 (95% CI, 0.14C0.26). With our combined approach, the proportion of transmission was 8% (95% CI, 3C14%) and the relative transmission rate became 0.10 (95% CI, 0.05C0.19). INTERPRETATION: When we examined the same outcomes as in previous studies but refined transmission ascertainment with the addition of conventional epidemiology and genomics, we found that smear-negative cases were 50% less infectious than previously thought.

Long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a smoldering inflammatory condition, characterized by several symptom clusters. This study aims to determine the prevalence of MAFLD in patients with postacute COVID syndrome (PACS) and its association with other PACS-cluster phenotypes. METHODS: We included 235 patients observed at a single university outpatient clinic. The diagnosis of PACS was based on 1 cluster of symptoms: respiratory, neurocognitive, musculoskeletal, psychological, sensory, and dermatological. The outcome was prevalence of MAFLD detected by transient elastography during the first postdischarge follow-up outpatient visit. The prevalence of MAFLD at the time of hospital admission was calculated retrospectively using the hepatic steatosis index. RESULTS: Of 235 patients, 162 (69%) were men (median age 61). The prevalence of MAFLD was 55.3% at follow-up and 37.3% on admission (P < .001). Insulin resistance (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14C1.96), body mass index (OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04C1.24), and the metabolic syndrome (OR = 2.54; 95% CI, 1.13C5.68) were independent predictors of MAFLD. The number of PACS clusters was inversely associated with MAFLD (OR = 0.86; 95% CI, .76C0.97). Thirty-one patients (13.2%) had MAFLD with no other associated PACS clusters. All correlations between MAFLD and other PACS clusters were weak.

Endocytic pathways, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CavME), play an important role for CoVs to penetrate the cell membrane barrier. In this study, a novel CoV entry manner is unraveled in which clathrin and caveolae can cooperatively mediate endocytosis of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV). Using multicolor live-cell imaging, the dynamics of the fluorescently labeled clathrin structures, caveolae structures, and PEDV were dissected. During CavME of PEDV, we found that clathrin structures can fuse with caveolae near the cell plasma membrane, and the average time of PEDV penetrating the cell membrane was within a3 min, exhibiting a rapid course of PEDV entry. Moreover, based on the dynamic recruitment of clathrin and caveolae structures and viral motility, the direct evidence also shows that about 20% of PEDVs can undergo an abortive entry via CME and CavME. Additionally, the dynamic trafficking of PEDV from clathrin and caveolae structures to early endosomes, and from early endosomes to late endosomes, and viral fusion were directly dissected, and PEDV fusion mainly occurred in late endosomes within a6.8 min after the transport of PEDV to late endosomes. Collectively, this work systematically unravels the early steps of PEDV infection, which expands our understanding of the mechanism of CoV infection.IMPORTANCE Emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses cause serious human and animal epidemics worldwide. For many enveloped viruses, including coronavirus, it is evident that breaking the plasma membrane barrier is a pivotal and complex process, which contains multiple dynamic steps. Although great efforts have been made to understand the mechanisms of coronavirus endocytic pathways, the direct real-time imaging of individual porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) internalization has not been achieved yet. In this study, we not only dissected the kinetics of PEDV entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis and the kinetics of endosome trafficking and viral fusion but also found a novel productive coronavirus entry manner in which clathrin and caveolae can cooperatively mediate endocytosis of PEDV. Moreover, we uncovered the existence of PEDV abortive endocytosis. In summary, the productive PEDV entry via the cooperation between clathrin and caveolae structures and the abortive endocytosis of PEDV provide new insights into coronavirus penetrating the plasma membrane barrier.","output":"Dynamic Dissection of the Endocytosis of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Coronavirus Cooperatively Mediated by Clathrin and Caveolae as Visualized by Single-Virus Tracking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) have been detected in several species of animals worldwide; however, data pertaining to their presence in Australian wild and domestic animals are limited.

We report here PBV detection in wild deer and cattle from southeastern Australia. Through metagenomics, the presence of PBV genogroups I (GI) and II (GII) were detected in deer serum and plasma. Molecular epidemiology studies targeting the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene were performed in a wide range of specimens (serum, faeces, spleen, lung, nasal swabs, and trachea) collected from wild deer and cattle, with PCR amplification obtained in all specimen types except lung and spleen. Our results reveal the predominance of GI and concomitant detection of both genogroups in wild deer and cattle. In concordance with other studies, the detected GI sequences displayed high genetic diversity, however in contrast, GII sequences clustered into three distinct clades. Detection of both genogroups in the upper respiratory tract (trachea and nasal swab) of deer in the present study gives more evidence about the respiratory tract tropism of PBV.

RESULTS The study included 366 adults and 147 children, covering 243 cases of ILI and 270 cases of ARS. Laboratory confirmed cases of influenza were higher in adults (50%) than in children (21.6%) ( p < 0.0001) and influenza infection was more prevalent in the ILI definition (53%) than ARS (24.4%) (p < 0.0001).

In the second step, five experts evaluated the weights of those factors and the interactions between them. The products of the weights and interactions allowed, in accordance with SWOT analysis methodology, the most desirable strategy of pyrolysis application in Poland to be determined, which turned out to be an aggressive one.

The Institute for Healthcare Improvement ventilation bundle consists of five structured evidence-based interventions: head of the bed elevation at 30C45; daily sedation interruptions and assessment of readiness to extubate; peptic ulcer prophylaxis; deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis; and daily oral care with chlorhexidine. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to evaluate the use of the ventilation bundle in two intensive care units in Victoria, Australia. METHODS: This is a 3-month prospective observational study in two intensive care units. Patient medical records were reviewed on days 3, 4, and 5 of mechanical ventilation using a prevalidated ventilation bundle checklist. RESULTS: A total of 96 critically ill patients required mechanical ventilation for more than 2 d. Patients had a mean age of 64.50 y (standard deviation = 14.89), with an Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III mean score of 79.27 (standard deviation = 27.11).

For antiviral therapeutics, drug repurposing allowed for rapid movement of existing clinical candidates and therapies into human clinical trials to be tested as COVID-19 therapies. One effective antiviral treatment strategy used early in symptom onset is to prevent viral entry. SARS-CoV-2 enters ACE2-expressing cells when the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 followed by cleavage at two cut sites on the spike protein. TMPRSS2 has a protease domain capable of cleaving the two cut sites; therefore, a molecule capable of inhibiting the protease activity of TMPRSS2 could be a valuable antiviral therapy. Initially, we used a fluorogenic high-throughput screening assay for the biochemical screening of 6030 compounds in NCATS annotated libraries.

Across the animal Kingdom, toxin diversity is enormous, and the ability to understand the biochemical mechanisms governing toxicity is not only relevant for the development of better envenomation therapies, but also for exploiting toxin bioactivities for therapeutic or biotechnological purposes. Most of toxinology research has relied on obtaining the toxins from crude venoms; however, some toxins are difficult to obtain because the venomous animal is endangered, does not thrive in captivity, produces only a small amount of venom, is difficult to milk, or only produces low amounts of the toxin of interest. Heterologous expression of toxins enables the production of sufficient amounts to unlock the biotechnological potential of these bioactive proteins. Moreover, heterologous expression ensures homogeneity, avoids cross-contamination with other venom components, and circumvents the use of crude venom. Heterologous expression is also not only restricted to natural toxins, but allows for the design of toxins with special properties or can take advantage of the increasing amount of transcriptomics and genomics data, enabling the expression of dormant toxin genes. The main challenge when producing toxins is obtaining properly folded proteins with a correct disulfide pattern that ensures the activity of the toxin of interest.

Numerous in vitro models have been used to mimic the BBB and constructed by implementing a variety of microfabrication and microfluidic techniques. However, currently available models still cannot accurately imitate the in vivo characteristics of BBB. In this article, we review recent BBB models by analyzing each parameter affecting the accuracy of these models. Furthermore, we propose an investigation of the synergy between BBB models and neuronal tissue biofabrication, which results in more advanced models, including neurovascular unit microfluidic models and vascularized brain organoid-based models.","output":"Vascularizing the brain in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aim: Surgical procedures in patients with COVID-19 disease are associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the demographic and clinical data of surgical patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease. Methods: After taking hospital ethics committee approval, medical records of surgical patients operated during the period from May 2020 to November 2020 in a COVID-19-designated tertiary care hospital of northern India were assessed. The demographic data such as age, gender, associated comorbidities, type of surgery, intraoperative complications, and data on the postoperative status of the patients were collected and analyzed. Results: Ninety-four patients underwent surgical procedures during the study period. Out of all patients, 87.2% were females. The median age of patients was 28 years (range: 1 month-59 years). The emergency cesarean section was the most common surgery performed. The subarachnoid block was the most commonly used anesthesia technique. Out of 94 patients, 70 patients were confirmed COVID-19 positive, and 24 were suspected cases. Most of the patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists II (83%) and 43.6% of patients had comorbidities. Conclusion: The cesarean section was the most commonly performed surgical procedure. The most common anesthesia technique used was the subarachnoid block. The patients operated under subarachnoid block had a better prognosis and did not require intensive care unit stays in the postoperative period.","output":"Demographic profile and clinical characteristics of surgical patients operated in COVID-19 operation theater in a tertiary care hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of gene expression that may be used to identify the pathological pathways influenced by disease and cellular interactions. Viral miRNAs (v-miRNAs) encoded by both DNA and RNA viruses induce immune dysregulation, virus production, and disease pathogenesis. Given the absence of effective treatment and the prevalence of highly infective SARS-CoV-2 strains, improved understanding of viral-associated miRNAs could provide novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 v-miRNAs were identified by deep sequencing in infected Calu-3 and Vero E6 cell lines. Among the ~0.1% small RNA sequences mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the top ten SARS-CoV-2 v-miRNAs (including three encoded by the N gene; v-miRNA-N) were selected. After initial screening of conserved v-miRNA-N-28612, which was identified in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, its expression was shown to be positively associated with viral load in COVID-19 patients. Further in silico analysis and synthetic-mimic transfection of validated SARS-CoV-2 v-miRNAs revealed novel functional targets and associations with mechanisms of cellular metabolism and biosynthesis.

Our objective was to examine changes in health behaviors and their relationship with negative mood during COVID-19 lockdown. We also considered associations between health behaviors and socio-demographic differences and COVID-19-induced changes. 399 participants completed a questionnaire asking about their personal situation and health behaviors during lockdown as well as a negative mood scale. The significance threshold for all analyses was  = 0.05. Poorer diet was linked to more-negative mood, and to changes to working status. Poorer sleep quality was linked with more-negative mood, and with shielding from the virus. Being less physically active was related to more-negative mood and student status, whereas being more physically active was linked to having or suspecting COVID-19 infection within the household. Increased alcohol consumption was linked to living with children, but not to negative mood. Changes to diet, sleep quality, and physical activity related to differences in negative mood during COVID-19 lockdown.

Frontline epidemic prevention workers play a pivotal role against COVID-19. They must face high-risk infection conditions, insufficient anti-epidemic material supplies, mental pressure, and so on. COVID-19 seriously affects their dietary and behavioral habits, and poor habits make them more susceptible to COVID-19. However, their baseline dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of COVID-19 remain unclear for these workers in China. This study aimed to explore the baseline dietary and behavioral habits of frontline workers and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of the epidemic; in addition, susceptible subgroups were identified by stratified analyses as targets of protective measures to keep them from being infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using a sample of 22,459 valid individuals living in China, including 9402 frontline epidemic prevention workers. RESULTS: Before COVID-19, 23.9% of the frontline epidemic prevention workers reported a high-salt diet, 46.9% of them reported a high frequency of fried foods intake, and 50.9% of them smoked cigarettes. After the outbreak of COVID-19, 34.6% of them expressed a willingness to reduce salt intake, and 43.7% of them wanted to reduce the frequency of pickled vegetables intake. A total of 37.9% of them expressed a willingness to decrease or quit smoking, and 44.5% of them wanted to increase sleep duration. Significant differences in the baseline dietary and behavioral habits and the willingness to change their habits were observed between frontline epidemic prevention workers and other participants. Among the frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19, frontline epidemic prevention experience was a promoting factor for adopting worse dietary and behavioral habits, including those in the high-salt intake subgroup (OR, 2.824; 95% CI, 2.341-3.405) and the 11-20 cigarettes/day subgroup (OR, 2.067; 95% CI, 1.359-3.143). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary and behavioral habits of frontline epidemic prevention workers were worse than that those of other participants before COVID-19. They had a greater willingness to adopt healthy dietary and behavioral habits after experiencing the outbreak of COVID-19. However, frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 continued in engage in these poor habits.

In this paper we explore, through twelve in-depth interviews with software engineers, how they perceive trust in their daily work. From the interviews we conclude three things. First, software engineers make a distinction between an adoption factor and a trust factor when selecting a package. Secondly, while in literature mostly technical factors are considered as the main trust factors, the software engineers in this study conclude that organizational factors are more important.

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Adult patients with mild hypercapnia (45 < PaCO(2)  60 mmHg) received either HFNC or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) oxygen therapy. Propensity score matching (PSM) was implemented to increase between-group comparability. The KaplanCMeier method was used to estimate overall survival and cumulative intubation rates, while 28-day mortality and 48-h and 28-day intubation rates were compared using the Chi-squared test. The predictive performances of HR/SpO(2) and the ROX index (the ratio of SpO(2)/FiO(2) to respiratory rate) at 4 h were assessed regarding HFNC failure, which was determined if intubation was given within 48 h after the initiation of oxygen therapy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for HR/SpO(2) and the ROX index were calculated and compared. RESULTS: A total of 524,520 inpatient hospitalization records were screened, 106 patients in HFNC group and 106 patients in NIV group were successfully matched. No significant difference in 48-h intubation rate between the HFNC group (the treatment group) and the NIV group (the control group) (14.2% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.278); patients receiving HFNC had higher 28-day intubation rate (26.4% vs. 14.2%, p = 0.029), higher 28-day mortality (17.9% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.043), and longer ICU length of stay (4.4 vs. 3.3 days, p = 0.019), compared to those of NIV group. The AUC of HR/SpO(2) at 4 h after the initiation of HFNC yielded around 0.660 for predicting 48-h intubation, greater than that of the ROX index with an AUC of 0.589 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with impending respiratory failure had lower intubation rate, shorter ICU length of stay, and lower mortality when treated mild hypercapnia with NIV over HFNC.

Early reports both confirmed and challenged these fears, as some farmers could not find new markets while others established or expanded their direct-to-consumer sales to replace their lost outlets. To understand the impact of the pandemic on Pennsylvania farmers across the entire 2020 growing season, Chatham University and Pasa Sustainable Agriculture(1) surveyed farmers and performed interviews with a subset of these farmers. The anonymous survey was distributed by Pennsylvania-based farm organizations to their constituents, predominantly through email. Just under half the farmers (42%) reported a loss of revenue, while over half (58%) reported either no change or an increase in revenue in 2020. The scale of these changes varied greatly. We also found that vegetable farmers fared slightly better than livestock/eggs/dairy farmers;those with a higher pre-COVID revenue did better than those with a lower pre-COVID revenue;and farms that were able to increase direct-to-consumer sales maintained or increased their total revenues. Participation in state and federal relief programs varied and appeared to have no significant effect on farmers' final 2020 revenue. Farmers' responses to the open-ended survey questions demonstrated that the weather, a lack of infrastructure to support small and midsized producers, and consumers' lack of support for a regional food system were major challenges before COVID.

Traditional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques use molecules of variable sizes (as determined by its localization precision (LP)) to reconstruct a super-resolution map. This results in an image with overlapping and superimposing PSFs (due to a wide size-spectrum of single-molecules) that undermine image resolution. Ideally, it should be possible to identify the brightest molecules (also termed as the fortunate molecules) to reconstruct ultra-superresolution map, provided sufficient statistics is available from the recorded data. Probabilistic Optically-Selective Single-molecule Imaging Based Localization Encoded (POSSIBLE) microscopy explores this possibility by introducing a narrow probability size-distribution of single-molecules (narrow size-spectrum about a predefined mean-size). The reconstruction begins by presetting the mean and variance of the narrow distribution function (Gaussian function). Subsequently, the dataset is processed and single-molecules are filtered by the Gaussian function to remove unfortunate molecules. The fortunate molecules thus retained are then mapped to reconstruct an ultra-superresolution map. In-principle, the POSSIBLE microscopy technique is capable of infinite resolution (resolution of the order of actual single-molecule size) provided enough fortunate molecules are experimentally detected. In short, bright molecules (with large emissivity) holds the key.

The objective was to examine the impact of selenium and coenzyme Q(10) on the level of D-dimer, and its relationship to cardiovascular mortality. D-dimer was measured in 213 individuals at the start and after 48 months of a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with selenium yeast (200 g/day) and coenzyme Q(10) (200 mg/day) (n = 106) or placebo (n = 107). The follow-up time was 4.9 years. All included individuals were low in selenium (mean 67 g/L, SD 16.8). The differences in D-dimer concentration were evaluated by the use of T-tests, repeated measures of variance and ANCOVA analyses. At the end, a significantly lower D-dimer concentration was observed in the active treatment group in comparison with those on placebo (p = 0.006). Although D-dimer values at baseline were weakly associated with high-sensitive CRP, while being more strongly associated with soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 and sP-selectin, controlling for these in the analysis there was an independent effect on D-dimer.

In this report, we present one such unusual presentation in a patient with sudden intraperitoneal hemorrhage and spontaneous splenic rupture with COVID-19 as the likely etiology and contributing factor. The patient was a 75-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of severe left-sided abdominal pain for several days without any preceding trauma. A CT of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a large amount of fluid in the abdomen, which raised suspicion of bleeding. An exploratory laparotomy revealed splenic rupture with hemoperitoneum, and the patient subsequently underwent an emergent splenectomy. The patients COVID-19 antigen test returned positive during the surgery and was subsequently confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. COVID-19 has been found to result primarily in respiratory symptoms through its ability to invade endothelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 affinity. It is speculated that this mechanism may cause a predisposition to micro-thromboses, which can eventually lead to manifestations such as large lymphoid organ thrombosis.

The pathogenesis of Graves disease is still an area of active research. We present a case of Graves disease, which developed following SARS-CoV2 infection. Clinical Case: A 43-year-old man with no prior history of thyroid disease, presented for evaluation due to fatigue palpitations, tremors, and hair loss in June 2020. Earlier that month, he was diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 infection and his thyroid function tests (TFTs) during a visit to the emergency department revealed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level of &amp;lt;0.010 mIU/L (0.35-4.94) with a free T4 (FT4) 1.4 ng/dL (0.7-1.5);consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism. He continued to report palpitations and tremors and further workup was done. A thyroid ultrasound showed two sub-centimeter nodules. A thyroid uptake scan followed, which showed heterogeneous activity in the thyroid gland, (12% and 32% uptake at 6 and 24 hours respectively) with focal increased uptake in the medial lobes, without cold nodules or hot nodules. Repeat TFTs one month later showed a suppressed TSH &amp;lt;0.010 mIU/L, and a normal FT4 1.3 ng/dL. Given suspicion for Graves disease, further labs were ordered. Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) were found to be elevated at 173 % baseline (&amp;lt;=140). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies were also elevated at 362 IU/mL H* (&amp;lt;=9) and 2 IU/mL H* (&amp;lt;=1) respectively. The overall picture was consistent with evolving early Graves disease. Conclusion: Multiple factors are frequently cited in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hyperthyroidism including viral and bacterial infections1 and there have been several reported cases of autoimmune disease related to SARS-CoV2 infection2. This case is one of several emerging cases of autoimmune hyperthyroidism possibly linked to COVID-19. References: 1. Smith, T. J . Graves Disease.

The severity of disease varies from mildly symptomatic to lethal and shows an extraordinary correlation with increasing age, which represents the major risk factor for severe COVID-191. However, the precise pathomechanisms leading to aggravated disease in the elderly are currently unknown. Delayed and insufficient antiviral immune responses early after infection as well as dysregulated and overshooting immunopathological processes late during disease were suggested as possible mechanisms. Here we show that the age-dependent increase of COVID-19 severity is caused by the disruption of a timely and well-coordinated innate and adaptive immune response due to impaired interferon (IFN) responses. To overcome the limitations of mechanistic studies in humans, we generated a mouse model for severe COVID-19 and compared the kinetics of the immune responses in adult and aged mice at different time points after infection. Aggravated disease in aged mice was characterized by a diminished IFN-{gamma} response and excessive virus replication. Accordingly, adult IFN-{gamma} receptor-deficient mice phenocopied the age-related disease severity and supplementation of IFN-{gamma} reversed the increased disease susceptibility of aged mice. Mimicking impaired type I IFN immunity in adult and aged mice, a second major risk factor for severe COVID-192-4, we found that therapeutic treatment with IFN-{lambda} in adult and a combinatorial treatment with IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{lambda} in aged Ifnar1-/-mice was highly efficient in protecting against severe disease. Our findings provide an explanation for the age-dependent disease severity of COVID-19 and clarify the nonredundant antiviral functions of type I, II and III IFNs during SARS-CoV-2 infection in an age-dependent manner. Based on our data, we suggest that highly vulnerable individuals combining both risk factors, advanced age and an impaired type I IFN immunity, may greatly benefit from immunotherapy combining IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{lambda}.","output":"Impaired immune response drives age-dependent severity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biomolecular NMR now contributes routinely to every step in the development of new chemical entities ahead of clinical trials. The versatility of NMR  from detection of ligand binding over a wide range of affinities and a wide range of drug targets with its wealth of molecular information, to metabolomic profiling, both ex vivo and in vivo  has paved the way for broadly distributed applications in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Proteomics and initial target selection both benefit from NMR: screenings by NMR identify lead compounds capable of inhibiting proteinCprotein interactions, still one of the most difficult development tasks in drug discovery.

During spring 2021, we routinely tested all residential students 1 to 2 times per week using pooled, RNA-extraction-free, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) testing of saliva at a cost of $0.43/sample with same-day results. The limit of detection was 500 copies/ml on individual samples, and analysis indicates 1,000 and 2,500 copies/ml in pools of 5 and 10, respectively, which is orders of magnitude more sensitive than rapid antigen tests. Importantly, saliva testing flagged 83% of semester positives (43,884 tests administered) and was 95.6% concordant with nasopharyngeal diagnostic results (69.0% concordant on the first test when the nucleocapsid gene (N1) cycle threshold (C(T)) value was >30). Moreover, testing reduced weekly cases by 59.9% in the spring despite far looser restrictions, allowing for more normalcy while eliminating outbreaks. We also coupled our testing with a survey to clarify symptoms and transmissibility among college-age students. While only 8.5% remained asymptomatic throughout, symptoms were disparate and often cold-like (e.g., only 37.3% developed a fever), highlighting the difficulty with relying on symptom monitoring among this demographic. Based on reported symptom progression, we estimate that we removed 348 days of infectious individuals by routine testing. Interestingly, viral load (C(T) value) at the time of testing did not affect transmissibility (R(2) = 0.0085), though those experiencing noticeable symptoms at the time of testing were more likely to spread the virus to close contacts (31.6% versus 14.3%). Together, our findings support routine testing for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Implementation of cost- and resource-efficient approaches should receive strong consideration in communities that lack herd immunity. IMPORTANCE This study highlights the utility of routine testing for SARS-CoV-2 using pooled saliva while maintaining high sensitivity of detection (under 2,500 copies/ml) and rapid turnaround of high volume (up to 930 samples in 8 h by two technicians and one quantitative PCR [qPCR] machine). This pooled approach allowed us to test all residential students 1 to 2 times per week on our college campus during the spring of 2021 and flagged 83% of our semester positives. Most students were asymptomatic or presented with symptoms mirroring common colds at the time of testing, allowing for removal of infectious individuals before they otherwise would have sought testing. To our knowledge, the total per-sample consumable cost of $0.43 is the lowest to date. With many communities still lagging in vaccination rates, routine testing that is cost-efficient highlights the capacity of the laboratorys role in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Routine, Cost-Effective SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance Testing Using Pooled Saliva Limits Viral Spread on a Residential College Campus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last decade has witnessed a significant advancement in medical science and technologies.

In particular, in the case of patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), concern about SARS-CoV-2 infection added to the burden of symptoms (BS) which already weights on the QoL of these patients. We designed a cross-sectional survey in order to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on status of anxiety, BS and QoL in MPN patients. METHODS: We analyzed the anxiety levels using the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); BS modifications were studied using the 18 items of the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form [MPN-SAF]. RESULTS: 132 people answered to the survey: 27 (20.4%) patients achieved a moderate to marked anxiety index value: this group described a greater worsening of symptoms than the rest of the cohort (p <0.0001). Women showed a higher level of anxiety than men (p = 0.01). A trend for lower level of anxiety was reported by patients who performed habitual physical activity (p = 0.06). A total of 98 (74.2%) patients described worsening of their symptoms during the quarantine period; 94 (71.2%) patients had postponed appointments or visits: they showed a significant worsening of their BS (p =0.01). CONCLUSION: This study first showed that the COVID-19 quarantine had a significant negative impact on the level of anxiety and BS in MPN patients. We identified female gender, absence of physical activity, the need for frequent visit to the hospital and the absence of a direct access to healthcare staff as the main factors associated to a higher anxiety index and worst BS.","output":"Being a Myeloproliferative Patient in COVID-19 Era: The Mytico Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Let G be a group and [Formula: see text],..., [Formula: see text] be subgroups of G of indices [Formula: see text] respectively.

However, whether PCT can serve as a useful candidate for differentiating KD from sepsis, and even for predicting incomplete KD, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) nonresponsiveness and coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 254 Chinese KD children were enrolled and divided into 6 subgroups, including complete KD, incomplete KD, IVIG-responsive KD, IVIG-nonresponsive KD, KD with CAAs and KD without CAAs. Blood samples were collected from all subjects within 24-h pre- and 48-h post-IVIG infusion, respectively. PCT, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood cell counts were detected. In addition, both 261 children with sepsis and 251 healthy children sex- and age-matched with KD children were enrolled in the same period. RESULTS: (1) PCT experienced the highest increase in sepsis patients before antibiotic therapy, followed by acute KD patients and the healthy controls. (2) The proportion of KD patients with a PCT concentration below 0.25 ng/ml was 11 folds higher than that of sepsis patients.

Different diagnostic tools, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), lung ultrasound (LUS), and computerized tomography (CT), have been used to detect active pneumonic lesions associated with COVID-19 with their varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with a pneumonic lung lesion detected by CT that is not detected by CXR. A total of 156 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at three nationally designated South Korean hospitals with no active lesion detected by CXR but on clinical suspicion of pneumonia underwent the CT examination and were enrolled. Medical records, which included demographic and clinical features, including comorbidity, symptoms, radiological, and laboratory findings on admission, were reviewed and analyzed. The risk factors of pneumonia detected by CT for patients without an active lesion detected by CXR were investigated. Of the 156 patients without an active lesion detected by CXR, 35 (22.44%) patients were found to have pneumonia by CT. The patients with pneumonia defined by CT were older than those without (64.1 years vs. 41.2 years). Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, preexisting stroke, and dementia were more common among patients with pneumonia defined by CT than those without. Serum albumin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), stroke, and age  70 years were significantly associated with pneumonia defined by CT after adjustment for age.

Viral loads and clearance kinetics of B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 viruses were indistinguishable, however B.1.1.7 exhibited a significantly slower pre-peak growth rate in saliva. These results provide a high-resolution portrait of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and implicate individual-level heterogeneity in infectiousness in superspreading.","output":"Daily sampling of early SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals substantial heterogeneity in infectiousness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"National estimates describing the overall prevalence of and disparities in influenza vaccination among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) in United States are not well described.

Associations between sociodemographic factors and lack of vaccination were examined using adjusted logistic regression. Among adults with DM, 36% lacked influenza vaccination. Independent predictors of lacking influenza vaccination included age 18 to 39 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.14-3.00), Black race/ethnicity (OR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.14-1.46), uninsured status (OR 1.88; 95% CI, 1.59-2.21), and no usual source of care (OR 1.61; 95% CI, 1.39-1.85). Nearly 64% individuals with  4 higher-risk sociodemographic characteristics lacked influenza vaccination (OR 3.50; 95% CI 2.79-4.39).

The present systematic review and meta-analysis describes the incidence of AKI, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and mortality among patients with COVID-19-associated AKI. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic database PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science to identify English articles published until 25 May 2020. In case of significant heterogeneity, the meta-analyses were conducted assuming a random-effects model. RESULTS: From 746 screened publications, we selected 21 observational studies with 15 536 patients with COVID-19 for random-effects model meta-analyses. The overall incidence of AKI was 12.3% (95% CI 7.3% to 20.0%) and 77% of patients with AKI were critically ill (95% CI 58.9% to 89.0%). The mortality among patients with AKI was 67% (95% CI 39.8% to 86.2%) and the risk of death was 13 times higher compared with patients without AKI (OR=13.3; 95% CI 6.1 to 29.2). Patients with COVID-19-associated AKI needed for RRT in 23.4% of cases (95% CI 12.6% to 39.4%) and those cases had high mortality (89%-100%). CONCLUSION: The present study evidenced an incidence of COVID-19-associated AKI higher than previous meta-analysis. The majority of patients affected by AKI were critically ill and mortality rate among AKI cases was high. Thus, it is extremely important for health systems to be aware about the impact of AKI on patients' outcomes in order to establish proper screening, prevention of additional damage to the kidneys and adequate renal support when needed.","output":"High burden of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 pandemic: systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous reviews have summarized the epidemiology, pathophysiology and the various therapeutic aspects of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but a practical guide on how to treat whom with what and when based on an understanding of the immunological background of the disease stages remains missing.

Some level of immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected; however, the evidence regarding duration and level of protection is still emerging (2). The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) and a local health department conducted an investigation at a skilled nursing facility (SNF) that experienced a second COVID-19 outbreak in October 2020, 3 months after a first outbreak in July. Five residents received positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results during both outbreaks. During the first outbreak, three of the five patients were asymptomatic and two had mild symptoms that resolved before the second outbreak. Disease severity in the five residents during the second outbreak was worse than that during the first outbreak and included one death. Because test samples were not retained, phylogenetic strain comparison was not possible. However, interim period symptom resolution in the two symptomatic patients, at least four consecutive negative RT-PCR tests for all five patients before receiving a positive test result during the second outbreak, and the 3-month interval between the first and the second outbreaks, suggest the possibility that reinfection occurred. Maintaining physical distance, wearing face coverings or masks, and frequent hand hygiene are critical mitigation strategies necessary to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to SNF residents, a particularly vulnerable population at risk for poor COVID-19-associated outcomes.* Testing, containment strategies (isolation and quarantine), and vaccination of residents and health care personnel (HCP) are also essential components to protecting vulnerable residents.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) but definitive evidence is lacking. Methods We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial including asymptomatic contacts exposed to a PCR-positive Covid-19 case in Catalonia, Spain. Clusters were randomized to receive no specific therapy (control arm) or HCQ 800mg once, followed by 400mg daily for 6 days (intervention arm). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, either symptomatically compatible or a PCR-positive result regardless of symptoms. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed up to 28 days. Results The analysis included 2,314 healthy contacts of 672 Covid-19 index cases identified between Mar 17 and Apr 28, 2020. A total of 1,198 were randomly allocated to usual care and 1,116 to HCQ therapy. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 disease (6.2% usual care vs. 5.7% HCQ; risk ratio 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.54-1.46]), nor evidence of beneficial effects on prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (17.8% usual care vs. 18.7% HCQ).

The objective of this study was to estimate the total discounted money value of human life losses (TDMVCL MAURITIUS ) associated with COVID-19 in Mauritius. Methods: The human capital approach (HCA) was used to estimate the TDMVCL MAURITIUS of the 10 human life losses linked with COVID-19 in Mauritius as of 16 October 2020. The HCA model was estimated with the national life expectancy of 75.51 years and a discount rate of 3%. A sensitivity analysis was performed assuming (a) 5 and 10% discount rates, and (b) the average world life expectancy of 73.2 years, and the world highest life expectancy of 88.17 years. Results: The money value of human lives lost to COVID-19, at a discounted rate of 3%, had an estimated TDMVCL MAURITIUS of Int$ 3,120,689, and an average of Int$ 312,069 per human life lost. Approximately 74% of the TDMVCL MAURITIUS accrued to persons aged between 20 and 59 years. Reanalysis of the model with 5 and 10% discount rates, holding national life expectancy constant, reduced the TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 19.0 and 45.5%, respectively. Application of the average world life expectancy at 3% discount rate reduced TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 13%; and use of the world highest life expectancy at 3% discount rate increased TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 50%. Conclusions: The average discounted money value per human life loss associated with COVID-19 is 12-fold the per capita GDP for Mauritius.

MIS-C is common in Hispanic and black children in Europe and North America, with few reports in East Asians. A significant portion of patients with MIS-C develop Kawasaki disease (KD)-like symptoms. Therefore, differential diagnosis is challenging, especially in East Asia, where KD is most prevalent. No Japanese cases have been reported in the literatures so far. We report a case of MIS-C in Japan with KD-like symptoms. A 9-year-old Japanese boy, who was infected with SARS-CoV2 1 month previously along with his family, was admitted to our hospital owing to fever for 6 days and erythema mainly in the groyne and pubic area. He also had conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, and diarrhoea. His laboratory findings were as follows: WBC, 12,840/L (lymphocytes, 4%); CRP, 22.6 mg/dL, pro-calcitonin, 1.8 ng/mL (normal, <0.50 ng/mL); NT pro-BNP, 7627 pg/mL (<125 pg/mL); and troponin T, 0.14 ng/mL (<0.01 ng/mL). His cardiac function was normal. We initially diagnosed him with KD. His fever rapidly resolved with intravenous immunoglobulin and there were no coronary artery lesions. Desquamation of the fingers was observed later. Finally, a history of SARS-COV2 infection, his age, atypical skin rash, elevation of markers of inflammation and heart failure, and lymphopenia suggested the diagnosis of MIS-C rather than KD. Differentiation between KD and MIS-C is necessary even in Japan, especially in patients with atypical features of KD.","output":"A case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in a japanese boy: with discussion of cytokine profile."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In October 2021, 59 scientists from 14 countries and 13 U.S. states collaborated virtually in the Third Annual Baylor College of Medicine & DNANexus Structural Variation hackathon.

This classical approach takes several days until large enough plaques can be visualized and counted with some variation due to subjectivity in plaque recognition. Since plaques are clonal lesions produced by virus-induced cytopathic effect, we applied DNA fluorescent dyes with differential cell permeability to visualize them by live-cell imaging. We could observe different stages of that cytopathic effect corresponding to an early wave of cells with chromatin-condensation followed by a wave of dead cells with membrane permeabilization within plaques generated by different animal viruses. This approach enables an automated plaque identification using image analysis to increase single plaque resolution compared to crystal violet counterstaining and allows its application to plaque tracking and plaque reduction assays to test compounds for both antiviral and cytotoxic activities. This fluorescent real-time plaque assay sums to those next-generation technologies by combining this robust classical method with modern fluorescence microscopy and image analysis approaches for future applications in virology.","output":"A Fluorescent Real-Time Plaque Assay Enables Single-Cell Analysis of Virus-Induced Cytopathic Effect by Live-Cell Imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying bipolar (BD) and major depressive disorders (MDD) are multifactorial but likely involve synaptic dysfunction and dysregulation.

These studies have yielded contradictory results, possibly due to the small sample size and sourcing material from different cortical regions of the brain. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to understand the role of these three synaptic proteins and other synaptic proteins, messenger RNA (mRNA) and their regional localizations in BD and MDD. A systematic literature search was conducted and the review is reported in accordance with the MOOSE Guidelines. Meta-analysis was performed to compare synaptic marker levels between BD/MDD groups and controls separately. 1811 papers were identified in the literature search and screened against the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The patient in question is a 43-year-old female who travelled from the United Kingdom (UK) to Poland for a circumferential abdominoplasty with fleur-de-lis extension. On returning home, she required admission to an NHS hospital 3 weeks post-operatively due to wound necrosis, dehiscence and cellulitis.

However, the additional concerns surrounding this case are numerous, including; air travel for non-essential purposes, the lack of self-isolation pre-operatively and a covid-19 test far in advance of surgery with disregard for any viral incubation period, particularly with this patient's travel related risk. There was complete disregard for EASAPS guidance banning aesthetic surgery in this global pandemic, exacerbated by the fact this particular week was the peak of Covid-19 cases in Poland. As we recover from this global pandemic and the world begins to normalise, we urge all surgeons undertaking aesthetic procedures to ensure they follow the relative aesthetic association guidelines to ensure both patient and staff safety.

We sought to characterize SARS-CoV-2 infection, and estimate the relative risk of infection among children within households during school closures in Taipei and New Taipei City. METHODS: We reviewed consecutive children below 18 years presenting to our emergency department from May 18, 2021 to July 12, 2021 who underwent real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory swabs. Demographics, symptoms, and contacts were captured from medical records. Household contact was defined as an individual with confirmed COVID-19 living in the same residence as the child. RESULTS: Among 56 children with SARS-CoV-2, twenty-five (45%) were male with mean age of 7.9 years. Symptoms were nonspecific, with 29% having fever, 32% having cough, and 48% were asymptomatic. The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR was 25 (range 11C38). All 56 children reported 94 contacts with a COVID-19 patient, of which 99% were household contacts. The relative risk of infection was 8.5 (95% CI 5.0C14.7) for children whose parent(s) were COVID-19 patients, and 7.3 (95% CI 4.9C11.0) for children whose household grandparent(s) were patients, as compared to children without respective contacts. Children without COVID-19 contacts were all tested negative.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCP, including clinical and non-clinical staff, researchers, and trainees between February 21 and March 19, 2021. The survey evaluated vaccine attitudes, beliefs, intent and acceptance. RESULTS: Overall, 3,981 (87.7%) of respondents had already received a COVID-19 vaccine or planned to get vaccinated. There were significant differences in vaccine acceptance by gender, age, race, and hospital role. Males (93.7%) were more likely than females (89.8%) to report vaccine acceptance (p<0.001). Mean age was higher among those reporting vaccine acceptance (p<0.001).

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one of the major pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by immune cells as well as non-immune cells, including neurons, which play a crucial role in generating cytokine storm. They recognize microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs, expressed by pathogens) and damage or death-associate molecular patterns (DAMPs; released and/expressed by damaged/killed host cells). Upon recognition of MAMPs and DAMPs, TLRs activate downstream signaling pathways releasing several pro-inflammatory mediators [cytokines, chemokines, interferons, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS or RNS)], which cause acute inflammation meant to control the pathogen and repair the damage. Induction of an exaggerated response due to genetic makeup of the host and/or persistence of the pathogen due to its evasion mechanisms may lead to severe systemic inflammatory condition called sepsis in response to the generation of cytokine storm and organ dysfunction. The activation of TLR-induced inflammatory response is hardwired to the induction of several negative feedback mechanisms that come into play to conclude the response and maintain immune homeostasis. This state-of-the-art review describes the importance of TLR signaling in the onset of the sepsis-associated cytokine storm and discusses various host-derived endogenous negative regulators of TLR signaling pathways. The subject is very important as there is a vast array of genes and processes implicated in these negative feedback mechanisms. These molecules and mechanisms can be targeted for developing novel therapeutic drugs for cytokine storm-associated diseases, including sepsis, severe COVID-19, and other inflammatory diseases, where TLR-signaling plays a significant role.","output":"Toll-like receptors in sepsis-associated cytokine storm and their endogenous negative regulators as future immunomodulatory targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article focuses on the concepts of ecosystems and clusters, with an emphasis on their importance for building vibrant a vibrant and life science/biopharma industry.

The prevention measures for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have reportedly reduced transmission of certain infectious diseases. Under these circumstances, the prevention measures for COVID-19 may reduce the incidence of Kawasaki disease. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using registration datasets of patients with Kawasaki disease who were diagnosed in all 11 inpatient pediatric facilities in Yamanashi Prefecture. The eligible cases were 595 cases that were diagnosed before the COVID-19 pandemic (from January 2015 through February 2020) and 38 cases that were diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic (from March through November 2020). Incidence of several infectious disease were evaluated using data from the Infectious Disease Weekly Report conducted by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. RESULTS: Epidemics of various infectious diseases generally remained at low levels during the first 9 months (March through November 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the incidence of COVID-19 was 50C80 times lower than the incidence in European countries and the United States. The total number of 38 cases with Kawasaki disease for the 9 months during the COVID-19 pandemic was 46.3% (?3.5 standard deviations [SDs] of the average [82.0; SD, 12.7 cases] for the corresponding 9 months of the previous 5 years.

Environmental changes caused by humans (auto-bioterrorism) and bioterrorism-related diseases they may impact are urbanization, agricultural intensification, de(re)forestation, water projects, and climate changes. Agroterrorism implies deliberate attack against commercial crops or livestock population. Agroterrorism is a multidimensional threat, involving a wide range of motives and perpetrators, and encompassing a wide range of actions, from single act of sabotage to strategic wartime programs with potentially disastrous spill-over' effects on susceptible wildlife and endangered species population. The threat of an agroterrorist attack depends on motivations and technical requirements of agroterrorism. Technical barriers to agroterrorism are lower than these to human-targeted bioterrorism. Terrorists' motives vary widely. The two most common are the profit motive and the anti-GMO (genetically modified organism) motive. The threat of an agroterrorist attack can be countered at four levels: (1) at the organism level, through animal or plant disease resistance; (2) at the farm level, through facility management techniques designed to prevent disease introduction or transmission; (3) at the agricultural sector level, through disease detection and response procedures; (4) at the national level, through policies designed to minimize the social and economic costs of a catastrophic disease outbreak.","output":"Environmental Health and Bioterrorism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Body weight (BW) loss is prevalent in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). Gut microbiota affects BW and is known to directly shape the host immune responses and antitumor immunity. This pilot study evaluated the link between gut microbiota, metabolic parameters and inflammatory/immune parameters, through the fecal material transplantation (FMT) of PC patients and healthy volunteers into germ-free (GF) mice. Methods We transplanted the feces from five PC patients and five age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers into two GF mice each. Mouse BW and energy intake were measured every 1-5 days, oral glucose on day 21, insulin tolerance on day 26, fecal bacterial taxonomic profile by 16S rRNA gene sequencing on day 5, 10, 15 and 30, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue T cells, plasma cytokines and weights of fat and muscle mass at sacrifice (day 34). Results are presented as mean  SD. The continuous parameters of mice groups were compared by linear univariate regressions, and their bacterial communities by Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), Bray-Curtis similarity and ANCOM test. Results Recipients of feces from PC patients and healthy volunteers had similar BW gain and food intake. Visceral fat was lower in recipients of feces from PC patients than from healthy individuals (0.72  0.17 vs. 0.92  0.14 g; coeff -0.19, 95% CI -0.38, -0.02, p=0.035). The other non-metataxonomic parameters did not differ between groups. In PCoA, microbiota from PC patients clustered apart from those of healthy volunteers and the same pattern was observed in transplanted mice.

Patients with hematologic malignancy diagnosed with PIV from January 2009 to December 2018 were retrospectively included in a tertiary care hospital in Seoul, South Korea. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was defined as the detection of PIV in a nasopharyngeal sample with URTI symptoms without new pulmonary infiltrates. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was defined as detection of PIV in either upper or lower respiratory tract samples with new pulmonary infiltrates, with or without hypoxia. PIV-associated mortality was defined as death with respiratory failure and persistent LRTI within 90 days after diagnosis. The study included 143 adult patients.

We searched oncology organisation's websites and eight databases (Inception-November 2020). Screening, data extraction and quality assessment were completed independently in duplicate. PROSPERO 2019CRD4201914001. RESULTS We identified 33 systematic reviews and 18 clinical guidelines. 21% of reviews were high quality, and the average quality score for guidelines was 44%. Evidence for most strategies was absent or weak. There was consensus from a low-quality review and multiple guidelines to recommend moisturisers, gels and lubricants for vulvovaginal symptoms. Evidence was weak for physical activity for self-managing most symptoms, although two high-quality reviews indicated yoga and aerobic exercise could reduce fatigue. Primary research was often biased by weak and underpowered study designs. Eleven reviews did not report information on adverse events.

Of 690 dengue patients, 31% had DHF and 24% severe dengue. Elevated AST and ALT occurred in 86% and 46%, respectively. Seven had AST or ALT1000 U/L. None had acute liver failure but one patient died. Median AST and ALT values were significantly higher with increasing dengue severity by both WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria. However, they were poorly discriminatory between non-severe and severe dengue (e.g., AST area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57C0.67) and between dengue fever (DF) and DHF (AST area under the ROC curve = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.52C0.61). There was significant overlap in AST and ALT values among patients with dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue, and between those with DF and DHF. CONCLUSIONS: Although aminotransferase levels increased in conjunction with dengue severity, AST or ALT values did not discriminate between DF and DHF or non-severe and severe dengue.","output":"Clinical Relevance and Discriminatory Value of Elevated Liver Aminotransferase Levels for Dengue Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative of the COVID-19 disease, which has spread pandemically around the globe within a few months. It is therefore necessary to collect fundamental information about the disease, its epidemiology and treatment, as well as about the virus itself. While the virus has been identified rapidly, detailed ultrastructural analysis of virus cell biology and architecture is still in its infancy. We therefore studied the virus morphology and morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV as it appears in Vero cell cultures by using conventional thin section electron microscopy and electron tomography. Both virus isolates, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Italy-INMI1, were virtually identical at the ultrastructural level and revealed a very similar particle size distribution with a median of about 100 nm without spikes. Maximal spike length of both viruses was 23 nm. The number of spikes per virus particle was about 30% higher in the SARS-CoV than in the SARS-CoV-2 isolate. This result complements a previous qualitative finding, which was related to a lower productivity of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture in comparison to SARS-CoV.","output":"Morphometry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 particles in ultrathin plastic sections of infected Vero cell cultures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to identify and understand factors affecting insiders intention to disclose patients medical information and to investigate how these factors affect the intention to disclose. Based on the literature review on deterrence theory and health information security awareness (HISA), we identify relevant factors and develop a research model explaining insiders intention to disclose patients health information. We collect data (N = 105) through scenario-based experiments. Results show that two personal factors, collectivism, and IT proficiency, play a significant role in the model. While collectivism affects two components (health information security regulation awareness and punishment severity awareness) of HISA which influences intention to disclose, IT proficiency moderates the relationship between HISA and intention to disclose. In addition, HISA negatively affects reporting assessment and intention to disclose. This paper aims to fill a research gap in understanding factors affecting insiders' intentions to disclose protected health information. We identify and investigate factors (e.g., collectivism, HISA, reporting assessment, and IT proficiency) that may affect insiders' disclosing intentions. We find that collectivism affects two components of HISA which influence reporting assessment and disclosing intention. We also discover that IT proficiency moderates the relationship between HISA and intention to disclose. Our findings suggest that we need to carefully consider personal factors such as collectivistic nature and IT proficiency in managing insiders' security breaches.","output":"The role of collectivism and moderating effect of IT proficiency on intention to disclose protected health information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mice aged 1, 4 or 8 weeks were inoculated with haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), strain 67N, by the intracerebral (i.c.), intranasal (i.n.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intravenous (i.v.) or oral route, with different doses.

The dominant p.D620N variant of vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (VPS35) gene is also associated with familial PD but has not been functionally connected to PINK1 and PARK2. METHODS: To better mimic and study the patient situation, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate heterozygous human SH-SY5Y cells carrying the PD-associated D620N variant of VPS35. These cells were treated with a protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to induce the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, which was assessed using biochemical and microscopy approaches. RESULTS: Mitochondria in the VPS35-D620N cells exhibited reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and appeared to already be damaged at steady state. As a result, the mitochondria of these cells were desensitized to the CCCP-induced collapse in mitochondrial potential, as they displayed altered fragmentation and were unable to accumulate PINK1 at their surface upon this insult. Consequently, Parkin recruitment to the cell surface was inhibited and initiation of the PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy was impaired. CONCLUSION: Our findings extend the pool of evidence that the p.D620N mutation of VPS35 causes mitochondrial dysfunction and suggest a converging pathogenic mechanism among VPS35, PINK1 and Parkin in PD.

Computed Tomography (CT) plays an important role in assessing the severity of the infection and can also be used to identify those symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. With a surge of the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients, radiologists are increasingly stressed to examine the CT scans manually. Therefore, an automated 3D CT scan recognition tool is highly in demand since the manual analysis is time-consuming for radiologists and their fatigue can cause possible misjudgment. However, due to various technical specifications of CT scanners located in different hospitals, the appearance of CT images can be significantly different leading to the failure of many automated image recognition approaches. The multi-domain shift problem for the multi-center and multi-scanner studies is therefore nontrivial that is also crucial for a dependable recognition and critical for reproducible and objective diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, we proposed a COVID-19 CT scan recognition model namely coronavirus information fusion and diagnosis network (CIFD-Net) that can efficiently handle the multi-domain shift problem via a new robust weakly supervised learning paradigm.

The relationship between IgG subclasses, especially IgG4, and recurrent wheezing resistant to ICS and requiring multiple hospitalizations in infants was examined. RESULTS: The serum IgG, IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 levels did not differ significantly among the four groups. The IgG4 level in Group 2 infants (3.1  0.2 mg/dl) was significantly lower than in Groups 1, 3, and 4 (9.9  8.0, 8.4  6.1, and 23.4  18.0 mg/dl).

Preliminary analyses reveal sound level reductions on the order of 6-7 dB(A) during lockdown, with differences more or less marked across sites and times of the day. After lockdown, sound levels gradually increased following an incremental relaxation of confinement. Within four weeks, sound levels measurements nearly reached the pre-COVID-19 levels despite a reduced number of pedestrian activities.

Additionally, SH sequences in the genotype G samples showed almost no sequence diversity, with 675 (91%) of them having identical sequences or only one nucleotide difference. This uniformity of circulating genotype and strain created complications for epidemiologic investigations and necessitated the development of a system for rapidly generating mumps whole genome sequences for more detailed analysis.

Since the application of social distancing in public transit vehicles is challenging, minimization of in-vehicle time can help to protect passengers from getting infected. Skip-stop operation is a viable strategy to reduce in-vehicle time as opposed to the conventional all-stop operation, and therefore can provide safer mobility for passengers. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize the in-vehicle time of passengers while operating an A/B stopping pattern (one of the most popular skip-stop strategies in the literature and in practice). Since the number of direct trips is necessarily decreased when using such a skip-stop operation, this paper quantifies the tradeoff between the in-vehicle time of passengers as a pandemic-based safety measure and the number of direct trips as a measure of passenger satisfaction. In order to efficiently solve problems with a large number of transit stops, a multi-start genetic algorithm is developed. Rigorous numerical experiments indicate that the proposed approach can reduce in-vehicle time by up to 34%.

Estimates of RSV incidence in hospitalized adults range widely, and few data exist on incidence in adults with comorbidities that increase the risk of severe disease. We conducted a prospective, population-based, surveillance study to estimate incidence of RSV hospitalization among adults overall and those with specific comorbidities. METHODS Hospitalized adults 18 years residing in the surveillance area with 2 ARI symptoms or exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary disease were screened for eligibility during the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 RSV seasons in three hospital systems in Rochester, NY and New York City. Respiratory specimens were tested for RSV using PCR assays. RSV incidence per 100,000 was adjusted by market share. RESULTS During three winter seasons a combination of active and passive surveillance identified 1,099 adults hospitalized with RSV at three medical centers. Annual incidence during three seasons ranged from 44.2-58.9/100,000. Age-group specific incidence ranged from 7.7-11.9/100,000, 33.5-57.5/100,000, and 136.9-255.6/100,000 in patients 18-49, 50-64, and >65-years of age, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to examine attitudes to the pandemic among individuals with SUD. Methods: Survey responses from 266 patients entering a residential treatment program were analyzed. Results: Most participants were White or African American men. A third of participants reported that their substance use had increased during the pandemic (38%), and that they had stockpiled substances because of concerns about supply (30%). A majority of participants indicated more depression (60%), anxiety (61%), worry about finances (62%), and feeling worse about their substance use due to COVID-19 (67%). An exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors that measured interest in SUD treatment, psychological symptoms, adherence to health recommendations, perceptions of vulnerability to COVID-19, and substance use during COVID-19. African American participants indicated a greater interest in treatment than Whites, while White participants indicated increased symptoms and substance use during COVID-19 (p < .05). Further, African Americans were more likely to have known someone who had developed COVID-19 than whites (p < .05). Older participants indicated adhering to health recommendations more than younger participants, using substances less than younger participants, as well as feeling more vulnerable to COVID-19 (p < .05). Conclusions: This is the first study to examine patient attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19 at a residential SUD treatment program. Treatment providers should be aware of patient attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19 paying special attention to barriers to treatment engagement.","output":"Assessing clinical impacts and attitudes related to COVID-19 among residential substance use disorder patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indian response to the pandemic has been described from\\"India is in denial about the covid-19 crisis\\"or\\"India staring at corona virus disaster\\", to\\"The mystery of India's plummeting covid-19 cases\\". These responses have been far from being backed scientifically and appear ignorant of India's capabilities of leveraging its strengths to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Backed by a swift Government action of restricting/regulating movement to increasing public health capacity to meet the increasing demands of the pandemic, India seems to have done enough to emerge successful. India is doing well, if not guaranteed for the future, but at least for now. Here we review these measures and point to their consistency with analysis of the role of intercommunity transmission and within community action to stop localized outbreaks. In particular, severe restrictions on travel, stopping gatherings, targeted localized lockdowns, school closures, effective public communication, improvements in case identification, rapid ramping of industrial production of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing capacity, as well as intensive measures in high density areas of urban deprivation have placed India in a regime of declining cases and outbreak control. It is time to recognize the scientific basis of India's success and give it its due. With the number of new cases in India leveling recently, the urgency is great to complete the eliminiation process so that a new surge does not occur.","output":"Was India saved by staying below the critical travel threshold and was lockdown and travel restriction the most important public health intervention?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP, COVID-19) outbreak began in Wuhan in December 2019. The new coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)) can cause multiple organ damage, mainly to lung tissue, and induce inflammation in the body. OBJECTIVES To investigate the changes of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level in patients with COVID-19 and assess its value in the evaluation and prognosis of this disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS This paper is a cross-sectional retrospective study. Eighty-six severe COVID-19 patients, 132 non-severe COVID-19 patients and 76 healthy individuals (control group) were recruited to measure triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using enzyme-coupled colorimetry. RESULTS The serum HDL-C level in COVID-19 group was 1.02 0.28 mmol/L which was significantly lower than in control group (1.52 0.55 mmol/L) (p < 0.05). In addition, the serum HDL-C level in severe COVID-19 group was 0.83 1.67 mmol/L, which was significantly lower than that in non-severe COVID-19 group (1.15 0.27 mmol/L) (p < 0.05).

Despite this findings, even in older people the typical clinical presentation with fever and respiratory symptoms remains the most probable. The clinical characteristic at Covid-19 onset are influenced by the presence of common health-related conditions in geriatric subjects, such as comorbidity, disability and frailty, and not simply by chronological age. Moreover, few studies investigated the tendency of Covid-19 symptoms to aggregate in cluster and the use of cluster approach might better describe the clinical complexity of the acute disease. Finally, concerning the prognostic significance of Covid-19 clinical presentation in older people, the available literature still provides discordant results: currently, patients with atypical symptoms report a higher risk to adverse outcomes, such as severity of acute illness and death.","output":"Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Adequate understanding and precautionary behaviors are of vital importance to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 among different populations have been reported, whereas such information is unavailable in teachers. We aimed to investigate the KAP of teachers associated with COVID-19 during the global outbreak. Methods: A large-scale population-based survey was conducted to gather information on COVID-19-related KAP among Chinese teachers using a self-administered questionnaire. We received 10,658 responses in April 2020, out of which 8,248 were enrolled in the final analysis. Participants responded to a self-administered questionnaire concerning demographic characteristics and KAP associated with COVID-19. Results: This work included 4,252 (51.6%) teachers in kindergartens, 2,644 (32.1%) teachers in primary schools, and 1,352 (16.4%) teachers in secondary schools. The knowledge level (mean: 4.46 out of seven points) was relatively lower than the levels of attitudes (mean: 3.27 out of four points) and practices (mean: 4.29 out of five points) toward COVID-19. Knowledge scores significantly varied by the collected demographic variables except education worksite (p < 0.05), whereas practice scores significantly differed in age groups (p < 0.05), education level (p < 0.001), education worksite (p < 0.001), and years of teaching (p < 0.001). The multivariate logistic analysis indicated that poor knowledge related to COVID-19 was common among men, younger, and less-educated teachers. In contrast, female teachers and those with higher education levels tend to have good practices against COVID-19. Conclusion: The present work suggested the knowledge gaps regarding COVID-19 were needed to be corrected immediately in teachers. Given the critical role of teachers in the education system, health authorities should take gender, age, and education level into account when developing suitable health interventions.","output":"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Toward COVID-19 Among Chinese Teachers, Shenzhen: An Online Cross-sectional Study During the Global Outbreak of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Macro-arteriovenous fistulas (MAVFs) are arteriovenous shunts draining into a giant venous ectasia. They can be treated by surgery or embolization. Angiographic controls are usually performed rapidly after treatment in order to prove the cure of the lesion but no long term angiographies are generally scheduled. We wanted to control the stabilities of such lesions at follow up. Method - Clinical history and imaging of ninety-five patients with high flow shunts draining into venous ectasias (MAVFs, Vein of Galen malformations and dilatations) were reviewed. Results - De novo arteriovenous shunts related to angiogenesis involving vasa vasorum developed in three patients with MAVFs at various intervals. Genetic underlying conditions as HHT or RASA 1 mutations were suspected in each patient. Conclusions - Neo-angiogenesis can occur after cure of MAVFs. Long term imaging follow-ups should be considered as the natural history of such recurrent shunts is currently unknown.","output":"De novo arteriovenous shunts after endovascular cure of cerebrospinal macro arteriovenous fistulas.

This is particularly relevant for blood-feeding insects, such as mosquitoes that routinely need to evade the defensive actions of their blood hosts. To minimize the chance of being swatted, a mosquito can use two distinct strategies-continuously exhibiting an unpredictable flight path or maximizing its escape maneuverability. We studied how baseline flight unpredictability and escape maneuverability affect the escape performance of day-active and night-active mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Anopheles coluzzii, respectively). We used a multi-camera high-speed videography system to track how freely flying mosquitoes respond to an event-triggered rapidly approaching mechanical swatter, in four different light conditions ranging from pitch darkness to overcast daylight. Results show that both species exhibit enhanced escape performance in their natural blood-feeding light condition (daylight for Aedes and dark for Anopheles). To achieve this, they show strikingly different behaviors. The enhanced escape performance of Anopheles at night is explained by their increased baseline unpredictable erratic flight behavior, whereas the increased escape performance of Aedes in overcast daylight is due to their enhanced escape maneuvers. This shows that both day and night-active mosquitoes modify their flight behavior in response to light intensity such that their escape performance is maximum in their natural blood-feeding light conditions, when these defensive actions by their blood hosts occur most. Because Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes are major vectors of several deadly human diseases, this knowledge can be used to optimize vector control methods for these specific species.","output":"Diurnal and nocturnal mosquitoes escape looming threats using distinct flight strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

These agents enable the automation of multiple tasks, saving time and (human) effort. However, their presence in social settings raises the need for a better understanding of their effect on social interactions and how they may be used to enhance cooperation towards the public good, instead of hindering it. To this end, we present an experimental study of human delegation to autonomous agents and hybrid human-agent interactions centered on a non-linear public goods dilemma with uncertain returns in which participants face a collective risk. Our aim is to understand experimentally whether the presence of autonomous agents has a positive or negative impact on social behaviour, equality and cooperation in such a dilemma. Our results show that cooperation and group success increases when participants delegate their actions to an artificial agent that plays on their behalf. Yet, this positive effect is less pronounced when humans interact in hybrid human-agent groups, where we mostly observe that humans in successful hybrid groups make higher contributions earlier in the game. Also, we show that participants wrongly believe that artificial agents will contribute less to the collective effort. In general, our results suggest that delegation to autonomous agents has the potential to work as commitment devices, which prevent both the temptation to deviate to an alternate (less collectively good) course of action, as well as limiting responses based on betrayal aversion.","output":"Delegation to artificial agents fosters prosocial behaviors in the collective risk dilemma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to spawning norms in all quarters, including the corporate boardrooms The transformation required in boards is unprecedented in its intensity to overcome the changing challenges in the global market A conceptual note has been developed to understand the boardroom challenges and the requirement of corporate stewards to combat the situation of health crises The article discusses the new boardroom challenges the organization have to face such as virtual boardroom, right board composition, dynamic risk assessment, continuity and resilience The need of the hour for corporate is to have an effective and steward board to overcome the health and financial challenges The article also intends to give suggestions to the companies to manage the pandemic situation with a right steward attitude Their diligent work can lead to increase in profits, which could further satisfy the shareholders with higher returns","output":"A Note on Boardroom Challenge, Board Effectiveness and Corporate Stewardship During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High impact epidemics constitute one of the largest threats humanity is facing in the 21(st) century. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, physical distancing together with testing, contact tracing and quarantining are crucial in slowing down epidemic dynamics. Yet, here we show that if testing capacities are limited, containment may fail dramatically because such combined countermeasures drastically change the rules of the epidemic transition: Instead of continuous, the response to countermeasures becomes discontinuous. Rather than following the conventional exponential growth, the outbreak that is initially strongly suppressed eventually accelerates and scales faster than exponential during an explosive growth period. As a consequence, containment measures either suffice to stop the outbreak at low total case numbers or fail catastrophically if marginally too weak, thus implying large uncertainties in reliably estimating overall epidemic dynamics, both during initial phases and during second wave scenarios.","output":"Discontinuous epidemic transition due to limited testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biogas production is a complicated process and mathematical modeling of the process is essential in order to plan the management of the plants.

The scope of this article is to investigate if machine learning approaches can be used to optimize the predictions of Gompertz models. Increasing the precision of the models is important in order to get an optimal usage of the resources and thereby ensure a more sustainable energy production. Three models were tested: A Gompertz model (Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) = 9.61%), a machine learning model (MAPE = 4.84%), and a hybrid model (MAPE = 4.52%). The results showed that the hybrid model could decrease the error in the predictions with 53% when predicting the methane production one day ahead. When encountering an offset in the predictions the reduction of the error was increased to 66%.","output":"Prediction of the Methane Production in Biogas Plants Using a Combined Gompertz and Machine Learning Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of scientific analysis that has examined spatial heterogeneities in the socioeconomic vulnerabilities related to COVID-19 risk and potential mitigation strategies at the sub-national level in India. The present study examined the demographic, socioeconomic, and health system-related vulnerabilities shaping COVID-19 risk across 36 states and union territories in India. STUDY DESIGN: Using secondary data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India; Census of India, 2011; National Family Health Survey, 2015-16; and various rounds of the National Sample Survey, we examined socioeconomic vulnerabilities associated with COVID-19 risk at the sub-national level in India from March 16, 2020 to May 03, 2020. METHODS: Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), and the negative binomial regression model were used to examine the predictors of COVID-19 risk in India. RESULTS: There persist substantial heterogeneities in the COVID-19 risk across states and union territories in India. The underlying demographic, socioeconomic and health infrastructure characteristics drive the vulnerabilities related to COVID-19 in India.
