Methods: In this historical cohort design, the CPR success rate probable risk factors of 737 critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in 17 hospitals in the catchment area of Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, was evaluated between Feb and Apr 2020. Data were extracted from a database that is a part of a national integrated care electronic health record system and analyzed with logistic and Cox regression models. Results: COVID-19 cases were 341 (46.3%). The mean age in COVID-19 cases and non-COVID-19 patients were 70.014.6 and 63.019.3 years, respectively (P<0.001). The mortality was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (99.1% vs. 74%, OR: 39.6, 95%CI: 12.4, 126.2). Cardiovascular diseases were the most frequent underlying disease (46.3% of COVID-19 cases and 35.1% of non-COVID-19 patients). Being a COVID-19 case (OR: 29.0, 95%CI: 8.9, 93.2), Intensive care unit admission (OR: 2.6, 95%CI: 1.5, 4.6) and age for each ten-year increase (OR: 1.2, 95%CI: 1.1, 1.4) were observed to be independent risk factors of mortality following CPR.

We used hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), one of the most studied drugs in current clinical trials, as a reference template to screen for structural similarity against a library of almost 4000 approved drugs. The top-ranked drugs, based on structural similarity to HCQ, were selected for in vitro antiviral assessment. Among the selected drugs, both zuclopenthixol and nebivolol efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection with EC(50) values in the low micromolar range, as confirmed by independent experiments. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of ambroxol, amodiaquine, and its active metabolite (N-monodesethyl amodiaquine) is also discussed. In trying to understand the hydroxychloroquine mechanism of action, both pK(a) and the HCQ aromatic core may play a role. Further, we show that the amodiaquine metabolite and, to a lesser extent, zuclopenthixol and nebivolol are active in a SARS-CoV-2 titer reduction assay.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of three hemostatic agents: BleedArrest, TraumaDex, and Celox. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, experimental study using male Yorkshire swine. The pigs (n = 5 per group) were randomly assigned to one of the following: BleedArrest, TraumaDex, Celox, or control. To simulate a trauma injury, the investigators generated a complex groin injury with transection of the femoral artery and vein in all pigs. After 1 min of uncontrolled hemorrhage, one of the hemostatic agents was poured into the wound, followed by standard wound packing. The control group underwent the same procedures with the exception of the hemostatic agents. In all groups, 5 min of direct manual pressure was applied to the wound followed by a standard pressure dressing. After 30 min, dressings were removed, and the amount of bleeding was determined. RESULTS There were significant differences between the BleedArrest (mean = 21.2, SD  36.6 mL) TraumaDex (mean = 68, SD  103.5 mL) and Celox (mean = 18.l6, SD  41.6 mL) groups compared with Control group (mean = 230, SD  154 mL) (P < 0.05).

However, SNF-VBP may unintentionally punish facilities with lower profit margins struggling to invest resources to lower readmissions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the SNF-VBP penalty amounts by skilled nursing facility (SNF) profit margin quintiles and examine whether facilities with lower profit margins are more likely to be penalized by SNF-VBP. RESEARCH DESIGN: We combined the first round of SNF-VBP performance data with SNF profit margins and characteristics data. Our outcome variables included estimated penalty amount and a binary measure for whether facilities were penalized by the SNF-VBP. We categorized SNFs into 5 profit margin quintiles and examined the relationship between profit margins and SNF-VBP performance using descriptive and regression analysis. RESULTS: The average profit margins for SNFs in the lowest profit margin quintile was -14.4% compared with the average profit margin of 11.1% for SNFs in the highest profit margin quintile. In adjusted regressions, SNFs in the lowest profit margin quintile had 17% higher odds of being penalized under SNF-VBP compared with facilities in the highest profit margin quintile. The average penalty for SNFs in the lowest profit margin quintile was $22,312. CONCLUSIONS: SNFs in the lowest profit margins are more likely to be penalized by the SNF-VBP, and these losses can exacerbate quality problems in SNFs with lower quality. Alternative approaches to measuring and rewarding SNFs under SNF-VBP or programs to assist struggling SNFs is warranted, particularly considering the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which requires resources for prevention and management.","output":"First Year of Skilled Nursing Facility Value-based Purchasing Program Penalizes Facilities With Poorer Financial Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic full-thickness resection (eFTR) using the full-thickness resection device (FTRD?) is a novel minimally invasive procedure that allows the resection of various lesions in the gastrointestinal tract including the colorectum. Real-world data outside of published studies are limited. The aim of this study was a detailed analysis of the outcomes of colonoscopic eFTR in different hospitals from different care levels in correlation with the number of endoscopists performing eFTR. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this case series, the data of all patients who underwent eFTR between November 2014 and June 2019 (performed by a total of 22 endoscopists) in 7 hospitals were analyzed retrospectively regarding rates of technical success, R0 resection, and procedure-related complications. RESULTS: Colonoscopic eFTR was performed in 229 patients (64.6% men; average age 69.3  10.3 years) mainly on the basis of the following indication: 69.9% difficult adenomas, 21.0% gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, and 7.9% subepithelial tumors. The average size of the lesions was 16.3 mm. Technical success rate of eFTR was achieved in 83.8% (binominal confidence interval 78.4-88.4%). Overall, histologically complete resection (R0) was achieved in 77.2% (CI 69.8-83.6%) while histologically proven full-wall excidate was confirmed in 90.0% (CI 85.1-93.7%). Of the resectates obtained (n = 210), 190 were resected en bloc (90.5%). We did not observe a clear improvement of technical success and R0 resection rate over time by the performing endoscopists. Altogether, procedure-related complications were observed in 17.5% (mostly moderate) including 2 cases of acute gangrenous appendicitis requiring operation.

We adopt Ehgartners discursive frames of consumer sovereignty, economic rationality, and stewardship to illustrate our findings, and add a fourth one of legitimacy. Constituting the conditions under which food-related themes become sustainability issues, these frames help businesses to (1) individualise the responsibility to enact changes, (2) tie efforts towards sustainability to financial profits, (3) subject people and nature to the combination of care and control, and (4) convey legitimacy through scientific authority. We discuss how these frames, mirrored in some consumer narratives, work to sideline deeper engagement with ecological sustainability and social justice, and how they brush aside the desires of some ostensibly sovereign consumers to overcome imperial modes of food provision through much more far reaching, systemic changes.

Tested combinations targeted the FCoV leader and 3' untranslated region, FCoV leader region and nucleocapsid gene, and FCoV leader region, 3' untranslated region, and nucleocapsid gene. For each test condition, assessments included relative quantification of the inhibition of intracellular viral genomic RNA synthesis by means of real-time, reverse-transcription PCR analysis; flow cytometric evaluation of the reduction of viral protein expression in infected cells; and assessment of virus replication inhibition via titration of extracellular virus with a TCID?? infectivity assay. RESULTS The 5 siRNAs had variable inhibitory effects on FCoV when used singly. Combinations of siRNAs that targeted different regions of the viral genome resulted in more effective viral inhibition than did individual siRNAs that targeted a single gene. The tested siRNA combinations resulted in approximately 95% reduction in viral replication (based on virus titration results), compared with findings in negative control, nontargeting siRNA-treated, FCoV-infected cells.

The device was used almost 150,000 times in a few weeks and was described by politicians and administrators as a solution and success. However, high usage cannot serve as the sole criterion of success. What might be adequate criteria? And should digital triage for citizens by default be considered low risk? METHODS: This paper reflects on the uncertain aspects of the performance, risks and issues of accountability pertaining to the digital diagnostic device in order to draw lessons for future improvements. The analysis is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the EU and US regulations of medical devices and the taxonomy of uncertainty in health care by Han et al. RESULTS: Lessons for future digital devices are (a) the need for clear criteria of success, (b) the importance of awareness of other severe diseases when triaging, (c) the priority of designing the device to collect data for evaluation and (d) clear allocation of responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: A device meant to substitute triage for citizens according to its own criteria of success should not by default be considered as low risk.

Shortening the duration from symptom onset to hospital admission, quarantining recent arrivals from Hubei Province, and letting symptomatic individuals stay at home were found to be the three most important interventions to reduce the risk of infection in Shenzhen. The ideal time window for a mandatory quarantine of arrivals from Hubei Province was between 10 January and January 17, 2020, while the ideal time window for local intervention strategies was between 15 and 22 January.

In this paper, we propose a novel Smartphone application-based platform for early diagnosis of possible Covid-19 infected patients. The application provides three modes of diagnosis from possible symptoms, cough sound, and specific blood biomarkers.

At Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital, those with a diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) were offered the MyCOPD app as a digital self-management tool. Initially, only 43% of patients had completed the app, therefore the Breathe Programme conducted a short survey, between September 2020 and January 2021, to gain patient feedback regarding their experiences of the app. Thus, the objective of this study was to utilise patient feedback to explore ways that digital engagement could be optimised within PR. Methods: A convenience sampling method was used to identify 227 patients with COPD who were eligible for the MyCOPD app. Eligibility was further determined by whether they had internet access via a digital device and an appropriate skill set, which was reported by the patient during triage. All patients were encouraged to visit the MyCOPD website for further information before accepting. Those who declined were offered a traditional PR programme. Each patients level of engagement was monitored weekly via the app's online dashboard. Weekly text messages and app notifications were sent to each patient during their time on the programme to encourage engagement. Those who accepted and completed the programme (26) completed a feedback questionnaire upon discharge. Feedback was both qualitative and quantitative. Results: 57 patients (25%) accepted the MyCOPD app whilst 170 (75%) of patients originally opted for traditional PR. The most significant reasons for declining were found to be lack of internet access and lack of skill set. 31 patients dropped out;11 were discharged due to lack of engagement and the remaining 20 patients later opted for traditional PR due to lack of digital skills. They reported finding paper educational packs easier for education. The majority of patients accessed the app via their smartphone. 92% of patients reported the app was either Very Valuable or Valuable in improving their confidence to self-manage their condition. Weekly text messages helped to improve compliance. Conclusion(s): Digital apps within PR can be useful in promoting patient self-management. However, the three issues that must be addressed and require further research are lack of internet access, poor patient digital perceptions and skill level. Reasons for this could be due to socio-economic factors, suggesting that social inequalities would need to be addressed to improve digital uptake. Some patients may require training to improve technological literacy, and overall skill set. The drop-out rate indicates that some patients had poor insight into their initial level of digital competency. Overall, a combination of traditional and digital options should be made available within the PR model to prevent exclusion, promote access to all and provide patient choice, which is paramount within healthcare. Impact: Patients within a PR cohort require more support and training in how to access and use digital technologies.

We investigated the in vitro bactericidal and virucidal efficacy of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) 7% gargle/mouthwash at defined dilution against oral and respiratory tract pathogens. METHODS: PVP-I was tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae according to bactericidal quantitative suspension test EN13727 and against severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), rotavirus strain Wa and influenza virus A subtype H1N1 according to virucidal quantitative suspension test EN14476. PVP-I 7% gargle/mouthwash was diluted 1:30 with water to a concentration of 0.23% (the recommended concentration for real-life use in Japan) and tested at room temperature under clean conditions [0.3 g/l bovine serum albumin (BSA), viruses only] and dirty conditions (3.0 g/l BSA + 3.0 ml/l erythrocytes) as an interfering substance for defined contact times (minimum 15 s). Rotavirus was tested without protein load. A  5 log(10) (99.999%) decrease of bacteria and  4 log(10) (99.99%) reduction in viral titre represented effective bactericidal and virucidal activity, respectively, per European standards. RESULTS: PVP-I gargle/mouthwash diluted 1:30 (equivalent to a concentration of 0.23% PVP-I) showed effective bactericidal activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza virus A (H1N1) and rotavirus after 15 s of exposure. CONCLUSION: PVP-I 7% gargle/mouthwash showed rapid bactericidal activity and virucidal efficacy in vitro at a concentration of 0.23% PVP-I and may provide a protective oropharyngeal hygiene measure for individuals at high risk of exposure to oral and respiratory pathogens.

We retrospectively enrolled 86 consecutive SARS-COV-2 pneumonia patients. CT severity scores were computed to quantify the overall lung involvement. The D-dimer level among CT score tertiles and the association of the D-dimer level with CT score were analyzed. Our results showed that the median D-dimer level was 0.70 mg/L (IQR 0.35C1.76). 42 patients (48.8%) had D-dimer levels above the median level. The D-dimer levels were significantly different across CT score tertiles (0.37 mg/l [IQR 0.31C0.87], 0.66 mg/l [IQR 0.39C1.43], 1.83 mg/l [IQR 0.85C4.41], P < 0.001).

Considering the repercussion of these unique social experiences in infants health, this study aims to assess the early impact of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic in hospital admissions for acute bronchiolitis. METHODS: Data from hospitalizations of acute bronchiolitis in infants under one year were obtained from the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Public Health database (DATASUS) for the period between 2016 and 2020. These data were also analyzed by macro-regions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and Midwest). To evaluate the effect of social distancing strategy on the incidence of acute bronchiolitis, the absolute and relative reduction was calculated by analyzing the yearly subsets of 2016vs2020, 2017vs2020, 2018vs2020, and 2019vs2020. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in all comparisons, ranging from -78% [IRR 0.22 (0.20 to 0.24)] in 2016vs2020 at -85% [IRR 0.15 (0.13 to 0.16)] in 2019vs2020, for the data from Brazil. For analyzes by macro-regions, the reduction varied from -58% [IRR 0.41 (0.37 to 0.45)] in the Midwest in 2016vs2020 to -93% [IRR 0.07 (0.06 to 0.08)] in the South in 2019vs2020. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction in hospitalization for acute bronchiolitis in children under one year old, in Brazil, of the order of more than 70% for most analysis. Our data suggest an important impact of social distance on reducing the transmission of viruses related to acute bronchiolitis.

METHOD A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study from August 2020 to February 2021, surveyed country representatives from the member countries of the Asian Oceanian Association of Neurology. The items of the survey were influenced by the findings and recommendations of the 2011 Atlas of Headache by Lifting the Burden and the World Health Organization. RESULTS Respondents from all of the 21 member countries of the Asian Oceanian Association of Neurology and 3 other Asian countries participated in this survey. All countries have an established neurological association except for Brunei where there are only 6 neurologists. Thirteen countries (54%) have a dedicated council for headaches. The majority have no subspecialty training program for headaches (75%). Prevalence studies are available in 14 countries while 10 out of the 24 have clinical practice guidelines. Among the 6 countries who offer subspecialty training for headache, only 3 countries cater foreign neurologists. Most of the countries have a wide selection of non-specific migraine drugs. All countries except for Mongolia have at least 1 triptan but non-oral forms for triptans are only available in 8 countries.

Whereas the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on several elective procedures has been well-documented, data on regional changes in OHT volumes after COVID-19 are limited. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on OHT volumes in Asia and Oceania. Methods: Using data from the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation (GODT), the world's most comprehensive source of data on organ donation and transplantation, we recorded the number of OHT procedures performed in years 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era) and 2020 (COVID-19 era). The analysis was limited to countries with reported OHT data within Asia and Oceania (Australia, China, India, Iran, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates). OHT rates were reported for each country per million population (PMP), and change in the COVID-19 era was reported as percentage of the pre-COVID-19 rates. The association of total COVID-19 cases with relative reduction in OHT was evaluated using linear regression. Results: Across the Asia/Oceania region, number of OHT in COVID-19 era (median 0.64 procedures PMP, IQR 0.28, 2.15) was significantly lower compared with the pre-COVID-19 era (median 1.18 procedures PMP, IQR 0.49, 2.50), with a median change of -0.29 (IQR -0.70, -0.08;P = 0.04). The impact of COVID-19 on OHT was most pronounced in Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and India, where OHT volumes decreased by 75.4%, 60.8%, and 53%, respectively. Country-level reduction in OHT volumes was not associated with total number of COVID- 19 cases during the year 2020 in that country (r = 0.31;P-value = 0.3). Conclusion: The number of heart transplants during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic significantly decreased in most countries of the Asia/Oceania region. Furthermore, the change in OHT volumes did not correlate with the total number of recorded COVID-19 cases, suggesting the pandemic's impact on OHT numbers extended beyond limiting availability of resources. Identifying factors leading to OHT deferral during COVID-19 pandemic will advance our understanding of the pandemic's true impact on the care of advanced heart failure patients in the region.

For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option. However, the strain on intensive care facilities caused by the pandemic is a major concern. There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources. METHODS: We performed an international multicenter study of transplant centers to understand the evolution of policies for transplant prioritization in response to the pandemic in March 2020. To describe the ethical tension arising in this setting, we propose a novel ethical framework, the quadripartite equipoise (QE) score, that is applicable to liver transplantation in the context of limited national resources. RESULTS: Seventeen large- and medium-sized liver transplant centers from 12 countries across 4 continents participated. Ten centers opted to limit transplant activity in response to the pandemic, favoring a \\"sickest-first\\" approach. Conversely, some larger centers opted to continue routine transplant activity in order to balance waiting list mortality. To model these and other ethical tensions, we computed a QE score using 4 factors - recipient outcome, donor/graft safety, waiting list mortality and healthcare resources - for 7 countries. The fluctuation of the QE score over time accurately reflects the dynamic changes in the ethical tensions surrounding transplant activity in a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This four-dimensional model of quadripartite equipoise addresses the ethical tensions in the current pandemic. It serves as a universally applicable framework to guide regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems.

Dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages are the first cell lineage against viruses' infections. The IFN type I is the danger signal for the human body during this clinical setting. Protective immune responses to viral infection are initiated by innate immune sensors that survey extracellular and intracellular space for foreign nucleic acids. In Covid-19 the pathogenesis is not yet fully understood, but viral and host factors seem to play a key role. Important points in severe Covid-19 are characterized by an upregulated innate immune response, hypercoagulopathy state, pulmonary tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, and fatal outcome in severe cases of macrophage activation syndrome, which produce a 'cytokine storm'.

The objectives of this review were to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of neonatal synthetic vitamin A supplementation, dextrose gel and probiotic supplementation for prevention of morbidity and mortality during infancy in low and middle-income countries. Methods: We included randomized trials. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. We conducted electronic searches on multiple databases. Data were meta-analyzed to obtain relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Studies for vitamin A and Probiotics were analyzed separately. No studies were found for dextrose gel supplementation during neonatal period. The overall rating of evidence was determined by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: Sixteen studies assessed the effect of vitamin A supplementation during the neonatal period. Based on pooled data from community-based studies only, there was no significant effect of vitamin A on all-cause mortality at age 1 month (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90, 1.08), 6 months (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.89-1.08) and 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94, 1.14) but increased risk of bulging fontanelle (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12, 2.09). The overall quality of evidence was high for the above outcomes. Thirty-three studies assessed the effect of probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period and were mostly conducted in the hospital setting. Probiotics reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66, 0.96), necrotizing enterocolitis (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35, 0.59) and neonatal sepsis (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70, 0.86).

Community pharmacists have a legal duty to promote safe and rational medicine use in outpatient care. The development of professionally oriented practice has been nationally coordinated since the 1990s with the support of a national steering group consisting of professional bodies, authorities, pharmacy schools and continuing education centers. The primary focus has been in patient counseling services and public health programs. The services have extended towards prospective medication risk management applying evidence-based tools, databases and digitalization. Research has been essential in informing progress by indicating high-risk patients, medications, practices and processes needing improvement. Despite the commitment of the profession and pharmacy owners, large-scale implementation of services has been challenging because of lack of remuneration, the pharmacy income still consisting primarily of sale of prescription and nonprescription medicines. Policy documents by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health have supported the extension of the community pharmacists role beyond traditional dispensing to promote rational pharmacotherapy. The current roadmap by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health emphasizes ensuring adequate regional availability and accessibility of medicines, regardless of the future pharmacy system. It also emphasizes the importance of strong regulation on pharmacy business operations and sale of medicines to ensure medication safety. At the same time, the roadmap requires that the regulation must enable implementation of new patient-oriented services and procedures, and further promote digitalization in service provision. Competition and balance of funding should be enhanced, e.g., through price competition, but the risk of pharmaceutical market concentration should be managed. The regulation should also consider influence of the new social and health care system on drug delivery. Year 2021 will be crucial for making long-term political decisions on the future direction of tasks and finances of Finnish community pharmacies in this framework. Government-funded studies are underway to guide decision making.

METHODS: We searched ScienceDirect, PubMed, CNKI, and MEDLINE (OVID) from December 31, 2019 to November 20, 2021 for all eligible studies. Random-model was used to reported the incidence, allcause case fatality rate (CFR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021242179). RESULTS: In all, thirty-one cohort studies were included in this study. A total of 3,441 patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) were investigated and 442 cases of CAPA were reported (30 studies). The pooled incidence rate of CAPA was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.11-0.17, I2=0.0%). Twenty-eight studies reported 287 deceased patients and 269 surviving patients. The pooled CFR of CAPA was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.47-0.56, I2=3.9%). Interestingly, patients with COVID19 would develop CAPA at 7.28 days after mechanical ventilation (range, 5.48-9.08 days). No significant publication bias was detected in this meta-analysis. DISCUSSION: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to an ICU might develop CAPA and have high all-cause CFR.

In addition, the ways by which the virus can most efficiently transmit still remain unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case a 48-year-old man who presents primary COVID-19 pneumonia. He was initially admitted for cholecystitis but, upon review of his abdominal CT scan, a segmental zone of ground glass opacity was identified in the right lower lobe. A bronchoalveolar lavage proved positive to SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR, even if he tested negative by oro-nasopharyngeal swab at admission and the day after he underwent bronchoscopy. The near absence of the virus in his saliva 2 days after, combined with a very sharp increase in salivary viral load on the third day, also rule out the possibility of prior viral replication in the upper airway and clearance. In addition, rapidly increasing bilateral alveolar lung infiltrates appeared as the upper respiratory tests begin to detect the virus. CONCLUSIONS: For this patient to have developed primary COVID-19 pneumonia, a contagious aerosol must have traveled to the lower respiratory system. This case gives indirect but compelling evidence that aerosol may spread the virus. It also highlights the limitations of oral and nasal testing methods and the importance of anatomical considerations when studying infections by SARS-CoV-2.

The initial management in the trauma bay follows detailed international valid algorithms. This study aims to work out potential adjustments of trauma bay algorithms during a global pandemic in order to reduce contamination and to increase safety for patients and medical personnel. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared patients admitted to the trauma bay of one academic level-one trauma centre in March and April 2019 with patients admitted in March and April 2020. Based on these datasets, possible adjustments of the current international guidelines of trauma bay management were discussed. RESULTS: Group Pan (2020, n = 30) included two-thirds the number of patients compared with Group Ref (2019, n = 44). The number of severely injured patients comparable amongst these groups: mean injury severity score (ISS) was significantly lower in Group Pan (10.5  4.4 points) compared with Group Ref (15.3  9.2 points, p = 0.035). Duration from admission to whole-body CT was significantly higher in Group Pan (23.8  9.4 min) compared with Group Ref (17.3  10.7 min, p = 0.046). Number of trauma bay admissions decreased, as did the injury severity for patients admitted in March and April 2020. In order to contain spreading of SARS Cov-2, the suggested recommendations of adjusting trauma bay protocols for severely injured patients include (1) minimizing trauma bay team members with direct contact to the patient; (2) reducing repeated examination as much as possible, with rationalized use of protective equipment; and (3) preventing potential secondary inflammatory insults. CONCLUSION: Appropriate adjustments of trauma bay protocols during pandemics should improve safety for both patients and medical personnel while guaranteeing the optimal treatment quality. The above-mentioned proposals have the potential to improve safety during trauma bay management in a time of a global pandemic.","output":"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic on trauma bay management and guideline adherence in a European level-one-trauma centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an unprecedented global pandemic demanding the urgent development of therapeutic strategies. Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library showed the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa- and octasaccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with higher affinity to heparin (KD 55 nM) compared to the receptor binding domain (RBD, KD 1 M) alone. An octasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S could inhibit spike-heparin interaction with an IC50 of 38 nM. Our data supports a model in which the RBD of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 confers sequence specificity for HS expressed by target cells whereas an additional HS binding site in the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site enhances the avidity of binding.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is impacting healthcare worldwide. Patients who develop coagulopathy have worse outcomes. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 suggests a strong interplay between hemostasis and immune cells, especially neutrophils. Our purpose was to assess neutrophil fluorescence as a potential biomarker of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with COVID-acute respiratory distress syndrome (COVID-ARDS). Sixty-one patients with COVID-ARDS admitted to the four intensive care units (ICUs) of a French general hospital were included in this prospective study. Neutrophil activation was assessed by measuring neutrophil fluorescence (NEUT-Side Fluorescence Light, NEUT-SFL) with a specific fluorescent dye staining analyzed by a routine automated flow cytometer Sysmex XN-3000? (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). DVT was diagnosed by complete duplex ultrasound (CDU). We found that NEUT-SFL was elevated on admission in patients with COVID-ARDS (49.76 AU, reference value 46.40 AU, p < 0.001), but did not differ between patients with DVT (49.99 AU) and those without (49.52 AU, p = 0.555). NEUT-SFL is elevated in patients with COVID-ARDS, reflecting neutrophil activation, but cannot be used as a marker of thrombosis. Because neutrophils are at interface between immune response and hemostasis through release of neutrophil extracellular traps, monitoring their activation could be an interesting approach to improve our management of coagulopathy during COVID-ARDS.

Mobile telepresence robots may allow persons with MCI or ADRD to remain living independently at home and ease the burden of caregiving. The goal of this study was to identify how an existing mobile telepresence robot can be enhanced to support at-home care of people with MCI or ADRD through key stakeholder input. OBJECTIVE: The specific aims were to assess what applications should be integrated into the robot to further support the independence of individuals with MCI or ADRD and understand stakeholders overall opinions about the robot. METHODS: We conducted in-person interviews with 21 stakeholders, including 6 people aged >50 years with MCI or ADRD living in the community, 9 family caregivers of people with MCI or ADRD, and 6 clinicians who work with the ADRD population. Interview questions about the robot focused on technology use, design and functionality, future applications to incorporate, and overall opinions. We conducted a thematic analysis of the data obtained and assessed the patterns within and across stakeholder groups using a matrix analysis technique. RESULTS: Overall, most stakeholders across groups felt positively about the robots ability to support individuals with MCI or ADRD and decrease caregiver burden. Most ADRD stakeholders felt that the greatest benefits would be receiving help in emergency cases and having fewer in-person visits to the doctors office. Caregivers and clinicians also noted that remote video communication with their family members using the robot was valuable. Adding voice commands and 1-touch lifesaving or help buttons to the robot were the top suggestions offered by the stakeholders. The 4 types of applications that were suggested included health-related alerts; reminders; smart-homeCrelated applications; and social, entertainment, or well-being applications. Stakeholders across groups liked the robots mobility, size, interactive connection, and communication abilities. However, stakeholders raised concerns about their physical stability and size for individuals living in smaller, cluttered spaces; screen quality for those with visual impairments; and privacy or data security. CONCLUSIONS: Although stakeholders generally expressed positive opinions about the robot, additional adaptations were suggested to strengthen functionality. Adding applications and making improvements to the design may help mitigate concerns and better support individuals with ADRD to live independently in the community. As the number of individuals living with ADRD in the United States increases, mobile telepresence robots are a promising way to support them and their caregivers. Engaging all 3 stakeholder groups in the development of these robots is a critical first step in ensuring that the technology matches their needs. Integrating the feedback obtained from our stakeholders and evaluating their effectiveness will be important next steps in adapting telepresence robots.","output":"Improving a Mobile Telepresence Robot for People With Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias: Semistructured Interviews With Stakeholders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most explanations for the crisis of the liberal order revolve around geopolitics, globalization, economic resentment fueling new forms of populism and nationalism, and Western states following their interests away from liberal values and institutions of their creation.

Moreover, lockdowns measures led to a restriction of the access to activities which, in turn, might have decreased the environmental satisfaction. Then, this research investigates the pandemics psychological impacts on emotions and regulation strategies, intolerance of uncertainty, and environmental satisfaction.

Serotypes 5 and 19A were almost exclusively identified in the children with RSV and alveolar CAP, although the difference was statistically significant only for serotype 19A (P=0.03). Eighty-three of the 134 RV-positive children (61.9%) were colonized with S. pneumoniae and again mean bacterial load was significantly higher in the patients with alveolar involvement (4.211.37 log10 DNA copies/mL vs. 3.411.47 log10 DNA copies/mL; P=0.03). Serotypes 1, 5 and 19A were more frequently identified in the children with RV and alveolar CAP, although the difference was statistically significant only for serotype 5 (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS In children with alveolar CAP and RSV or RV infection, the determination of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal bacterial load and identification of the serotypes can contribute to the diagnosis of mixed lung infection.","output":"Pneumococcal bacterial load colonization as a marker of mixed infection in children with alveolar community-acquired pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current two-stage study focused on work integration and quality of life of patients in an acute psychiatric day care unit. There is evidence that a longer absence from work due to illness negatively affects job retention, life satisfaction and clinical prognosis. Furthermore, there are individual supportive methods that proved to be effective in work integration. We therefore developed a specific group program Fit for Work and Life (FWL) for patients in an acute psychiatric day care unit focusing on work integration in the first labor market (in contrast to work in institutions for people with disabilities/second labor market). METHODS: Between 2018 and 2020, 62 patients (intervention group; IG) were enrolled in an 8?week prospective job integration program and compared to 74 patients (control group; CG) who received treatment as usual (partly retrospective survey). Patients of both groups held a job when entering treatment. Main outcome was defined as their working status 4 weeks after the end of treatment as well as self-reported life satisfaction. RESULTS: At the end of treatment (i.e. the week prior to discharge), the IG participants reported higher overall life satisfaction as well as higher health-, self- and living condition-related satisfaction than controls. Functional and clinical improvement during treatment was linked to subsequently returning to work. Functional improvement was further linked to higher life satisfaction. Mediational analysis revealed an indirect path from functional improvement on life satisfaction via working status, i.e. the higher functional improvement during treatment, the higher the chance of successfully returning to work, which in turn increased life satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that programs such as FWL are useful interventions for employed patients to improve reintegration into work and life and to help to increase life satisfaction.","output":"Fit for Work and Lifean eight-week program for improvement of functionality and quality of life: A two-stage study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 has brought a serious global public health threats especially for most of the cities across the world even in India more than 50 % of the total cases were reported from large ten cities.

Each viral genome is accompanied by a set of metadata which supplies important information such as the geographic origin of the sample, age of the host, and the lab at which the sample was sequenced, and is integral to epidemiological efforts and public health direction. Here, we interrogate some shortcomings of metadata within the GISAID database to raise awareness of common errors and inconsistencies that may affect data-driven analyses and provide possible avenues for resolutions. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a startling prevalence of spelling errors and inconsistent naming conventions, which together occur in an estimated ~ 9.8% and ~ 11.6% of \\"originating lab\\" and \\"submitting lab\\" GISAID metadata entries respectively. We also find numerous ambiguous entries which provide very little information about the actual source of a sample and could easily associate with multiple sources worldwide.

A seemingly opposite housing condition, social isolation (SI), is used as a rodent model of stress, negatively affecting several neurobiological mechanisms and hampering cognitive performance. Experimental designs that involve switching between these housing conditions produced mixed results. We evaluated different behavioral and cognitive effects of brief EE following long-term, SI-induced stress. We revealed the influence of enrichment after 30 days of isolation on behavioral despair, anxiety-like behavior, and spatial working memory in adult male Wistar rats and found a substantial anxiolytic effect in the experimental (SI to EE) group. Interestingly, rats exposed to EE also showed increased behavioral despair compared with the control (continuous SI) group. There was no difference in spatial working memory performance at the end of a 5-day water Y-maze (WYM) test. However, the SI to EE animals displayed better memory performance in the first 2 days of the WYM, indicating faster learning. In line with this difference, we recorded significantly more c-Fos-immunopositive (c-Fos+) cells in the retrosplenial and perirhinal cortices of the SI to EE animals. The lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala showed no such difference.

Inguinal endometriosis is uncommon, affecting only 0.6% of all patients with endometriosis. We present a case of inguinal endometriosis with a disappearing mass preoperatively. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 44-year-old woman presented with a palpable mass and pain in her left inguinal region. Computed tomography showed a 20-mm mass near the pubic tubercle. After 2 months of observation, the mass became impalpable and could not be confirmed by computed tomography; however, the inguinal pain did not improve regardless of menstrual cycles. Resection of the inguinal mass and the entire extraperitoneal portion of the uterine round ligament was performed. Histopathological examination revealed endometrial glands and stroma with CD10-positive cells, which confirmed inguinal endometriosis diagnosis. Erythrophagocytic macrophages indicated endometriosis-related hematoma absorption. Her symptoms disappeared after surgery, and no postoperative complications occurred. DISCUSSION: For treating inguinal endometriosis, the complete removal of the mass and the entire extraperitoneal portion of the round ligament by an anterior approach is necessary to prevent postoperative residual symptoms and recurrence. However, the preoperative diagnosis of inguinal endometriosis remains a challenge and is frequently discovered incidentally by intraoperative findings and pathological examination. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should have a high suspicion of inguinal endometriosis and improved diagnostic precision to select the appropriate surgical approach. Regardless of menstrual variability, the feature of a decreased mass size caused by endometriosis-related hematoma absorption can serve as a preoperative diagnostic clue.","output":"Inguinal endometriosis with a disappearing mass preoperatively: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Handy and disposable point-of-care diagnostics facilitate the early screening of severe diseases in resource-limited areas. To address urgent needs in inconvenient sites, a simple colorimetric diagnostic device equipped with a capillary tube with porous hydrogel and immunocomplex particles was developed for the rapid detection of biomarkers (16 min). In this device, probe particles attach to capture particles (dp = 40 m) and form sandwiched immunocomplexes in the presence of target biomarkers, and a red color progressively emerges when the sandwiched immunocomplex particles are blocked by the porous hydrogel embedded inside the glass capillary. Colorimetric aggregation was recorded using a smartphone and analyzed with imaging software. The limit of detection reached 1 ng/mL and showed a maximum of 79% accuracy compared with that obtained through a conventional spectrophotometric technique. The level of a diabetic retinopathy (DR) biomarker, lipocalin-1 (LCN-1), was measured in 1 L of a human tear sample and used in testing the practicability of the proposed device. All healthy subjects showed lower intensity levels than the other diabetic counterparts (proliferative DR or nonproliferative DR patients), implying the potential of this device in clinical applications. Overall, the diagnostic device facilitates point-of-care-testing and provides a low-cost (~1 USD), compact, and reliable tool for early diagnosis in resource-limited areas.","output":"Colorimetric Diagnostic Capillary Enabled by Size Sieving in a Porous Hydrogel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by pathogenic and highly transmissible Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is a single stranded RNA virus. It rapidly emerged from an epidemic to a global pandemic form spreading in alarming levels. The pathogenesis involving spike protein which is present on the viral surface, plays a key role in host attachment and penetration. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly affects respiratory system, but may involve other systems including haematopoietic system and homeostasis. Aim of the review article is to discuss spectrum of haematological changes in the blood counts, coagulation, peripheral blood and bone marrow in COVID-19 for complete understanding the disease process, the knowledge of which is helpful in early diagnosis and management of these patients. An extensive immune profiling of B and T cell population with analysis of spectrum of immune changes during the period of infection were also discussed. In COVID-19, changes in laboratory parameters and hematologic abnormalities have been reported and its association with early diagnosis, disease prognosis and severity has been repeatedly discussed in the literature. Changes in laboratory investigations help in risk stratification and early intervention. The most common laboratory finding in COVID-19 is lymphopenia. COVID-19 patients presented with coagulopathy is at high risk of morbidity and mortality. In severe COVID-19 patients, bone marrow aspirate shows histiocytic proliferation with hemophagocytosis. To understand the correlations between immune responses and severity of COVID-19, immune profiling of B and T cell population was compared with extensive clinical data. A deep understanding of the laboratory findings and haematological abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection would help to raise disease suspicion in absence of Real time polymerase chain reaction or antibody results.

However, human and animal studies indicate that the majority of gut viruses infect villous enterocytes, Viruses appear to have different affinities for enterocytes at different sites on the villus. Infection of enterocytes leads to cell death, extrusion into the lumen, and villous atrophy when the rate of cell production in the crypts cannot keep pace with the rate of enterocyte loss. This results in a reduced surface area as well as impairment of digestive and absorptive functions. This may also result in a net secretory state. All these changes, along with others such as reduced enzymatic activity and reduced epithelial integrity, may contribute to the induction of an acute but transient malabsorptive diarrhoea which may persist until the digestive/absorptive functions of the enterocyte are restored. However, if colonic compensation is sufficient to handle the increased fluid load, diarrhoea may not be evident. The roles of villous ischaemia, altered countercurrent exchanger or altered immune responses still remain uncertain and require further investigation.","output":"Pathogenesis of gut virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper employs regression with ARIMA errors (RegARIMA) to quantify the impacts of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions, daily new cases, seasonal and calendar effects, and other factors on activity trends across the timeline of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The discussion focuses on two controversial policy sets imposed by the Japanese government that aim to contain the pandemic and to stimulate the recovery of the economy. The containing effect was achieved by stay-at-home requests and declaring a State of Emergency in the combat against the first waves of infectious cases. After observing reduced cases, Go-to-travel and Go-to-eat campaigns were launched in July 2020 to encourage recreational travel and to revive the economy. To better understand the impact of the policies we utilize Google trends which measure how much these policies are looked up online. We suggest this reflects how much they are part of the public discussion. A case study is conducted in Kyoto, a city famous for tourism. The proposed RegARIMA model is compared with linear regression and time series models. The outperformances in measuring the magnitude of intervention impacts and forecasting the future trends are confirmed by using a total of twelve activity and mobility indices as the dependent variable.

In phase 1, 60 participants received two intramuscular injection of the vaccine following dose-escalation procedure. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and laboratory tests to evaluate the vaccine safety. In phase 2, 560 healthy adults received either vaccine doses similar in phase 1 (25 or 50 or 75 mcg S antigen in 05 mg aluminium per dose) or adjuvant (05 mg aluminium) in a ratio of 2:2:2:1. One primary outcome was the vaccine safety, including solicited adverse events for 7 day and unsolicited adverse events for 28 days after each injection as well as serious adverse event or adverse events of special interest throughout the study period. Another primary outcome was anti-S IgG antibody response (Index unit/ml). Secondary outcomes were surrogate virus neutralisation (inhibition percentage), wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation (dilution fold), and T-cell responses by intracellular staining for interferon gamma (IFNg). Anti-S IgG and neutralising antibody levels were compared with convalescent serum samples from symptomatic Covid-19 patients. FINDINGS: For phase 1 study, no serious adverse events were observed for all 60 participants. Most adverse events were grade 1 and disappeared shortly after injection. For phase 2 study, after randomisation, 480 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with adjuvant, and 80 participants were assigned to receive the placebo (adjuvant only). Reactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants and of short duration (mean 3 days). Unsolicited adverse events were mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to Nanocovax. Regarding the immunogenicity, Nanocovax induced robust anti-S antibody responses. In general, there humoral responses were similar among vaccine groups which reached their peaks at day 42 and declined afterward. At day 42, IgG levels of vaccine groups were 6048 [CI95%: 5112C7155], 4911 [4126C5846], 5718 [484-675] compared to 710 [632-1392] of convalescent samples.

Our results supported that right-wing individuals tended to have higher hesitancy associated with taking the COVID-19 vaccine. However, we demonstrated that this association, in part, can be explained by a corresponding belief in COVID-19 related conspiracies. Further, this association only emerged when associated with a general distrust in science.

We planned this study to evaluate efficacy and safety of dual SOF/DCV as add-on treatment to the standard of care (SOC) in patients with COVID-19, initially hospitalized to a non-intensive care setting.METHODS: Eighty nine consecutive eligible patients presenting to a single center in Cairo were included in the study and randomly assigned to two treatment groups. The experimental group was treated with the SOC therapy (as per the Egyptian ministry of health protocol) in addition to one 400 mg tablet SOF and one 60 mg DCV daily for 10 days;while the control group was treated with the SOC therapy alone. Baseline clinical, laboratory and imaging data were measured and followed up for 21 days. Data were compared between the two treatment groups.FINDINGS: The proportion of cumulative clinical recovery in the experimental group at day 21 was numerically greater than the control group (40/44 (91%;CI: 78.8-96.4%) versus 35/45 (77.8%;63.7-87.5%)). The Hazard Ratio (HR) for time to clinical recovery adjusted for baseline severity by a Cox-regression model was statistically significant: HR: 1.59 (CI: 1.001-2.5), signifying nearly 1.6 times higher probability of clinical recovery in the experimental group than the control at any time point during the study. Concordantly, the experimental group also showed trends to greater numerical improvement in other efficacy endpoints including the mean 8 points ordinal scale score, the mean severity of lung lesions score and the case fatality rate (4.5% versus 11.1%) than the control group. All these effects, though did not reach statistical significance at the study sample size, but being all concordant with the HR, they support the study concept. No serious or severe adverse events were reported in both groups and the treatment was well tolerated.INTERPRETATION: This study provides support to the potential benefits and safety of sofosbuvir combined with daclatasvir in the treatment of COVID-19. It is hoped to encourage further large sized multinational studies to confirm these encouraging results.Trial Registration: The study protocol was registered in the German clinical trial database repository (DRKS00022203) before the study initiation.Funding Statement: This study was funded by Pharco Corporate.Declaration of Interests: SH and OE are employees of Pharco, SH holds stock in Pharco.

Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a glycolipid-anchored protein on the cell surface, is controlled by many factors in tumorigenesis and is expressed in many tumor tissues. In this review, we summarize the regulatory effects of the uPAR signaling pathway on processes and factors related to tumor progression, such as tumor cell proliferation, adhesion, metastasis, glycolysis, tumor microenvironment and angiogenesis. Overall, the evidence accumulated to date suggests that uPAR induction by tumor progression may be one of the most important factors affecting therapeutic efficacy. An improved understanding of the interactions between uPAR and its coreceptors in cancer will provide critical biomolecular information that may help to better predict the disease course and response to therapy.","output":"uPAR: An Essential Factor for Tumor Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV S protein requires proteolytic cleavage by elastase, cathepsin or TMPRSS2 for S-mediated cell-cell or virus-cell membrane fusion. Activation of viral glycoprotein (GP) by protease also has been reported for influenza virus. The most distinctive difference between influenza virus and SARS-CoV is the stage during virus replication in which viral glycoproteins are cleaved by proteases. In influenza virus, the protease makes a simple cut in the GP during maturation. In contrast, SARS-CoV S protein is cleaved by the protease following receptor-induced conformational changes. The protease cleavage site in S protein is thought to be exposed only after receptor binding. In support of this model, we reported that the S protein of mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (MHV-2), which is highly similar to the S protein of SARS-CoV, requires two-step conformational changes mediated by sequential receptor binding and proteolysis to be activated for membrane fusion. Such a mechanism allows for tight temporal control over fusion by protecting the activating cleavage site from premature proteolysis yet allowing efficient cleavage upon binding to the receptor on target cells.","output":"[Protease-dependent cell entry mechanism of coronaviruses]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus originally from Wuhan, China.

Educational leaders have tried to manage the new situation, but the human infrastructure was not ready for such an event. This study aims to explain the challenges and opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic for medical education. METHOD: This qualitative study used conventional content analysis to collect data from face-to-face and semi-structured interviews. The interviews continued until data saturation was reached. The participants were 12 students and 14 faculty members at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. To ensure data rigor, we used member checks, peer checks and an external observer. RESULTS: Three main categories and 15 subcategories were extracted. The findings showed that four subcategories, e.g. perception on feasibility of e-learning, standardizing of e-learning, dedicated teaching, and networking and interdisciplinary collaborations, affected the development of medical e-learning. The main opportunities from the COVID-19 pandemic for medical education were classified into five subcategories: attitudes to e-learning and adaptability, preventing students' separation from the educational environment, documentation and monitoring education, take control of own learning, and increasing perceived usefulness. The main challenges were divided into four subcategories, e.g. noncompliance with virtual classroom etiquette, inadequate interactions, time limitations, and infrastructure defects and problems. Finally, participants believed that methods of evaluation in e-learning were more suitable for diagnosis and formative evaluations. Generally, two subcategories were extracted, e.g. formative and summative. CONCLUSION: Medical schools have necessarily moved towards e-learning to compensate for the interruption in classroom education, such that traditional classes have been replaced with e-learning. These rapid, extensive changes in teaching and learning approaches have consequences for medical schools.","output":"Challenges and opportunities from the COVID-19 pandemic in medical education: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite their importance in lung health and disease, it remains unknown how human alveolar macrophages develop early in life.

Using PubMed and Cochrane databases, we reviewed studies from April 5th, 2010 to April 5th, 2020 that included the search terms patient satisfaction and teledermatology. All studies that included patient satisfaction as an outcome were included, but studies not published in English were excluded. We examined domains of satisfaction, survey method, study characteristics (including patient population, country, age, study design and evidence score), findings and statistical comparisons. We thoroughly reviewed 23 studies. Definitions of satisfaction varied, but all concluded patients were satisfied with the live-interactive and store-and-forward modalities. The studies reveal that store-and-forward is appropriate for clinicians with established patients who require regular follow-up. Verified areas of care include treatment of chronic conditions, topical skin cancer therapy, wound monitoring, and post-procedural follow-up. Only four studies conducted statistical analyses. One of those studies compared patient preference for each modality of teledermatology with face-to-face dermatology. While this study reported high satisfaction with each mode of teledermatology, patients still preferred face-to-face. Favorable responses to remote diagnostic capabilities suggest that these offerings improve preference for teledermatology.

METHODS We included 10,861 patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to the Northwell Health system hospitals during the period of March 1 to April 27, 2020. BMI was classified as: underweight, normal, overweight, obesity class I, II, and III. Primary outcomes are invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. RESULTS There were 243 (2.2%) underweight, 2,507 (23.1%) normal weight, 4,021 (37.0%) overweight, 2,345 (21.6%) obesity class I, 990 (9.1%) obesity class II, and 755 (7.0%) obesity class III patients. Patients who are overweight (OR=1.27[95% CI, 1.11-1.46]), obesity class I (OR=1.48 [95% CI, 1.27-1.72]), obesity class II (OR=1.89[95% CI, 1.56-2.28]), and obesity class III (OR=2.31 [95% CI, 1.88-2.85]) had increased risk of requiring IMV. Underweight and obesity classes II and III were statistically associated with death (OR=1.44 [95% CI, 1.08-1.92]; OR=1.25 [95% CI 1.03-1.52]; OR=1.61 [95% CI 1.30-2.00], respectively).

CONCLUSION Patients who are underweight or with obesity are at a risk for mechanical ventilation and death, suggesting pulmonary complications (indicated by IMV) is a significant contributor for poor outcomes in COVID-19 infection.","output":"Body Mass Index as a Risk Factor for Clinical Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to the focused application of resources toward developing vaccines to prevent COVID-19. However, the efficacy and safety profiles of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are still unknown. We aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, seroreactivity, and disease flares after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in MAFLD patients.Methods: For this prospective observational study, we recruited patients receiving two doses SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac). Neutralizing antibody to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and IgG to SARS-COV-2 spike-specific were evaluated on Day 0, Day 28, Day 57, and Day 180. All participants with available data were included in the safety and immunogenicity, and disease flares analyses.Findings: 50 MAFLD patients and 50 healthy controls receiving a 0-28 interval vaccination procedure were enrolled. The seroconversion rates of neutralizing antibodies were 16% in MAFLD group (Log10 Geometric Mean Titers (GMT): median 0783, IQR: 0719-0971) and 32% in non-MAFLD group (0884, IQR: 0716-1027) on day 28, and 82% in MAFLD group (1206, IQR: 1053-1467), 90% of non-MAFLD group (1360, IQR: 1130-1464) on day 57, respectively. However, the neutralizing antibody titer in two groups fell below the seropositivity cut-off value on day 180 (MAFLD group 0.928, IQR: 0773-1057 vs. non-MAFLD group 0907, IQR: 0810-1009). There was no significant difference in the overall incidence of adverse reactions after two-dose vaccinations between two groups. Furthermore. disease flares were not found in MAFLD group after two-dose vaccinations. On multivariable analysis, NAFLD fibrosis score was negatively associated with seropositive of neutralizing antibody on 180 days (OR 003, 95% CI 0001-058, P = 0022).Interpretation: Two-dose regimen of CoronaVac vaccination in MAFLD patients was safe and well tolerated. MAFLD patients showed a robust immune response after SARS-COV-2 vaccination, which conferred 82% protection against COVID-19 and vaccination does not affect MAFLD disease status.Clinical Trial Registration Details: This trial had been registered in Chinese ClinicalTrials.gov (ChiCTR2100042717).Funding Information: Project of Key Medical Disciplines of Hangzhou, the Health and Science and Technology Planning Project of Hangzhou municipal Health Commission (No. A20210205).Declaration of Interests: JP Shi reports grants from Project of Key Medical Disciplines of Hangzhou for the Department of infectious & Hepatology.

METHODS An extensive comprehensive screening was conducted using electronic databases up to 3rd September 2020 after obtaining registration with PROSPERO (CRD420202064800). The observational studies or interventional studies in English, evaluating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with concurrent infections are included for the meta-analyses. RESULTS Our search retrieved 20 studies, with a total of 205,702 patients. Patients with Tuberculosis (RR =2.10, 95% CI: 1.75 to 2.51, I2 =0%), Influenza (RR =2.04, 95% CI: 0.15 to 28.25, I2 =99%) have an increased risk of mortality during a co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. No significant impact is found in people living with HIV (RR =0.99, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.19, I2 =30%), Chronic hepatitis (RR =1.15, 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.81, I2 =10%).

METHODS: This is an experimental study. PE through 2.2 and 2.8 mm incisions was performed in six goat eyes and four simulator eyes using both continuous and interrupted ultrasound (U/S). PPV and FL were performed in three goat eyes. Generation of visible fluid droplet spray was analyzed from video recordings through the microscope camera and an external digital camera. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) was applied over the incision site during PE and FL. RESULTS: When PE was performed through both incision sizes, there was no visible fluid droplet spray if the phaco tip was centered in the incision, without sleeve compression. When there was phaco tip movement with the phaco sleeve sandwiched between the tip and the incision wall, there was visible fluid droplet spray generation. It was more difficult to induce fluid droplet spray with 2.8 mm incision, and spray was lesser with interrupted U/S. During PPV, there was no droplet spray. During FL, fluid droplet spray was only seen when U/S was delivered with the fragmatome tip close to the sclerotomy. HPMC impeded droplet spray. CONCLUSION: Fluid droplet generation during PE can be minimized to a large extent by keeping the phaco tip centered within the incision, avoiding sleeve compression. Smaller incision and continuous U/S were more prone to droplet generation. FL should be performed away from sclerotomy.

Two days later, the RT-PCR test, blood analysis, and chest computed tomography (CT) were applied to the patient for being in contact with a COVID positive patient. Conjunctival swabs did not identify SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. However, nasopharyngeal swab and blood test confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT did not show pneumonia.

Food handlers in food and drink establishments are at high risk of exposure to the virus due to their many daily contacts with customers. Since there is a paucity of evidence about infection prevention practices and associated factors among this high-risk group in Ethiopia including in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town, this study was designed to address this gap. METHOD: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 food handlers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town food and drink establishments in July and August 2020. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected by trained data collectors using a pretested structured questionnaire and an on-the-spot observational checklist. Data were entered into EpiData version 4.6 and exported to STATA version 14.0 for data cleaning and analysis. Data were analyzed using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model at 95% confidence interval (CI). From the bivariable analysis, variables with a p-value <0.25 were retained into multivariable analysis. Finally, variables that had a p-value <0.05 were declared as factors significantly associated with good infection prevention practices of COVID-19 among food handlers. MAIN FINDINGS: The overall rate of good practice in infection prevention among food handlers was 43.9% (95% CI: 39.2C48.4%). Among the total 401 food handlers, 79.8% had good knowledge and 58.4% had a favorable attitude about COVID-19 infection prevention. Factors significantly associated with good COVID-19 infection prevention practices were: educational status of college or above (AOR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.32C3.75), food handling work experience greater than five years (AOR = 2.55; 95% CI: 1.43C5.77), availability of written guidelines within the food and drink establishment (AOR = 2.68; 95% CI: 1.52C4.75), and taking training about infection prevention (AOR = 3.26; 95% CI: 1.61C6.61). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that around one-third of food handlers had good infection prevention practices. Thus, to reduce COVID-19 transmission, integrated work is urgently needed to further improve food handlers good practices, knowledge and attitude about infection prevention through providing health education, training and by making written infection prevention guidelines available in food and drink establishments.","output":"COVID-19 infection prevention practices among a sample of food handlers of food and drink establishments in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater-based surveillance is a cost-effective concept for monitoring COVID-19 pandemics at a population level. Here, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was monitored from a total of 693 wastewater (WW) influent samples from 28 wastewater treatment plants (WWTP, N = 21-42 samples per WWTP) in Finland from August 2020 to May 2021, covering WW of ca. 3.3 million inhabitants ([~] 60% of the Finnish population). The relative quantity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in the 24h-composite samples was determined by using the ultrafiltration method followed by nucleic acid extraction and RT-qPCR assay targeted with N2-assay. SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals at each WWTP were compared over time to the numbers of new and confirmed COVID-19 cases in the sewer network area. Over the 10-month surveillance period, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WW was 79% (including 6% uncertain results), while only 24% of all samples exhibited gene copy (GC) numbers above the quantification limit. The range of the SARS-CoV-2 detection rate in WW varied from 33% (including 10% uncertain results) in Pietarsaari to 100% in Espoo. Only six out of 693 WW samples were positive with SARS-COV-2 RNA when the reported COVID-19 case number from the preceding 14 days was zero. Overall, the 14-day COVID-19 incidence was 7, 18 and 36 cases within the sewer network area when the probability to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples was 50%, 75% and 95%, respectively. The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 GC required significantly more COVID-19 cases: the quantification rate was 50%, 75% and 95% when the 14-day incidence was 110, 152 and 223 COVID-19 cases, respectively, per 100 000 persons. Multiple linear regression confirmed the relationship between the COVID-19 incidence and the SARS-CoV-2 GC quantified in WW at 15 out of 28 WWTPs (overall R2 = 0.36, p < 0.001). At four of the 13 WWTPs where a significant relationship was not found, the GC of SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained below the quantification limit during the whole study period. In the five other WWTPs, the sewer coverage was less than 80% of the total population in the area and thus the COVID-19 cases may have been inhabitants from the areas not covered. Based on the results obtained, WW-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 could be used as an indicator for local and national COVID-19 incidence trends. Importantly, the determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments from WW is a powerful and non-invasive public health surveillance measure, independent of possible changes in the clinical testing strategies or in the willingness of individuals to be tested for COVID-19.","output":"Detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater influent in relation to reported COVID-19 incidence in Finland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The closure of schools as a result of COVID-19 has been a critical global incident from which to rethink how education works in all our countries.

We designed a Likert-type online questionnaire to measure the frequency of teaching activities. It was answered by 1,403 teachers from Spain (734 primary and 669 secondary education teachers). The proposed activities varied depending on the learning promoted (reproductive or constructive), the learning outcomes (verbal, procedural, or attitudinal), the type of assessment to which the activities were directed, and the presence of cooperative activities. The major result of this study was that teachers used reproductive activities more frequently than constructive ones. We also found that most activities were those favoring verbal and attitudinal learning. The cooperative activities were the least frequent. Finally, through a cluster analysis, we identified four teaching profiles depending on the frequency and type of digital technologies use: Passive, Active, Reproductive, and Interpretative. The variable that produced the most consistent differences was previous digital technologies use These results show that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) uses are reproductive rather than constructive, which impedes effective digital technologies integration into the curriculum so that students gain 21st-century competencies.","output":"Teaching and Learning in Times of COVID-19: Uses of Digital Technologies During School Lockdowns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The quarantine period imposed to travelers in many countries due to COVID19 is a major obstacle for any traveler Lifting the quarantine period could lead to significant improvement in people's quality of life and any country's economy Bahrain have used two quarantine models from arriving passengers We report data about the incidence of COVID19 on arriving passengers at Bahrain International airport Infection rates were reported on arrival, during quarantine and after leaving quarantine Results showed that travelers had low incidence of COVID19 on arriving and during the quarantine period, while becoming at higher risk after leaving quarantine We concluded that quarantine requirement maybe lifted for arriving travelers Testing upon arrival with implementation of the public health preventative measures can minimize the risk of transmission","output":"Quarantining arriving travelers in the era of COVID-19: balancing the risk and benefits a learning experience from Bahrain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had serious adverse effects globally in 2020 which are foreseen to extend in 2021, as well.

The Sicilian Tourism Department in Italy is the projects lead beneficiary, with representative partners throughout six Mediterranean countries (Italy, Egypt, Spain, Jordan, Lebanon, Portugal). The case study in Portugal is being developed in Tavira, through the intangible cultural heritage of the Mediterranean diet. The research based on the cultural experience, the history of the landscape and the sense of identity and continuity of knowledge is reassigned into a digital platformthe creation of apps and, within this, the design of a virtual route that navigates key geographical places. These apps will later revolve around one of the cultural elements of the Mediterranean, namely, the olive oil activity, with a detailed presentation of the manufacturing process, as well as its didactic interpretation and dissemination about the protection and conservation of Mediterranean research. The methodological approach is developed through the analysis and interpretation of a detailed list of references, fieldwork in a plurality of sites, contextual inquiries and interviews. As a powerful tool for internet marketing and research, these apps will reinforce identity, hospitality and tourism enterprises connected through the virtual itinerary, allowing a closer interaction between tourists and locals, endorsing the rise of technological development, as well as to drastically reduce environmental and ecological risks.","output":"Digital Tourism: An Alternative View on Cultural Intangible Heritage and Sustainability in Tavira, Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine coronaviruses (BCoVs), which cause gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in cattle, and are genetically related to the human coronavirus HCoV-OC43, which is responsible for up to 10% of common colds, attract increased attention. We applied the method of photodynamic inactivation with cationic photosensitizers (PSs) to reduce the titers of BCoV and studied the morphological structure of viral particles under various modes of photodynamic exposure. The samples of virus containing liquid with an initial virus titer of 5 Log(10) TCID50/mL were incubated with methylene blue (MB) or octakis(cholinyl)zinc phthalocyanine (Zn-PcChol(8+)) at concentrations of 1C5 M for 10 min in the dark at room temperature. After incubation, samples were irradiated with LED (emission with maximum at 663 nm for MB or at 686 nm for Zn-PcChol(8+)) with light doses of 1.5 or 4 J/cm(2). Next, the irradiation titrated virus containing liquid was studied using negative staining transmission electron microscopy. MB and Zn-PcChol(8+) at concentrations of 1C5 M, in combination with red light from LED sources in the low doses of 1.5C4.0 J/cm(2), led to a decrease in BCoV titers by at least four orders of magnitude from the initial titer 5 Log(10) TCID50/mL. Morphological changes in photodamaged BCoVs with increasing PS concentrations were loss of spikes, change in shape, decreased size of virus particles, destruction of the envelope, and complete disintegration of viruses.

METHODS Forty participants were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. The experimental group did the VR exercises while smelling the lavender oil scents. The control group did the VR exercises without it. Both groups did the exercises in ten 45-min sessions. We assessed the participants with the timed up and go (TUG) test, Berg balance scale (BBS), fall efficacy scale - international (FES-I), and the 29-item multiple sclerosis impact scale (MSIS-29). We did the tests at the baseline and after the last exercise session.

However, little is known about the characteristics of those who are at elevated risk of being problematic users. Using data from the 2012 Current Population Survey Internet Use Supplement and Educational Supplement for teens and young adults, this study developed a conceptual framework for modeling technology use. A three-part categorization of use was posited for utilitarian, social and entertainment purposes, which fit observed data well in confirmatory factor analysis. Seemingly unrelated regression was used to examine the demographic characteristics associated with each of the three categories of use. Exploratory factor analysis uncovered five distinct types of users, including one user type that was hypothesized to likely be at elevated risk of problematic use. Regression results indicated that females in their twenties who are in school and have greater access to technology were most likely to fall into this higher-risk category. Young people who live with both parents were less likely to belong to this category. This study highlighted the importance of constructing models that facilitate identification of patterns of use that may characterize a subset of users at high risk of problematic use.

METHODS: The survey is composed of 25 questions. Some questions were adapted from the global rheumatology alliance COVID-19 survey for patients. RESULTS: 187 rheumatology staff members across Egypt from 18 universities and authorizations actively participated with a valid response. The mean time needed to complete the survey was 17.7  13 min. Participants were 159 (85%) females (F:M 5.7:1). One-third agreed that they will be vaccinated once available, 24.6% have already received at least one dose, 29.4% are unsure while 16% will not take it. Furthermore, 70.1% agreed that they will recommend it to the rheumatic diseases (RD) patients once available, 24.1% are not sure while 5.9% will not recommend it. RD priority to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in descending order include SLE (82.9%), RA (55.1%), vasculitis (51.3%), systemic sclerosis (39.6%), MCTD (31.6%), Behcet's disease (28.3%).

On the supply side, Bangladeshs supply of grain products has increased substantially, with an average annual growth rate of 1.99 million tons in 1998C2018. Domestic grain production, especially rice production, accounted for the largest proportion in its structure. However, under the constraints of resources and environment, imports and international aid were needed to ensure a stable and sustainable grain supply. On the demand side, Bangladeshs demand for grain products continued to grow at an average annual rate of 2.09 million tons and its structure was constantly diversified. In recent years, domestic grain production has fully met the grain demand for food use, but the overall grain supply dependence on foreign gradually increased. From the analysis of the influencing factors, the grain supply, especially the domestic production of rice and maize, had the greatest impact on the balance of grain supply-demand in Bangladesh. Moreover, multiple cropping index, chemical fertilizer application per hectare and irrigation rate were the three main factors affecting grain production. As a typical agricultural country, Bangladeshs grain security was faced with challenges, such as high population density, insufficient cultivated land resources, international grain trade and frequent natural disasters. It is suggested that its government should strengthen scientific and technological research, adjust agricultural structure, improve the efficient utilization of agricultural resources and grain circulation systems, and balance the grain demand between food use and indirect use, so as to achieve complete grain self-sufficiency and overall grain security.","output":"Grain security assessment in Bangladesh based on supply-demand balance analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a cancer that arises from the basal layer of the epidermis and is most often caused by exposure to UV radiation. Most BCCs are localized and can be fully treated by surgical removal or topical treatment. In the last decade, it has been found that the hedgehog pathway, a signaling pathway that regulates embryonic development, has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of BCC in adults. Therefore, two drugs that inhibit the hedgehog pathway have been developed. These drugs, indicated for metastatic or locally advanced BCC, may cause a rapid clinical and imaging response, but have an adverse reaction that includes muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia and fatigue, and often leads to drug discontinuation. Due to the high rates of treatment discontinuation, the possibility of administering the drug intermittently was examined and, indeed, a decrease in adverse reactions together with tumor response was observed. Additionally, it seems that patients who discontinue treatment may benefit from long-term remission. These cases indicate the possibility of changing the schedule of administration of the drug. We hereby report two cases of patients who were treated with radiation therapy for ringworm in their childhood and developed BCC. The patients were treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor with complete tumor regression. After treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions, no recurrence of the tumor was observed over a period of almost two years.","output":"[PROLONGED COMPLETE REMISSION AFTER A SHORT COURSE OF HEDGEHOG PATHWAY INHIBITORS IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED BASAL CELL CARCINOMA: AN ALTERNATIVE TO SURGERY?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In COVID-19, lung manifestations present as a slowly evolving pneumonia with insidious early onset interstitial pulmonary edema that undergoes acute exacerbation in the late stages and microvascular thrombosis.

Predicting both its prevalence and incidence throughout the world is crucial to help health professionals make key decisions. In this study, we aim to predict the incidence of COVID-19 within a two-week period to better manage the disease. METHODS: The COVID-19 datasets provided by Johns Hopkins University, contain information on COVID-19 cases in different geographic regions since January 22, 2020 and are updated daily. Data from 252 such regions were analyzed as of March 29, 2020, with 17,136 records and 4 variables, namely latitude, longitude, date, and records. In order to design the incidence pattern for each geographic region, the information was utilized on the region and its neighboring areas gathered 2 weeks prior to the designing. Then, a model was developed to predict the incidence rate for the coming 2 weeks via a Least-Square Boosting Classification algorithm. RESULTS: The model was presented for three groups based on the incidence rate: less than 200, between 200 and 1000, and above 1000. The mean absolute error of model evaluation were 4.71, 8.54, and 6.13%, respectively.

In our renal service we reduced HD frequency from thrice to twice-weekly in selected patients with the primary aim of reducing COVID 19 exposure and transmission between HD patients. Methods: Dialysis unit nephrologists identified 166 suitable patients (38.4% of our HD population) to temporarily convert to twice-weekly haemodialysis immediately prior to the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in our area. Changes in pre-dialysis weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and biochemistry were recorded weekly throughout the 4-week project. Hyperkalaemic patients (serum potassium > 6.0mmol/L) were treated with a potassium binder, sodium bicarbonate and received responsive dietary advice. Results: There were 12 deaths (5 due to COVID-19) in the HD population, 6 of which were in the twice weekly HD group;no deaths were definitively associated with change of dialysis protocol. A further 19 patients were either hospitalised and/or developed COVID-19 and thus transferred back to thrice weekly dialysis as per protocol. 113 (68.1%) were still receiving twice-weekly HD by the end of the 4-week project. Indications for transfer back to thrice weekly were;fluid overload (19), persistent hyperkalaemia (4), patient request (4) and compliance (1). There were statistically significant increases in SBP and pre-dialysis potassium during the project. Conclusions: Short term conversion of a large but selected HD population to twice-weekly dialysis sessions was possible and safe. This approach could help mitigate COVID-19 transmission amongst dialysis patients in centres with similar organisational pressures.","output":"Safely reducing haemodialysis frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]similar to other disasters, this pandemic has seen a rise in spontaneous volunteers or volunteers who take initiative to help vulnerable members of their communities with transportation and delivering supplies, well-being checks, call center support, or administration and computing tasks (Butler, 2020).

Patients may be frail, acutely unwell, or have terminal illnesses such as dementia. It is therefore essential that clinicians review resuscitation status as part of their routine practice. However, we are aware that advanced decision-making C to resuscitate or not to resuscitate C is not routine practice across older adult psychiatric wards in the UK. Our 2017 audit reflected this, demonstrating a very low rate of resuscitation decisions at NELFT. This re-audit aimed to measure the frequency and quality of resuscitation decisions on an older adult psychiatric ward. We expected improvements in these areas, subsequent to changes implemented from the initial audit. We also sought to identify which patient factors influenced clinicians decision-making on resuscitation. Please note, this audit was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Method In June 2017, an audit of 25 patients admitted to two older adult psychiatric acute wards was completed. In December 2019, a retrospective analysis of the last 25 admissions to one older adult ward was undertaken. Electronic patient notes and DNACPR (Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) orders were examined. The audit measured frequency of resuscitation decisions and quality of documentation against current standards. DNACPR orders were analysed and clinicians were interviewed to identify the reasons for such decisions. Result There was an increase in the number of patients for which resuscitation decisions were made, from 4% in 2017 to 40% (n = 10) in 2019. The majority of patients with a DNACPR decision (n = 8) had a diagnosis of dementia. Prospective quality of life, with this diagnosis, was the most frequent determinant of DNACPR decisions (n = 7). Qualitative analysis indicated that clinicians were more likely to consider a resuscitation decision for patients with an organic disorder rather than functional disorder. Adequate completion of DNACPR orders was seen in each case. Either the patient, a family member or carer was involved in every decision. The standard for recording decisions on the electronic patient record was not met. Conclusion It is good practice to consider resuscitation decisions for patients admitted to older adult psychiatric wards. This re-audit found an improvement in frequency of resuscitation decisions and also revealed differences in decision-making for patients with organic and functional disorders. Implementation of further change is indicated;decision-making can be improved through reflection, teaching, changes to practice, and technologies.","output":"To resuscitate or not to resuscitate;a question for old age psychiatrists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human geography has experienced a burgeoning interest in care Despite this, the more radical potentials of thinking with, and through, care remain largely unexplored In this paper, we critically examine one such potential, asking how care might facilitate a substantial rethinking of practices of research and analysis within human geography We argue that care does not simply name practices of social reproduction or emotional attachment, but is a distinct mode of ethics, both visible in the social world and capable of informing academic practice We ask what it means to recognise everyday accounts as acts of care, and to analyse these same accounts through an ethic of care where knowledge, action, relating to others, and the shaping of ethical commitment are inextricably intertwined While, typically, everyday accounts are seen as about some sort of underlying meaning or dynamic, we suggest that such accounts need to be understood as parts of efforts to navigate and re-make social worlds We unfold our argument by first tracing how care has been understood and analysed within human geography as a shifting and situated social practice Building on, but moving beyond, such approaches, we examine social worlds as ?matters of care?, where everyday understandings, and the potential for action and ethical commitment are not only continually negotiated, but are staunchly kept open to new possibilities Through the close reading of extracts from in-depth interviews with first-time parents in the city of Oxford, UK, we illustrate how care offers a committed practice of knowing and relating within research We argue this approach provides new ways of thinking about geographical research, where primary research, analysis and scholarly narratives are all implicated in the remaking of everyday worlds which, in turn, reveal a new terrain of political potentiality","output":"Accounting for care within human geography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this scoping review was to ascertain how 'telehealth' is utilised within health care, from pre hospital to admission, discharge and post discharge, with patients who have suffered major trauma. METHODS: A scoping review of the literature published in English since 1980 was conducted using MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Austhealth, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Cochrane library) and Web of Science MEDLINE and MEBASE to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: We included 77 eligible studies with both randomised controlled trial and cohort design methodology. A variety of trauma was included such as traumatic brain injuries (n = 52; 67.5%), spinal cord injury (n = 14; 18.2%) and multi-trauma (n = 9; 11.7%) to both adult (n = 38) and paediatric (n = 32) participants. Telehealth is used in pre-hospital and acute-care settings (n = 11; 14.3%) to facilitate assessment, and in rehabilitation and follow-up (n = 61; 79.2%) to deliver therapy. Effects on health were reported the most (n = 46), with no negative outcomes. The feasibility of telehealth as a delivery mode was established, but coordination and technical issues are barriers to use. Overall, both patients and clinicians were satisfied using this mode of delivery. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates how telehealth is utilised across a spectrum of patients with traumatic injuries and to facilitate delivery of therapy, specialist consultations and assessments, with many studies reporting improvements to health. There is a paucity of high-quality rigorous research, which makes replication of findings and uptake of the intervention problematic. Future telehealth and trauma research should focus on the quality and reproducibility of telehealth interventions and the economic feasibility of using this platform to deliver trauma care.","output":"Telehealth in trauma: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a new pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

MCPyV is ubiquitous in humans. After an early-age primary infection, MCPyV establishes a clinically asymptomatic lifelong infection. In immunocompromised patients/individuals, including elders, MCC can arise following an increase in MCPyV replication events. Elders are prone to develop immunesenescence and therefore represent an important group to investigate. In addition, detailed information on MCPyV serology in elders has been debated. These findings cumulatively indicate the need for new research verifying the impact of MCPyV infection in elderly subjects (ES). Herein, sera from 226 ES, aged 66C100 years, were analyzed for anti-MCPyV IgGs with an indirect ELISA using peptides mimicking epitopes from the MCPyV capsid proteins VP1-2. Immunological data from sera belonging to a cohort of healthy subjects (HS) (n = 548) aged 18C65 years, reported in our previous study, were also included for comparisons. Age-/gender-specific seroprevalence and serological profiles were investigated. MCPyV seroprevalence in ES was 63.7% (144/226). Age-specific MCPyV seroprevalence resulted as 62.5% (25/40), 71.7% (33/46), 64.9% (37/57), 63.8% (30/47), and 52.8% (19/36) in ES aged 66C70, 71C75, 76C80, 81C85, and 86C100 years, respectively (p > 0.05). MCPyV seroprevalence was 67% (71/106) and 61% (73/120) in ES males and females, respectively (p > 0.05). Lack of age-/gender-related variations in terms of MCPyV serological profiles was found in ES (p > 0.05). Notably, serological profile analyses indicated lower optical densities (ODs) in ES compared with HS (p < 0.05), while lower ODs were also determined in ES males compared with HS males (p < 0.05). Our data cumulatively suggest that oncogenic MCPyV circulates in elders asymptomatically at a relatively high prevalence, while immunesenescence might be responsible for a decreased IgG antibody response to MCPyV, thereby potentially leading to an increase in MCPyV replication levels. In the worse scenario, alongside other factors, MCPyV might drive MCC carcinogenesis, as described in elders with over 60 years of age.","output":"Decreased IgG Antibody Response to Viral Protein Mimotopes of Oncogenic Merkel Cell Polyomavirus in Sera From Healthy Elderly Subjects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La recherche est une comparaison des valuations externes des dpartements fran?ais, ralises par les Chambres Rgionales des Comptes, les agences de notation et les cabinets daudit (avant la crise sanitaire de la Covid-19).

SUBJECTS/METHODS: Chronic LHON, 11778 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation, patients (26 eyes; mean age: 35.1  16.1 years) were prospectively recruited at Doheny Eye Center, University of California Los Angeles from March 2016 to July 2017. Age-matched healthy controls (27 eyes; mean age: 32.4  11.1 years) were enroled for comparison. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) imaging was performed in chronic LHON patients and compared with age-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: The macular choroid was significantly thinner in chronic LHON (250.5  62.2 m) compared with controls (313.9  60.2 m; p < 0.0001). The peripapillary choroid was also significantly thinner in chronic LHON (135.7  51.4 m) compared with controls (183.0  61.8 m, p < 0.001). Choroidal thickness strongly correlated with retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness in both the macular (R(2) = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57C0.84) and peripapillary regions (R(2) = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31C0.70).

We retrospectively analyzed patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted from February 10, 2020 to April 5, 2020. First, all patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort or a validation cohort. By univariate analysis of the training cohort, we developed combination scores and screened the superior score for predicting the prognosis. Subsequently, we identified the independent factors influencing prognosis. Finally, we demonstrated the predictive efficiency of the score in validation cohort. A total of 145 patients were enrolled. In the training cohort, nonsurvivors had higher levels of lactic dehydrogenase than survivors. Among the 7 combination scores that were developed, lactic dehydrogenase-lymphocyte ratio (LLR) had the highest area under the curve (AUC) value for predicting prognosis, and it was associated with the incidence of liver injury, renal injury, and higher disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score on admission. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that C-reactive protein, DIC score 2 and LLR >345 were the factors associated with prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that only LLR >345 was an independent risk factor for prognosis (odds ratio [OR] = 9.176, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.674C31.487, P < .001).

The traditional view of these RNA elements are as local structures present in non-coding regions. However, this view is changing due to the discovery of regulatory elements in coding regions and functional long-range intra-genomic base pairing interactions. The 4.8 kb long RNA genome of the tombusvirus tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) contains these types of structural features, including six different functional long-distance interactions. We hypothesized that to achieve these multiple interactions this viral genome must utilize a large-scale organizational strategy and, accordingly, we sought to assess the global conformation of the entire TBSV genome. Atomic force micrographs of the genome indicated a mostly condensed structure composed of interconnected protrusions extending from a central hub. This configuration was consistent with the genomic secondary structure model generated using high-throughput selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension (i.e. SHAPE), which predicted different sized RNA domains originating from a central region. Known RNA elements were identified in both domain and inter-domain regions, and novel structural features were predicted and functionally confirmed. Interestingly, only two of the six long-range interactions known to form were present in the structural model. However, for those interactions that did not form, complementary partner sequences were positioned relatively close to each other in the structure, suggesting that the secondary structure level of viral genome structure could provide a basic scaffold for the formation of different long-range interactions.

Care partners of people with dementia are more likely to have depression, anxiety, and be isolated, heightened by events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Connecting individuals to research has been challenging, especially in diverse populations who are disproportionately impacted by ADRD and health and socioeconomic inequities. The Memory Advocate Peers (MAP) Program aims to address these challenges by building and piloting a sustainable, replicable, volunteer peer mentor program to support individuals newly diagnosed with dementia and their care partners, and help to connect them to services. METHOD: The MAP program has been developed and is led by people living with dementia, care partners, community-based experts in dementia care, and healthcare leaders. The program will give people with dementia and care partners the opportunity to share experiences with a volunteer advocate who has lived experience with dementia, obtain valuable education about how to live well with dementia, connect to community services, and access clinical trials or other research opportunities. Partnerships have been established with New York University-affiliated neurologists to identify and refer newly diagnosed patients to the program, and with the leading local research programs. RESULT: MAP will recruit and train up to 25 advocates to provide twelve months of post-diagnostic support to 50 clients and care partners (where applicable), with a focus on under-represented communities. A research study is embedded within the program to evaluate feasibility, as well as participant quality of life, health resource use, impact on psychological wellbeing, and value of research participation. CONCLUSION: This pilot will be critical in understanding the impact peer-to-peer mentorship can have for both the individual with ADRD and the care partner.

Despite decades of study, the behavior of the pulmonary surfactant at the molecular scale is poorly understood, which hinders the development of effective surfactant replacement therapies, useful in the treatment of several lung-related diseases. In this work, we combined all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, Langmuir trough measurements, and AFM imaging to study synthetic four-component lipid monolayers designed to model protein-free pulmonary surfactant. We characterized the structural and dynamic properties of the monolayers with a special focus on lateral heterogeneity. Remarkably, simulations reproduce almost quantitatively the experimental data on pressure-area isotherms and the presence of lateral heterogeneities highlighted by AFM. Quite surprisingly, the pressure-area isotherms do not show a plateau region, despite the presence of liquid-condensed nanometer-sized domains at surface pressures larger than 20 mN/m. In the simulations, the liquid-condensed domains were small and transient, but they did not coalesce to yield a separate phase. They were only slightly enriched in DPPC and cholesterol, and their chemical composition remained very similar to the overall composition of the monolayer membrane. Instead, they differed from liquid-expanded regions in terms of membrane thickness (in agreement with AFM data), diffusion rates, as well as acyl chain packing and orientation. We hypothesize that such lateral heterogeneities are crucial for lung surfactant function, as they allow both efficient packing, to achieve low surface tension, and sufficient fluidity, critical for rapid adsorption to the airCliquid interface during the breathing cycle.","output":"Understanding the Functional Properties of Lipid Heterogeneity in Pulmonary Surfactant Monolayers at the Atomistic Level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with cancer demonstrate particularly poor outcomes from COVID-19.

In some tumor types, especially in gastrointestinal cancers, expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is highly correlated. Furthermore, we found infiltration with T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration to be particularly pronounced in ACE2-high tumors.

Objective: we aimed to assess STD in healthcare professionals (HCP), mainly allergists, affected with COVID-19, by means of a survey, and to evaluate the association of STD and their severity with demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, and hospital admission. METHODS: A 15-item questionnaire was designed including different sections as follows: demographics, diagnostic characteristics, STD patterns, medication use as well as comorbidities. The questionnaire was developed using Google forms, implemented and distributed to members of the Spanish Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (SEAIC) and spread via Social Media to be completed by HCP affected with COVID-19. RESULTS: HCP (n=234), 76.5% &#8804;55 yrs, 73.5% female, completed the survey. There was STD in up to 74.4% of the respondents, 95.6% reporting a moderate-severe impairment. Mean recovery time of taste dysfunction was 21.624.0 days in HCP &#8804;55 yrs and 33.6126.2 days in >55 yrs (p=0.019). Stratified analysis by severity of STD showed that more than a half of COVID-19 subjects presented severe loss of smell. An older age (>55 yrs) was associated with fever, anorexia, less headache and with a longer persistence of taste dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: STD is a common symptom in COVID-19, even as a unique or preceding symptom. HCP who declared smell dysfunction (SD) were younger than those not affected with STD.

Patients with primary or secondary antibody deficiency are at increased risk of persistent infection. This challenging clinical scenario is associated with adverse patient outcome and potentially creates an ecological niche for the evolution of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune evasion capacity. Case reports and/or series have implied a therapeutic role for passive immunisation with convalescent plasma (CP) to secure virological clearance, although concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of CP and its potential to drive viral evolution, and it has largely been withdrawn from clinical use in the UK. Case presentation: We report two cases in which persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared following administration of the monoclonal antibody combination casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2, Ronapreve). A 55-year-old male with follicular lymphoma, treated with B cell depleting therapy, developed SARS-CoV-2 infection in September 2020 which then persisted for over 200 days. He was hospitalised on four occasions with COVID-19 and suffered debilitating fatigue and malaise throughout. There was no clinical response to antiviral therapy with remdesivir or CP, and SARS-CoV-2 was consistently detected in nasopharyngeal swabs. Intrahost evolution of several spike variants of uncertain significance was identified by viral sequence analysis. Delivery of REGN-COV2, in combination with remdesivir, was associated with clinical improvement and viral clearance within 6 days, which was sustained for over 150 days despite immunotherapy for relapsed follicular lymphoma. The second case, a 68-year-old female with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia on ibrutinib, also developed persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite a lack of response to remdesivir, infection promptly cleared following REGN-COV2 in combination with remdesivir, accompanied by resolution of inflammation and full clinical recovery that has been maintained for over 290 days. Conclusions These cases highlight the potential benefit of REGN-COV2 as therapy for persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection in antibody deficient individuals, including after failure of CP treatment. Formal clinical studies are warranted to assess the effectiveness of REGN-COV2 in antibody-deficient patients.","output":"Persistent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Patients With Secondary Antibody Deficiency: Successful Clearance Following Combination Casirivimab and Imdevimab (REGN-COV2) Monoclonal Antibody Therapy (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although intravenous thrombolysis increases the probability of a good functional outcome in carefully selected patients with acute ischemic stroke, a substantial proportion of patients who receive thrombolysis do not have a good outcome. Several recent trials of mechanical thrombectomy appear to indicate that this treatment may be superior to thrombolysis. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of new-generation mechanical thrombectomy devices with intravenous thrombolysis (if eligible) compared with intravenous thrombolysis (if eligible) in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal intracranial occlusion. We systematically searched seven databases for randomized controlled trials published between January 2005 and March 2015 comparing stent retrievers or thromboaspiration devices with best medical therapy (with or without intravenous thrombolysis) in adults with acute ischemic stroke. We assessed risk of bias and overall quality of the included trials. We combined the data using a fixed or random effects meta-analysis, where appropriate. We identified 1579 studies; of these, we evaluated 122 full-text papers and included five randomized control trials (n=1287). Compared with patients treated medically, patients who received mechanical thrombectomy were more likely to be functionally independent as measured by a modified Rankin score of 0-2 (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.88-3.04; I2=0%).

In order to evaluate their relative impact, two frequently used gamification tools, badges (i.e., digital credentials given for achievements) and leaderboards (i.e., digital rankings based on performance), were compared for their effectiveness on the academic performance and motivation of students. Two experiments were conducted in two online undergraduate physics courses taught via a learning management system.

We review our experiences with EVT performed using FAST and stent retriever thrombectomy in such cases. METHODS The subjects comprised 41 patients with an M2 occlusion who underwent EVT (25 with FAST, 16 with stent retriever thrombectomy). The patients' data were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the technical characteristics and angiographic outcome of the two EVT techniques. RESULTS Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grades 2b-3 using the first chosen technique did not differ significantly between the two techniques (FAST 64.0% vs stent retriever thrombectomy 81.2%, p=0.305). Time from groin puncture to reperfusion was significantly shorter for stent retriever thrombectomy (53.0 vs 38.5 min; p=0.045). Distal embolization occurred in three cases (12.0%) in the FAST group and in four (26.7%) in the stent retriever group (p=0.362). However, the two techniques did not differ significantly in the final TICI 2b-3 rate (72.0% vs 87.5%; p=0.441). A frequent angiographic finding regarding the failure of FAST was that the M2 occlusion was located immediately after severe acute angulation between M1 and M2. CONCLUSIONS Stent retriever thrombectomy may provide faster reperfusion than FAST, while the FAST technique might be associated with lower distal embolization and a higher reperfusion rate for the first thrombectomy attempt, but without any significant difference in clinical outcome. When choosing the EVT method for M2 occlusions, consideration of the location of the occlusion and tortuosity between M1 and M2 might be helpful to achieve a better angiographic outcome.","output":"Endovascular thrombectomy for M2 occlusions: comparison between forced arterial suction thrombectomy and stent retriever thrombectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to study affect of COVID 19 pandemic on lifestyle of young adults and adolescent.

Limited experience suggests a promising role for Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) in COVID-19 management based on the hypothesis that clinical benefit is derived from reduction in plasma viscosity. However, systematic study evaluating the safety and efficacy of TPE in these patients has not been done. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of TPE in a subset of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and elevated blood viscosity in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted in the intensive care units (ICUs) of 3 hospitals in our health system, with a limited initial enrollment target of 20 patients. Participants included adult COVID-19 patients with moderate elevation in plasma viscosity (2.3-3.5 centipoise) or significant hyperfibrinogenemia (>800 mg/dL) that were not improving despite standard supportive care. Patients with bacterial or fungal coinfection or moribund patients were specifically excluded. Upon enrollment, patients were randomized 1:1 to the treatment group (1 plasma volume TPE with frozen plasma (FP) replacement on 2 consecutive days) or control group (continued standard of care (SOC)). Primary measures included the safety/tolerability of TPE and change in plasma viscosity levels after TPE versus SOC. Secondary measures included evaluation of various clinical and laboratory parameters, including fibrinogen and other coagulation-related markers, mortality, bleeding and thromboembolic complications, ICU length of stay and time to discharge after enrollment. RESULTS: Preliminary analysis of collected data demonstrates that TPE is safe and well-tolerated in these patients, with adverse events limited to one mild occurrence of tachycardia that improved upon decreasing the flow rate. There was significant decrease in plasma viscosity in the TPE treatment group, compared to the SOC control group. Secondary measures of select laboratory parameters also show a significant decrease in fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (vWF), Factor VIII, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the TPE treatment group. No significant differences were seen in levels of fibrin monomer, total IgG, total IgM, total protein, or total albumin between the two groups. Data collection and analysis for clinical parameters are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Here we report preliminary results suggesting that TPE is safe and effective for normalizing plasma viscosity in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Concomitant removal of large plasma proteins (fibrinogen, vWF) hints at their role in driving the increased viscosity associated with severe disease, which may contribute to clotting and end-organ damage in COVID-19. Based on lack of change in total IgG/IgM levels, TPE is not anticipated to hinder the patients humoral immunity by removing existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. These results warrant further studies on the utility of TPE to mitigate critical illness in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Therapeutic Plasma Exchange is Safe and Efficacious in Normalizing Increased Plasma Viscosity Associated with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the Alma Ata Declaration of 1978, countries have varied in their progress towards establishing and sustaining comprehensive primary health care (PHC) and realizing its associated vision of Health for All. International health emergencies such as the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic underscore the importance of PHC in underpinning health equity, including via access to routine essential services and emergency responsiveness. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge about PHC impacts, implementation enablers and barriers, and knowledge gaps across the three main PHC components as conceptualized in the 2018 Astana Framework. A scoping review design was adopted to summarize evidence from a diverse body of literature with a modification to accommodate four discrete phases of searching, screening and eligibility assessment: a database search in PubMed for PHC-related literature reviews and multi-country analyses (Phase 1); a website search for key global PHC synthesis reports (Phase 2); targeted searches for peer-reviewed literature relating to specific components of PHC (Phase 3) and searches for emerging insights relating to PHC in the COVID-19 context (Phase 4). Evidence from 96 included papers were analysed across deductive themes corresponding to the three main components of PHC. Findings affirm that investments in PHC improve equity and access, healthcare performance, accountability of health systems and health outcomes. Key enablers of PHC implementation include equity-informed financing models, health system and governance frameworks that differentiate multi-sectoral PHC from more discrete service-focussed primary care, and governance mechanisms that strengthen linkages between policymakers, civil society, non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations and private sector entities. Although knowledge about, and experience in, PHC implementation continues to grow, critical knowledge gaps are evident, particularly relating to country-level, context-specific governance, financing, workforce, accountability and service coordination mechanisms.

These processes are also called inflammaging and immunosenescence. The age-related immune remodeling is associated with many clinical changes, e.g., risk for cancers and chronic infections increases, whereas the efficiency of vaccination and immunotherapy declines with aging. On the other hand, there is convincing evidence that chronic inflammatory states promote the premature aging process. The inflammation associated with aging or chronic inflammatory conditions stimulates a counteracting immunosuppression which protects tissues from excessive inflammatory injuries but promotes immunosenescence. Immunosuppression is a driving force in tumors and chronic infections and it also induces the tolerance to vaccination and immunotherapies. Immunosuppressive cells, e.g., myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), regulatory T cells (Treg), and type M2 macrophages, have a crucial role in tumorigenesis and chronic infections as well as in the tolerance to vaccination and immunotherapies. Interestingly, there is substantial evidence that inflammaging is also associated with an increased immunosuppressive activity, e.g., upregulation of immunosuppressive cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Given that both the aging and chronic inflammatory states involve the activation of immunosuppression and immunosenescence, this might explain why aging is a risk factor for tumorigenesis and chronic inflammatory states and conversely, chronic inflammatory insults promote the premature aging process in humans.","output":"Clinical perspectives on the age-related increase of immunosuppressive activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the psychological well-being of healthcare workers has been taken for granted - it has even been considered a part of the requirements that were demanded of them.

Dental school leaderships needed to ensure the academic continuity, therefore the majority of the in-person actives were transitioned into a virtual setting. The aim of this study was to identify students' perception regarding the measures taken to adapt during the pandemic by different dental schools in the European Region. METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilised a validated 37-questions survey. Ethical approval was obtained from the Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. Using this instrument, the perceptions of the European dental students regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their education and mental health were identified. The questions were divided into categories: standard demographic information; models of education during the COVID-19 pandemic (types of teaching, examination and other educational activities) and support received. The survey was administered through electronic online tools, and all responses remained confidential. The data was processed through quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: A total of 879 student responses to the survey from 34 countries in the European Region were included in this study. When asked about the time spent on their education, 50% of the participants (n=435) reported spending less time on their education and 30% (n=265) reported spending more time. The types of teaching included showed a heterogenous approach, varying from online simulations to problem-solving for the didactic setting, or a hybrid model with group activities for the clinical setting. There were broad splits in satisfaction with the education delivered, with 44% (n=382) being either satisfied or very satisfied and 31% (n=279) being either unsatisfied or very unsatisfied.

Our goal was to determine the frequency of hypopneic hypoventilation and its association with hypoxia in children undergoing sedation with ketamine. METHODS Children who received intravenous ketamine with or without midazolam for sedation in a pediatric emergency department were prospectively enrolled. Heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ET(CO2)) levels were recorded every 30 seconds. RESULTS Fifty-eight subjects were included in this study. Fifty percent of subjects had recorded ET(CO2) values less than 30 mm Hg without a rise in respiratory rate. Twenty-eight percent of subjects experienced a decrease in pulse oximetry less than 95%. Patients who experienced a persistent decrease in ET(CO2) at least 30 seconds in length were much more likely to have a persistent decrease in pulse oximetry than those with normal or transient decreases in ET(CO2) (relative risk, 6.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-30.5). Decreases in ET(CO2) occurred on an average of 3.7 minutes before decreases in pulse oximetry. CONCLUSIONS Hypopneic hypoventilation as detected by capnography is common in children undergoing sedation with ketamine with or without midazolam.

Concurrently, the same characteristics correlate with the adoption of prophylactic tools. As a result, the latter do not unfold homogeneously in a population, affecting their ability to control the spread of infectious diseases. Focusing on the case of vaccines, we reveal that, provided an imperfect vaccine efficacy, three different dynamical regimes exist as a function of the mixing rate between vaccinated and not vaccinated individuals. Specifically, depending on the epidemic pressure, vaccine coverage and efficacy, we find the final attack rate to decrease, increase or vary non monotonously with respect to the mixing rate. We corroborate the phenomenology through Monte Carlo simulations on a temporal real-world contact network. Besides vaccines, our findings hold for any prophylactic tool that reduces but not suppress the probability of transmission, indicating a universal mechanism in spreading dynamics.While it is known that vaccine adoption is clustered, most modelling studies are based on vaccines which efficacy is almost 100%.

CLEC4M was previously reported to capture artificial HCVpp (pseudoparticle) and transmit it to hepatocytes (transinfection) via CLEC4M-positive cells. It is still not known whether CLEC4M acts as a receptor for HCVcc (cell-culture-produced HCV) transinfection or whether CLEC4M is an entry receptor for HCVcc. Initially, we established stably CLEC4M-positive and HCV-replication-permissive cell lines by introducing a CLEC4M expression vector into Huh7-25 cells (Huh7-25-CLEC4M) by transfection. Huh7-25 is a mutant cell line that is resistant to JFH-1 HCVcc due to the lack of expression of CD81 but permissive for replication of JFH1 HCV RNA. When Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells were infected with HCVcc and cultured for 6 days, none were positive for infection. Next, to examine whether CLEC4M functions as a receptor for transinfection, Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells were inoculated with HCVcc and thereafter co-cultured with Huh7-it cells, which are susceptible to HCV infection. The amount of HCV RNA was increased in Huh7-it cells co-cultured with Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells, and the transinfection was inhibited in the presence of anti-CLEC4M antibody during inoculation. Thus, CLEC4M cannot substitute for CD81 as an entry receptor for JFH-1 HCVcc. It just mediates transinfection without internalization of HCVcc. CD81 is still crucial for HCV entry into hepatocytes, and CLEC4M in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells may be responsible for hepatotropism of HCV infection by trapping circulating HCV to transmit it to adjacent hepatocytes.

With repercussions on working conditions and the public image of journalists, these variables are, however, only the most visible face of threats to an activity that, according to Nelson Traquina (2002), has a symbiotic relationship with democracy. Beyond these economic, social and cultural circumstances are also the expectations of the professionals themselves. In an occupation so often described as passionate, the professional situation seems to be less and less rewarding, not only due to the decrease in job opportunities, with newsrooms increasingly empty, but also due to the lack of perspective on career progression. This is one of the results of the Study on the Effects of the State of Emergency on Journalism in the Context of the Covid-19 Pandemic, conducted between May and June 2020. With a particular focus on reading journalists expectations, in this article we analyse the symbolic representations of a job that founded its social legitimacy on an idea of public service. Based on studies about the profession and its representations, we tried to find answers to understand why the acceptance of precariousness and abandonment of the profession can still be understood as places of resistance. ? 2021.

We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a harmonized electronic health record dataset of 6.4 million, to describe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes in patients with CLD and cirrhosis. METHODS: We identified all patients with CLD with or without cirrhosis who had SARS-CoV-2 testing in the N3C Data Enclave as of July 1, 2021. We used survival analyses to associate SARS-CoV-2 infection, presence of cirrhosis, and clinical factors with the primary outcome of 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We isolated 220,727 patients with CLD and SARS-CoV-2 test status: 128,864 (58%) were noncirrhosis/negative, 29,446 (13%) were noncirrhosis/positive, 53,476 (24%) were cirrhosis/negative, and 8941 (4%) were cirrhosis/positive patients. Thirty-day all-cause mortality rates were 3.9% in cirrhosis/negative and 8.9% in cirrhosis/positive patients. Compared to cirrhosis/negative patients, cirrhosis/positive patients had 2.38 times adjusted hazard of death at 30 days. Compared to noncirrhosis/positive patients, cirrhosis/positive patients had 3.31 times adjusted hazard of death at 30 days. In stratified analyses among patients with cirrhosis with increased age, obesity, and comorbid conditions (ie, diabetes, heart failure, and pulmonary disease), SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased adjusted hazard of death. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of approximately 221,000 nationally representative, diverse, and sex-balanced patients with CLD; we found SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis was associated with 2.38 times mortality hazard, and the presence of cirrhosis among patients with CLD infected with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with 3.31 times mortality hazard.

These reports are obtained under various on-call conditions by radiologists with various backgrounds. Our aim was to investigate what influences the radiologists written expressions. To do so, this retrospective multicentric study included 30,227 emergency radiological reports of computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging involving exactly one body region, only with pathological findings, interpreted from 2019C09-01 to 2020C02-28 by 165 radiologists. After text pre-processing, one-word tokenization and use of dictionaries for stop words, polarity, sentiment and uncertainty, 11 variables depicting the structure and content of words and sentences in the reports were extracted and summarized to 3 principal components capturing 93.7% of the dataset variance. In multivariate analysis, the 1(st) principal component summarized the length and lexical diversity of the reports and was significantly influenced by the weekday, time slot, workload, number of examinations previously interpreted by the radiologist during the on-call period, type of examination, emergency level and radiologists gender (P value range: < 0.0001C0.0029). The 2(nd) principal component summarized negative formulations, polarity and sentence length and was correlated with the number of examination previously interpreted by the radiologist, type of examination, emergency level, imaging modality and radiologists experience (P value range: < 0.0001C0.0032). The last principal component summarized questioning, uncertainty and polarity and was correlated with the type of examination and emergency level (all P values < 0.0001). Thus, the length, structure and content of emergency radiological reports were significantly influenced by organizational, radiologist- and examination-related characteristics, highlighting the subjectivity and variability in the way radiologists express themselves during their clinical activity.

There is an urgent need to identify vulnerability and protective factors related to the severity of psychiatric symptoms among healthcare workers to implement targeted prevention and intervention programs to reduce the mental health burden worldwide during COVID-19. Objective: The present study aimed to apply a machine learning approach to predict depression and PTSD symptoms based on psychometric questions that assessed: (1) the level of stress due to being isolated from one's family;(2) professional recognition before and during the pandemic;and (3) altruistic acceptance of risk during the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers. Methods: A total of 437 healthcare workers who experienced some level of isolation at the time of the pandemic participated in the study. Data were collected using a web survey conducted between June 12, 2020, and September 19, 2020. We trained two regression models to predict PTSD and depression symptoms. Pattern regression analyses consisted of a linear epsilon-insensitive support vector machine (-SVM). Predicted and actual clinical scores were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), the coefficient of determination (r2), and the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) to evaluate the model performance. A permutation test was applied to estimate significance levels. Results: Results were significant using two different cross-validation strategies to significantly decode both PTSD and depression symptoms. For all of the models, the stress due to social isolation and professional recognition were the variables with the greatest contributions to the predictive function. Interestingly, professional recognition had a negative predictive value, indicating an inverse relationship with PTSD and depression symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings emphasize the protective role of professional recognition and the vulnerability role of the level of stress due to social isolation in the severity of posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms.

Here, we develop synthetic antibody mimetics, termed monobodies, to interfere with STAT3 signaling. These monobodies are highly selective for STAT3 and bind with nanomolar affinity to the N-terminal and coiled-coil domains. Interactome analysis detects no significant binding to other STATs or additional off-target proteins, confirming their exquisite specificity. Intracellular expression of monobodies fused to VHL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor, results in degradation of endogenous STAT3. The crystal structure of STAT3 in complex with monobody MS3-6 reveals bending of the coiled-coil domain, resulting in diminished DNA binding and nuclear translocation. MS3-6 expression strongly inhibits STAT3-dependent transcriptional activation and disrupts STAT3 interaction with the IL-22 receptor.

One of the reasons is the difficulty of analyzing medical record data of COVID-19 patients. The analysis becomes difficult because of the large volume of data and the heterogeneous characteristics of the content. This is what makes medical personnel take a long time in the process of analyzing data on COVID-19 patients, and causes the slow handling of cases in Indonesia. Therefore, this study proposes a new approach to analyze and classify medical record data of COVID-19 patients using a data analytics approach with descriptive and predictive mining methods. Where descriptive method is used to grouping patient's disease risk categorization and predictive method is used to classify positive/negative patients. The input data used for the analysis process was sourced from the results of the RT-PCR test of COVID-19 patients. Before being analyzed, the data is normalized first, and the features are extracted. Next, the descriptive mining process was carried out using the Hierarchical Clustering Complete Linkage method and predictive mining using the Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) methods. If so, then the results of the process are tested using the confusion matrix and error ratio methods. From the whole process, it can be concluded that the error ratio of this approach is 8% for predictive mining and 21% for descriptive mining.

Therefore, medical students should be confronted with digital health during their medical education. However, corresponding teaching formats and concepts are still largely lacking in the medical curricula. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to introduce digital health as a curricular module at a German medical school and to identify undergraduate medical competencies in digital health and their suitable teaching methods. METHODS: We developed a 3-week curricular module on digital health for third-year medical students at a large German medical school, taking place for the first time in January 2020. Semistructured interviews with 5 digital health experts were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an abductive approach. We obtained feedback from the participating students and lecturers of the module through a 17-item survey questionnaire. RESULTS: The module received overall positive feedback from both students and lecturers who expressed the need for further digital health education and stated that the field is very important for clinical care and is underrepresented in the current medical curriculum. We extracted a detailed overview of digital health competencies, skills, and knowledge to teach the students from the expert interviews. They also contained suggestions for teaching methods and statements supporting the urgency of the implementation of digital health education in the mandatory curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: An elective class seems to be a suitable format for the timely introduction of digital health education. However, a longitudinal implementation in the mandatory curriculum should be the goal. Beyond training future physicians in digital skills and teaching them digital health's ethical, legal, and social implications, the experience-based development of a critical digital health mindset with openness to innovation and the ability to assess ever-changing health technologies through a broad transdisciplinary approach to translate research into clinical routine seem more important.

SARS-CoV-2 is an emergent viral disease that caused millions of COVID-19 cases all over the world. Around 15% of cases are severe and some of them are accompanied by dysregulated immune system and cytokine storm. There is increasing evidence that severe manifestations of COVID-19 might be attributed to human genetic variants in genes related to immune deficiency and or inflammasome activation (cytokine storm). OBJECTIVE: Identify the candidate genes that are likely to aid in explaining severe COVID-19 and provide insights to understand severe COVID-19. METHODS: In this article, we systematically reviewed genes related to viral susceptibility that were reported in human genetic studies (Case reports and GWAS) to understand the role of host viral interactions and to provide insights into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. RESULTS: We found 40 genes associated with viral susceptibility and 21 of them were associated with severe SARS-CoV disease and severe COVID-19. Some of those genes were implicated in TLR pathways, others in C-lectin pathways, and others were related to inflammasome activation (cytokine storm). CONCLUSIONS: This compilation represents a list of candidate genes that are likely to aid in explaining severe COVID-19 which are worthy of inclusion in gene panels and during meta-analysis of different variants in host genetics studies of COVID-19.

METHODS: We observed a significant decline in diagnostic tests used in the diagnosis of haematological malignancies. We therefore decided to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the volume of tests performed to see if this impacted the number of new cases of haematological malignancies diagnosed.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the diagnostic value of chest computed tomography (CT) imaging with respect to symptom duration. METHODS: This retrospective study involved patients from five centers, who were admitted with typical COVID-19 symptoms and found to be positive for COVID-19 real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) test. RESULTS: One hundred and five patients with positive COVID-19 rtRT-PCR test were involved in the study. Sixty percent of these patients had chest CT imaging findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. The most common chest CT finding was bilateral and subpleural ground-glass opacity in middle-lower lobes of the lungs. Chest CT findings were detected in 85.1% of the patients with a symptom duration of more than 2 days. In receiver operating characteristic analysis of this parameter, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.869, while sensitivity and specificity were 90.5% and 76.2%, respectively. It was notable that chest CT findings were 7.17 times more common among the patients aged 60 years and older, with AUC, specificity, and positive predictive value of 0.768, 88.1%, and 84.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chest CT imaging is a quite valuable tool in patients with longer than 2 days' duration of symptoms, in whom clinical and epidemiological data support the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. We suggest that the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia should be made with chest CT imaging when rtRT-PCR test cannot be performed or gives a negative result, which is important for public health and to prevent the spread of infection.","output":"The relationship between diagnostic value of chest computed tomography imaging and symptom duration in COVID infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), anticoagulant medications such as warfarin and rivaroxaban are commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of ischaemic strokes, and other thromboembolic events.

Households represent one of the most energy-consuming sectors globally and are expected to increase tremendously in the future. Women have higher responsibility in the household energy use in most societies. However, their participation and impacts have been less prioritized in the sustainability concept regarding energy perspective. In contrast, most development studies reveal that women's participation in managing resources can positively impact women and policy management. However, women's active participation and influences on social, economic, and environmental contexts are mostly ignored in energy-related decisions, disregarding women's productive activities. Thus, this study evaluates the gender role in urban household energy in three contexts of economic, social, and environmental aspects of sustainability pillars. This study is exploratory research based on questionnaire survey, interviews, observation, and air quality tests to apprehend appropriate data. The study revealed that the lower-income group uses a larger share of their monthly income for household energy with unclean cooking fuel. It has an impact on low-willingness to participate in new energy technology purchases. The use of electrical appliances and income has a moderate correlation (r = .48). However, Kathmandu urban households are eager to use electric cooking, but urban women have insufficient knowledge, information, and less affordability for new technology. The city's sustainability level is still low (47 scores) from a gender perspective, and it suggests the city needs a long way on the sustainability route.

We summarize the actions and outcomes concerning outbreak prevention and control in the Antoni Asuncin Hernndez (AAH) Prison (Valencian Region, Spain), one of the largest in Europe. DESCRIPTION: An intersectoral commission was established in March 2020 at the Valencia General Hosp Health Dept to coordinate the COVID-19 response in penitentiary centres. A contingency plan was developed, with successive contention layers: general measures, restriction of interaction with the community (including suspension of visits), 14 days quarantine on admission and return, reduction of activities, modular confinement, voluntary confinement in cells, occupational risks prevention, vaccination, epi surveillance, outbreak management (incl sectorisation), isolation of cases (PCR at discharge), contact tracing and 14d quarantine (PCR at 0,7&14d), expanded testing and healthcare services. RESULTS: On 8 Jan 2021, with a regional 14d cum incidence of 394/100,000 pop, an outbreak was declared. The index case initiated symptoms the 14th day after return from leave, after quarantine discharge. In 57 days 281 confirmed cases were diagnosed: 274 inmates (out of 1,823) and 7 workers (of 890). Mean age 40,7 years (SD 12,0), 9 cases + 65 year-olds, 99,3% men. 7 out of 32 modules and the nursing unit were affected, with an overall attack rate of 38,5% (range 6,1-77,4%). 5 inmates were hospitalised, of which 2 in ICU. All patients had an uneventful recovery. Case fatality rate 0. No new variant was detected. LESSONS: Intersectoral coordination mechanisms, involving prison officials, public health authorities and healthcare services, are crucial to unfold an appropriate COVID-19 response. Tailored, rigorous, dynamic and proportionate measures are essential to reduce COVID-19 impact on the health and well-being of prisons' population and their communities. KEY MESSAGES: Prisons are at risk of large COVID-19 outbreaks, with potentially severe consequences, given their population vulnerability and organisational complexity. We recommend a 14d quarantine duration. Intersectoral coordination mechanisms are crucial to unfold an appropriate COVID-19 response, wich should include tailored, rigorous, dynamic and proportionate prevention and control measures.","output":"COVID-19 prevention and outbreak control in a large Spanish prison: an intersectoral approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background With the exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries swiftly implemented a variety of health policies. In this work we examine how rapid countries responded to this pandemic using two events: the day in which the first case of COVID-19 was reported, and first day in which countries used school closure as one of the measures to avoid outbreaks. Methods We compiled information from multiple sources, from December 31st 2019 to June 1st 2020, to trace when 172 countries reported their first COVID-19 case and implemented school closure to contain outbreaks. We applied cross-national Weibull survival analysis to evaluate the global speed of detection of first COVID-19 reported cases and school closure. We also assessed how health systems, globalization, economic development, political systems, and economic integration to China, Republic of Korea and Italy increased the speed of adoption. Results Ten days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be an international emergency, countries were 28 (95% CI: 12,77) times more likely to report first COVID-19 cases and 42 (95% CI: 22,90) times more likely to close schools. One standard deviation increase in the epidemic security index rises the rate of report first cases by 37% (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.37 (95% CI: 1.09,1.72) and delays the adoption for school closures by 36% (HR 0.64 (95% CI:0.50,0.82). One standard deviation increase in the globalization index augments the adoption for school closures by 74% (HR 1.74 (95% CI:1.34,2.24). Conclusion. After the WHO declared a global emergency, countries were unprecedently acting very rapidly. While countries more globally integrated were swifter in closing schools, countries with better designed health systems to tackle epidemics were slower in adopting it. More studies are needed to assess how the speed of school closures and other policies will affect the development of the pandemic.","output":"The global viralization of policies to contain the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic: analyses of school closures and first reported cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Standard protocols or algorithms are considered essential to ensure adequate analgesia. Germany has widely adopted postoperative protocols for pain management including oral opioids for rescue medication, but the effectiveness of such protocols has only been evaluated longitudinally in a before and after setting. The aim of this cohort analysis was to compare the effectiveness of an oral opioid rescue medication algorithm for postoperative management of pain to the gold standard of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA). MATERIAL AND METHODS This study compared cohorts of patients of two prospective observational studies undergoing elective total hip replacement. After surgery patients received piritramide to achieve a pain score of 3 on the numeric rating scale (NRS 0-10). A protocol was started consisting of oral long-acting oxycodone and ibuprofen (basic analgesia). Cohort 1 (C1, 126 patients) additionally received an oral opioid rescue medication (hydromorphone) when reporting pain >3 on the NRS. Cohort 2 (C2, 88 patients) was provided with an opioid by PCIA (piritramide) for opioid rescue medication. Primary endpoints were pain intensity at rest, during movement, and maximum pain intensity within the first 24 h postoperative. Secondary endpoints were opioid consumption, functional outcome and patient satisfaction with pain management. RESULTS Pain during movement and maximum pain intensity were higher in C1 compared to C2: pain on movement median 1st-3rd quartile: 6 (3.75-8) vs. 5 (3-7), p = 0.023; maximum pain intensity: 7 (5-9) vs. 5 (3-8), p = 0.008. There were no differences in pain intensity at rest or between women and men in either group. The mean opioid consumption in all patients (combined PACU, baseline, and rescue medication; mean  SD mg ME) was 126.6  51.8 mg oral ME (median 120 (87.47-154.25) mg ME). Total opioid consumption was lower in C1 than C2 (117  46 mg vs 140  56 mg, p = 0.002) due to differences in rescue opioids (C1: 57  37 mg ME, C2: 73  43 mg ME, p = 0.006, Z = -2.730). Basic analgesia opioid use was comparable (C1: 54  31 mg ME, C2: 60  36 mg ME, p = 0.288, Z = -1.063). There were no differences in respect to the addition of non-opioids and reported quality of mobilization, sleep, frequency of nausea and vomiting, or general satisfaction with pain management. CONCLUSION In this study PCIA provided a better reduction of pain intensity, when compared to a standardized protocol with oral opioid rescue medication. This effect was associated with increased opioid consumption. There were no differences in frequencies of opioid side effects. This study was a retrospective analysis of two cohorts of a major project. As with all retrospective studies, our analysis has several limitations to consider. Data can only represent the observation of clinical practice. It cannot reflect the quality of a statement of a randomized controlled trial. Observational studies do not permit conclusions on causal relationships.","output":"The effectiveness of an oral opioid rescue medication algorithm for postoperative pain management compared to PCIA : A cohort analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our ability to uncover complex network structure and dynamics from data is fundamental to understanding and controlling collective dynamics in complex systems. Despite recent progress in this area, reconstructing networks with stochastic dynamical processes from limited time series remains to be an outstanding problem. Here we develop a framework based on compressed sensing to reconstruct complex networks on which stochastic spreading dynamics take place. We apply the methodology to a large number of model and real networks, finding that a full reconstruction of inhomogeneous interactions can be achieved from small amounts of polarized (binary) data, a virtue of compressed sensing. Further, we demonstrate that a hidden source that triggers the spreading process but is externally inaccessible can be ascertained and located with high confidence in the absence of direct routes of propagation from it.

In this study, systemic, mucosal, and cellular immune responses and long-term protective immunity induced by RBD-rAAV were further characterized in a BALB/c mouse model, with comparison of the i.m. and intranasal (i.n.) routes of administration. Our results demonstrated that: 1) the i.n. vaccination induced a systemic humoral immune response of comparable strength and shorter duration than the i.m. vaccination, but the local humoral immune response was much stronger; 2) the i.n. vaccination elicited stronger systemic and local specific cytotoxic T cell responses than the i.m. vaccination, as evidenced by higher prevalence of IL-2 and/or IFN-gamma-producing CD3+/CD8+ T cells in both lungs and spleen; 3) the i.n. vaccination induced similar protection as the i.m. vaccination against SARS-CoV challenge in mice; 4) higher titers of mucosal IgA and serum-neutralizing Ab were associated with lower viral load and less pulmonary pathological damage, while no Ab-mediated disease enhancement effect was observed; and 5) the vaccination could provide long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection.

By 2050, mortality from antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria is projected to increase up to 10 million people per year, which will exceed mortality from cancer. Mutations in bacteria and viruses are occurring faster than new drugs and vaccines are being introduced to the market. In search of effective protection against infections, new strategies and approaches are being developed, one of which is the use of innate immunity activators in combination with etiotropic chemotherapy drugs. Muramyl peptides, which are part of peptidoglycan of cell walls of all known bacteria, regularly formed in the body during the breakdown of microflora and considered to be natural regulators of immunity. Their interaction with intracellular receptors launches a sequence of processes that ultimately leads to the increased expression of genes of MHC molecules, pro-inflammatory mediators, cytokines and their soluble and membrane-associated receptors. As a result, all subpopulations of immunocompetent cells are activated: macrophages and dendritic cells, neutrophils, T-, B- lymphocytes and natural killer cells for an adequate response to foreign or transformed antigens, manifested both in the regulation of the inflammatory response and in providing immunological tolerance. Muramyl peptides take part in the process of hematopoiesis, stimulating production of colony-stimulating factors, which is the basis for their use in the treatment of oncological diseases.

The use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for rectal cancer is increasing in the UK. However, the extent of IMRT implementation and current practice was not previously known. A national survey was commissioned to investigate the landscape of IMRT use for rectal cancer and to inform the development of national rectal cancer IMRT guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based survey was developed by the National Rectal Cancer IMRT Guidance working group in collaboration with the Royal College of Radiologists and disseminated to all UK radiotherapy centres. The survey enquired about the implementation of IMRT with a focus on the following aspects of the workflow: dose fractionation schedules and use of a boost; pre-treatment preparation and simulation; target volume/organ at risk definition; treatment planning and treatment verification. A descriptive statistical analysis was carried out. RESULTS: In total, 44 of 63 centres (70%) responded to the survey; 30/44 (68%) and 36/44 (82%) centres currently use IMRT to treat all patients and selected patients with rectal cancer, respectively. There was general agreement concerning several aspects of the IMRT workflow, including patient positioning, use of intravenous contrast and bladder protocols. Greater variation in practice was identified regarding rectal protocols; use of a boost to primary/nodal disease; target volume delineation; organ at risk delineation and dose constraints and treatment verification. Delineation of individual small bowel loops and daily volumetric treatment verification were considered potentially feasible by most centres.

While seizures in the rat lead to more cortical area devoted to simple cortical forelimb movement representations (motor maps) assessed using short-duration intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), the effect of seizures on complex movements derived with long-duration ICMS is unknown. Further, the relationship between motor map expression and motor impairment is not well understood. We used long-duration ICMS in the rat to test the hypothesis that repeated seizure activity (cortical kindling) increases the extent of overlapping cortical representation where multiple forelimb movements are evoked to stimulation. Cortical kindling (n = 7) significantly expanded (100%) forelimb motor maps characterized by a proportional increase in both complex and simple movement representation areas, and significantly increased (285%) overlapping forelimb representation compared to sham-kindled controls (n = 5). In a second experiment, motor maps were derived with long-duration ICMS under acute cortical application of bicuculline (n = 6) to reduce intracortical inhibition or saline control (n = 10). Bicuculline also significantly expanded forelimb motor maps (108%) but without increasing representational overlap. Moreover, expanded map areas in bicuculline rats evoked qualitatively distinct forelimb movements to long-duration, but not short-duration (n = 5), ICMS that were truncated. Our evidence indicates that motor map expansion following repeated experimental seizures is associated with reduced segregation between cortical movement representations that is not entirely due to reduced cortical inhibition but may contribute to interictal motor deficits in some individuals with epilepsy.","output":"Seizures alter cortical representations for complex movements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sanitary Crisis, Civilizational Crisis is the translation of Michel Maffesolis Crise sanitaire, crise civilisationnelle.

AIMS: This study aimed to identify the vaccination rates at 1 year after pharmacist-led provision of information in the community. The objectives were to reveal the reasons for not being vaccinated and to determine opinions and awareness of PN and HZ vaccination among public. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in five social and solidarity centres in Turkey. Participants were educated by a pharmacist about PN and HZ diseases, vaccinations and reimbursement status, respectively. All participants were followed by telephone 1 year after to determine their vaccination status. RESULTS: A total of 155 participants (72.9% male; mean age was 68.72  9.04 years) were included. With respect to PN and HZ vaccines, it was found that 40% and 12.7% of participants knew about the respective vaccines. Following the pharmacists educational session, 52.9% and 51.6% were willing to have the respective vaccine, but only 5.7% and 0.8% respectively got vaccinated 1 year after the educational session. Perceived disease severity, provision of information by a pharmacist, and reimbursement status of the vaccines were not associated with the vaccination rates.

A good place to start is learning what worked and what did not from previous efforts to green the economic recovery during the 2008-2009 Great Recession, examining the cases of the United States and South Korea. Policies for a sustained economic recovery amount to much more than just short-term fiscal stimulus. Transitioning from fossil fuels to a sustainable low-carbon economy will require long-term commitments (5-10 years) of public spending and pricing reforms. The priorities for public spending include support for private sector green innovation and infrastructure, development of smart grids, transport systems, charging station networks, and sustainable cities.

Despite the cancellation of most elective orthopedic and plastic surgical procedures, hand surgeons around the world continue to see a steady stream of limb-threatening cases such as severe trauma and infections that require emergent surgical care. With the increase in community-spread, an increasing number of COVID-19 infected patients may be asymptomatic or have mild, non-specific or atypical symptoms. Some of them may already have an ongoing, severe infection. The time-sensitive nature of some of these cases means that hand surgeons may need to operate urgently on patients who may be suspected of COVID-19 infections, often before confirmatory test results are available. General guidelines for peri-operative care of the COVID-19 positive patient have been published. However, our practices differ from general orthopedic and plastic surgery, primarily because of the focus on trauma.

We conducted a retrospective population-based study in Alberta, Canada (population 4.4 million), where there have been approximately 1550 hospital admissions for COVID-19, to determine the impact of COVID-19 on hospital admissions and emergency department (ED visits), following initiation of a public health emergency act on March 15, 2020. METHODS: We used multivariable negative binomial regression models to compare daily numbers of medical/surgical hospital admissions via the ED between March 16-September 23, 2019 (pre COVID-19) and March 16-September 23, 2020 (post COVID-19 public health measures). We compared the most frequent diagnoses for hospital admissions pre/post COVID-19 public health measures. A similar analysis was completed for numbers of daily ED visits for any reason with a particular focus on ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC). FINDINGS: There was a significant reduction in both daily medical (incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.86, p<0.001) and surgical (IRR 0.82, p<0.001) admissions through the ED in Alberta post COVID-19 public health measures. There was a significant decline in daily ED visits (IRR 0.65, p<0.001) including ACSC (IRR 0.75, p<0.001). The most common medical/surgical diagnoses for hospital admissions did not vary substantially pre and post COVID-19 public health measures, though there was a significant reduction in admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a significant increase in admissions for mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relatively low volume of COVID-19 hospital admissions in Alberta, there was an extensive impact on our healthcare system with fewer admissions to hospital and ED visits. This work generates hypotheses around causes for reduced hospital admissions and ED visits which warrant further investigation. As most publicly funded health systems struggle with health-system capacity routinely, understanding how these reductions can be safely sustained will be critical.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on hospital admissions and emergency department visits: A population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has affected living standards around the world, and pandemic anxiety has changed social habits.

METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used, using online surveys disseminated from April to May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to recruit the participants of this study. The previously developed scales were used to assess the participants demographic information, perceived risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and perceived severity of COVID-19. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the potential association of perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: The Internet was the main source for obtaining COVID-19 information among participants in this study. While 45.8% of the participants believed it was very unlikely for them to get infected with COVID-19, 76.7% perceived COVID-19 as a severe disease.

These diseases include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Ebola. With the current (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, it is critical to delineate appropriate contextual respiratory protection for HCWs. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) as part of respiratory protection versus another device (egN95/FFP2) on HCW infection rates and contamination. METHODS: Our primary outcomes included HCW infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Ebola, or MERS when utilizing PAPR. We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently screened all citations, full-text articles, and abstracted data. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Where applicable, we constructed evidence profile (EP) tables for each individual outcome. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each outcome was classified according to the GRADE system. RESULTS: We identified 689 studies during literature searches. We included 10 full-text studies. A narrative synthesis was provided. Two on-field studies reported no difference in the rates of healthcare workers performing airway procedures during the care of critical patients with SARS-CoV-2. A single simulation trial reported a lower level of cross-contamination of participants using PAPR compared to alternative respiratory protection. There is moderate quality evidence that PAPR use is associated with greater heat tolerance but lower scores for mobility and communication ability. We identified a trend towards greater self-reported wearer comfort with PAPR technology in low-quality observational simulation studies. CONCLUSION: Field observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment. Greater heat tolerance accompanied by lower scores of mobility and audibility in PAPR was identified.

Hence, BAs returning to the liver after enteric secretion, modification and reabsorption may contribute to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Herein, we characterized the enterohepatic profile and signaling of BAs in preclinical models of NASH, and explored the consequences of experimental manipulation of BA composition. Methods We used high-fat diet (HFD)-fed foz/foz and high-fructose western diet-fed C57BL/6J mice, and compared them to their respective controls. Mice received a diet supplemented with deoxycholic acid (DCA) to modulate BA composition. Results Compared to controls, mice with NASH had lower concentrations of BAs in their portal blood and bile, while systemic BA concentrations were not significantly altered. Notably, the concentrations of secondary BAs, and especially of DCA, and the ratio of secondary to primary BAs were strikingly lower in bile and portal blood of mice with NASH. Hence, portal blood was poor in FXR and TGR5 ligands, and conferred poor anti-inflammatory protection in mice with NASH. Enhanced primary BAs synthesis and conversion of secondary to primary BAs in NASH livers contributed to the depletion in secondary BAs. Dietary DCA supplementation in HFD-fed foz/foz mice restored the BA concentrations in portal blood, increased TGR5 and FXR signaling, improved the dysmetabolic status, protected from steatosis and hepatocellular ballooning, and reduced macrophage infiltration. Conclusions BA composition in the enterohepatic cycle, but not in systemic circulation, is profoundly altered in preclinical models of NASH, with specific depletion in secondary BAs. Dietary correction of the BA profile protected from NASH, supporting a role for enterohepatic BAs in the pathogenesis of NASH. Lay summary This study clearly demonstrates that the alterations of enterohepatic bile acids significantly contribute to the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in relevant preclinical models. Indeed, experimental modulation of bile acid composition restored perturbed FXR and TGR5 signaling and prevented non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and associated metabolic disorders.","output":"Bile acids contribute to the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extent and geographic patterns of molecular genetic diversity of the largest remaining free-ranging cheetah population were described in a survey of 313 individuals from throughout Namibia.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is highly influenced by methodologies used for its isolation, concentration and RNA extraction. Although various viral concentration methods are currently employed, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, adsorption-extraction, ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration, to our knowledge, none of these methods have been standardized for use with a variety of wastewater matrices and/or different kits for RNA extraction and quantification. To address this, wastewater with different physical characteristics was seeded with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 and used to test the efficiency of PEG precipitation and adsorption-extraction to concentrate the virus from three physiochemically different wastewater samples, sourced from three distinct wastewater plants. Efficiency of viral concentration and RNA extraction was assessed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and the recovery yields calculated. As co-purification of inhibitors can be problematic for subsequent detection, two commonly used commercial master mixes were assessed for their sensitivity and efficiency to detect two SARS-CoV-2 target nucleocapsid (N) gene sequences. Recovery rates varied greatly between wastewater matrices and concentration methods, with the highest and most reproducible recovery rates (46.6-56.7%) observed when SARS-CoV-2 was precipitated with PEG and detected by the Luna? Universal master mix. The adsorption-extraction method was less effective (0-21.7%). This study demonstrates that PEG precipitation is the more robust method, which translates well to varying wastewater matrices, producing consistent and reproducible recovery rates. Furthermore, it is compatible with different kits for RNA extraction and quantitation.","output":"An optimized and robust PEG precipitation method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diversity of lagoviruses (Caliciviridae) in Australia has increased considerably in recent years. By the end of 2017, five variants from three viral genotypes were present in populations of Australian rabbits, while prior to 2014 only two variants were known. To understand the evolutionary interactions among these lagovirus variants, we monitored their geographical distribution and relative incidence over time in a continental-scale competition study. Within 3 years of the incursion of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2, denoted genotype GI.1bP-GI.2 [polymerase genotype]P-[capsid genotype]) into Australia, two novel recombinant lagovirus variants emerged: RHDV2-4e (genotype GI.4eP-GI.2) in New South Wales and RHDV2-4c (genotype GI.4cP-GI.2) in Victoria. Although both novel recombinants contain non-structural genes related to those from benign, rabbit-specific, enterotropic viruses, these variants were recovered from the livers of both rabbits and hares that had died acutely. This suggests that the determinants of host and tissue tropism for lagoviruses are associated with the structural genes, and that tropism is intricately connected with pathogenicity. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the RHDV2-4c recombinant emerged independently on multiple occasions, with five distinct lineages observed. Both the new RHDV2-4e and -4c recombinant variants replaced the previous dominant parental RHDV2 (genotype GI.1bP-GI.2) in their respective geographical areas, despite sharing an identical or near-identical (i.e. single amino acid change) VP60 major capsid protein with the parental virus. This suggests that the observed replacement by these recombinants was not driven by antigenic variation in VP60, implicating the non-structural genes as key drivers of epidemiological fitness. Molecular clock estimates place the RHDV2-4e recombination event in early to mid-2015, while the five RHDV2-4c recombination events occurred from late 2015 through to early 2017. The emergence of at least six viable recombinant variants within a 2-year period highlights the high frequency of these events, detectable only through intensive surveillance, and demonstrates the importance of recombination in lagovirus evolution.","output":"Frequent intergenotypic recombination between the non-structural and structural genes is a major driver of epidemiological fitness in caliciviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aim: Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 primarily affects the respiratory system, involvement of cardiovascular system is not uncommon and a range of cardiac manifestations among Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients were reported in the literature. Furthermore, it is evident from scientific literature that the incidence of deaths and hospitalizations has been increasingly more among COVID-19 subjects with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19. Another emerging significant concern is the varying presentations of COVID-19 and side effects due to the medication used in the management of COVID-19 patients. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on the possible association between CVD and COVID-19 with emphasis on the pathophysiological mechanisms, cardiac manifestations, and impact of medications used for COVID-19 on cardiovascular health. Based on the available literature, we conclude that though CVD could not be reckoned as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection, it is evident that pre-existing CVD has an influence on the severity of COVID-19 infection and associated mortality. Relevance for Patients: Literature suggests that people with pre-existing CVD are at increased risk for COVID-19 and associated severity. Consequently, it becomes important to thoroughly gain insights into the possible pathophysiological mechanisms, cardiac manifestations in COVID-19, and the impact of COVID-19 treatment on the cardiovascular system.","output":"Coronavirus Disease and Cardiovascular Disease: A Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS Management of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become a major concern. Some data suggest that cryoablation improves the outcomes of elderly patients with HCC, but its efficacy and safety remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of percutaneous cryoablation with those of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for elderly HCC patients. METHODS In all, 223 patients with small HCC aged 70 years, treatment-na?ve, without metastasis were enrolled and randomized into a cryoablation group (n=112) or a RFA (n=111) group from July 2015 to October 2018. The primary endpoint was local tumor progression (LTP) at 3 years after treatment. The secondary endpoints including overall survival(OS), tumor-free survival(TFS), local tumor progression(LTP), and safety were analyzed for these two groups after both treatments. RESULTS LTP rates at 1-, 3-, and 5-year were 12, 17, and 20% for cryoablation and 17, 18, and 21% for RFA, respectively(P=0.735). For lesions >3 cm in diameter, LTP rates at 1-, 3-year were 13 and 22% in cryoablation group and 22 and 42%, respectively, in the RFA group (P=0.039). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 90, 75, and 62% for cryoablation and 90, 68, and 63% for RFA, respectively(P=0.331). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year TFS rates were 59, 32, and 25% in the cryoablation and 59, 28, and 20% in the RFA, respectively (P=0.309). Major complications occurred in 6 patients (5%) following cryoablation and 6 patients (6%) following RFA (P=0.886).

In particular, academic institutions have been and continue to be plagued with the uncertainty of how COVID\\\\19 will impact higher education. In the spring of 2020 all institutions were faced with the reality that remote learning would take place until the end of semester. During the fall semester of 2020 some institutions moved forward with face to face learning. However, they were quickly forced to return to remote learning as the case positivity rate increased. Higher education has offered online and distance education for decades. COVID\\\\19 has now forced all institutions to pivot and offer the majority if not all classes online in a distance learning environment. During this pivot my university instituted The Mastering Online Teaching Course (MOT). The main goal was to introduce instructors new to teaching hybrid or full online courses the basics and best practices for online teaching during the pandemic. The course was a four week self\\\\paced course that consisted of four learning modules. The objectives of the course were to 1) create a deconstructed syllabus, 2) incorporate backward design, alignment, and Transparency in Learning and Teaching (TILT) principles into online course design and delivery, 3) develop an assessment strategy that includes formative assessment, peer feedback, and authentic summative assessment, 4) create a variety of assessments in the learning management system, 5) curate and develop accessible content, all of which aligns to learner\\\\centered outcomes and assessments, 6) add content to the learning management system and organize it so that everything is easy for students to navigate, 7) connect assessments to the gradebook, 8) implement strategies to foster a supportive online learning community and to 9) schedule announcements and set up intelligent agents to keep students organized, up\\\\to\\\\date, and on track. During the fall of 2020 several of the objectives from the MOT were incorporated into the Determinants of Health course. This is a required course for all public health majors. The main focus of the course is to describe the major biological and physiological processes that cause ill\\\\health, with special focus on inflammation, infection, degeneration, neoplasm, and metabolic dysfunction. In particular, a deconstructed syllabus was created and several assessments were developed for the course per the objectives of the MOT.

Methods: We enroled 112 households (291 participants) in a case-ascertained study in Bergen, Norway from 28th February to 4th April 2020, collecting demographic and clinical data from index patients and household members. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were measured in sera collected 6-8 weeks after index patient nasopharyngeal testing to define household attack rates. Findings: The overall attack rate was 45% (95% CI 38-53) assessed by serology, and 47% when also including seronegative RT-PCR positives. Serology identified a higher number of infected household members than RT-PCR. Attack rates were equally high in children (48%) and young adults (42%). The attack rate was 16% in asymptomatic household members and 42% in RT-PCR negative contacts. Older adults had higher antibody titres than younger adults. The risk of household transmission was higher when the index patient had fever (aOR 3.31 [95% CI 1.52-7.24]; p = 0.003) or dyspnoea (aOR 2.25 [95% CI 1.80-4.62]; p = 0.027) during acute illness. Interpretation: Serological assays provide more sensitive and robust estimates of household attack rates than RT-PCR. Children are equally susceptible to infection as young adults.

Demographic characteristics and types of services were aggregated to assess monthly trends using Pearson &#967;2 tests. Regression models were developed to compare factors associated with referrals in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. RESULTS: During the pandemic, service volume (P < .001) and participant volume (P < .001) increased significantly compared with the prepandemic period. Participant characteristics were similar during both periods, the only differences being age distribution, expanded geographic range, and increased male participation during the pandemic. Nonreferred services, such as peer support, increased during the pandemic period. Type of referrals significantly changed from primarily mental health services and disease management in the prepandemic period to affordable housing support, food assistance, and supplemental income.

Over the last years, the tripartite motif-containing protein 5 (TRIM5) and 22 (TRIM22) have shown promise as restriction factors of a plethora of viruses that infect primates. Although there have been studies describing the evolution of these proteins in a wide range of mammals, no prior studies of the TRIM6/34/5/22 gene cluster have been performed in the Chiroptera order. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the evolution of this gene cluster in several bat genomes. Examination of different yangochiroptera and yinpterochiroptera bat species revealed a dynamic history of gene expansion occurring in TRIM5 and TRIM22 genes. Multiple copies of TRIM5 were found in the genomes of several bats, demonstrating a very low degree of conservation in the synteny of this gene among species of the Chiroptera order. Our findings also reveal that TRIM22 is often found duplicated in yangochiroptera bat species, an evolutionary phenomenon not yet observed in any other lineages of mammals. In total, we identified 31 TRIM5 and 19 TRIM22 amino acids to be evolving under positive selection, with most of the residues being placed in the PRYSPRY domain, known to be responsible for binding to the viral capsid during restriction in the primate orthologous TRIM proteins.

Due to barriers such as limited access to care, half of the women with PPD do not receive treatment. Therefore, it is critical to identify effective and scalable interventions. Traditional mindfulness programs have been effective in reducing depressive symptoms, however access remains a barrier. A self-paced mobile health (mHealth) mindfulness program may fit the lifestyle of busy mothers who are unable to attend in-person classes. However, little is known regarding the feasibility or efficacy of mHealth mindfulness interventions in postpartum women with depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of an mHealth mindfulness intervention within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health care system. Participants were identified through clinician referral and electronic health records via KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program and recruited by the study team. Inclusion criteria included the following: English-speaking, up to 6 months postpartum with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) score of 10 to 19, and no regular mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to use a mindfulness app, Headspace, 10 to 20 min/day for 6 weeks. Baseline and postintervention surveys captured data on patient-reported outcomes (depression and stress symptoms, sleep quality, and mindfulness). Semistructured interviews captured acceptability. Retention and adherence were used to assess feasibility. RESULTS: Of the 115 women who were contacted and met the eligibility criteria or declined participation before eligibility assessment, 27 (23%) were enrolled. In addition, 70% (19/27) completed the study. The mean age of participants was 31 years (SD 5.2), 30% (8/27) were non-Hispanic White, and, on average, participants were 12.3 weeks postpartum (SD 5.7). Of the women who completed the study, 100% (19/19) used the Headspace app at least once, and nearly half (9/19, 47%) used the app on &#8805;50% of the days during the 6-week intervention period. Of the 16 participants who completed the postintervention interview, 69% (11/16) reported that they were very or extremely satisfied with the app. Interviews indicated that women appreciated the variety of meditations and felt that the program led to reduced anxiety and improved sleep.

Service planning and policy making for recovery from the pandemic and beyond should draw not only on COVID-19 experiences, but also on the substantial research evidence accumulated prior to this. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an umbrella review of systematic reviews of research literature and evidence-based guidance on tele-mental health, including both qualitative and quantitative literature. METHODS: Three databases were searched between January 2010 and August 2020 for systematic reviews meeting pre-defined criteria. Reviews retrieved were independently screened and those meeting inclusion criteria were synthesised and assessed for risk of bias. Narrative synthesis was used to report findings. RESULTS: Nineteen systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen examined clinical effectiveness, eight reported on aspects of tele-mental health implementation, ten reported on acceptability to service users and clinicians, two on cost-effectiveness and one on guidance. Most reviews were assessed as low quality. Findings suggested that video-based communication could be as effective and acceptable as face-to-face formats, at least in the short-term. Evidence was lacking on the extent of digital exclusion and how it can be overcome, and on some significant contexts such as children and young people's services and inpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS: This umbrella review suggests that tele-mental health has potential to be an effective and acceptable form of service delivery. However, we found limited evidence on impacts of large-scale implementation across catchment areas. Combining previous evidence and COVID-19 experiences may allow realistic planning for future tele-mental health implementation.","output":"Tele-mental health services: a rapid umbrella review of pre-COVID-19 literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study explored a multiple mediation model in Wuhan's college students. Positive thinking and resilience were identified as mediators between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) victimization experiences and mental health. METHOD: The sample included 384 from 4 universities in Wuhan, China. Four structured instruments were applied to the college students, including scale of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus victimization experience, scale of the positive thinking, scale of the resilience, and scale of the mental health. The responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Structural equation models were used to construct measurement and structural models. RESULTS: The findings confirmed that the 2019-nCoV victimization experience was a negative predictor of mental health; positive thinking and resilience were strong mediators between 2019-nCoV victimization experience and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that a complete model was significant because positive thinking compensated for resilience. Notably, these 2 strong mediators will vastly resist the negative influences of 2019-nCoV victimization experience on mental health in Wuhan's college students until the end of the pandemic.

The subjects were included if they were aged 0-18 years and were seen in a pediatric clinic in April 2019 or April 2020. We extracted the number of visits, visit type, and visit diagnosis; and the patient characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, and insurance status. Logistic regression analysis identified characteristics associated with obtaining care in April 2020. We included 120,230 visits. Participants were 50% white and half had Medicaid. In 2020 there were significantly fewer visits for both well and acute visits with 42,670 visits in 2020 compared to 77,560 in 2019; 6616 were telehealth visits in 2020. Visits for chronic conditions were significantly decreased in 2020.

It is also important that these treatments limit the oxidative and hyperinflammatory damage caused as a response to pathogenic agents, since, in some cases, an inflammatory syndrome may develop that worsens the patients prognosis. The potential benefits of complementary nutrients and dietary interventions in the treatment of pathological processes in which oxidative stress and inflammation play a fundamental role have been widely evaluated.

The 5-day positivity rate is marginally to slightly positively correlated with the deceased rate at +0.02 whereas the 14-day positivity rate has a negative correlation of -0.06 with the deceased rate. The higher negative correlation of the 21-day positivity rate of C0.12 with the deceased rate indicates that there are more recoveries over the subsequent 7-day period after 14 days which is also in-line with medical and health professionals who advocate a 14-day quarantine to recover from the virus if the population has tested positive. Statistical correlation and regression Analysis of Variants (ANOVA) analysis indicates that the 21-day positivity rate is negatively correlated to the deceased rate at -0.12 with an R2 (coefficient of determination) of 1.3% compared to correlation coefficients of C0.06 and +0.02 and R2 of 0.28% and 0.03% respectively for the 14-day and 5-day cumulative positivity rates.The 21-day rate is most relevant leading indicator in comparison with the 14-day and 5-day rate and is statistically significant at the 75% Confidence Interval. This implies a Regression equation of Deceased rate over 21 days = 0.0248 - 6.66% x 21 Day Positivity Rate + ErrorThis implies that corona hotspots should ideally quarantine for a longer 21-day period rather than the 14-day period typically advocated especially in areas where there is a stress on the healthcare facilities to avoid burdening the hospitals for non-critical cases.The paper suggests further avenues to explore this relationship including a split of the type of tests namely RT-PCR vs RAT antigen tests as RAT yields a higher 53% of false negatives vis-a-vis the COVID-19 deceased rate and an analysis over a longer time period of say 12 months to analyze the relationship of the delta (change) of the positivity rate and the delta of the deceased rate with statistical significance testing at the 95% and 99% confidence intervals. Longer period analysis would give further insight into leading indicators of rising and decreasing infections which could be used by government and health practitioners so as to proactively increase number of vaccines, health practitioners and hospital ICU beds in advance of a surge in infections and deceased rates.","output":"A Comparison of the Leading Indicators of COVID-19 Deceased Rates in New Delhi, India during the First Quarter of the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An unusual clonal gammopathy was reported in COVID-19 patient but whether this anomaly is related or not to the disease has not yet been clarified.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence for digital interventions to improve hygiene practices within the community. METHODS: We reviewed articles published between 01 January 2000 and 26 May 2019 that presented a controlled trial of a digital intervention to improve hygiene behaviours in the community. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), China National Knowledge Infrastructure and grey literature. Trials in hospitals were excluded, as were trials aiming at prevention of sexually transmitted infections; only target diseases with transmission mechanisms similar to COVID-19 (e.g. respiratory and gastrointestinal infections) were included. Trials had to evaluate a uniquely digital component of an intervention. Study designs were limited to randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after trials, and interrupted time series analyses. Outcomes could be either incidence of infections or change in hygiene behaviours. The Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to assess study quality. RESULTS: We found seven studies that met the inclusion criteria. Six studies reported successfully improving self-reported hygiene behaviour or health outcomes, but only one of these six trials, Germ Defence, confirmed improvements using objective measures (reduced consultations and antibiotic prescriptions). Settings included kindergartens, workplaces, and service station restrooms. Modes of delivery were diverse: WeChat, website, text messages, audio messages to mobiles, electronic billboards, and electronic personal care records. Four interventions targeted parents of young children with educational materials. Two targeted the general population; these also used behaviour change techniques or theory to inform the intervention. Only one trial had low risk of bias, Germ Defence; the most common concerns were lack of information about the randomisation, possible bias in reporting of behavioural outcomes, and lack of an analysis plan and possible selective reporting of results. CONCLUSION: There was only one trial that was judged to be at low risk of bias, Germ Defence, which reduced incidence and severity of illness, as confirmed by objective measures.

While numerous studies have examined climate change effects on crop yields, relatively few studies have examined effects on crop quality (concentrations of nutrients, minerals, and secondary metabolites). This review article employs a culturally relevant beverage crop, tea (Camelia sinensis), as a lens to examine environmental effects linked to climate change on the directionality of crop quality. Our systematic review identified 86 articles as relevant to the review question. Findings provide evidence that shifts in seasonality, water stress, geography, light factors, altitude, herbivory and microbes, temperature, and soil factors that are linked to climate change can result in both increases and decreases up to 50% in secondary metabolites. A gap was found regarding evidence on the direct effects of carbon dioxide on tea quality, highlighting a critical research area for future study. While this systematic review provides evidence that multiple environmental parameters are impacting tea quality, the directionality and magnitude of these impacts is not clear with contradictory evidence between studies likely due to confounding factors including variation in tea variety, cultivar, specific environmental and agricultural management conditions, and differences in research methods. The environmental factors with the most consistent evidence in this systematic review were seasonality and water stress with 14 out of 18 studies (78%) demonstrating a decrease in concentrations of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with a seasonal shift from the spring and /or first tea harvest to other seasons and seven out of 10 studies (70%) showing an increase in levels of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with drought stress. Herbivory and soil fertility were two of the variables that showed the greatest contradictory evidence on tea quality. Both herbivory and soil fertility are variables which farmers have the greatest control over, pointing to the importance of agricultural management for climate mitigation and adaptation. The development of evidence-based management strategies and crop breeding programs for resilient cultivars are called for to mitigate climate impacts on crop quality and overall risk in agricultural and food systems.","output":"Environmental Factors Variably Impact Tea Secondary Metabolites in the Context of Climate Change."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease emerged in December 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its rapid global spread has brought an international health emergency and urgent responses for seeking efficient prevention and therapeutic treatment. This has led to imperative needs for illustration of the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, identification of molecular targets or receptors, and development of antiviral drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. In this study, we investigated the current research progress in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the published research findings, we first elucidated, at the molecular level, SARS-CoV-2 viral structures, potential viral host-cell-invasion and pathogenic mechanisms, main virus-induced immune responses, and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We then focused on the main virus- and host-based potential targets, summarized and categorized effective inhibitory molecules based on drug development strategies for COVID-19, that can guide efforts for the identification of new drugs and treatment for this problematic disease. Current research and development of antibodies and vaccines were also introduced and discussed. We concluded that the main virus entry route- SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2 receptors has played a key role in guiding the development of therapeutic treatments against COVID-19, four main therapeutic strategies may be considered in developing molecular therapeutics, and drug repurposing is likely to be an easy, fast and low-cost approach in such a short period of time with urgent need of antiviral drugs. Additionally, the quick development of antibody and vaccine candidates has yielded promising results, but the wide-scale deployment of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines remains paramount in solving the pandemic crisis. As new variants of the virus begun to emerge, the efficacy of these vaccines and treatments must be closely evaluated. Finally, we discussed the possible challenges of developing molecular therapeutics for COVID-19 and suggested some potential future efforts.

By introducing the concept of the probability of binding efficiency (PBE) and combining the secondary structures of RNA molecules, we designed 11 siRNAs that target the consensus regions of three key viral genes: the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) genes of SARS-CoV-2. The silencing efficiencies of the siRNAs were determined in human lung and endothelial cells overexpressing these viral genes. The results suggested that most of the siRNAs could significantly reduce the expression of the viral genes with inhibition rates above 50% in 24 hours.

The prominence of phosphorylated molecules presents a conundrum given that phosphorylation is a thermodynamically unfavorable, endergonic process in water, and most natural sources of phosphate are poorly soluble. We recently demonstrated that a semi-aqueous solvent consisting of urea, ammonium formate, and water (UAFW) supports the dissolution of phosphate and the phosphorylation of nucleosides. However, the prebiotic feasibility and robustness of the UAFW system are unclear. Here, we study the UAFW system as a medium in which phosphate minerals are potentially solubilized. Specifically, we conduct a series of chemical experiments alongside thermodynamic models that simulate the formation of ammonium formate from the hydrolysis of hydrogen cyanide, and demonstrate the stability of formamide in such solvents (as an aqueous mixture). The dissolution of hydroxylapatite requires a liquid medium, and we investigate whether a UAFW system is solid or liquid over varied conditions, finding that this characteristic is controlled by the molar ratios of the three components. For liquid UAFW mixtures, we also find the solubility of phosphate is higher when the quantity of ammonium formate is greater than urea. We suggest the urea within the system can lower the activity of water, help create a stable and persistent solution, and may act as a condensing agent/catalyst to improve nucleoside phosphorylation yields.","output":"The Prebiotic Provenance of Semi-Aqueous Solvents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we evaluate the role of mast cells in infection with influenza A/H5N1 virus in immunized mice.

PyMol and Schrodinger software were used to identify the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was employed to assess the interaction between an extract component (erythrodiol) and the spike protein. RESULTS: Our in-silico evaluations showed that phytoconstituents of Momordica charantia have a low binding energy range, -5.82 to -5.97 kcal/mol. A docking study revealed two sets of phytoconstituents that bind at the S1 and S2 domains of SARS-CoV-2. SPR showed that erythrodiol has a strong binding affinity (KD = 1.15 M) with the S2 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, docking, ADME properties, and SPR displayed strong interactions between phytoconstituents and the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that phytoconstituents from bitter melon are potential agents to treat SARS-CoV-2 viral infections due to their binding to spike proteins S1 and S2.","output":"Targeting novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with phytoconstituents of Momordica charantia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During pandemics, the blood services must continuously recruit blood donors to maintain the supply of blood products. While the willingness to donate usually rises after other catastrophes such as earthquakes or terrorist attacks, a decline in the number of donors has been observed at the beginning of previous pandemics. Many donors fear infection or a weakening of their immune system and stay at home. Blood services find it difficult to organise the usual number of mobile donation appointments, which leads to a decline in donations. In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, blood donations declined by more than 10% in many countries. Donors who continue to donate during a pandemic tend to be more experienced and already have an established donor identity. Many of these donors report that they want to contribute to overcoming the crisis. Thus, even during a pandemic, there is a high level of solidarity among blood donors. However, potential first-time donors are more likely to be deterred from donating by the uncertain conditions. Targeted recruitment strategies using social media channels are therefore needed to attract new donors. Initial findings among German blood donors suggest that current first-time donors have a high intention to return. To maintain the blood supply during a pandemic, the blood services should try to recruit first-time donors and quickly increase the number of their mobile donation appointments. Recruitment campaigns for experienced donors should reduce uncertainty and strengthen confidence in blood services. The greater the trust in the blood services, the lower the donors? perception of risk. Alternative contact channels, such as messenger services, should also be tested.","output":"Motivation zur Vollblutspende w?hrend pandemischer Ereignisse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The evaluation of immune responses to RTS,S/AS01 has traditionally focused on immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies that are only moderately associated with protection. The role of other antibody isotypes that could also contribute to vaccine efficacy remains unclear. Here we investigated whether RTS,S/AS01E elicits antigen-specific serum IgA antibodies to the vaccine and other malaria antigens, and we explored their association with protection. METHODS Ninety-five children (age 5-17 months old at first vaccination) from the RTS,S/AS01E phase 3 clinical trial who received 3 doses of RTS,S/AS01E or a comparator vaccine were selected for IgA quantification 1 month post primary immunization. Two sites with different malaria transmission intensities (MTI) and clinical malaria cases and controls, were included. Measurements of IgA against different constructs of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) vaccine antigen and 16 vaccine-unrelated Plasmodium falciparum antigens were performed using a quantitative suspension array assay. RESULTS RTS,S vaccination induced a 1.2 to 2-fold increase in levels of serum/plasma IgA antibodies to all CSP constructs, which was not observed upon immunization with a comparator vaccine. The IgA response against 13 out of 16 vaccine-unrelated P. falciparum antigens also increased after vaccination, and levels were higher in recipients of RTS,S than in comparators. IgA levels to malaria antigens before vaccination were more elevated in the high MTI than the low MTI site. No statistically significant association of IgA with protection was found in exploratory analyses. CONCLUSIONS RTS,S/AS01E induces IgA responses in peripheral blood against CSP vaccine antigens and other P. falciparum vaccine-unrelated antigens, similar to what we previously showed for IgG responses. Collectively, data warrant further investigation of the potential contribution of vaccine-induced IgA responses to efficacy and any possible interplay, either synergistic or antagonistic, with protective IgG, as identifying mediators of protection by RTS,S/AS01E immunization is necessary for the design of improved second-generation vaccines.

Complications are usually associated with the research approach, the etiological coherence of co-occurrence, and the obscurity or absence of diagnostic criteria for mental disorders due to a general medical condition or drugs, age, etc. This review aims to investigate contemporary epidemiological data on mental and somatic comorbidity. RECENT FINDINGS The frequent co-occurrence of certain physical diseases and certain mental disorders is corroborated by contemporary epidemiological data. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, respiratory disorders, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders seem to be associated with mental disorders; the rates of occurrence, however, depend on the special characteristics of the sample. Utilization of healthcare systems and costs for patients with mental-somatic comorbidities are suggested to be higher than those for patients without comorbidities. SUMMARY Although it is generally accepted that many physical conditions have been associated with serious mental disorders, the exact nature of the relationship between them is still unclear. Various factors such as unhealthy lifestyle habits, psychotropic medication, and inadequate medical treatment or provision are implicated.

Our goal was to statistically link mutations to severe disease outcome. We used an automated machine learning approach where 1594 viral genomes with available clinical follow-up data were used as the training set (797 'severe' and 797 'mild'). The best algorithm, based on random forest classification combined with the LASSO feature selection algorithm, was employed to the training set to link mutation signatures and outcome. The performance of the final model was estimated by repeated, stratified, 10-fold cross validation (CV) and then adjusted for multiple testing with Bootstrap Bias Corrected CV. We identified 26 protein and Untranslated Region (UTR) mutations significantly linked to severe outcome. The best classification algorithm uses a mutation signature of 22 mutations as well as the patient's age as the input and shows high classification efficiency with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 [confidence interval (CI): [0.912, 0.962]] and a prediction accuracy of 87% (CI: [0.830, 0.903]). Finally, we established an online platform (https://covidoutcome.com/) that is capable to use a viral sequence and the patient's age as the input and provides a percentage estimation of disease severity. We demonstrate a statistical association between mutation signatures of SARS-CoV-2 and severe outcome of COVID-19.

We examined trends in the hospitalised cases and tested the assumption that the low severity of disease had been related to the relatively young population affected. METHODS: All patients with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 admitted from February to April 2020 were divided into: i) imported cases, ii) locally-transmitted cases outside migrant worker dormitories and iii) migrant worker dormitory cases, and were examined for underlying comorbidities, clinical progress and outcomes. RESULTS: Imported cases (n = 29) peaked in mid-March 2020, followed by local cases (n = 100) in mid-April 2020; migrant worker cases (n = 425) continued to increase in late April 2020. Migrant worker cases were younger, with few medical comorbidities, and had less severe disease. As the migrant worker cases increased, the proportion of patients with pneumonia decreased, whilst patients presenting earlier in their illness and asymptomatic disease became more common. CONCLUSION: Singapore experienced a substantial shift in the population at risk of severe COVID-19. Successful control in the community protected an aging population. Large migrant worker dormitory outbreaks occurred, but the disease incurred was less severe, resulting in Singapore having one of the lowest case fatality rates in the world.","output":"Demographic shift in COVID-19 patients in Singapore from an aged, at-risk population to young, migrant workers with reduced risk of severe disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The expansion of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has now procured on epidemic percentages, affecting more than 190 nations in a matter of weeks.

Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine potential mediating factors. Prevalence of burnout was notable, with 52% recording moderate/severe in Emotional Exhaustion, 19.5% moderate/severe in Depersonalisation, and 55.5% low/moderate Personal Accomplishment. Over half of all respondents (52%) experienced sleep problems; the presence of depressive symptoms was a significant predictor of insomnia.

The long-term psychological impact, of both the spread of the virus and the restrictive policies adopted to counteract it, remains uncertain. However, recent studies reported a high level of psychological distress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The purpose of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of a new questionnaire, to evaluate PTSD risk related to the COVID-19 emergency. A total of Italian people completed a web-based cross-sectional survey broadcasted through different social-media. Demographic data and some psychological dimensions, such as general distress and sleep disturbance, were collected. A new self-report questionnaire (COVID-19-PTSD), consisting of 19 items, was developed starting from the PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5) questionnaire, and it was administered in order to analyze its psychometric properties. The results highlighted the adequate psychometric properties of the COVID-19-PTSD questionnaire. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a seven-factor model (Intrusion, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Dysphoric arousal, Anxious arousal and Externalizing behavior) best fits the data. Significant correlations were found among COVID-19-PTSD scores, general distress and sleep disturbance. A high percentage of PTSD symptomatology (29.5%) was found in the Italian population. COVID-19-PTSD appears to be effective in evaluating the specific stress symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian population. These results are relevant from a clinical point of view because they suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could be considered as a traumatic event.

As a result, surge models that rely on case counts to forecast hospital demand may be inaccurately influencing policy and decision-maker action. OBJECTIVE: Based on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence data derived from a statewide random sample (as opposed to relying on reported case counts), we determine the infection-hospitalization ratio (IHR), defined as the percentage of infected individuals who are hospitalized, for various demographic groups in Indiana. Furthermore, for comparison, we show the extent to which case-based hospitalization ratios, compared with the IHR, overestimate the probability of hospitalization by demographic group. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of statewide prevalence data from Indiana, COVID-19 hospitalization data extracted from a statewide health information exchange, and all reported COVID-19 cases to the state health department. SETTING: State of Indiana as of April 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic-stratified IHRs and case-hospitalization ratios. RESULTS: The overall IHR was 2.1% and varied more by age than by race or sex. Infection-hospitalization ratio estimates ranged from 0.4% for those younger than 40 years to 9.2% for those older than 60 years. Hospitalization rates based on case counts overestimated the IHR by a factor of 10, but this overestimation differed by demographic groups, especially age.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, self-administered web-based survey of a convenience sample of 2257 adults reporting recent exposure to tear gas in Portland, Oregon (U.S.), administered between July 30, 2020-August 20, 2020. Descriptive analyses were conducted on socioeconomic characteristics, reported health issues, utilization of healthcare services, and frequency of reported exposure to tear gas. Associations between reported mental health issues, healthcare utilization and race and/or ethnic categories were assessed using a chi-square test. For tests of association, racial and/or ethnic categories were divided into White/Non-Hispanic only and all other racial/ethnic categories due to a small number of Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic participants and participants with multiple race and/or ethnic background. Effect sizes for the differences were expressed as Cramers V, a metric that measures associations between nominal responses. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to assess the relationship between health issues and the number of reported days of exposure to tear gas (i.e., a proxy dose of exposure) grouped into 1 day, 2C4 days, and  5 days. Missing data (item non-response) were omitted from the analysis. RESULTS: Almost all respondents (2116; 93.8%) reported physical (2114; 93.7%) or psychological (1635; 72.4%) health issues experienced immediately after (2105; 93.3%) or days following (1944; 86.1%) the exposure.

Subsequently, after 26 days from LAAO procedure, he was admitted to the emergency department for haematic cardiac tamponade. The patient was successfully treated with subxyphoidal pericardiocentesis in the acute phase, unfortunately cardiac arrest occurred during the transfer to the referral hospital for urgent cardiac surgery. Permanent neurological damage was reported and the patient died on day 28. DISCUSSION: LAAO late-onset complications are very rare and the case presented is the first case described of late-onset pericardial effusion and tamponade secondary to the Cardia Ultraseal LAAO device implantation. We present a revision of the literature regarding the occurrence of similar adverse events and discuss the hypothetical mechanism of this major complication.","output":"Left atrial appendage closure device complicated by late-onset pericardial effusion and tamponade: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intrinsic disorder (i.e., lack of a unique 3-D structure) is a common phenomenon, and many biologically active proteins are disordered as a whole, or contain long disordered regions. These intrinsically disordered proteins/regions constitute a significant part of all proteomes, and their functional repertoire is complementary to functions of ordered proteins. In fact, intrinsic disorder represents an important driving force for many specific functions. An illustrative example of such disorder-centric functional class is RNA-binding proteins. In this study, we present the results of comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of the abundance and roles of intrinsic disorder in 3,411 ribosomal proteins from 32 species. We show that many ribosomal proteins are intrinsically disordered or hybrid proteins that contain ordered and disordered domains. Predicted globular domains of many ribosomal proteins contain noticeable regions of intrinsic disorder. We also show that disorder in ribosomal proteins has different characteristics compared to other proteins that interact with RNA and DNA including overall abundance, evolutionary conservation, and involvement in proteinCprotein interactions. Furthermore, intrinsic disorder is not only abundant in the ribosomal proteins, but we demonstrate that it is absolutely necessary for their various functions.

This qualitative study aimed to define and characterize higher-order cognitive competencies required to safely perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. STUDY DESIGN Hierarchical and cognitive task analyses for establishing a critical view of safety during laparoscopic cholecystectomy were performed using qualitative methods to map the thoughts and practices that characterize expert performance. Experts with more than 5 years of experience, and who have performed at least 100 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, participated in semi-structured interviews and field observations. Verbal data were transcribed verbatim, supplemented with content from published literature, coded, thematically analyzed using grounded-theory by 2 independent reviewers, and synthesized into a list of items. RESULTS A conceptual framework was created based on 10 interviews with experts, 9 procedures, and 18 literary sources. Experts included 6 minimally invasive surgeons, 2 hepato-pancreatico-biliary surgeons, and 2 acute care general surgeons (median years in practice, 11 [range 8 to 14]). One hundred eight cognitive elements (35 [32%] related to situation awareness, 47 [44%] involving decision-making, and 26 [24%] action-oriented subtasks) and 75 potential errors were identified and categorized into 6 general themes and 14 procedural tasks. Of the 75 potential errors, root causes were mapped to errors in situation awareness (24 [32%]), decision-making (49 [65%]), or either one (61 [81%]). CONCLUSIONS This study defines the competencies that are essential to establishing a critical view of safety and avoiding bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

The study surveyed 674 adults in Malaysia in May 2020 regarding whether the time spent on social media predicted handwashing contingent on gender and number of children. More time spent on social media was positively associated with handwashing for males with three or more children. However, for males without children, social media use was negatively associated with handwashing. The association was not significant for males with one or two children. For females, more time spent on social media was significantly linked to more handwashing only for females with one child. Gender, a traditional predictor of handwashing, was a useful predictor only for those who spent more than three hours per day on social media and had at most one child. Number of children was a novel negative predictor for males who did not use social media and who averaged one hour per day on social media, a positive predictor for males who spent lots of time on social media, but not a predictor for females. In sum, social media use predicts handwashing, and is thus a helpful variable for use in targeted health communication during a pandemic C particularly through social media.

Such diseases spread mainly through person-to-person contacts. Health care authorities recommend contact tracing procedures to prevent the spread to a vast population. Although several mobile applications have been developed to trace contacts, they typically require collection of privacy-intrusive information such as GPS locations, and the logging of privacy-sensitive data on a third party server, or require additional infrastructure such as WiFi APs with known locations. In this paper, we introduce CONTAIN, a privacy-oriented mobile contact tracing application that does not rely on GPS or any other form of infrastructure-based location sensing, nor the continuous logging of any other personally identifiable information on a server. The goal of CONTAIN is to allow users to determine with complete privacy if they have been within a short distance, specifically, Bluetooth wireless range, of someone that is infected, and potentially also when. We identify and prove the privacy guarantees provided by our approach.

METHODS: The present study is a cross\\\\sectional study conducted on 358 students who were currently studying at the Kashan University of Medical Sciences. The students who were pregnant or had a special diet to follow were excluded. Samples were selected by the systematic method. Food security was measured using United States Department of Agriculture. Food Frequency Questionnaire, 21\\\\items Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, and Socioeconomic Questionnaire were used to investigate the nutrients intake, depression/anxiety status, and socioeconomic factors, respectively. Chi\\\\square, independent t\\\\test, and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Based on the findings of the present study, 16.8% of students experienced different levels of food insecurity, and 83.2% of participants were categorized as food secure. Gender, financial assistance, health insurance, depression, and students' occupation are associated with food insecurity (P < .05). Additionally, the results of the logistic regression analysis showed that depression (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01\\\\1.07), and students' jobs (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23\\\\0.80) have the greatest impact on students' food insecurity. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study show that economic factors and gender have a significant impact on students' food security.

Though its transmission was essentially attributed to droplets from an infected person, with recent advancements in knowledge, aerosol transmission seems to be a viable pathway, as well. Because of the lower biological load in ambient aerosol, detection of SARS-CoV-2 is challenging. A few recent attempts of sampling large aerosol volumes and using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air at very low levels gave positive results. These results suggest the potential of using this technique to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and use it as an early warning signal for possible outbreak or recurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AIM: To assess efficacy of comprehensive respiratory viral panel (CRVP) sequencing and RT-PCR for low-level identification of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in indoor air. METHODS: A large volume of indoor aerosol samples from three major hospitals involved in COVID-19 care in Kuwait was collected. Viral RNA was isolated and subjected to comprehensive respiratory viral panel sequencing (CRVP) as per the standard protocol to detect the SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in the hospital aerosol and monitor variations within the sequences. RT-PCR was also employed to estimate the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: 13 of 15 (86.7%) samples exhibited SARS-CoV-2 with a relative abundance of 0.2C33.3%. The co-occurrence of human adenoviruses (type C1, C2, C5, C4), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza B, and non-SARS-CoV-229E were also recorded. Alignment of SARS-CoV-2 sequences against the reference strain of Wuhan China revealed variations in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs-17), insertions and deletions (indels-1). These variations were predicted to create missense (16), synonymous (15), frameshift (1) and stop-gained (1) mutations with a high (2), low (15), and moderate (16) impact. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that using CRVP on a large volume aerosol sample was a valuable tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in indoor aerosols of health care settings. Owing to its higher sensitivity, it can be employed as a surveillance strategy in the post COVID times to act as an early warning system to possibly control future outbreaks.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in hospital air as revealed by comprehensive respiratory viral panel sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several social injustice issues, well known within the Black community, were brought to light to other ethnic/racial groups in 2020 and could no longer be ignored within the academic community.

The biomarkers of inflammation have been used to risk-stratify patients with COVID-19. Osteopontin (OPN) is an integrin-binding glyco-phosphoprotein involved in the modulation of leukocyte activation; its levels are associated with worse outcomes in patients with sepsis. Whether OPN levels predict outcomes in COVID-19 is unknown. Methods: We measured OPN levels in serum of 341 hospitalized COVID-19 patients collected within 48 h from admission. We characterized the determinants of OPN levels and examined their association with in-hospital outcomes; notably death, need for mechanical ventilation, and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and as a composite outcome. The risk discrimination ability of OPN was compared with other inflammatory biomarkers. Results: Patients with COVID-19 (mean age 60, 61.9% male, 27.0% blacks) had significantly higher levels of serum OPN compared to healthy volunteers (96.63 vs. 16.56 ng/mL, p < 0.001). Overall, 104 patients required mechanical ventilation, 35 needed dialysis, and 53 died during their hospitalization. In multivariable analyses, OPN levels 140.66 ng/mL (third tertile) were associated with a 3.5  (95%CI 1.44C8.27) increase in the odds of death, and 4.9  (95%CI 2.48C9.80) increase in the odds of requiring mechanical ventilation. There was no association between OPN and need for RRT. Finally, OPN levels in the upper tertile turned out as an independent prognostic factor of event-free survival with respect to the composite endpoint. Conclusion: Higher OPN levels are associated with increased odds of death and mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19, however, their utility in triage is questionable.","output":"Circulating Osteopontin Levels and Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore public attitudes to COVID-19 vaccines in the UK, focused on intentions and decisions around taking vaccines, views on 'vaccine passports', and experiences and perspectives on post-vaccination behaviour. DESIGN: Qualitative study consisting of 6 online focus groups conducted between 15th March - 22nd April 2021. SETTING: Online video conferencing PARTICIPANTS: 29 adult UK-based participants RESULTS: Three main groups regarding participants' decision or intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were identified: (1) Accepters, (2) Delayers and (3) Refusers. Two reasons for vaccine delay were identified: delay due to a perceived need more information and delay until vaccine was 'required' in the future. Three main facilitators (Vaccination as a social norm; Vaccination as a necessity; Trust in science) and six barriers (Preference for 'natural immunity'; Concerns over possible side effects; Distrust in government; Perceived lack of information; Conspiracy theories; 'Covid echo chambers') to vaccine uptake were identified. For some delayers, vaccine passports were perceived to be a reason why they would get vaccinated in the future. However, vaccine passports were controversial, and were framed in three main ways: as 'a necessary evil'; as 'Orwellian'; and as a 'human rights problem'. Participants generally felt that receiving a vaccine was not changing the extent to which people were adhering to COVID-19 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, positive sentiment toward vaccines was high. However, there remains a number of potential barriers which might be leading to vaccine delay in some. 'Vaccine delay' might be a more useful and precise construct than vaccine hesitancy in explaining why some may initially ignore or be uncertain about vaccination invitations. Vaccine passports may increase or 'nudge' uptake in some delayers but remain controversial.

Briefly, statins could modulate virus entry, acting on the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, ACE2 and CD147, and/or lipid rafts engagement. Statins, by inducing autophagy activation, could regulate virus replication or degradation, exerting protective effects. The well-known anti-inflammatory properties of statins, by blocking several molecular mechanisms, including NF-&#954;B and NLRP3 inflammasomes, could limit the \\"cytokine storm\\" in severe COVID-19 patients which is linked to fatal outcome. Finally, statin moderation of coagulation response activation may also contribute to improving COVID-19 outcomes.

We evaluate the performance of an automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to triage retinal images from the English Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP) into test-positive/technical failure versus test-negative, using human grading following a standard national protocol as the reference standard. METHODS: Retinal images from 30 405 consecutive screening episodes from three English DESPs were manually graded following a standard national protocol and by an automated process with machine learning enabled software, EyeArt v2.1. Screening performance (sensitivity, specificity) and diagnostic accuracy (95% CIs) were determined using human grades as the reference standard. RESULTS: Sensitivity (95% CIs) of EyeArt was 95.7% (94.8% to 96.5%) for referable retinopathy (human graded ungradable, referable maculopathy, moderate-to-severe non-proliferative or proliferative). This comprises sensitivities of 98.3% (97.3% to 98.9%) for mild-to-moderate non-proliferative retinopathy with referable maculopathy, 100% (98.7%,100%) for moderate-to-severe non-proliferative retinopathy and 100% (97.9%,100%) for proliferative disease. EyeArt agreed with the human grade of no retinopathy (specificity) in 68% (67% to 69%), with a specificity of 54.0% (53.4% to 54.5%) when combined with non-referable retinopathy. CONCLUSION: The algorithm demonstrated safe levels of sensitivity for high-risk retinopathy in a real-world screening service, with specificity that could halve the workload for human graders. AI machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as this can provide clinically equivalent, rapid detection of retinopathy, particularly in settings where a trained workforce is unavailable or where large-scale and rapid results are needed.","output":"Prospective evaluation of an artificial intelligence-enabled algorithm for automated diabetic retinopathy screening of 30 000 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Studies have shown that lung inflammation affects lung function, with life-threatening results. Vitamin D may play an important role in inhibiting inflammatory cytokines.

The key objective of this study is to identify and describe, within the probabilistic approach, the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 test numbers and the mortality and morbidity rates. METHODS: The study is based on a statistical analysis of 1058 monthly observations relating to 107 countries, from six different continents, in an 11-month period from March 2020 to January 2021. The variable utilised can be defined as the number of tests performed in a given country in 1 month, to the number of cases reported in a prior month and morbidities and mortalities per 1 million population. The probabilities of different mortality and morbidity rates for different test numbers were determined by moving percentiles and fitted by the power law and by the three-segment piecewise-linear approximation based on Theil Sen trend lines. RESULTS: We have identified that for a given probability the dependence of mortality and morbidity rates on SARS-CoV-2 test rates follows a power law and it is well approximated by the three Theil Sen trend lines in the three test rate ranges. In all these ranges Spearman rho and Kendall tau-b rank correlation coefficients of test numbers and morbidity with fatality rates have values between ? 0.5 and ? 0.12 with p-values below 0.002.

METHODS: This study employed a cross-over design in healthy female volunteers. Twenty-five milligrams of melatonin was administered intravenously, intravesically, rectally, transdermally, and vaginally. Blood samples were collected at specified time points up to 24 h following intravenous, intravesical, rectal, and vaginal administration, and up to 48 h following transdermal administration. Plasma melatonin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Sedation was evaluated by a simple reaction-time test, and sleepiness was assessed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Adverse events were registered for each route of administration. RESULTS: Ten participants were included. We documented a mean (SD) time to maximal concentration of 51 (29) min for intravesical, 24 (20) min for rectal, 21 (8) h for transdermal, and 147 (56) min for vaginal administration. The mean (SD) elimination half-life was 47 (6) min for intravenous, 58 (7) min for intravesical, 60 (18) min for rectal, 14.6 (11.1) h for transdermal, and 129 (17) min for vaginal administration. The mean (SD) bioavailability was 3.6 (1.9)% for intravesical, 36.0 (28.6)% for rectal, 10.0 (5.7)% for transdermal, and 97.8 (31.7)% for vaginal administration. No significant changes in reaction times were observed following administration of melatonin by any of the administration routes. Increased tiredness was documented following transdermal administration only. No serious adverse effects were documented. CONCLUSION: Rectally and vaginally administered melatonin may serve as relevant alternatives to standard oral melatonin therapy. Transdermal delivery of melatonin displayed an extended absorption and can be applied if prolonged effects are intended. Intravesical administration displayed, as expected, a very limited bioavailability. Melatonin administered by these routes of administration was safe.","output":"Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Intravenous, Intravesical, Rectal, Transdermal, and Vaginal Melatonin in Healthy Female Volunteers: A Cross-Over Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The microNet (Net) project aims at the development of an extended network of educational cosmic ray telescopes in the geographical area of western Greece.

RESULTS: Here, we describe VIRUSBreakend, a high-speed tool that identifies viral DNA presence and genomic integration. It utilizes single breakends, breakpoints in which only one side can be unambiguously placed, in a novel virus-centric variant calling and assembly approach to identify viral integrations with high sensitivity and a near-zero false discovery rate.

The etiological agent of COVID-19 is the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory system's epithelial cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, causing from non or mild symptoms to severe viral pneumonia, and in some cases, death. Based on evolving clinical evidence, it is now unfitting to label SARS-CoV-2 as just a respiratory virus, as lately, various reports substantiate its pathogenicity in other organs of the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). Despite conflicting results regarding ACE2 expression in brain tissue, the latest data show that ACE2 is robustly expressed by CNS cells, suggesting that CNS is a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type within the CNS and play a role in axon guidance and synaptic support, control the blood-brain barrier flow, and regulate neuroinflammation. To test if SARS-CoV-2 can enter into the CNS via astrocytes and then elicit adverse neurological effects, we have initiated studies to test if astrocytes express ACE2 and whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect human astrocytes via this receptor. We have found that astrocytes robustly express ACE2 at the mRNA and protein levels. We are currently testing if astrocytes are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could subsequently lead to neuronal damage and possibly account for some of the neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients.

However, there have been increasing reports of myopericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, especially among adolescents and young adults. We aimed to characterise the incidence of myopericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, and compare this with non-COVID-19 vaccination. Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching four international databases from Jan 1, 1947, to Dec 31, 2021, for studies in English reporting on the incidence of myopericarditis following vaccination (the primary outcome). We included studies reporting on people in the general population who had myopericarditis in temporal relation to receiving vaccines, and excluded studies on a specific subpopulation of patients, non-human studies, and studies in which the number of doses was not reported. Random-effects meta-analyses (DerSimonian and Laird) were conducted, and the intra-study risk of bias (Joanna Briggs Institute checklist) and certainty of evidence (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach) were assessed. We analysed the difference in incidence of myopericarditis among subpopulations, stratifying by the type of vaccine (COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19) and age group (adult vs paediatric). Among COVID-19 vaccinations, we examined the effect of the type of vaccine (mRNA or non-mRNA), sex, age, and dose on the incidence of myopericarditis. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021275477). Findings The overall incidence of myopericarditis from 22 studies (405 272 721 vaccine doses) was 333 cases (95% CI 153C726) per million vaccine doses, and did not differ significantly between people who received COVID-19 vaccines (182 [109C303], 11 studies [395 361 933 doses], high certainty) and those who received non-COVID-19 vaccines (560 [107C2937], 11 studies [9 910 788 doses], moderate certainty, p=020). Compared with COVID-19 vaccination, the incidence of myopericarditis was significantly higher following smallpox vaccinations (1321 [813C2146], p<00001) but was not significantly different after influenza vaccinations (13 [00C8841], p=043) or in studies reporting on various other non-smallpox vaccinations (570 [11C30366], p=058). Among people who received COVID-19 vaccines, the incidence of myopericarditis was significantly higher in males (vs females), in people younger than 30 years (vs 30 years or older), after receiving an mRNA vaccine (vs non-mRNA vaccine), and after a second dose of vaccine (vs a first or third dose). Interpretation The overall risk of myopericarditis after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is low. However, younger males have an increased incidence of myopericarditis, particularly after receiving mRNA vaccines. Nevertheless, the risks of such rare adverse events should be balanced against the risks of COVID-19 infection (including myopericarditis).

AIM: The study aimed to assess food insecurity and its relationships with glycaemic control and other patient characteristics amongst diabetic patients attending Jabulani Dumani Community Health Centre. SETTING: The study was conducted in a primary healthcare facility in the south sub-district of Ekurhuleni health district, the Gauteng province, South Africa. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study involving 250 patients. Data were collected by using an interview-administered Household Food Insecurity Access Scale questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses by using Stata 14.0 statistical software were performed. Chi square and logistic regression tests assessed the association between socio-demographic characteristics, glycaemic control and food insecurity. RESULTS: Amongst 250 recruited participants, 82.4% were above 50 years, 64% women, 88.8% South African citizens and 42.4% had a household size of  5 people. Sixty-four percent and 69.9% were classified as having food insecurity and poor glycaemic control, respectively. On further analysis, food insecurity was associated with unemployment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51C5.75), being a South African citizen (AOR = 1.60; 95% CI: 0.66C3.86), household size of  5 people (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI: 0.98C3.19) and uncontrolled glycaemic level (AOR = 5.38; 95% CI: 2.91C9.96). CONCLUSION: Food insecurity in diabetic patients constitutes a serious challenge for glycaemic control. It is critical for healthcare providers in primary care settings to ensure screening for early identification and management of food insecurity and take measures to prevent poor glycaemic control.","output":"Food insecurity and its impact on glycaemic control in diabetic patients attending Jabulani Dumani community health centre, Gauteng province, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this note, we provide a step-by-step approach of Westerlund and Narayan (WN, 2012, 2015) predictability test using COVID-19 and oil price data.

In an online study (N = 271), we measured trait self-control, goal progress, continued engagement in pre-pandemic goal-directed behaviors, development of new goal-directed behaviors and turning these new behaviors into habits. Results showed that during lockdown, people with higher (vs. lower) trait self-control were not only more likely to continue engaging in pre-pandemic goal-directed behaviors, but also found it easier to develop new goal-directed behaviors and were more likely to turn these behaviors into habits.

Most lubricants, however, are still made from petroleum fractions. I light of this, and due to various environmental problems, the search for feasible biolubricants has become essential. This study obtained biolubricants through the in situ transesterification of microbial biomass, containing at least 20 wt% of lipids. The following two distinct biomasses were evaluated: the marine microalgae, Dunaliella salina, and the consortium of microalgae-fungi, Scenedesmus obliquus and Mucor circinelloides. Microbial oil from both biomasses presented a fatty acid profile with high amounts of oleic acid. The oil of D. salina had a lower content of polyunsaturated fatty acids relative to the microbial consortium profile, which indicates that this is a good configuration for increasing biolubricant oxidation resistance. The catalyst used was a Keggin-structure heteropolyacid supported on niobium, H3PMo12O40/Nb2O5, activated at 150 C, which had high transesterification yields, notwithstanding the feedstocks, which were rich in free fatty acids. The performed transesterification reactions resulted in excellent yields, up to 97.58% and 96.80%, for marine microalgae and the consortium, respectively, after 6 h at 250 C, with 10 wt% of catalyst (related to the lipid amount).

In this pilot study, we assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of CIPE delivered within 2 months after the index event. Thirty-three participants were randomised to CIPE or a waiting list (WL). The frequency, vividness and distress of intrusive recollections or flashback memories of the traumatic event were assessed using an intrusive memory smartphone app. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress were assessed by the PTSD Symptom Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). The most common index traumas in the sample were rape, interpersonal violence and life-threatening accidents.

Larger input amounts of bacteriophage Phi6 are shown to delay and protect the phage from environmental decay, both when the phages are dried in plastic tubes and when they are stored in saline solution at 4C. In contrast, when bacteriophage Phi6 is placed in LB (Luria-Bertani) growth medium (instead of saline) prior to placement on the plastic surface, the influence of the starting concentration on viral recovery is negligible. Protection is reflected in the phage half-lives at higher concentrations being longer than the half-lives at lower concentrations. Because experiments supporting the possibility of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses rely upon the survival of infectious virus following inoculation onto various surfaces, large initial amounts of input virus on a surface may generate artificially inflated survival times compared to realistic lower levels of virus that a subject would normally encounter. This is not only because there are extra half-lives to go through at higher concentrations but also because the half-lives themselves are extended at higher virus concentrations. It is important to design surface drying experiments for pathogens with realistic levels of input virus and to consider the role of the carrier and matrix if the results are to be clinically relevant. IMPORTANCE During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, much attention has been paid to the environmental decay of SARS-CoV-2 due to the proposed transmission of the virus via fomites. However, published experiments have commenced with inocula with very high virus titers, an experimental design not representative of real-life conditions. The study described here evaluated the impact of the initial virus titer on the environmental decay of an enveloped virus, using a nonpathogenic surrogate for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, enveloped bacteriophage Phi6. We establish that higher concentrations of virus can protect the virus from environmental decay, depending on conditions. This has important implications for stability studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. Our results point to a limitation in the fundamental methodology that has been used to attribute fomite transmission for almost all respiratory viruses.","output":"Higher Concentrations of Bacterial Enveloped Virus Phi6 Can Protect the Virus from Environmental Decay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission include masking in public places, physical distancing, staying home when ill, avoiding high-risk locations, using a contact tracing app, and being willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine.

We demonstrate how different types of charitable workers experiences affect their interactions with donors and thus the corresponding donation outcomes. Academic / Practical Relevance: Most of the existing charitable giving papers in the non-profit literature focus on the donor-side efforts to increase donations. There exists little evidence which illustrates the potential of improving charitable productivity from the side of charitable workers. Improving charitable productivity is important, and especially critical in the current COVID-19 pandemic, with severe blood shortages occurring due to heightened demand for blood and decreased number of blood donors. Methodology: Using a unique dataset at the nurse-donor interaction level, we analyze the role of nurse persuasion in driving charitable productivity as well as the moderating effect of nurse experience with donor physical capabilities and nurse workload.Results: We find that the persuasion ability of the nurse and physical dimension of donors play important roles in designing staffing to improve charitable productivity. The effect of staff persuasion strongly depends on the relevant, rather than general, experience of the nurse. Moreover, donors that are physically-disadvantaged are more likely to be influenced by nurse persuasion. Nurse persuasion may also reduce the negative effects of workload.Managerial Implications: When taking the insights on staffing-donor interactions into account, improved matching between nurses and donors can provide economically significant benefits for the blood bank.

Ozone and its precursors generally feature different diurnal patterns, which is closely related to atmospheric physical and chemical processes. This work aims to shed more light on the causes of ozone pollution from the perspective of the diurnal patterns. Hundreds of ozone pollution days (with maximum hourly O3 concentration over 100 ppb) during 2013C2017 were identified and then clustered into 4 typical types according to the diurnal variation patterns. We found that ozone pollution in Shanghai was particularly severe when anthropogenic pollutant mixed with biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) under the prevailing southwesterly wind in summer. The reason could be attributed to the spatial disparities of ozone sensitivity regime in YRD: VOC-limited regime around in the urban area and NOx-limited regime in the rural forest regions in the southern and southwest. The transition of sensitivity regimes along south/southwest wind tended to promote the photochemical production of ozone, making daily O3 pollution time exceeding 6 h of the day. In addition, ozone peak concentration in Shanghai was highly dependent on the evolution of sea-land breezes (SLBs). Earlier sea breeze associated with approaching typhoon in the West Pacific caused less cloud (?25%) and more solar radiation (11%) in YRD, which subsequently led to a rapid increase of O3 concentration in the morning and a deteriorated ozone pollution during noon and the afternoon.

However, there are individual differences in the level of emotion differentiation, and some individuals do not appear to differentiate much between different emotions. Low differentiation is associated with maladaptive outcomes, therefore such individuals might benefit from interventions that can increase their level of emotion differentiation. To this end, we tested the effects of an emotion knowledge intervention on the level of emotion differentiation. One hundred and twenty participants were assigned to either an experimental or a control condition. Emotion differentiation was assessed with a Scenario Rating Task before and after the intervention, and at follow-up. As predicted, negative emotion differentiation increased significantly after the emotion knowledge intervention, and this increase was not observed in the control group. Positive emotion differentiation also increased slightly; however, it did not reach significance level. This finding suggests that an emotion knowledge intervention might be beneficial for increasing negative emotion differentiation and may have implications for the clinical context.","output":"From Knowledge to Differentiation: Increasing Emotion Knowledge Through an Intervention Increases Negative Emotion Differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a challenge to every health system.

Despite the tremendous advances in anti-retroviral therapies (ART) and the implementation of ART regimens, HIV incidence (number of new infections over a defined period of time) and prevalence (the burden of HIV infection) in certain regions of the world and socio-economic groups are still on the rise. HIV continues to disproportionally affect highly marginalized populations that constitute higher-risk and stigmatized groups, underserved and/or neglected populations. In addition, it is not uncommon for PWH to suffer enhanced debilitating conditions resulting from the synergistic interactions of both communicable diseases (CDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). While research utilizing only a comorbidities framework has advanced our understanding of the biological settings of the co-occurring conditions from a molecular and mechanistic view, harmful interactions between comorbidities are often overlooked, particularly under adverse socio-economical and behavioral circumstances, likely prompting disease clustering in PWH. Synergistic epidemics (syndemics) research aims to capture these understudied interactions: the mainly non-biological aspects that are central to interpret disease clustering in the comorbidities/multi-morbidities only framework.

The respiratory system is most affected by injuries caused by COVID-19, but other organs may be involved, including the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE-2). ACE-2 is expressed not only in the lungs, but also in other organs, including the cardiovascular system. Several studies have found that a good percentage of patients with severe COVID-19 have cardiac lesions, including myocardial fibrosis, edema and pericarditis. Pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix caused by viral infection leads to myocardial fibrotic lesions. These fibrotic scars can cause cardiac dysfunction, reducing the ejection fraction caused by the presence of stiffened myocardial matrix, or cardiac arrhythmias that cause an alteration in the electrical conduction system of the heart. These cardiac dysfunctions can cause death. It is therefore essential to identify cardiac involvement early in order to act with appropriate therapeutic treatments.

Mobile health (mHealth) apps can help manage and prevent NCDs if people are willing to use them as supportive tools. Still, many people are reluctant to adopt these technologies. Implementing new apps could result in earlier intervention for many health conditions, preventing more serious complications. OBJECTIVE: This research project aimed to test the factors that facilitate the adoption of mHealth apps by users with NCDs. We focused on determining, first, what user interface (UI) qualities and complexity levels appeal to users in evaluating mHealth apps. We also wanted to determine whether people prefer that the data collected by an mHealth app be analyzed using a physician or an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. The contribution of this work is both theoretical and practical. We examined users considerations when adopting mHealth apps that promote healthy lifestyles and helped them manage their NCDs. Our results can also help direct mHealth app UI designers to focus on the most appealing aspects of our findings. METHODS: A total of 347 respondents volunteered to rate 3 models of mHealth apps based on 16 items that measured instrumentality, aesthetics, and symbolism. Respondents rated each model after reading 1 of 2 different scenarios. In one scenario, a physician analyzed the data, whereas, in the other, the data were analyzed by an AI algorithm. These scenarios tested the degree of trust people placed in AI algorithms versus the human touch of a human physician regarding analyzing data collected by an mHealth app. RESULTS: As shown by the responses, the involvement of a human physician in the application had a significant effect (P<.001) on the perceived instrumentality of the simple model. The complex model with more controls was rated significantly more aesthetic when associated with a physician performing data analysis rather than an AI algorithm (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Generally, when participants found a human touch in the mHealth app (connection to a human physician who they assumed would analyze their data), they judged the app more favorably. Simple models were evaluated more positively than complex ones, and aesthetics and symbolism were salient predictors of preference. These trends suggest that designers and developers of mHealth apps should keep the designs simple and pay special attention to aesthetics and symbolic value.","output":"Supporting Management of Noncommunicable Diseases With Mobile Health (mHealth) Apps: Experimental Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Host carbohydrates, or glycans, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many bacterial infections.

Because of the extraction of cholesterol leads to disorganization of lipid microdomains and to dissociation of proteins bound to the lipid rafts, we investigated the effect of cholesterol depletion by methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD) on caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV.1) in three important phases of virus infection such as binding, entry and post-entry. MCD treatment did not prejudice virus binding to cells, while a dose-dependent reduction of the virus yield was observed at the virus entry stage, and 30 mM MCD reduced infectivity evidently. Treatment of MDBK after virus entry revealed a moderate inhibitory effect suggesting that cholesterol is mainly required during virus entry rather than during the post-entry stage. Alteration of the envelope lipid composition affected virus entry and a noticeable reduction in virus infectivity was detected in the presence of 15 mM MCD. Considering that the recognition of a host cell receptor is a crucial step in the start-up phase of infection, these data are essential for the study of CpHV.1 pathogenesis.

Additional analysis using the validated technology acceptance model (TAM) was performed to test the potential applications of these technologies after the pandemic. The study objectives were as follows: (1) to assess the use of telehealth (telephone and video technologies) for different SUD services during COVID-19 in May-June 2020, (2) to assess the intended applications of telehealth for SUD services beyond COVID-19, (3) to evaluate the perceived ease of use and value of telehealth for delivering SUD services, and (4) to assess organizational readiness for the sustained use of telehealth services. METHODS: An online survey on the use of telephonic and video services was distributed between May and August 2020 to measure the current use of these services, perceived organizational readiness to use these services, and the intent to use these services after COVID-19. In total, 8 of 10 regional Addiction Technology Transfer Centers representing 43 states distributed the survey. Individual organizations were the unit of analysis. RESULTS: In total, 457 organizations responded to the survey. Overall, the technology was widely used; >70% (n>335) of organizations reported using telephone or video platforms for most services. The odds of the intent of organizations to use these technologies to deliver services post COVID-19 were significantly greater for all but two services (ie, telephonic residential counseling and buprenorphine therapy; mean odds ratio 3.79, range 1.87-6.98).

METHODS: Quality assurance was evaluated by chart review over a 5-year period to compare the prevalence of hypocalcemia and APR to published data. A quality improvement (QI) initiative consisting of process changes including the addition of an endocrine RN to coordinate infusions and a shift to patient/family self-scheduling of infusions was conducted. The effect of the interventions on safety (completion of pre- and post-infusion bloodwork) and efficacy (receipt of all prescribed infusions) outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients received 244 infusions over the period. The frequency of hypocalcemia (22%) and APR (31%) was consistent with prior reports. 99% of patients received pre-infusion bloodwork, 78% received post-first-infusion bloodwork, and 47% received all prescribed infusions.

RESULTS: Patients assessed were aged from 0 to 76 years; 36/68 were female. Peaks of clinical assessments coincided with updates to the case definition for suspected COVID-19. Microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2, mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, non-SARS/MERS coronaviruses and rhinovirus/enterovirus. Nine of sixty-eight received antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted, 5 due to inability to self-isolate. Patients requiring admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were more likely to have fever or raised respiratory rate compared to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had mild illness, which did not require clinical intervention. This finding supports a community testing approach, supported by clinicians able to review more unwell patients. Extensions of the epidemiological criteria for the case definition of suspected COVID-19 lead to increased screening intensity; strategies must be in place to accommodate this in time for forthcoming changes as the epidemic develops.","output":"Sixty-eight consecutive patients assessed for COVID-19 infection: Experience from a UK Regional infectious diseases Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are an emerging class of targeted protein degraders that coopt the intracellular degradation machinery to selectively deplete their respective targets. PROTACs act as bifunctional degraders that comprise ubiquitin E3 ligase- and target-binding moieties connected by chemical linkers with appropriate physicochemical properties. Through this bivalent structure, PROTACs induce the degradation of their targets via proximity-based pharmacology. Compared to conventional inhibitors, PROTACs exhibit superior pharmacologic properties with respect to efficacy, potency, selectivity, durability of response, and efficacy against undruggable proteins. Over the last few years, the scientific community has witnessed significant endeavors to advance this field and expand the armamentarium of PROTACs. In this perspective, we highlight these advances with an emphasis on emerging PROTAC variants, PROTACtability and degradability of protein targets, expression-guided PROTACs, multivalent PROTACs, preclinical resistance, candidates evaluated in clinical trials, and prospects for the use of PROTACs as a therapeutic modality.","output":"New frontiers in the discovery and development of PROTACs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of cellular metabolism and can be either beneficial, at low levels, or deleterious, at high levels, to the cell. It is known that several viral infections can increase oxidative stress, which is mainly facilitated by viral-induced imbalances in the antioxidant defence mechanisms of the cell. While the exact role of ROS in certain viral infections (adenovirus and dengue virus) remains unknown, other viruses can use ROS for enhancement of pathogenesis (SARS coronavirus and rabies virus) or replication (rhinovirus, West Nile virus and vesicular stomatitis virus) or both (hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and influenza virus). While several viral proteins (mainly for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus) have been identified to play a role in ROS formation, most mediators of viral ROS modulation are yet to be elucidated. Treatment of viral infections, including hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and influenza virus, with ROS inhibitors has shown a decrease in both pathogenesis and viral replication both in vitro and in animal models.

In order to anticipate the reinstatement of delayed interventions, surgical activity reduction analysis is essential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction of urological surgery in adult during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. Material: The data regarding urological procedures realized in the 8 academic urological departments of Parisians centres (AP-HP) were compared over two similar periods (14-29 March 2019 and 12-27 March 2020) using the centralized surgical planning software shared by these centres. Procedure title, type of surgery and outpatient ratio were collected. The interventions were sorted into 16 major families of urological interventions. Results: Overall, a 55% decrease was observed concerning urological procedures over the same period between 2019 and 2020 (995 and 444 procedures respectively). Oncology activity and emergencies decreased by 31% and 44%. The number of kidney transplantations decreased from 39 to 3 (-92%). Functional, andrological and genital surgical procedures were the most impacted among the non-oncological procedures (-85%, -81% and -71% respectively). Approximatively 1033 hours of surgery have been delayed during this 16-day period. Conclusion: Lockdown and postponement of non-urgent scheduled urological procedures decisions has led to a drastic decrease in surgical activity in AP-HP. Isolated Kidney transplantation has been stopped (national statement).

A whole-body PBPK model was created to simulate 100 adult individuals aged 18-60 years. Physiological changes (e.g., plasma protein concentration, liver size, CP450 expression, hepatic blood flow) and portal vein shunt were incorporated into the LD model. The changes were implemented by using the Child-Pugh (CP) classification system. DEX was qualified using clinical data in healthy adults for both oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) administrations and similarly propranolol (PRO) and midazolam (MDZ) were qualified with PO and IV clinical data in healthy and LD adults. The qualified model was subsequently used to simulate a 6 mg PO and 20 mg IV dose of DEX in patients with varying degrees of LD, with and without shunting. The PBPK model was successfully qualified across DEX, MDZ and PRO. In contrast to healthy adults, the simulated systemic clearance of DEX decreased (35% - 60%) and the plasma concentrations increased (170% - 400%) in patients with LD. Moreover, at higher doses of DEX, the AUC ratio between healthy/LD individuals remained comparable to lower doses. The exposure of DEX in different stages of LD was predicted through PBPK modelling, providing a rational framework to predict PK in complex clinical scenarios related to COVID-19. Model simulations suggest dose adjustments of DEX in LD patients are not necessary considering the low dose administered in the COVID-19 protocol.","output":"PBPK modelling of dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 and liver disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Convective warming is effective in maintaining core temperature under anesthesia. It may increase evaporative water loss (EWL). If significant, further investigation of warming modifications to minimize this impact would be warranted. OBJECTIVES To quantify EWL in two groups of children (warmed and nonwarmed) having surgical procedures under anesthesia. METHODS We performed an observational study of well children having general anesthesia for elective surgical procedures lasting 60 min. They were recruited sequentially to each of three age groups: 1-12 months, 13 months-5 years, and 5-12 years--with each age group divided into convectively warmed (43C) and nonwarmed (21C) subgroups. Evaporative heat loss (EHL) was calculated from accurate measurement of net EWL during the surgical period. RESULTS Sixty children were studied. As a percentage of body mass, mean EWLs were 0.29 (warmed) and 0.09 (nonwarmed). Using an ancova model, only procedure duration had a significant impact and explained why the extended procedural time in some convectively warmed children led to higher mean EWLs for that group. For the nonwarmed group, the mean Tcore drop was 1.27C with a contribution from EWL of 0.6C over ~70 min. CONCLUSIONS Within the age range 1 month-12 years, EHL is not significantly influenced by convective heating under anesthesia. There is no thermal advantage in exploring technique modifications such as humidifying the warming air. Previous estimates of the contribution of EHL to total heat loss in anesthetized children may require revision.","output":"The effect of convective heating on evaporative heat loss in anesthetized children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although several international guidelines recommend early over late intubation of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this issue is still controversial. We aimed to investigate the effect (if any) of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched, while references and preprint servers were explored, for relevant articles up to December 26, 2020, to identify studies which reported on mortality and/or morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing early versus late intubation. \\"Early\\" was defined as intubation within 24 h from intensive care unit (ICU) admission, while \\"late\\" as intubation at any time after 24 h of ICU admission. All-cause mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were the primary outcomes of the meta-analysis. Pooled risk ratio (RR), pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222147). RESULTS: A total of 12 studies, involving 8944 critically ill patients with COVID-19, were included. There was no statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality between patients undergoing early versus late intubation (3981 deaths; 45.4% versus 39.1%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.15, p = 0.08). This was also the case for duration of MV (1892 patients; MD - 0.58 days, 95% CI - 3.06 to 1.89 days, p = 0.65). In a sensitivity analysis using an alternate definition of early/late intubation, intubation without versus with a prior trial of high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive mechanical ventilation was still not associated with a statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality (1128 deaths; 48.9% versus 42.5%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99-1.25, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The synthesized evidence suggests that timing of intubation may have no effect on mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients with COVID-19. These results might justify a wait-and-see approach, which may lead to fewer intubations. Relevant guidelines may therefore need to be updated.","output":"Effect of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized cohort studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) are the major components of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and chronic exposure is recognized to enhance respiratory system complications. Although the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be associated with the PMs, the mechanism by which exposure to DEP increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under discussion. However, diesel fine PM (dPM) elevate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it coincides with the increase in the number of ACE2 receptors. Expression of ACE2 and its colocalized activator, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the alveolar epithelial cells exposed to dPM. Thus, the coexistence of PM and SARS-CoV-2 in the environment augments inflammation and exacerbates lung damage.

First, we review the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic on mental health, which shows high rates of psychological distress and early warning signs of an increase in mental health disorders. Second, we assess the responses in different countries, noting the swift and diverse responses to address mental health in some countries, particularly through the development of national COVID-19 response plans for mental health services, implementation of WHO guidance, and deployment of digital platforms, signifying a welcome recognition of the salience of mental health. Third, we consider the opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine global mental health, especially through shifting the balance of power from high-income countries to LMICs and from narrow biomedical approaches to community-oriented psychosocial perspectives, in setting priorities for interventions and research. Finally, we present a vision for the concept of building back better the mental health systems in LMICs with a focus on key strategies; notably, fully integrating mental health in plans for universal health coverage, enhancing access to psychosocial interventions through task sharing, leveraging digital technologies for various mental health tasks, eliminating coercion in mental health care, and addressing the needs of neglected populations, such as children and people with substance use disorders.

However, there are few antiviral drugs that can effectively treat these infections. The standard approach in the development of antiviral drugs involves the identification of a unique viral target, followed by the design of an agent that addresses that target. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a novel source of potential antiviral drugs. AMPs have been shown to inactivate numerous different enveloped viruses through the disruption of their viral envelopes. However, the clinical development of AMPs as antimicrobial therapeutics has been hampered by a number of factors, especially their enzymatically labile structure as peptides. We have examined the antiviral potential of peptoid mimics of AMPs (sequence-specific N-substituted glycine oligomers). These peptoids have the distinct advantage of being insensitive to proteases, and also exhibit increased bioavailability and stability. Our results demonstrate that several peptoids exhibit potent in vitro antiviral activity against both HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 when incubated prior to infection. In other words, they have a direct effect on the viral structure, which appears to render the viral particles non-infective. Visualization by cryo-EM shows viral envelope disruption similar to what has been observed with AMP activity against other viruses. Furthermore, we observed no cytotoxicity against primary cultures of oral epithelial cells. These results suggest a common or biomimetic mechanism, possibly due to the differences between the phospholipid head group makeup of viral envelopes and host cell membranes, thus underscoring the potential of this class of molecules as safe and effective broad-spectrum antiviral agents.

Conclusion The half-year follow-up of prospective COVID19+ cohort, treated for early-stage BC demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile with few low-grade adverse events. It seems that the COVID 19 infection does not appear to increase the side effects of RT. Therefore, the RT should not be delayed.","output":"Assessment of Side Effects of Radiation Therapy in Patients With COVID-19 Treated for Early-Stage Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Le 29 fvrier 2020, les services de Maladies Infectieuses et de Mdecine Polyvalente de notre tablissement ont ouvert un Centre Ambulatoire de Maladies Infectieuses charg initialement du diagnostic COVID des patients symptomatiques.

From a few 2D microscopy scans, we determine the statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, the spatial properties, and the distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in the construction of the 3D model. Once all the imaging evidence is incorporated into the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining the rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, and their distances and orientations relative to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization as a visual-programming feedback loop. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a use case of the modeling procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 virion ultrastructure.

METHODS From 58 patients referred for neurorehabilitation, 43 were eligible for and participated in the present study. Before and after 8 weeks of rehabilitation, patients underwent physical, neuropsychological and respiratory evaluations and assessment of functional independence, impact of fatigue and quality of life. RESULTS Forty of 43 individuals (52  11.4 years, 24 male) completed the rehabilitation program. Fatigue (87.5%), dyspnea and/or shortness of breath (62.5%), and cognitive impairment (37.5%) were reported by both previously hospitalized and home-confined patients. Neurological sequelae (35.5%) were present only in hospitalized patients. After 8 weeks of rehabilitation, patients reported significant improvements in motor functional independence, upper and lower limb functionality, impact of fatigue on daily activities, respiratory muscle strength, cognitive performance, and quality of life.

The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators).

Limited or negligible pre-existing immunity to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality worldwide, as well as a record-breaking surge in the use of medical-surgical supplies and personal protective equipment. In response to the global need for effective sterilization techniques, this study evaluated the virucidal efficacy of FATHHOMEs self-contained, ozone-based dry-sanitizing device, by dose and time response assessment. We tested inactivation of human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, a close genetic model of SARS-CoV-2, on porous (N95 filtering facepiece respirator/FFR) and nonporous (glass) surfaces. We started our assays with 20 ppm-10 min ozone exposure, and effectively reduced 99.8% and 99.9% of virus from glass and N95 FFR surfaces, respectively. Importantly, the virus was completely inactivated, below the detection limit (over 6-log(10) reduction) with 25 ppm-15 min ozone exposure on both tested surfaces.

Objectives: We quantified potential effects of future climate change on the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of the tick vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes scapularis, and explored their importance for Lyme disease risk, and for vector-borne diseases in general. Methods: We applied observed temperature data for North America and projected temperatures using regional climate models to drive an I. scapularis population model to hindcast recent, and project future, effects of climate warming on R(0). Modeled R(0) increases were compared with R(0) ranges for pathogens and parasites associated with variations in key ecological and epidemiological factors (obtained by literature review) to assess their epidemiological importance. Results: R(0) for I. scapularis in North America increased during the years 1971C2010 in spatio-temporal patterns consistent with observations. Increased temperatures due to projected climate change increased R(0) by factors (2C5 times in Canada and 1.5C2 times in the United States), comparable to observed ranges of R(0) for pathogens and parasites due to variations in strains, geographic locations, epidemics, host and vector densities, and control efforts. Conclusions: Climate warming may have co-driven the emergence of Lyme disease in northeastern North America, and in the future may drive substantial disease spread into new geographic regions and increase tick-borne disease risk where climate is currently suitable. Our findings highlight the potential for climate change to have profound effects on vectors and vector-borne diseases, and the need to refocus efforts to understand these effects.

Here, we show that Brucella, the causative agent of brucellosis, the most prevalent bacterial zoonosis globally, subverts this immune defense pathway by activating regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of mRNAs encoding BLOS1, a protein that promotes endosome-lysosome fusion. RIDD-deficient cells and mice harboring a RIDD-incompetent variant of IRE1 were resistant to infection. Non-functional Blos1 struggled to assemble the BLOC-1-related complex (BORC), resulting in differential recruitment of BORC-related lysosome trafficking components, perinuclear trafficking of Brucella-containing vacuoles (BCVs), and enhanced susceptibility to infection. The RIDD-resistant Blos1 variant maintains the integrity of BORC and a higher-level association of BORC-related components that promote centrifugal lysosome trafficking, resulting in enhanced BCV peripheral trafficking and lysosomal-destruction, and resistance to infection. These findings demonstrate that host RIDD activity on BLOS1 regulates Brucella intracellular parasitism by disrupting BORC-directed lysosomal trafficking. Notably, coronavirus MHV also subverted the RIDD-BLOS1 axis to promote intracellular replication.

Previously, boar semen was tested by a nested PCR (nPCR) assay which was compared to the \\"gold standard\\" swine bioassay. A correlation of 94% was observed, indicating that, most of the time, PCR detected infectious virus. Subsequently, a real-time PCR targeting the 3' untranslated region of the PRRSV genome was compared with nPCR by testing 413 serum and semen samples from PRRSV-inoculated and control boars. There was 95% agreement between the results of the two tests, with the majority of samples with discordant results containing virus at the lower range of detection by the assays. The virus in all samples was quantitated by using a standard curve obtained by serial dilution of an in vitro transcript. By using the in vitro transcript, the lower limit of sensitivity was observed to be approximately 33 copies/ml. Reactivity with a panel of more than 100 PRRSV isolates from various geographical regions in the United States was also documented. No reactivity with nine nonrelated swine viruses was noted. A real-time PCR was also developed for the detection of the European Lelystad virus and the European-like PRRSV now found in the United States. In six of six PRRSV-inoculated boars, peak levels of viremia occurred at 5 days postinoculation (DPI) and were most consistently detectable throughout 22 DPI. In five of six boars, PRRSV was shed in semen for 0 to 2 days during the first 10 DPI; however, one of six boars shed the virus in semen through 32 DPI. Therefore, in general, the concentration and duration of PRRSV shedding in semen did not correlate with the quantity or duration of virus in serum.

We designed four different prototypical patients with a combination of common COVID-19 symptoms and opportunities for exposure who were made to self-assess using the 10 provincial COVID-19 self-assessment tools on 1 April. These tools were developed to allow individuals to self-triage, allowing health systems direct capacity to testing and care. We assessed the consistency of the self-assessment tools and of the guidance provided to the patients. While the tools generally screen in three areas, the scope of included COVID-19 associated symptoms as well as the opportunities for exposure, and therefore transmission, vary between provinces such that no two provinces screened in the same way. This was, in turn, reflected in the inconsistency in guidance found. A patient with cough who had travelled abroad or had close contact with a confirmed case within 14 days received the most consistent guidance, with remaining patients receiving guidance ranging from mandatory quarantine or self-isolation to being told they did not have COVID-19 symptoms, guidance at odds with medical evidence. Thus, there is not a single, evidence-based Canadian standard of care simply for self-assessment. Without consistency in public health guidance, Canadians cannot appropriately self-isolate to mitigate community transmission, nor can the necessary valid and reliable data be collected to inform critical epidemiological models that help guide pandemic response.

METHODS Clinical, imaging, and outcome data were collected in 173 patients with acute ischemic stroke who presented within 4.5 hours from symptom onset, in the time window eligible for intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator. Imaging data included Alberta Score Program Early Computed Tomographic Score (ASPECTS), site of occlusion, volume of ischemic core and penumbra, and recanalization. Outcome data consisted of modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. We classified patients based on their baseline imaging characteristics and treatment with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (yes/no) according to 5 different hypothetical prognostic algorithms: (1) based on whether patients received intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator, (2) based on ASPECTS, (3) based on the site of occlusion, (4) based on volume of ischemic core and penumbra, and (5) based on a matrix of predicted recanalization and volume of ischemic core and penumbra. We compared the performance of such algorithms to predict good clinical outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 2 at 90 days. RESULTS One hundred and twenty-four patients received intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator; 49 did not. In the group that was treated, 46 (37%) had good outcome as opposed to 38.7% in the nontreated. The algorithm that combined the prediction of recanalization with the volume of ischemic core and penumbra showed the highest accuracy to predict good outcome (77.7%) as opposed to others (range, 43.9%-57.2%) CONCLUSIONS The combination of predicted recanalization and tissue fate proved superior to prognosticate good clinical outcome when compared with other usual predictors.","output":"Prediction of Early Arterial Recanalization and Tissue Fate in the Selection of Patients With the Greatest Potential to Benefit From Intravenous Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection has resulted in an ongoing pandemic affecting health system and economy of more than 200 countries around the world.

Since then, the mechanisms of action for several peptides and their antiviral prospect received large attention due to the global threat posed by viruses. Here, we discussed the therapeutic properties of peptides used in influenza treatment. Peptides with antiviral activity against influenza can be divided into three main groups. First, entry blocker peptides such as a Flupep that interact with influenza hemagglutinin, block its binding to host cells and prevent viral fusion. Second, several peptides display virucidal activity, disrupting viral envelopes, e.g., Melittin. Finally, a third set of peptides interacts with the viral polymerase complex and act as viral replication inhibitors such as PB1 derived peptides.

In addition, hypoxia inhibits the binding of the spike to NCI-H460 human lung epithelial cells by decreasing the cell surface levels of heparan sulfate (HS), a known attachment receptor of SARS-CoV-2. This interaction is also reduced by lactoferrin, a glycoprotein that blocks HS moieties on the cell surface.

METHODS: To tack part in the current research investigation to define a potential target drug that may protect the world from emerged pandemic corona disease, we have carried out a virtual screening study by of 129 approved drugs that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating existing infections. Especially 12 drugs against chronic hepatitis B virus, 37 against chronic hepatitis C virus, 37 against human immunodeficiency virus, 14 anti-herpesvirus, 11 anti- influenza, and 18 others drugs currently on the market were considered for this study. Then these drugs were evaluated using virtual screening and molecular docking studies in the active site of the (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (6lu7). Once the efficacy of the drug is determined, it can be approved for of their in vitro and in vivo activity against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that could be interesting for rapid clinical treatment of patients. These drugs were ranked for potential effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and those with high molecular docking scores are proposed as novel candidates for repurposing. The N3 inhibitor co-crystallized with the protease (6lu7) and the anti-HIV protease inhibitor Lopinavir were used as standards for comparison. RESULTS: The results suggest the effectiveness of Beclabuvir, Nilotinib, Tirilazad, Trametinib and Glecaprevir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its main protease. CONCLUSION: These promising drugs could inhibit the replication of the virus; hence, we suggest the repurposing of these compounds for thetreatment of COVID-19. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.

Here we showed that ACE2, but not TMPRSS2 or Furin, has a higher level of sequence variability in the Spike protein interaction surface, which greatly influences Spike protein binding mode. Using molecular docking simulations we compared the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins in complex with the ACE2 receptor and showed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein is compatible to bind the human ACE2 with high specificity. In contrast, TMPRSS2 and Furin are sufficiently similar in the considered hosts not to drive susceptibility differences. Computational analysis of binding modes and protein contacts indicates that macaque, ferrets and hamster are the most suitable models for the study of inhibitory antibodies and small molecules targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein interaction with ACE2. Since TMPRSS2 and Furin are similar across species, our data also suggest that transgenic animal models expressing human ACE2, such as the hACE2 transgenic mouse, are also likely to be useful models for studies investigating viral entry.","output":"Structural and functional modelling of SARS-CoV-2 entry in animal models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The corona virus continues to have a firm grip on the global economy Mechanical engineering and plant engineering are not unaffected by this In the first half of 2020, German machine production fell short of the previous year's level by 14% Machine exports recorded a decline of a similar magnitude of minus 15% in the same period The setbacks in April and May were particularly severe At the end of May, 98% of the member companies surveyed by the Association of German Mechanical and Plant Engineering (VDMA) reported that their business activities were in some cases massive","output":"Maschinenbau  Strategische Herausforderungen prae, propter et post Corona"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) belongs to the group II coronaviruses.

Standard sonification methods reported in the literature involve either (i) using only a subset of the variables, or (ii) first solving a learning task on the data and then mapping the output to an audio waveform, which is utilized by the end-user to make a decision. This paper presents a novel framework for sonifying high-dimensional data using a complex growth transform dynamical system model where both the learning (or, more generally, optimization) and the sonification processes are integrated together. Our algorithm takes as input the data and optimization parameters underlying the learning or prediction task and combines it with the psychoacoustic parameters defined by the user. As a result, the proposed framework outputs binaural audio signatures that not only encode some statistical properties of the high-dimensional data but also reveal the underlying complexity of the optimization/learning process. Along with extensive experiments using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the framework on sonifying Electro-encephalogram (EEG) data with the potential for detecting epileptic seizures in pediatric patients.","output":"Using growth transform dynamical systems for spatio-temporal data sonification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The highly mathematical nature of introductory level vibrations and control theory courses results in students struggling to understand the concepts. Hands-on activity demonstrated in class can help them better understand the concepts.

Also, with the COVID-19 crisis, the Spring 2020 academic year took an unexpected turn for academics and students all over the world. Engineering faculty who teach laboratories had to move online and instruct from home. Online course preparation takes more time and effort compared to traditionally designed face-to-face courses and was compounded considering the unprecedented situation where many instructors didn't have time to record data from existing lab equipment or record video in their laboratories. In this paper, we present a Matlab Simscape GUI program designed to simulate modeling and control of dynamical systems for vibrations and control theory courses, and their associated laboratories, as one potential solution for online instruction. To complement the simulation program, online classroom and homework activities were designed using a learning sciences approach connecting several critical educational theories which can bolster student motivation, engagement with the material, and overall learning performance. The simulation is presented along with data from 19 students who completed the associated classroom and homework activities. Survey results probing student perceptions about the value of the learning tasks for the simulation were overwhelmingly positive and indicate this approach holds promise in supporting student learning.","output":"Reinforcing student learning by MATLAB simscape GUI program for introductory level mechanical vibrations and control theory courses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our current work seeks to provide direct empirical evidence on whether Chinese international students experiences studying abroad promote dialectical thinking.

More specifically, when primed with studying abroad or typical day (relative to hometown culture), participants were more likely to show tolerance for contradiction by deeming both sides of contradictory scientific statements as convincing and rating them more favorably. Therefore, it is plausible that Chinese international students experiences studying abroad promote their dialectical thinking. More work is needed to further this line of research by (1) extending these effects with other measures of dialectical thinking such as perception of interconnectedness and prediction of change, (2) adopting differing paradigms to provide more robust findings, and (3) probing the underlying processes as to why experiences studying abroad promote dialectical thinking.","output":"Do Experiences Studying Abroad Promote Dialectical Thinking?

Here, we screened for such autoantibodies in 103 critically-ill COVID-19 patients in a tertiary intensive care unit in Switzerland. Eleven patients (10.7%), but no healthy donors, had neutralizing anti-IFN or anti-IFN/anti-IFN{omega} IgG in plasma/serum, but anti-IFN IgM or IgA was rare. One patient had non-neutralizing anti-IFN IgG. Strikingly, all patients with plasma anti-IFN IgG also had anti-IFN IgG in tracheobronchial secretions, identifying these autoantibodies at anatomical sites relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Longitudinal analyses revealed patient heterogeneity in terms of increasing, decreasing, or stable anti-IFN IgG levels throughout the length of hospitalization. Notably, presence of anti-IFN autoantibodies in this critically-ill COVID-19 cohort appeared to predict herpesvirus (herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2, HSV-1/-2; and/or cytomegalovirus, CMV) reactivations, which are linked to worse clinical outcomes. Indeed, all seven tested COVID-19 patients with anti-IFN IgG in our cohort (100%) suffered from one or more herpesvirus reactivations, and analysis revealed that these patients were substantially more likely to experience CMV reactivation than COVID-19 patients without anti-IFN autoantibodies, even when adjusting for systemic steroid treatment (odds ratio 7.28, 95%-CI 1.14-46.31, p=0.036). As the IFN system deficiency caused by neutralizing anti-IFN autoantibodies likely directly and indirectly exacerbates herpesvirus reactivations in critically-ill patients, early diagnosis of anti-IFN IgG could be rapidly used to inform risk-group stratification and treatment options.","output":"Herpesvirus Reactivations in Critically-Ill COVID-19 Patients with Autoantibodies Neutralizing Type I Interferons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective: To determine the level of satisfaction with their work and degree of burnout among anesthesiologists and emergency physicians working in the red zone of a COVID-19 hospital Subjects and methods A prospective study was conducted as an anonymous survey of physicians performing their duties in intensive care units of the red zone 65 specialists were interviewed: Group 1 (52 3%) trainee physicians, Group 2 (47 7%) anesthesiologists and emergency physicians Results The majority of respondents in both groups noted relatively high satisfaction with their current work At the same time, the majority of respondents (70 9%) in the group of anesthesiologists and emergency physicians would prefer the previous working conditions to current ones Also, it was noted that both groups were highly emotionally exhausted ? 2020 Geocarrefour All rights reserved","output":"The level of satisfaction with their work and degree of burnout among anesthesiologists and emergency physicians working in the red zone of a COVID hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antigen\\\\specific T\\\\cells are essential for protective immunity against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2.

All the patients underwent echocardiography. Their clinical data were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. All patients were followed up using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for a maximum of 24 months after the closure. All patients underwent successful device implantation. Echocardiography showed that the major immediate complications included residual shunt, pericardial effusion, and tricuspid regurgitation in the per-atrial group. During the mid-term follow-up period, TTE revealed that the most common complication was tricuspid regurgitation (non-preexisting). There were no cases of VSD recurrence, device displacement, valvular injury, malignant arrhythmias, hemolysis, or death. Moreover, according to the TTE data, the intracardiac structure of the patients were improved. Compared to the control group, the intracardiac manipulation time was shorter and the number of patients with residual shunts, redeployment of devices, or immediate new tricuspid regurgitations was fewer when using 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography. However, the procedure time in the per-atrial group was slightly longer than that in the control group.

In previous work, we proposed a model that allows the provisioning of adapted interfaces based on users identity and their functional attributes to facilitate this task for software designers and developers. However, these identities and attributes are self-declared by the users, which may impact reliability and usability. In this work, we propose an extension of our model to resolve these deficiencies by delegating the identity and attributes provision to external certified entities. The European electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS) regulation established a solution to ensure the cross-border mutual recognition of Electronic Identification (eID) mechanisms among the European Member States. This research aims to provide an extension of this regulation mentioned above (eIDAS) to support functional attributes and connect our previously proposed model to this extended eIDAS network. Thanks to this proposal, web services can guarantee adapted and personalized interfaces while improving the functionalities offered without any previous configuration by users and, in a reliable way, since the functional attributes belong to the users official eID. As the attribute set provided by eIDAS nodes only contains citizens personal and legal ones, we also propose a mechanism to connect the eIDAS network to external attribute providers that could extend the eIDAS profile of users with their functional attributes. We deployed a pilot to validate the proposed model consisting of an identity provider, an eIDAS node supporting the extended reference code, and an attribute provider supporting functional attributes. We also designed and implemented a simple service that supports eID authentication and serves adapted interfaces based on the retrieved extended eIDAS profile. Finally, we developed an experience for getting feedback from a set of real users with different functional capabilities.

To develop the proposed system, TGAM1, i.e., ThinkGear-AM1 series of NeuroSky company, was used, connecting it to an isolated Bluetooth 4.0 communication protocol from a brackish and humid environment, and a Notch Filter was applied to reduce the input noise. In this way, at Definiti Ixtapa-Mexico facilities, we explored the behavior of three children with Infantile Spastic Cerebral Palsy (Experiment 1), as well as the behavior of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and neurotypic children (Experiment 2). This was done applying the Power Spectrum Density (PSD) and the Self-Affine Analysis (SSA) from Electroencephalogram (EEG) biosignals. The EEG Raw data were time series showing the cerebral brain activity (voltage versus time) before and during DAT for the Experiment 1, and before, during DAT and after for the Experiment 2. Likewise, the EEW RAW data were recorded by the first frontopolar electrode (FP1) by means of an EEG biosensor TGAM1 Module.

We collected demographic data, PTSD symptoms, and exposure to social unrest-related traumatic events (TEs), pandemic-related traumatic events (PEs), and personal stressful life experiences (SLEs). Multiple logistic regression was performed to examine the links between TEs, PEs, and SLEs and PTSD.

We aimed to develop and validate a machine-learning model for the early prediction of moderate-to-severe condition of inhalation-induced ARDS. METHODS: Clinical expertise was applied with data-driven analysis. Using data from electronic intensive care units (retrospective derivation cohort) and the three most accessible vital signs (i.e. heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate) together with feature engineering, we applied a random forest approach during the time window of 90 h that ended 6 h prior to the onset of moderate-to-severe respiratory failure (the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen  200 mmHg). RESULTS: The trained random forest classifier was validated using two independent validation cohorts, with an area under the curve of 0.9127 (95% confidence interval 0.8713C0.9542) and 0.9026 (95% confidence interval 0.8075C1), respectively.

Continuing DOAC during device implantation may increase periprocedural bleeding risk; however, interrupting DOACs may increase thromboembolic risk. OBJECTIVE To compare the incidence of clinically significant pocket hematoma and thromboembolism in patients who have their DOAC continued or interrupted for cardiac device implantation. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL until December 2019 and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that compared outcomes after continuing or interrupting DOAC during cardiac device implantation. Independently and in duplicate, reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-text of potentially eligible studies. They then evaluated risk of bias and abstracted data. RCT data were pooled using a fixed-effect model. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS Two RCTs, representing 763 patients, and 3 observational studies met eligibility criteria. In RCTs, continuing DOAC for device implantation compared to interrupting DOAC resulted in no significant difference in clinically significant pocket hematoma (2.1% vs. 1.8%; RR 1.15; 95%CI 0.44-3.05) or thromboembolism (0.03% vs. 0.03%; RR 1.02; 95%CI 0.06-16.21). Quality of evidence for both outcomes was moderate due to imprecision. Observational studies showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS Continuing DOACs for device implantation results in little to no difference in the incidence of clinically significant pocket hematoma or thromboembolism. Given the ease of stopping and re-starting DOACs, interrupting DOACs may be the preferred strategy for most patients. However, whenever continuous therapeutic anti-coagulation is desired, DOAC continuation should be preferred over bridging with parenteral anticoagulation. This article is protected by copyright.

METHOD: Participants were electronically surveyed about their pre- and post-pandemic parenting-related stress, using an adapted version of the parenting stress scale. RESULTS: Nine-hundred and ninety foster parents (N = 990) participated in the study. Overall, foster parents reported significant increases along three specific domains of stressnamely, parenting stress, lack of control, and parental satisfaction (reverse-scored). Analyses for group differences on the post-only scores indicated that foster parents who are not married, or who report poorer mental health (i.e., good, versus very good or excellent) or financial circumstances (i.e., as indicated by not reliably having more income than expenses) may face increased risk for exacerbated stress during this pandemic. DISCUSSION: Findings from this study indicate that parental stress-levels among foster parents have increased since the start of COVID-19. These findings are not only troubling for foster caregivers, but may also have implications for the youth in their care. Ultimately, results from this study indicate the need to better support foster parents, in general, and during public health crises, specifically.","output":"Examining the Impact of COVID-19 on Parental Stress: A Study of Foster Parents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, public transportation networks have faced unprecedented challenges and have looked for practical solutions to address the safety concerns. In the wintertime, when natural ventilation is not an option, implementing an all-fresh air heating policy could be a viable solution to lower the transmission of such infectious disease, by reducing the density of pathogens and exposure time. Even though this will expectedly increase the energy demand, it is particularly crucial when the people safety is the first priority to operate any public transportation systems. To tackle the transmission issue, in this paper two concepts of an all-fresh-air Heat Pump (HP), namely a Baseline (BHP) and a novel Recovery (RHP) concepts were investigated. These two HPs concepts could provide better ventilation inside the bus, compared to a Conventional (CHP) concept where the cabin air is re-circulated. To address the energy consumption concerns, the RHP concept is proposed to improve the performance of the system by recovering part of the cabin waste heat, without using any additional heat exchangers. Three different coupled models of a generic single-deck cabin and a heat pump system for each concept were developed in the Simscape environment of MATLAB (R2020b). The performance of these HPs was investigated to evaluate how an all-fresh air policy could affect the performance of the system in the BHP, and the energy-saving potential of the RHP concepts. The performance of the system was studied under different ambient temperatures ranging from -5 to 5 C, and for low and moderate occupancy levels. Results show that employing the RHP and BHP significantly improved the ventilation rate per person by at least 102% and at most 125%, compared to a CHP concept with 50% of re-circulated air. Moreover, adopting the RHP concept also reduced the power demand by at least 8% and at most 11%, compared to the BHP for the selected fan and blower flow rates.","output":"A numerical evaluation of a novel recovery fresh air heat pump concept for a generic electric bus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We previously showed, by means of an online-based survey, that the belief of being infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acted as a nocebo and predicted higher perception of symptoms similar to COVID-19 symptoms.

METHOD Examination was carried out of a password-protected electronic database of all LVMRs operated on in one institution. RESULTS Fifty patients (45 women), median age 54 (range, 24-71) years, were referred with early symptomatic failure (n = 27) following an inadequate LVMR or major mesh complications (erosion into another organ, fistulation or stricturing) (n = 23). All were amenable to remedial laparoscopic surgery. Functional improvements were found in pre- and postoperative ODS, Wexner (FI) scores (two-tailed t-test; P < 0.0001) and quality of life (Birmingham Bowel and Urinary Symptoms Questionnaire-22) scores at 3 months (two-tailed t-test; P < 0.001) and normalization at 1 year (P < 0.015).

However, personalized oncology would allow a rational approach to chemotherapies. Classically, cancer diagnosis and prognosis are performed through mutation mapping, but this genomic approach has an indirect relationship with the disease since it is based on the results of statistics accumulated over time. By contrast, a strategy based on gene expression would enable figuring out the actual disease phenotype and focusing on its specific molecular targets. In previous reports, we paved the way in that direction by successively showing that targeting up-regulated hubs are a suitable strategy to forward a tumor toward cell death and that the number of proteins to be targeted is typically between 3 and 10 according to tumor aggressiveness. In this report, we focused on the up-regulated genes of crucial cell signaling pathways, which are key hallmarks of unregulated cell division and apoptosis. By principal component analysis, we identified the genes that most explain the aggressiveness among cancer types. We also identified the genes that maximized the classification between aggressive and mild cancers using the random forest algorithm. Finally, by mapping these genes on the human interactome, we showed that they were close neighbors. ABSTRACT: The main hallmarks of cancer include sustaining proliferative signaling and resisting cell death. We analyzed the genes of the WNT pathway and seven cross-linked pathways that may explain the differences in aggressiveness among cancer types. We divided six cancer types (liver, lung, stomach, kidney, prostate, and thyroid) into classes of high (H) and low (L) aggressiveness considering the TCGA data, and their correlations between Shannon entropy and 5-year overall survival (OS). Then, we used principal component analysis (PCA), a random forest classifier (RFC), and proteinCprotein interactions (PPI) to find the genes that correlated with aggressiveness. Using PCA, we found GRB2, CTNNB1, SKP1, CSNK2A1, PRKDC, HDAC1, YWHAZ, YWHAB, and PSMD2. Except for PSMD2, the RFC analysis showed a different list, which was CAD, PSMD14, APH1A, PSMD2, SHC1, TMEFF2, PSMD11, H2AFZ, PSMB5, and NOTCH1. Both methods use different algorithmic approaches and have different purposes, which explains the discrepancy between the two gene lists. The key genes of aggressiveness found by PCA were those that maximized the separation of H and L classes according to its third component, which represented 19% of the total variance. By contrast, RFC classified whether the RNA-seq of a tumor sample was of the H or L type. Interestingly, PPIs showed that the genes of PCA and RFC lists were connected neighbors in the PPI signaling network of WNT and cross-linked pathways.","output":"A Data Science Approach for the Identification of Molecular Signatures of Aggressive Cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fabrication of 3D microstructures is under continuous development for engineering bone substitutes.

Acute respiratory failure in these patients is a threatening event, with a very poor outcome, particularly when mechanical ventilation (MV) is required. For many years, oncologists and intensivists had a pessimistic vision of the dismal outcome of those hematological patients requiring admission to the ICU. The bleak experience in this population led some authors to suggest early withdrawal of support, or even withholding the option of mechanical ventilation altogether. However, over the last years this vision seems to be changing. Great progress has been made in stem cell transplantation that can be ascribed to a better understanding of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system for donor selection, more effective and less toxic immunosupression for prevention and treatment of graft-versus host disease (GVHD), and significant advances in infectious disease therapy. Also improvements in ventilatory and supportive care, such as the early implantation of noninvasive ventilation (NIV), may avoid intubation in a significant percentage of patients suffering from acute respiratory failure. As a result of all this, the proportion of both hematological patients requiring management in the ICU and those requiring MV is decreasing. Also the survival rate of HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU has been steadily improving.

As a result of the lockdown, some higher institutions had to quickly move from the traditional face-to-face teaching method to virtual learning. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on education in Nigeria and also provide recommendations that may be useful in developing remote teaching contingency strategies. Five-point Likert-scale questionnaire targeting students and teachers separately was designed to get feedbacks from both students and teachers on their experiences, issues and successes. The questionnaires were divided into five categories: virtual classrooms, course learning outcomes, alternative method of assessment, impact of online teaching and satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 703 students and 60 teachers from five different local universities participated in this study. All participants (> 50%) had difficulties with Internet connection. Students (67%) as well as teachers (59%) agree that they had limited interactions with one another and this negatively influence students satisfaction (p < 0.01). While students were split on the most appropriate method of assessment, teachers (63%) believe assignments and oral examinations are more suitable for online teaching. Many teachers (66%) admitted that it was difficult assessing students abilities and performance. Some students (> 40%) were concerned about the number of assignments given. Most teachers (84%) believe there is an increase in tendency for examination malpractice when assessment was conducted virtually. Students had significantly (p < 0.05) higher marks in all courses during online assessment compared to previous session involving face-to-face teaching.

Twenty-three (34.3%) patients were still at the anticancer treatment phase, but no tumour progression and recurrence was observed for all the patients during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. About 70% of these patients had fever (n=53, 79.1%) and/or cough (n=50, 74.6%). Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) with COVID-19 was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095). Limitation: This is a retrospective study with only 67 cases from four hospitals. And some specific clinical information was insufficient. Conclusion: This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. The tendency of poor prognosis was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase. We should pay more intensive attentions to cancer patients infected with COVID-19.","output":"A Multicentre Study of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outcomes of Cancer Patients in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a poorly understood complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

Nonadherence reduces cure rates, prolongs infectiousness, and contributes to the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Moreover, MDR-TB is a growing, complex, and costly problem that presents a major obstacle to TB control. Directly observed therapy (DOT) for treatment adherence monitoring is the recommended standard; however, it is challenging to implement at scale because it is labor-intensive. Mobile health interventions can facilitate remote adherence monitoring and minimize the costs and inconveniences associated with standard DOT. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of using video directly observed therapy (VDOT) plus incentives to improve medication adherence in TB treatment versus usual-care DOT in an African context. METHODS: The DOT Selfie study is an open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 2 parallel groups, in which 144 adult patients with TB aged 18-65 years will be randomly assigned to receive the usual-care DOT monitoring or VDOT as the intervention. The intervention will consist of a smartphone app, a weekly internet subscription, translated text message reminders, and incentives for those who adhere. The participant will use a smartphone to record and send time-stamped encrypted videos showing their daily medication ingestion. This video component will directly substitute the need for daily face-to-face meetings between the health provider and patients. We hypothesize that the VDOT intervention will be more effective because it allows patients to swallow their pills anywhere, anytime. Moreover, patients will receive mobile-phoneCbased social bundle incentives to motivate adherence to continued daily submission of videos to the health system. The health providers will log into a secured computer system to verify treatment adherence, document missed doses, investigate the reasons for missed doses, and follow prespecified protocol measures to re-establish medication adherence. The primary endpoint is the adherence level as measured by the fraction of expected doses observed over the treatment period. The main secondary outcome will be time-to-treatment completion in both groups. RESULTS: This study was funded in 2019. Enrollment began in July and is expected to be completed by November 2020. Data collection and follow-up are expected to be completed by June 2021. Results from the analyses based on the primary endpoint are expected to be submitted for publication by December 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This random control trial will be among the first to evaluate the effectiveness of VDOT within an African setting. The results will provide robust scientific evidence on the implementation and adoption of mobile health (mHealth) tools, coupled with incentives to motivate TB medication adherence. If successful, VDOT will apply to other low-income settings and a range of chronic diseases with lifelong treatment, such as HIV/AIDs.

A protocol for open reduction of DDH has been refined through collaboration between surgical, anaesthetic, and nursing teams to allow same day discharge. The objective of this study was to determine the safety and feasibility of performing open reduction of DDH as a day case. METHODS: A prospectively collected departmental database was visited. All consecutive surgical cases of DDH between June 2015 and March 2020 were collected. Closed reductions, bilateral cases, cases requiring corrective osteotomy, and children with comorbidities were excluded. Data collected included demographics, safety outcome measures (blood loss, complications, readmission, reduction confirmation), and feasibility for discharge according to the Face Legs Activity Cry Consolidability (FLACC) pain scale. A satisfaction questionnaire was filled by the carers. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS: Out of 168 consecutive DDH cases, 16 patients fit the inclusion criteria (age range 10 to 26 months, 13 female). Intraoperative blood loss ranged from \\"minimal\\" to 120 ml, and there were no complications or readmissions. The FLACC score was 0 for all patients. The carers satisfaction questionnaire expressed high satisfaction from the experience with adequate information and support provided. CONCLUSION: Open reduction in DDH, without corrective osteotomy, is safe and feasible to be managed as a day case procedure. It requires a clear treatment pathway, analgesia, sufficient counselling, and communication with carers.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonism with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increases the expression of ACE2 receptors which, coupled with the metabolic changes associated with obesity-related hypertension, can make hypertensive patients with obesity more vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Although current evidence suggests that ACEI/ARB use does not increase risk of severe COVID-19 in the general population, potential interactions with obesity-related hypertension are unknown. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between March 1st and July 8th, 2020. We included adults who are overweight (BMI  25 kg/m(2)) or obese (BMI  30 kg/m(2)) with hypertension treated as outpatients with or without ACEIs/ARBs. Patients without exposure to RAAS antagonists served as controls. We assessed mortality and the severity of COVID-19 reflected by admission to ICU and usage of supplemental O(2), non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and vasopressors. Results: Of the 369 inpatients with COVID-19, we identified 138 exhibiting obesity-related hypertension who were then allocated into the control (n=59) and ACEI/ARB (n=79) groups. The BMIs between groups at baseline were not statistically significant (Control: 33.6  0.96 vs. ACEI/ARB: 34.99  0.97; p=.32). Women were less represented in the ACEI/ARB group (Control: 47% vs. ACEI/ARB: 24%). The controls had a substantially higher mortality rate (Control: 32.2% vs. ACEI/ARB: 15.1%). In regard to the severity of COVID-19, the ACEI/ARB cohort showed lower usage of supplemental O(2) (Control: 52.5% vs. ACEI/ARB: 49.3%), mechanical ventilation (Control: 37.2% vs. ACEI/ARB: 1.2%), vasopressors (Control: 38.9% vs. ACEI/ARB: 31.6%), and had lower ICU admissions (Control: 57.6% vs. ACEI/ARB: 46.8%). However, the ACEI/ARB group had higher rates of: ECMO (Control: 0% vs. ACEI/ARB: 20.2%) and non-invasive ventilation (Control: 18.6% vs. ACEI/ARB: 20.2%). Of note, the rate of diabetes was higher in the ACEI/ARB cohort (Control: 45.7% vs. ACEI/ARB: 63.2%). Conclusion: Our results suggest that a history of RAAS antagonism is associated with lower mortality and less severity of COVID-19 in patients with obesity-related hypertension requiring hospital admission.","output":"Patients With Obesity-Related Hypertension Treated With Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Antagonists Exhibit Lower Mortality And Less Severe COVID-19: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.dadm.2019.03.006.].","output":"Erratum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Clinically suspicious novel coronavirus (COVID-19) lung pneumonia can be observed typically on computed tomography (CT) chest scans even in patients with a negative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.

Videoconferencing is a common telehealth modality for delivering psychotherapy and has demonstrated similar outcomes to those of face-to-face therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most common psychotherapy evaluated across various telehealth modalities; however, studies on CBT delivered via videoconference, particularly in a group therapy format, are lacking. Further, little research exists on videoconference group CBT for anxiety disorders. Accordingly, the present study compared the outcomes of group CBT for anxiety and related disorders delivered via videoconference versus face-to-face. METHOD: Using a non-randomized design, data on attendance, dropout, clinical outcomes, and functional impairment were collected from 413 adult outpatients of a tertiary care anxiety disorders clinic who attended a CBT group for panic disorder/agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or obsessive-compulsive disorder delivered either face-to-face (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) or via videoconference (since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic). Outcomes were assessed using well-validated self-report measures. Data were collected pre-treatment, across 12 weekly sessions, and post-treatment. Intent-to-treat analyses were applied to symptom outcome measures. RESULTS: Face-to-face CBT conferred only a slight benefit over videoconference CBT for symptom outcomes across all groups, but when assessed individually, only the GAD group showed greater symptom improvement in the face-to-face format. Effect sizes for significant differences between the delivery formats were small. Participants in videoconference groups tended to have slightly higher attendance rates in some instances, whereas functional improvement and treatment dropout were comparable across the delivery formats. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide preliminary evidence that videoconference group CBT for anxiety and related disorders may be a promising and effective alternative to face-to-face CBT. Additional research is needed to establish equivalence between these delivery formats.","output":"Face-to-face versus Video Teleconference Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Anxiety and Related Disorders: A Preliminary Comparison: Thrapie cognitivo-comportementale de groupe en personne contre par vido tlconfrence pour l'anxit et les troubles connexes: une comparaison prliminaire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No abstract.","output":"Geographical Distribution of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Worldwide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Designated as the most harmful for health, PM2.5 aerosol fraction was a subject of our study.

For this reason, the present study investigates the impact of attitudes on TA behavior in 382 adolescents by gender and extent of technology use. Three scales were used to determine adolescents' TA awareness, attitude, and behavior. The results of the dual-moderated mediation model show that gender and duration of technology use (h) moderated the full mediation of attitude on awareness and behavior in TA (F = 39.29, df = 9;372, p < .01). The indirect effect in males with 16.04 h per day of technology use is stronger (.24) than the indirect effect in males with 4.90 h per day of technology use (.13). In addition, the simple slope plot shows that when attitude scores increase, addictive behavior rises in females (simple slope = .74, t = 8.79, p < .01). On the other hand, with 16.04 h per day of technology use, when attitude scores decrease, addictive behavior rises in females (simple slope = .69, t = 7.59, p < .01). Furthermore, when the attitude scores increase, addictive behavior rises in males (simple slope = .85, t = 13.26, p < .01). As a result, the psychoeducational intervention programs to be implemented for TA should not only focus on awareness, but should also encompass behavioral, cognitive and lifestyle changes.","output":"Technology addiction of adolescents in the COVID-19 era: Mediating effect of attitude on awareness and behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, PCR has been widely used for screening patients displaying relevant symptoms. The rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enables prompt diagnosis and the implementation of proper precautionary and isolation measures for the patient. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the basic assay performance of an innovative PCR system, GeneSoC? (Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). A total of 1,445 clinical samples were submitted to the clinical laboratory, including confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, from February 13 to August 31. Specimen types included nasopharyngeal swabs. The sampling was performed several times for each patient every 2-7 days. Using this system, sequences specific for SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in a sample within 10-15 min using the microfluidic thermal cycling technology. Analytical sensitivity studies showed that GeneSoC? could detect the target sequence of the viral envelope and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genes at 5 and 10 copies/L, respectively. The precision of the GeneSoC? measurements using clinical isolates of the virus at a concentration of 103 copies/L was favorable for both the genes; within-run repeatability and between-run reproducibility coefficient of variation values were less than 3% and 2%, respectively; and the reproducibility of inter-detection units was less than 5%. Method comparison by LightCycler? 480 showed the positive and negative agreement to be 100% [(174/174) and (1271/1271), respectively]. GeneSoC? proved to be a rapid and reliable detection system for the prompt diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 patients and could help reduce the spread of infections and facilitate more rapid treatment of infected patients.","output":"Evaluation of the basic assay performance of the GeneSoc? rapid PCR testing system for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an emergent move in all countries across the world.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Medline, bioRxiv, and medRxiv from 1 January to 30 April 2020, using subject headings or subheadings combined with text words for the concepts of covid-19 and serological tests for covid-19. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND DATA ANALYSIS: Eligible studies measured sensitivity or specificity, or both of a covid-19 serological test compared with a reference standard of viral culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Studies were excluded with fewer than five participants or samples. Risk of bias was assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2). Pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated using random effects bivariate meta-analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was overall sensitivity and specificity, stratified by method of serological testing (enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs), or chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs)) and immunoglobulin class (IgG, IgM, or both). Secondary outcomes were stratum specific sensitivity and specificity within subgroups defined by study or participant characteristics, including time since symptom onset. RESULTS: 5016 references were identified and 40 studies included. 49 risk of bias assessments were carried out (one for each population and method evaluated). High risk of patient selection bias was found in 98% (48/49) of assessments and high or unclear risk of bias from performance or interpretation of the serological test in 73% (36/49). Only 10% (4/40) of studies included outpatients. Only two studies evaluated tests at the point of care. For each method of testing, pooled sensitivity and specificity were not associated with the immunoglobulin class measured. The pooled sensitivity of ELISAs measuring IgG or IgM was 84.3% (95% confidence interval 75.6% to 90.9%), of LFIAs was 66.0% (49.3% to 79.3%), and of CLIAs was 97.8% (46.2% to 100%). In all analyses, pooled sensitivity was lower for LFIAs, the potential point-of-care method. Pooled specificities ranged from 96.6% to 99.7%. Of the samples used for estimating specificity, 83% (10 465/12 547) were from populations tested before the epidemic or not suspected of having covid-19. Among LFIAs, pooled sensitivity of commercial kits (65.0%, 49.0% to 78.2%) was lower than that of non-commercial tests (88.2%, 83.6% to 91.3%). Heterogeneity was seen in all analyses. Sensitivity was higher at least three weeks after symptom onset (ranging from 69.9% to 98.9%) compared with within the first week (from 13.4% to 50.3%). CONCLUSION: Higher quality clinical studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests for covid-19 are urgently needed. Currently, available evidence does not support the continued use of existing point-of-care serological tests.

The study draws on data collected through a broadly representative phone survey with 2,533 respondents and an online randomized survey experiment with 2,392 participants in Papua New Guinea. Both surveys show that less than 20 percent of the respondents who were aware a vaccine existed were willing to be vaccinated. The main reason respondents stated for their hesitancy regarding the vaccine was concern about side effects;however, the majority also said health workers could change their mind, particularly if information was communicated in person. The phone survey illustrated that people's level of trust in the vaccine and their beliefs about the behavior of others are strongly associated with their intention to get a COVID-19 vaccine. In contrast, people's concern about COVID-19, most trusted source of information (including social media), and vaccination history were unrelated to their intention to get vaccinated. The online experiment showed that a message that emphasized the relative safety of the vaccine by highlighting that severe side effects are rare, while also emphasizing the dangers of COVID-19, increased intention to get vaccinated by around 50 percent. Collectively, these results suggest that policy makers would be well placed to direct their efforts to boosting the general population's trust that getting vaccinated substantially reduces the risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19.","output":"Addressing vaccine hesitancy: survey and experimental evidence from Papua New Guinea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis consists of life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated response to infection. Recent studies have found that excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis, thereby increasing morbidity and mortality. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a small glycerophospholipid molecule that exerts multiple functions by binding to its receptors. Although LPA has been functionally identified to induce NETs, whether and how LPA receptors, especially lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPA(3)), play a role in the development of sepsis has never been explored. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of LPA(3) on sepsis is essential for the development of medical therapy. After intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Lpar3 (-/-)mice showed a substantially higher mortality, more severe injury, and more fibrinogen content in the lungs than wild-type (WT) mice. The values of blood coagulation markers, plasma prothrombin time (PT) and fibrinogen (FIB), indicated that the Lpar3 (-/-) mice underwent a severe coagulation process, which resulted in increased thrombosis. The levels of NETs in Lpar3 (-/-) mice were higher than those in WT mice after LPS injection. The mortality rate and degree of lung damage in Lpar3 (-/-) mice with sepsis were significantly reduced after the destruction of NETs by DNaseI treatment. Furthermore, in vitro experiments with co-cultured monocytes and neutrophils demonstrated that monocytes from Lpar3 (-/-) mice promoted the formation of NETs, suggesting that LPA(3) acting on monocytes inhibits the formation of NETs and plays a protective role in sepsis. Mechanistically, we found that the amount of CD14, an LPS co-receptor, expressed by monocytes in Lpar3 (-/-)mice was significantly elevated after LPS administration, and the MyD88-p65-NFB signaling axis, downstream of toll-like receptor 4 signaling, in monocytes was overactivated. Finally, after an injection of the LPA(3) agonist (2S)-1-oleoyl-2-methylglycero-3-phosphothionate (OMPT), the survival rate of mice with sepsis was improved, organ damage was reduced, and the production of NETs was decreased. This suggested the possible translational value and application prospects of (2S)-OMPT in the treatment of sepsis. Our study confirms an important protective role of LPA(3) in curbing the development of sepsis by suppressing NETs production and thrombosis and provides new ideas for sepsis treatment strategies.","output":"Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 3 Suppress Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Production and Thrombosis During Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ozone valley (OV) in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has been identified since the 1990s during boreal summer.

However, PSY and RHV exhibited improvements in depression and anxiety from initial to follow up, whereas CTL continued to exhibit elevated levels. There was little change in community integration measures. Our results indicate that all groups reported increased mental health problems after the onset of the pandemic, but vulnerable Veterans were not disproportionately affected and had better mental health resilience (i.e., for depression and anxiety) as the pandemic progressed compared to CTL.

BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of severe coronavirus disease, a significant public health concern that quickly led to a pandemic. Contamination of environmental surface materials is of concern, with previous studies identifying long-term detection of infectious particles on surfaces. These contaminated surfaces create an increased risk for contact transmission. METHODS Surface materials were inoculated with 10,000 plaque forming units and samples were collected 4, 8, 12, 24, 30, 48, and 168 hours post infection (hpi). Viral titers were determined for each sample and time point using plaque assays. Nonparametric modeling utilized the Turnbull algorithm for interval-censored data. Maximum likelihood estimates for the survival curve were calculated. Parametric proportional hazards regression models for interval censored data were used to explore survival time across the surface materials. RESULTS There was a sharp decline in recoverable virus after 4 hpi for all tested surfaces. By 12 hpi, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was recoverable from only four surfaces; and by 30 hr, the virus was recoverable from only one surface. There were differences in survival curves based on the materials although some groups of materials are similar, both statistically and practically. CONCLUSIONS While very low amounts of infectious SARS-CoV-2 are recoverable over time, there remains a risk of viral transmission by surface contamination in indoor environments.

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomic sequence demonstrated that shxx1902(the 5th passage) and shxx1912(the 5th passage) clustered with a new GII subgroup (GII-c), which consisted of SINDEL strains from America (e.g., OH851), and their S gene belonged to GII-a. Both the strains(the 35th passage) have occurred dramatic changes in their genomes compared with the 5th passage. The 5th and 35th SH1302 belonged to GI-b genotype. The anti-N protein antibody titer of the strain shxx1902 was elevated to the same level as the vaccine strain(CV777) in mice.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a major threat to public health. Nurses have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment and public health. However, available data on the work stress among these nurses are limited. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire was completed by 180 anti-epidemic nurses from Guangxi. Data collection tools, including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), were used. Descriptive single factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring the related influencing factors. RESULTS: The SOS (39.91  12.92) and SAS (32.19  7.56) scores of this nurse group were positively correlated (r = 0.676, p < .05). Multiple regression analysis showed that only children, working hours per week and anxiety were the main factors affecting nurse stress (p = .000, .048, .000, respectively).

The objective of this prospective study conducted from June 2008 to March 2011 was to characterise the incidence and outcomes of viral respiratory infections in LTR. METHODS Patients were seen in three contexts: study-specific screenings covering all seasons; routine post-transplantation follow-up; and emergency visits. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected systematically and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed when clinically indicated. All specimens underwent testing with a wide panel of molecular assays targeting respiratory viruses. RESULTS One hundred and twelve LTR had 903 encounters: 570 (63%) were screening visits, 124 (14%) were routine post-transplantation follow-up and 209 (23%) were emergency visits. Respiratory viruses were identified in 174 encounters, 34 of these via BAL. The incidence of infection was 0.83 per patient-year (95% CI 0.45 to 1.52). The viral infection rates upon screening, routine and emergency visits were 14%, 15% and 34%, respectively (p<0.001). Picornavirus was identified most frequently in nasopharyngeal (85/140; 60.7%) and BAL specimens (20/34; 59%). Asymptomatic viral carriage, mainly of picornaviruses, was found at 10% of screening visits. Infections were associated with transient lung function loss and high calcineurin inhibitor blood levels. The hospitalisation rate was 50% (95% CI 30% to 70.9%) for influenza and parainfluenza and 16.9% (95% CI 11.2% to 23.9%) for other viruses. Acute rejection was not associated with viral infection (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.3). CONCLUSIONS There is a high incidence of viral infection in LTR; asymptomatic carriage is rare.

It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made government and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using non-pharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number was computed with and without interventions and was used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population, while the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to the virus to the barest minimum.","output":"Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a 50-year-old Thai woman with recent travel to Denmark who presented with acute high-grade fever, vomiting, and myalgia for 1 day.

Existing disaster prevention plans and calculated evacuation capacities in the coastal areas that would be affected do not account for physical distancing in the context of COVID-19. Therefore, we developed a tsunami evacuation placement model incorporating physical distance guidelines for infection control and living space per person into calculations of evacuation center accommodation capacities in Aki City, Kochi Prefecture. Using available administrative, population, and tsunami inundation data, we counted and mapped evacuation centers in the estimated inundated area within three zones constructed for smooth evacuation using the ArcGIS software Build Balanced Zones Tool. We calculated the space per evacuee using the Sphere handbook standard of 3.5 m2 or double the Sphere standard at 7 m2 plus the recommended physical distance of 11 m2 per person. We then compared the results with planned capacities. A total of 27 shelters are located in the area projected to be inundated at depths of 0.3C10 m, and their planned capacity, 2 m2 for each evacuee, would accommodate 32.9% of Aki's population and result in 9639 unaccommodated evacuees. Allotting 14.5 m2 (living space) or 18 m2 (living space plus space to maintain physical distancing) would reduce accommodation capacities to 57.1% and 28.6% (12,133 and 12,371 unaccommodated evacuees, respectively).

The medical profession has been on the front lines of this rapidly developing situation, which in turn has called for unprecedented changes in the medical school curriculum. These changes have severe implications for medical students interested in applying to competitive surgical specialties like orthopedics. Methods: As medical students in 3 different class years pursuing orthopedic surgery, we provide our perspectives on the impact that COVID-19 has had on medical student orthopedic education. Results: With the removal of away rotations and a shift to virtual interviews, rising fourth year medical students are arguably the most impacted as they prepare for the orthopedic residency application process. Third year students, who are in the exploratory phase of choosing a specialty, also face uncertainties in the shift to a \\"new\\" clerkship experience that may (1) be of shorter duration, (2) implement shifts to limit overcrowding of clinical space, and (3) increase the use of telehealth over direct patient contact. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the course of medical students' orthopedic education in unprecedented ways. We believe the following suggestions may be helpful for students seeking alternative, supplemental ways of learning: (1) read up on major orthopedic journals, (2) reach out to orthopedic surgeons in areas of interest, (3) reach out to program directors/medical clerkship directors/program coordinators for opportunities to attend their educational curriculum virtually, (4) attend online lectures and hospital grand rounds, and (5) practice suturing technique with a practice kit.

RECENT FINDINGS Solvent detergent-treated pooled plasma has proved to be well suited for the production of pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma. One such product, Bioplasma FDP, was licensed in South Africa in 1994 and has since 1996 been in successful clinical use. A clinical study with this product and two studies with the European product, Uniplas, have confirmed the efficacy and safety of pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma. SUMMARY Pooling of plasma enables the production of ABO-universal plasma.

Methods Ex vivo ultrasonographic and histologic evaluations of a fresh caecum were initially performed. Then, 20 asymptomatic cats, privately owned or originating from a reproductive colony, were recruited. All cats had an ultrasonographic examination of the ileocaecocolic junction, where the thickness of the caecal wall, ileocolic lymph nodes and the echogenicity of the local fat were assessed. They all underwent a colonoscopy with a macroscopic assessment of the mucosa and biopsies for histology. Results An ultrasonographic hypoechoic nodular inner layer, which corresponded to the coalescence of multiple lymphoid follicles originating from the submucosa and protruding in the mucosa on histology, was visible in all parts of the caecum. The combined mucosa and submucosa was measured ultrasonographically and defined as the follicular layer. Although all cats were asymptomatic, 3/19 cats showed mild caecal inflammation on histology. The most discriminatory ultrasonographic parameter in assessing this subclinical inflammation was the thickness of the follicular layer at the entrance of the caecum, with a cut-off value of 2.0 mm. All cats (20/20) showed some degree of macroscopic 'dimpling' of the caecal mucosa on endoscopy. Conclusions and relevance Lymphoid follicles in the caecal mucosa and submucosa constitute a unique follicular layer on ultrasound. In asymptomatic cats, a subtle, non-clinically relevant inflammation may exist and this is correlated with an increased thickness of the follicular layer on ultrasound. On endoscopy, a 'dimpled aspect' to the caecal mucosa is a normal finding in the asymptomatic cat.","output":"Ultrasonographic, endoscopic and histological appearance of the caecum in clinically healthy cats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Miniaturized analytical systems, especially microchip CE (MCE), are becoming a promising tool for analytical purposes including DNA analysis.

Hence, the present study attempts to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the water quality of River Gomti across its stretch of ~960 km through the assessment of Water Quality Index (WQI). The study also highlights the potential risk of faecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 through intake of river water facing the issue of direct discharge of domestic sewage. A deterioration in the water quality was witnessed at ~69% sampling locations during the lockdown period (May 2020). Interestingly, none of the water samples during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods across the whole stretch belonged to the excellent category (WQI<25). The DO levels fell across ~69% and ~88% of the sites during the lockdown and post-lockdown periods, respectively. Moreover, there was an increase in the BOD(5) levels across ~69% and 75% of the sites during lockdown and post-lockdown periods, respectively. These findings indicate that the release of sewage without or with partial treatment is a chief contributor of water pollution in the groundwater fed River Gomti. Thereby, highlighting the possible risk of faecal-oral transmission of the corona virus, and creating a major concern for the residents across its stretch. The urban sprawl and riverfront development in Lucknow city also emerge as potential causes of water quality deterioration in River Gomti, considering that the water quality at five sites within the city was under the unfit category regardless of the lockdown situation. Thus, the urgent need of management of domestic sewage release into the river and further research on the potential risk of faecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been suggested in the study.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the water quality index of River Gomti, India, with potential hazard of faecal-oral transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.529 was named by the WHO as Omicron and classified as a Variant of Concern (VOC) on 26 November 2021.

Most reports are subjective evaluations, which have been suggested to be unreliable. The objective is to test chemosensory dysfunction and recovery based on extensive psychophysical tests in COVID-19 during the course of the disease. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: A total of 111 patients from four centers participated in the study. All tested positive for SARS-COV-2 with RT-PCR. They were tested within 3 days of diagnosis and 28 to 169 days after infection. Testing included extensive olfactory testing with the Sniffin' Sticks test for threshold, discrimination and identification abilities, and with the Taste Sprays and Taste Strips for gustatory function for quasi-threshold and taste identification abilities. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in olfactory function during and after infection. During infection 21% were anosmic, 49% hyposmic, and 30% normosmic. After infection only 1% were anosmic, 26% hyposmic, and 73% normosmic. For gustatory function, there was a difference for all taste qualities, but significantly in sour, bitter, and total score. Twenty-six percent had gustatory dysfunction during infection and 6.5% had gustatory dysfunction after infection.

It provides training of full procedures with simulation of bleeding. Although widely used, the face validity has not yet been evaluated. This study aimed to establish face validity of the POP trainer for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and its usefulness compared with other training modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS During MIS courses, the participants (n = 52) used the POP trainer to perform LC. Face validity was assessed with questionnaires for realism and usefulness on a five-point Likert scale. Participants were divided into two groups: experts (n = 15) who had performed more than 50 laparoscopic procedures and novices (n = 37) with less than 50 procedures. Secondary aims included the ranking of training modalities, as well as exploration of their specific advantages and disadvantages. RESULTS The POP trainer was found to be realistic (3.8  0.9) and useful (4.6  0.9). Differences between experts and novices were only found for \\"The training modality resembles reality\\" (3.1  0.8 vs. 3.8  0.7; p = 0.010), \\"The operation on the POP trainer is realistic\\" (3.4  1.1 vs. 4.5  0.8; p = 0.003), and \\"It would be desirable to have a POP trainer at my own hospital\\" (4.2  1.1 vs. 4.8  0.8; p = 0.040).

A simple U-shaped tool was devised to aid in the estimation of the corneal diameters of patients in settings where an ophthalmic caliper is not available or EUA is not feasible. METHODS: Infants presenting to the congenital glaucoma clinic posted for EUA were recruited. The demographic details of the patients such as age, sex, and diagnosis were noted. A simple U-shaped tool was devised using three Schirmer strips or a printable ruler. Before the patient underwent a EUA, the corneal diameters were measured using the U-tool. During EUA, corneal diameters were measured using the Castroviejo caliper. RESULTS: The mean age of infants was 6.7  3.39 months (R = 1C12). The mean corneal diameter measured using the U-tool was 13.29  1.33 mm and with Castroviejo caliper was 13.18  1.39 mm. The difference between the corneal diameters measured using the two techniques was ?0.114 mm with the BlandCAltman plot 95% Limits of agreement (LoA) from ?0.965 to 0.737 mm.

In disaster-prone countries like Japan, there is substantial concern about the occurrence of natural disasters during the COVID-19 pandemic. When a natural disaster occurs, many people evacuate to shelters, and an outbreak of infectious disease often happens in shelters. In this situation, we should consider the management of evacuation shelters under this pandemic situation. Many types of research have investigated infectious diseases in shelters after a natural disaster. However, these are about infectious diseases after a disaster, and not about the occurrence of natural disasters under a pandemic like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, such researches mainly focus on medical teams or local governments who respond to infectious diseases. Based on the above mentioned information, the purpose of this study is to clarify (i) the change in citizens awareness of risk influenced by the spread of COVID-19 and (ii) the measurement and decision necessary for evacuating people under COVID-19. We administered a questionnaire to Japanese citizens from April to May 2020, and found that majority of people do not want to have evacuation life under COVID-19, and this tendency is larger among people who live together with the aged and the care-needed. In addition, this research confirmed the risk awareness structure applicable to both COVID-19 and natural disasters. The results show that many people firmly ask governments to take measures against infectious disease such as using hotels as shelters, securing personal spaces in shelters, storing masks and disinfectors, and so on during an outbreak of an infectious disease. However, it is not enough to take such measures only;it is necessary to provide accurate information and mental support to reduce anxiety in people. Based on these results, we should consider more about the management of shelters under COVID-19 as soon as possible before the arrival of typhoon season.","output":"A Report of the Questionnaire Survey on Awareness of COVID-19 and Shelters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Segments of the genome enriched in repetitive sequences still present a challenge and are omitted in genome assemblies. For that reason, the exact composition of DNA sequences underlying the heterochromatic regions and the active centromeres are still unexplored for many organisms. The centromere is a crucial region of eukaryotic chromosomes responsible for the accurate segregation of genetic material. The typical landmark of centromere chromatin is the rapidly-evolving variant of the histone H3, CenH3, while DNA sequences packed in constitutive heterochromatin are associated with H3K9me3-modified histones. In the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas we identified its centromere histone variant, Cg-CenH3, that shows stage-specific distribution in gonadal cells. In order to investigate the DNA composition of genomic regions associated with the two specific chromatin types, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput next-generation sequencing of the Cg-CenH3- and H3K9me3-associated sequences. CenH3-associated sequences were assigned to six groups of repetitive elements, while H3K9me3-associated-ones were assigned only to three. Those associated with CenH3 indicate the lack of uniformity in the chromosomal distribution of sequences building the centromeres, being also in the same time dispersed throughout the genome. The heterochromatin of C. gigas exhibited general paucity and limited chromosomal localization as predicted, with H3K9me3-associated sequences being predominantly constituted of DNA transposons.","output":"Sequence Composition Underlying Centromeric and Heterochromatic Genome Compartments of the Pacific Oyster Crassostrea gigas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Wuhan was the first Chinese city to be lockdown for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in springtime of 2020. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between sleep status, body mass index, anxiety and depression in college students during the post-pandemic era in the universities of Wuhan, China. METHODS: A total of 1457 college students completed the online surveys from December 25, 2020 to January 16, 2021. Collected data included gender, age, school name, native place, grade, major, body mass index (BMI), the scores of self-assessment lists of sleep (SRSS), Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and Zung depression self-rating scale (SDS). RESULTS: 1445 valid questionnaires (99.18%) were received. Of all the respondents, the prevalence of insomnia, overweight and obesity, anxiety and depression were 32.73%, 19.45%, 15.43% and 62.91%, respectively. Female students were more likely to have insomnia and anxiety than male students. The rate of insomnia, overweight and obesity in postgraduates were higher than undergraduates. Non-medical students were more likely to be overweight and obese than medical students. In addition, insomnia severity was positively correlated to anxiety severity, and BMI was positively correlated to anxiety or depression severity. There was also a positive correlation between the severity of anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: During the post-pandemic era, insomnia and depression are common problems among college students in Wuhan, suggesting that we should strengthen the sleep education of college students to improve sleeping disorders and psychosomatic health.","output":"Research on sleep status, body mass index, anxiety and depression of college students during the post-pandemic era in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, caused an outbreak of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China and then the entire world, forcing the World Health Organization to make the assessment that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can be characterized as a pandemic, the first ever caused by a coronavirus To date, clinical evidence and guidelines based on reliable data and randomized clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 are lacking In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatments for COVID-19 are currently being evaluated and tested worldwide Some of these options were soon abandoned due to ineffectiveness, while others showed promising results The basic treatments are mainly represented by antiviral drugs, even if the evidence is not satisfactory Among the antivirals, the most promising appears to be remdesivir Corticosteroids and tocilizumab seem to guarantee positive results in selected patients so far, although the timing of starting therapy and the most appropriate therapeutic schemes remain to be clarified Efficacy of the other drugs is still uncertain, and they are currently used as a cocktail of treatments in the absence of definitive guidelines What will represent the real solution to the enormous problem taking place worldwide is the identification of a safe and effective vaccine, for which enormous efforts and investments are underway","output":"Pharmacologicaltreatment of COVID-19: lights and shadows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past 50 years, drug delivery breakthroughs have enabled the approval of several important medicines.

METHODS In 43 cases of suspected fetal growth restriction (FGR), serial Doppler measurements of umbilical artery (UA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) pulsatility index (PI) were performed. The last measurement, closest to delivery (< 1 week before birth), was used for analysis. Neonatal circulation was assessed for 2 h/day on Days 1-5, 8 and 15 by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of the cerebral, renal and splanchnic regions. We calculated fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) as: (arterial oxygen saturation - NIRS value)/arterial oxygen saturation. The following ratios were calculated: cerebroplacental ratio (CPR; MCA-PI/UA-PI), cerebrorenal ratio (CRR; cerebral/renal FTOE) and cerebrosplanchnic ratio (CSR; cerebral/splanchnic FTOE). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient () was calculated between prenatal Doppler parameters and neonatal NIRS variables. These analyses were carried out for the entire group, and separately for cases of early FGR (delivered < 34 weeks) and late FGR ( 34 weeks). RESULTS Fetal Doppler parameters correlated with neonatal NIRS variables on Days 1-3: UA-PI correlated with renal FTOE (Day 1:  = 0.454, P < 0.01) and CRR (Day 1:  = -0.517, P < 0.001). MCA-PI correlated with cerebral FTOE on Day 2 ( = 0.469, P < 0.01), approached statistical significance on Day 3 but was not correlated on Day 1. CPR correlated with CRR (Day 1:  = 0.474, P < 0.01). Most associations lost their statistical significance when early and late FGR subgroups were considered separately. CONCLUSION Low MCA-PI and low CPR, indicating brain sparing before birth, are associated with low CRR after birth, indicating relatively greater blood flow to the cerebrum than to the renal region. Based on the results of this study, it could be speculated that if brain sparing is present in the fetal circulation, it persists during the first 3 days after birth. Copyright ? 2015 ISUOG.

We explored whether extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT), a ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 and a master regulator of innate immunity and inflammation, is a potential ARDS therapeutic target. METHODS: Wild type C57BL/6J or endothelial cell (EC)-cNAMPT -/- knockout mice (targeted EC NAMPT deletion) were exposed to either a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced (\\"one-hit\\") or a combined LPS/ventilator (\\"two-hit\\")-induced acute inflammatory lung injury model. A NAMPT-specific mAb imaging probe (99mTc-ProNamptorTM) was used to detect NAMPT expression in lung tissues. Either an eNAMPT-neutralising goat polyclonal antibody (pAb) or a humanised monoclonal antibody (ALT-100a? mAb) were utilised in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical, biochemical, and imaging studies validated time-dependent increases in NAMPT lung tissue expression in both preclinical ARDS models. Intravenous delivery of either eNAMPT-neutralising pAb/mAb significantly attenuated inflammatory lung injury (H & E staining, BAL protein, BAL PMNs, plasma IL-6) in both preclinical models. In vitro human lung EC studies demonstrated eNAMPT-neutralising antibodies (pAb, mAb) to strongly abrogate eNAMPT-induced TLR4 pathway activation and EC barrier disruption. In vivo studies in wild type and EC-cNAMPT -/- mice confirmed a highly significant contribution of EC-derived NAMPT to the severity of inflammatory lung injury in both preclinical ARDS models. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight both the role of EC-derived eNAMPT and the potential for biologic targeting of the eNAMPT/TLR4 inflammatory pathway. In combination with predictive eNAMPT biomarker and NAMPT genotyping assays, this offers the opportunity to identify high-risk ARDS subjects for delivery of personalised medicine.","output":"Endothelial eNAMPT amplifies pre-clinical acute lung injury: efficacy of an eNAMPT-neutralising monoclonal antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On January 6, 2022, a cluster of COVID-19 cases* caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was detected in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Hong Kong), resulting in the territory's fifth wave of COVID-19 cases (1).

They range from early, low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) without breathlessness (\\"silent hypoxia\\"), delirium, rashes, and loss of smell (anosmia), to persisting chest pain, muscle weakness and -pain, fatigue, confusion, memory problems and difficulty to concentrate (\\"brain fog\\"), mood changes, and unexpected onset of hypertension or diabetes. SARS CoV-2 affects the microcirculation, causing endothelial cell swelling and damage (endotheliitis), microscopic blood clots (microthrombosis), capillary congestion, and damage to pericytes that are integral to capillary integrity and barrier function, tissue repair (angiogenesis), and scar formation. Similar to other instances of critical illness, COVID-19 is also associated with elevated cytokine levels in the systemic circulation. This review examines how capillary damage and inflammation may contribute to these acute and persisting COVID-19 symptoms by interfering with blood and tissue oxygenation and with brain function. Undetectable by current diagnostic methods, capillary flow disturbances limit oxygen diffusion exchange in lungs and tissue and may therefore cause hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia. The review analyzes the combined effects of COVID-19-related capillary damage, pre-existing microvascular changes, and upstream vascular tone on tissue oxygenation in key organs. It identifies a vicious cycle, as infection- and hypoxia-related inflammation cause capillary function to deteriorate, which in turn accelerates hypoxia-related inflammation and tissue damage. Finally, the review addresses the effects of low oxygen and high cytokine levels in brain tissue on neurotransmitter synthesis and mood. Methods to assess capillary functions in human organs and therapeutic means to protect capillary functions and stimulate capillary bed repair may prove important for the individualized management of COVID-19 patients and targeted rehabilitation strategies.","output":"SARS CoV-2 related microvascular damage and symptoms during and after COVID-19: Consequences of capillary transit-time changes, tissue hypoxia and inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serum levels of IgG, IgM and IgA against severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were detected serially with the use of immunofluorescent antibody assays in 30 patients with SARS.

We aimed to compare outcomes of TURBT using spinal anaesthesia (SA) alone versus SA+ONB in terms of rates of obturator reflex, bladder perforation, incomplete tumour resection, tumour recurrence and local anaesthetic toxicity. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Web of Science), identifying studies comparing the outcomes of TURBT using spinal anaesthesia versus spinal with an obturator nerve block. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies were used to assess the included studies. Random effects modelling was used to calculate pooled outcome data. RESULTS: Searches of electronic databases resulted in 107 articles, from which four randomised control trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies met the eligibility criteria, enrolling a total of 448 patients. The use of spinal anaesthesia with an obturator nerve block was associated with a significantly reduced risk of obturator reflex (p <0.00001), bladder perforation (p=0.02), incomplete resection (p <0.0001) and 12-month tumour recurrence (p=0.005). Obturator nerve block was not associated with an increased risk of local anaesthetic toxicity (0/159). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that TURBT employing spinal anaesthesia with an obturator nerve block is superior to the use of spinal anaesthesia alone. During the COVID-19 pandemic, where avoidance of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) such as a general anaesthesia is paramount, the use of an obturator nerve block with spinal anaesthesia is essential for the safety of both patients and staff without compromising care. Further high-quality RCTs with adequate sample sizes are required to compare the different techniques of obturator nerve block as well as comparing this method to general anaesthesia with complete neuromuscular blockade.","output":"Safety and efficacy of transurethral resection of bladder tumour comparing spinal anaesthesia to spinal anaesthesia with an obturator nerve block: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suggestions of the existence of so-called 'social care deserts' in England in the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic drew attention to the potential impact of geographical inequalities on the availability of residential, nursing and domiciliary care. To date, much of this analysis has been conducted at spatially aggregated scales such as that of local authorities or postcode sector. Hidden within such aggregate-level analysis however are geographical differences in the local provision of care services. In this paper, we draw attention to geographical modelling techniques that can be used to examine local trends in the supply of social care services in relation to potential demand. These spatial models can be used to examine variations in the number of facilities (or choice) within reasonable drive times/distances. Drawing on a national database of residential and nursing care beds in Wales for March 2020, we illustrate the potential of such techniques to provide an insight into current patterns in access to care homes, and to monitor future changes in the fall-out from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care home sector. The concentration of care home sites in metropolitan areas and in the heavily populated post-industrial valleys in the south-east is identified, but significant demand present in these areas ameliorates scores towards mid-range ratios. We conclude by suggesting that the types of techniques used in this study enable disparities in provision within localised areas to be better explored, thereby helping planners and policy makers to address potential inequalities in provision.","output":"Towards an understanding of inequalities in accessing residential and nursing home provision: The role of geographical approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For community nurses, the pressures of working during the COVID-19 pandemic have been immense But what has not been so clear is the individual experiences of those working in general practice","output":"Why do general practice nurses feel undervalued?: The pandemic has shown their adaptability, but we must ensure more equitable treatment and recognition for the profession"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When pathogens become airborne, they travel associated with particles of different size and composition. Particle size determines the distance across which pathogens can be transported, as well as the site of deposition and the survivability of the pathogen. Despite the importance of this information, the size distribution of particles bearing viruses emitted by infectious animals remains unknown. In this study we characterized the concentration and size distribution of inhalable particles that transport influenza A virus (IAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) generated by acutely infected pigs and assessed virus viability for each particle size range. Aerosols from experimentally infected pigs were sampled for 24 days using an Andersen cascade impactor able to separate particles by size (ranging from 0.4 to 10 micrometer (m) in diameter). Air samples collected for the first 9, 20 and the last 3 days of the study were analyzed for IAV, PRRSV and PEDV, respectively, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified as geometric mean copies/m(3) within each size range. IAV was detected in all particle size ranges in quantities ranging from 5.5x10(2) (in particles ranging from 1.1 to 2.1m) to 4.3x10(5) RNA copies/m(3) in the largest particles (9.0C10.0m). PRRSV was detected in all size ranges except particles between 0.7 and 2.1m in quantities ranging from 6x10(2) (0.4C0.7m) to 5.1x10(4) RNA copies/m(3) (9.0C10.0m). PEDV, an enteric virus, was detected in all particle sizes and in higher quantities than IAV and PRRSV (p < 0.0001) ranging from 1.3x10(6) (0.4C0.7m) to 3.5x10(8) RNA copies/m(3) (9.0C10.0m). Infectious status was demonstrated for the 3 viruses, and in the case of IAV and PRRSV, viruses were isolated from particles larger than 2.1m.

Significant attention has focused on the individual-level demographic and co-morbid factors associated with rates and mortality of COVID-19. However, less attention has been given to the county-level social determinants of health that are the main drivers of health inequities. To identify the degree to which social determinants of health predict COVID-19 cumulative case rates at the county-level in Georgia, we performed a sequential, cross-sectional ecologic analysis using a diverse set of socioeconomic and demographic variables. Lasso regression was used to identify variables from collinear groups. Twelve variables correlated to cumulative case rates (for cases reported by 1 August 2020) with an adjusted r squared of 0.4525. As time progressed in the pandemic, correlation of demographic and socioeconomic factors to cumulative case rates increased, as did number of variables selected. Findings indicate the social determinants of health and demographic factors continue to predict case rates of COVID-19 at the county-level as the pandemic evolves.

However, most studies of interventions have focused on veterans, representing a missed opportunity for intervention with active military personnel. Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework, the aim of this systematic review was to analyse and synthesise the evidence related to workplace-based interventions for reducing alcohol use in active-duty military personnel. METHODS Four electronic databases and reference lists of relevant articles were searched from database inception until 20 January 2020. This review focused on experimental and quasi-experimental studies of active-duty military personnel. Data extraction and methodological quality assessment were independently performed by two reviewers using a standardised checklist. A third reviewer was used to arbitrate the disputed studies for final selection. RESULTS The search yielded seven studies from an initial 1582 records identified. A range of interventions were used in these studies (four randomised controlled trials, two non-randomised trials and one before and after cohort study), including web-based approaches, telephone-delivered interventions and individual and group-based face-to-face interventions. Seven studies found decreased drinking, measured using a range of outcomes, following the intervention. However, this was not sustained in the longer term in any of the studies. CONCLUSIONS The low methodological rigour of most studies limited the capacity to demonstrate the efficacy of the interventions studied. Given the importance of reducing harmful or RSOD use of alcohol in the military, future studies would benefit from improved methodological rigour including ensuring adequate study power, randomisation, selection of validated outcome measures, including measures other than consumption (eg, attitudinal measures), and longer-term follow-up.

METHODS Cross-sectional data were from the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Survey (CPAS, N = 2365 parents of a child 0-18 years, 8-28th April 2020); and a pre-pandemic national database containing 18 years of annual surveys collected in 2002-2019 (N = 17,529 parents). RESULTS Levels of subjective wellbeing during the pandemic were considerably lower than ratings prior to the pandemic (Personal Wellbeing Index, mean[SD] = 65.3 [17.0]; compared to [SD] = 75.8 [11.9], p < 0.001). During the pandemic, lower subjective wellbeing was associated with low education (adjusted regression coefficient, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = -5.19, -0.93), language other-than-English (95% CI = -7.22, -1.30), government benefit (95% CI = -6.99, -0.96), single parents (95% CI = -8.84, -4.59), child neurodevelopmental condition (95% CI = -3.44, -0.76), parent physical/mental health problems (95% CI = -3.23, -0.67), COVID-environmental stressors (95% CI = -3.48, -2.44), and fear/worry about COVID-19 (95% CI = -8.13, -5.96).

Limited literature is available on treatment approaches for this problem, and each has shortcomings. This study describes a muscle transfer technique to treat complete irreparable avulsion of the hip abductor muscles and tendons. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE Ten adult cadaver specimens were dissected to determine nerve and blood supply point of entry in the gluteus maximus and tensor fascia lata (TFL) and evaluate the feasibility and safety of transferring these muscles to substitute for the gluteus medius and minimus. In this technique, the anterior portion of the gluteus maximus and the entire TFL are mobilized and transferred to the greater trochanter such that the muscle fiber direction of the transferred muscles closely matches that of the gluteus medius and minimus. METHODS Five patients (five hips) were treated for primary irreparable disruption of the hip abductor muscles using this technique between January 2008 and April 2011. All patients had severe or moderate pain, severe abductor limp, and positive Trendelenburg sign. Patients were evaluated for pain and function at a mean of 28 months (range, 18-60 months) after surgery. RESULTS All patients could actively abduct 3 months postoperatively. At 1 year postoperatively, three patients had no hip pain, two had mild pain that did not limit their activity, three had no limp, and one had mild limp. One patient fell, fractured his greater trochanter, and has persistent limp and abduction weakness.

Twenty-six percent of specimens from unvaccinated Orange County residents in December 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive; out of 852 seropositive individuals 77 had symptoms and 9 sought medical care. The antibody response was predominantly against nucleocapsid (NP), full length, and S2 domain of spike. Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) reactivity was low and not cross-reactive against SARS S1 or SARS RBD.

Vibraimage technology is the method of head micromovements video processing by inter-frame difference accumulation and converting spatial and temporal characteristics of the inter-frame difference into behavioral and psychophysiological parameters. Here we shown that behavioral parameters measured by vibraimage changed during COVID-19 infection.

Methods: PSAP processes were modified over several days including (1) referral of non-ill callers to public health information call centers; (2) algorithms for detection, isolation, or hospitalization of suspected COVID-19 patients; and (3) specialized medical teams sent to the PSAP for triage and case management, including ambulance dispatches or alternative dispositions. Call volumes, ambulance dispatches, and response intervals for the 2 weeks after announcement were compared to 2017-2019 data and the week before. Results: For 2 weeks following outbreak announcement, the primary-level PSAP (police/fire/EMS) averaged 56% more daily calls compared to prior years and recorded 9281 (106% increase) on Day 4, averaging a??400/hour. The secondary-level (EMS) PSAP recorded an analogous 63% increase with 3863 calls (a??161/hour; 264% increase) on Day 3.

Efficacy-tested diet (RENEW) and exercise (BEAT Cancer) programs were adapted for web delivery among middle-aged and older cancer survivors for the AMPLIFI study, a National Cancer Institute-funded, multi-site, program project. METHODS: Throughout the continental U.S., survivors of several obesity-related cancers are being recruited for three interconnected randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Projects 1 and 2 test 6-month diet or exercise interventions versus a wait-list control condition. Upon completion of the 6-month study period, the intervention participants receive the next behavior change sequence (i.e., diet receives exercise, exercise receives diet) and the wait-list control arm initiates a 12-month combined diet and exercise intervention. Project 3 tests the efficacy of the sequential versus simultaneous interventions. Assessments occur at baseline and semi-annually for up to 2-years and include: body mass index, health behaviors (diet quality, accelerometry-assessed physical activity/sleep), waist circumference, D3 creatine-assessed muscle mass, physical performance, potential mediators/moderators of treatment efficacy, biomarkers of inflammation and metabolic regulation, health care utilization, cost, and overall health. Four shared resources support AMPLIFI RCTs: 1) Administrative; 2) Adaptation, Dissemination and Implementation; 3) Recruitment and Retention; and 4) Assessment and Analysis.

As key users of digital health technologies, health care workers are crucial to enable a meaningful digital transformation of health care. Digital health literacy and digital skills should become prerequisite competencies for health professionals to facilitate the implementation and leverage the potential of digital technologies to improve health. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess European medical students perceived knowledge and opinions toward digital health, the status of digital health implementation in medical education, and the students most pressing needs. METHODS: The explanatory design of our mixed methods study was based on an online, anonymous, self-administered survey targeted toward European medical students. A linear regression analysis was used to identify the influence of the year of medical studies on the responses. Additional analysis was performed by grouping the responses by the self-evaluated frequency of eHealth technology use. Written responses to four qualitative questions in the survey were analyzed using an inductive approach. RESULTS: The survey received a total of 451 responses from 39 European countries, and there were respondents for every year of medical studies. The majority of respondents saw advantages in the use of digital health. While 40.6% (183/451) felt prepared to work in a digitized health care system, more than half (240/451, 53.2%) evaluated their eHealth skills as poor or very poor. Medical students considered lack of education to be the reason for this, with 84.9% (383/451) agreeing or strongly agreeing that more digital health education should be implemented in the medical curriculum. Students demanded introductory and specific eHealth courses covering data management, ethical aspects, legal frameworks, research and entrepreneurial opportunities, role in public health and health systems, communication skills, and practical training. The emphasis lay on tailoring learning to future job requirements and interprofessional education. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a lack of digital health-related formats in medical education and a perceived lack of digital health literacy among European medical students. Our findings indicate a gap between the willingness of medical students to take an active role by becoming key players in the digital transformation of health care and the education that they receive through their faculties.","output":"Perceptions of Digital Health Education Among European Medical Students: Mixed Methods Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by a strong inflammatory process that may ultimately lead to organ failure and patient death. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a molecular platform that promotes inflammation via cleavage and activation of key inflammatory molecules including active caspase-1 (Casp1p20), IL-1, and IL-18. Although participation of the inflammasome in COVID-19 has been highly speculated, the inflammasome activation and participation in the outcome of the disease are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and is active in COVID-19 patients. Studying moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, we found active NLRP3 inflammasome in PBMCs and tissues of postmortem patients upon autopsy. Inflammasome-derived products such as Casp1p20 and IL-18 in the sera correlated with the markers of COVID-19 severity, including IL-6 and LDH. Moreover, higher levels of IL-18 and Casp1p20 are associated with disease severity and poor clinical outcome. Our results suggest that inflammasomes participate in the pathophysiology of the disease, indicating that these platforms might be a marker of disease severity and a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.","output":"Inflammasomes are activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with COVID-19 severity in patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID assessment can be performed using the recently developed individual risk score (prediction of severe respiratory failure in hospitalized patients with SARS-COV2 infection, PREDI-CO score) based on High Resolution Computed Tomography.

Methods: We collected 92 from patients treated in the IRCCS SantOrsola-Malpighi Policlinic and public databases;each lung was segmented using a pre-trained AI method;ground-glass opacity was identified using a novel, non-supervised approach;radiomic measurements were collected and used to predict clinically relevant scores, with particular focus on mortality and the PREDI-CO score. We compared the prediction obtained through different machine learning approaches. Results: All the methods obtained a well-balanced accuracy (70%) on the PREDI-CO score but did not obtain satisfying results on other clinical characteristics due to unbalance between the classes. Conclusions: Semi-supervised segmentation, implemented using a combination of non-supervised segmentation and feature extraction, seems to be a viable approach for patient stratification and could be leveraged to train more complex models.

The training of new sonographers and deep learning based algorithms for US image analysis usually requires a large amount of data.

In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis framework. Our main contributions include: (1) we present the first work that can synthesize realistic B-mode US images with high-resolution and customized texture editing features; (2) to enhance structural details of generated images, we propose to introduce auxiliary sketch guidance into a conditional GAN. We superpose the edge sketch onto the object mask and use the composite mask as the network input; (3) to generate high-resolution US images, we adopt a progressive training strategy to gradually generate high-resolution images from low-resolution images. In addition, a feature loss is proposed to minimize the difference of high-level features between the generated and real images, which further improves the quality of generated images; (4) the proposed US image synthesis method is quite universal and can also be generalized to the US images of other anatomical structures besides the three ones tested in our study (lung, hip joint, and ovary); (5) extensive experiments on three large US image datasets are conducted to validate our method.

The progressive increase in torque (extra torque) that may develop in response to low intensity wide-pulse high-frequency (WPHF) NMES holds great promise for rehabilitation as it overcomes the main limitation of NMES, namely discomfort. WPHF NMES extra torque is thought to result from reflexively recruited motor units at the spinal level. However, whether WPHF NMES evoked force can be modulated is unknown. Therefore, we examined the effect of two interventions known to change the state of spinal circuitry in opposite ways on evoked torque and motor unit recruitment by WPHF NMES. The interventions were high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and anodal transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS). We show that TENS performed before a bout of WPHF NMES results in lower evoked torque (median change in torque time-integral: - 56%) indicating that WPHF NMES-evoked torque might be modulated. In contrast, the anodal tsDCS protocol used had no effect on any measured parameter. Our results demonstrate that WPHF NMES extra torque can be modulated and although the TENS intervention blunted extra torque production, the finding that central contribution to WPHF NMES-evoked torques can be modulated opens new avenues for designing interventions to enhance WPHF NMES.","output":"Modulation of torque evoked by wide-pulse, high-frequency neuromuscular electrical stimulation and the potential implications for rehabilitation and training."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Annual Congress of Rheumatology is the biggest rheumatology conference in Europe organized by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).

COVID-19 is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test, however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models. COVID-CAPS achieved an Accuracy of 95.7%, Sensitivity of 90%, Specificity of 95.8%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, while having far less number of trainable parameters in comparison to its counterparts.

Kasus penularan dan kematian yang tinggi membuat Brasil dapat dikatakan gagal dalam mencegah penyebaran COVID-19. Terdapat beberapa faktor yang berpengaruh dalam kegagalan upaya Brasil merespon pandemi ini. Salah satunya adalah karena adanya informasi dan instruksi yang berbeda antara Presiden Bolsonaro dengan gubernur-gubernurnya. Tulisan ini bertujuan untuk mengkaji respon Brasil dalam mengatasi pandemi COVID-19 dari rentang waktu sejak kasus pertama pada bulan Februari hingga bulan Juli 2020 serta menjelaskan alasan kegagalan tersebut. Argumen utama penulis adalah kegagalan Brasil disebabkan oleh adanya gejolak dalam politik domestik Brasil dan kondisi sosial ekonomi di Brasil. Gejolak politik domestik tersebut dibagi menjadi dua yaitu gejolak di tingkat nasional: antara Presiden Bolsonaro dan menteri kesehatannya;dan gejolak di tingkat lokal: antara Presiden Bolsonaro dengan para gubernur negara bagian. Dari segi ekonomi kondisi Brasil yang masih berusaha memulihkan perekonomian membuat pemerintahan Bolsonaro seolah sengaja melalaikan tanggung Jawab untuk mengatasi penyebaran COVID-19. Sementara dari segi sosial ketimpangan yang ada di Brasil membuat masyarakat yang tinggal di daerah-daerah miskin menjadi paling beresiko tertular karena tidak adanya infrastruktur sanitasi yang memadai. Kata-kata kunci: COVID-19 Brasil Bolsonaro kelalaian Brazil is a country with the second highest positive cases of COVID-19 in the world after the United States. The high number of infected and death cases makes Brazil fail to prevent the spread of COVID-19. There are several factors contributed to Brazils failure to respond the pandemic. One of the reasons is because of the information and differences between President Bolsonaro and his governors. This paper aims to examine Brazils response in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic from the timeframe from the first case in February to July 2020 and to explain the reasons for this failure. The authors main argument is that Brazils failure was caused by the turmoil in domestic politics and the socio-economic conditions in Brazil. Domestic political turmoil is divided into two namely turmoil at the national level: between President Bolsonaro and his ministers of health;and turmoil at the local level: between President Bolsonaro and state governors. From the economy point of view Brazils condition which is still in recovery has made the Bolsonaro administration seem to have deliberately neglected its responsibility to contain the spread of COVID-19. Meanwhile from a social perspective the existing inequality in Brazil put people living in poorest regions at the highest risk of infection due to the absence of adequate sanitation infrastructure.

The virus is now pandemic and widely disseminated to almost every continent and nation with globally over twenty-seven million infections and over ninety-thousand reported deaths attributed to the COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded RNA virus, similar in structure to that of other coronaviruses and comprising three main viral proteins; membrane (M), spike (S) and envelope (E). The clinical features of COVID-19 disease can be classified according to different degrees of severity, with some patients, particularly those of older age and with long-standing chronic illnesses, developing progressive respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. In these severe cases, the disease can frequently be fatal. In addition, many infections are asymptomatic or only cause mild symptoms. As there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 there is considerable scientific endeavor globally to raise a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, in addition to engineering neutralizing antibody interventions. In the absence of an effective vaccine, interim measures involving movement control and lock downs of varying stringencies have been imposed, in order to control the spread of the virus. Whilst early enforced lockdown measures have been effective in reducing the spread of infection, these measures may prove to be less effective against the current and predominant strain of SARS-CoV-2, the G614 clade. Conversely, other mutations of the virus, such as the &#916;382 variant could reduce the clinical relevance of infection, and therefore may reduce the need for stringent movement control, particularly once vaccines become widely available. The front runners in the race to develop an effective vaccine focus on the SARS-Co-V-2 Spike protein. However, vaccines that produce a CD4 and CD8 response to a wider range of SARS-Co-V-2 viral proteins, may be more effective. Lastly, population based studies that determine the level of innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 existing in the community, from prior exposure to the virus or to other coronaviruses, will have important implications for the stringencies of government imposed movement control and upon the strategic delivery of vaccination programmes.","output":"Understanding the dynamics of COVID-19; implications for therapeutic intervention, vaccine development and movement control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whipple's disease (WD) is a rare infectious disease with a wide clinical spectrum.

METHODS Data of SARS cases notified from Dongcheng District Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and supplemented by other channels were collected. All data were input into dataset files by Microsoft Excel-2000 software and analyzed with SPSS version 10.0 software. RESULTS Totally, 572 cases notified were collected during this period in Dongcheng District, Beijing, and 99 of them were excluded from SARS, because of diagnosis of common cold, pneumonia, measles, or rubella, etc. Actually, 473 SARS cases were analyzed. Attack rate of SARS in permanent residents of Dongcheng was 28.3 per 100,000. Forty-one of them died, with a case-fatality ratio of 8.7%. Outbreak of SARS in Dongcheng District started on March 14, with a peak during mid- and late April, and dropped from May 5, 2003. Persons were all susceptible to SARS, with the highest proportion at ages of 20-50 years, which accounted for 68.7% of the total cases. Average age of the patients at their onset was 40.7 years. No gender difference in SARS cases was found. Number of SARS cases in health care workers (HCWs) accounted for 18.0% and that in the retired persons accounted for 15.4% of the total cases. Cases occurred in all 10 sub-districts of Dongcheng. Totally, 230 of the 572 notified cases (40.2%) hospitalized at local hospitals under the jurisdiction of Dongcheng District. Eighteen of 85 cases of SARS occurred in health care workers of local hospitals, accounting for 4.5% of the total number of health care workers working at the wards caring for SARS patients or at fever clinics. There were 34.7% of SARS cases without any contact histories before their onset. Familial aggregation phenomena were observed in 41.8% of the cases and 18.1% of households. And, 7.4% (attack rate) in those exposed to SARS cases suffered the illness during the periods of quarantine. CONCLUSIONS SARS appeared outbreak in Dongcheng District, Beijing during March to June 2003. People were all susceptible to SARS, which mainly threatened the young adults and the middle-aged, as well as health care workers and the retired workers. Main mode of transmission was exposure to SARS patients in a near distance at hospitals or families.

This study examined the evolution of psychosocial impacts with the progression of the pandemic in adult populations from different countries and continents, and identified, among a wide range of individual and country-level factors, which ones are contributing to this evolving psychological response. An online survey was conducted in May/June 2020 and in November 2020, among a sample of 17,833 adults (Phase 1: 8806; Phase 2: 9027) from eight countries/regions (Canada, the United States, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, the Philippines, New Zealand). Probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive episode (MDE) were assessed. The independent role of potential factors was examined using multilevel logistic regression. Probable GAD or MDE was indicated by 30.1% and 32.5% of the respondents during phases 1 and 2, respectively (a 7.9% increase over time), with an important variation according to countries/regions (range from 22.3% in Switzerland to 38.8% in the Philippines). This proportion exceeded 50% among young adults (18C24 years old) in all countries except for Switzerland. Beyond young age, several factors negatively influenced mental health in times of pandemic; important factors were found, including weak sense of coherence (adjusted odds ratio aOR = 3.89), false beliefs (aOR = 2.33), and self-isolation/quarantine (aOR = 2.01).

Unlike external stigma, internal stigma is not well explored in in the Middle East and North African countries, while grasping this particular form of stigma is essential to limit its effects. The present study aims to measure internal stigma effects and to identify factors associated with this kind of stigma not yet documented among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Morocco. METHODS: The PLHIV Stigma Index questionnaire (adapted and translated into French and Moroccan Arabic dialect darija) was used to collect information regarding the stigma and discrimination experienced by PLHIV across 8 cities in Morocco (SeptemberCOctober 2016). A randomly drawn cluster of 10 PLHIV, consisting of 5 men and 5 women, was drawn at each participating medical care center to achieve a nationally representative sample of PLHIV. Fifteen interviewers living with HIV and five supervisors were selected and trained to administer the questionnaire. An internal stigma score (range: 0C7), was calculated based on seven negative feelings/ beliefs. Negative binomial regression was used to identify characteristics associated with the internal stigma score. RESULTS: Among 626 PLHIV, internal stigma was reported by 88.2%. The median [IQR] internal stigma score was 4 [2C5]. Regarding internal stigma, 51% avoided going to the local clinic when needed and 44% chose not to attend social gatherings. Belonging to at least one key population (aIRR [95%CI] = 1.15 [1.03; 1.28]), experiencing discriminatory reactions from family following HIV status disclosure (1.28 [1.11; 1.49]), avoiding HIV services for fear of stigmatization by staff (1.16 [1.05; 1.28]) and being denied health services because of HIV status (1.16 [1.03;1.32]), are among the factors significantly associated with an increase of the internal stigma score.

We assessed the impact of this lockdown on New Zealand's public ophthalmology service. METHOD An anonymous online survey was sent to all New Zealand-based fellows of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) after lockdown. Respondents provided retrospective assessment of practice patterns and their personal health during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was supported by national-level administrative data, allowing survey findings to be contextualised. RESULTS Fifty-seven respondents (response rate 49%) working in the public health system participated. A large majority of respondents reduced elective clinic and surgical volumes by at least 75% (82% and 98%, respectively). National-level information confirmed clinic reduced to 38.2% of normal and elective operating volumes to 11.5%, with virtual visits increasing 17.9-fold. Elective clinic and elective operating volumes promptly recovered to usual volumes on the second month post lockdown. Most respondents (58%) followed the RANZCO triaging guideline, and 28% triaged emergencies only. At a personal level, respondents reported a significant physical health benefit (p<0.001) associated with the lockdown experience, but no change in mental health or social wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS Publicly employed ophthalmologists experienced dramatic reductions to elective clinic and operating volumes during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Tamarins (Saguinus species) infected by GB virus B (GBV-B) are considered a valid surrogate model for hepatitis C to study the biology of HCV infection and the development of new antiviral drugs. To test the efficacy of local delivery and expression of IFN-alpha in this model, we have developed HD-TET-tIFN, a helper-dependent adenovirus vector expressing tamarin IFN-alpha (tIFN) under the control of the tetracycline-inducible transactivator rtTA2s-S2. Expression of tIFN was successfully induced both in vitro and in vivo in rodents by doxycycline administration with consequent activation of IFN-responsive genes. More importantly, tIFN efficiently inhibited GBV-B replicon in a Huh-7 hepatoma cell line at low HD-TET-tIFN doses. A certain degree of transcriptional control of tIFN was achieved in tamarins injected with HD-TET-tIFN, but under the conditions used in this study, infection and replication of GBV-B were only delayed and not totally abrogated upon virus challenge. Hepatic delivery and regulated expression of IFN-alpha appear to be a possible approach for the cure of hepatitis, but this approach requires more studies to increase its efficacy.

Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of camrelizumab combination therapy vs. chemotherapy for previously untreated patients with advanced, non-squamous NSCLC without Alk or Egfr genomic aberrations from the perspective of China's healthcare system. Methods: Based on the CameL trial, the study developed a three-health state Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding camrelizumab to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in NSCLC patients. The analysis models were conducted for patients unselected by PD-L1 tumor expression (the base case) and the patient subgroup with PD-L1-expressing tumors (1%). Primary model outcomes included the costs in US dollars and health outcomes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as well as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) under a willingness-to-pay threshold of $31,500 per QALY. Additionally, a scenario analysis that adjusted within-trial crossover was employed to evaluate camrelizumab combination therapy compared to chemotherapy without subsequent use of PD1/PD-L1 antibodies. Results: Camrelizumab combination therapy was more costly and provided additional 0.11 QALYs over chemotherapy in the base case analysis (0.86 vs. 0.75 QALYs), 0.12 QALYs over chemotherapy in the subgroup analysis (0.99 vs. 0.88 QALYs), and 0.34 QALYs over chemotherapy in the scenario analysis (0.86 vs. 0.52 QALYs).

Besides, the base case and subgroup analysis were more sensitive to the risk of neutrophil count decreased in the camrelizumab and the utility of stable disease, respectively. Conclusion: Although camrelizumab combination therapy is not cost-effective as first-line therapy for NSCLC patients in China in the base case, adjusting within-trial crossover would move the treatment regimen toward cost-effectiveness in the scenario analysis.","output":"Economic Evaluation of First-Line Camrelizumab for Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This study aimed to assess the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Hertfordshire Community Perinatal Team (CPT) group interventions and the innovations made. BACKGROUND: The CPT is a multidisciplinary mental health service that runs three groups: Circle of Security (CoS), Emotional Coping Skills (ECS) and a peer support group - Wellbeing and Lifestyle. The service has received an increase in referrals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Methods: Team member and client semi structured interviews were conducted with answers transcribed in real time and analysed. Patient clinical records were accessed via PARIS and analysed in order to identify patient demographics within each group and whether these had changed during the pandemic. Clinical outcome measures and client feedback were evaluated to see whether the change in groups is impacting their clinical effectiveness. RESULT: Results: Innovations made by the CPT include: groups becoming virtual, launching of the new Circle of Security Group which helps women tackle the Ghosts in the Nursery and strengthen maternal bonds, restructuring existing groups, breakout room forums and incorporating communication platform apps such as Whatsapp. The Wellbeing and Lifestyle Group increased in size and reach (7 women from 7 areas in 2019 vs 12 women from 12 areas in 2021) with an increased retention rate (71% in 2019 vs 100% in 2021) and a decreased attrition rate (29% in 2019 to 0% in 2021).

Health systems must be well-prepared to cope with large and sudden changes in demand by implementing interventions to ensure adequate access to care. We developed the first planning tool for the COVID-19 pandemic to account for how hospital provision interventions (such as cancelling elective surgery, setting up field hospitals, or hiring retired staff) will affect the capacity of hospitals to provide life-saving care. METHODS: We conducted a review of interventions implemented or considered in 12 European countries in March to April 2020, an evaluation of their impact on capacity, and a review of key parameters in the care of COVID-19 patients. This information was used to develop a planner capable of estimating the impact of specific interventions on doctors, nurses, beds, and respiratory support equipment. We applied this to a scenario-based case study of 1 intervention, the set-up of field hospitals in England, under varying levels of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics pandemic planner is a hospital planning tool that allows hospital administrators, policymakers, and other decision-makers to calculate the amount of capacity in terms of beds, staff, and crucial medical equipment obtained by implementing the interventions. Flexible assumptions on baseline capacity, the number of hospitalizations, staff-to-beds ratios, and staff absences due to COVID-19 make the planner adaptable to multiple settings. The results of the case study show that while field hospitals alleviate the burden on the number of beds available, this intervention is futile unless the deficit of critical care nurses is addressed first. DISCUSSION: The tool supports decision-makers in delivering a fast and effective response to the pandemic. The unique contribution of the planner is that it allows users to compare the impact of interventions that change some or all inputs.","output":"The J-IDEA Pandemic Planner: A Framework for Implementing Hospital Provision Interventions During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perjalanan panjang bangsa Indonesia telah membuktikan ketangguhan dalam menghadapi berbagai macam tantangan.

The processes during on\\\\farm killing that were assessed included handling and moving, stunning and/or killing methods (including restraint). The killing methods were grouped into mechanical and electrical methods as well as lethal injection. In total, 21 hazards compromising animal welfare were identified and characterised, most of these related to stunning and/or killing. Staff was identified as an origin for all hazards, either due to lack of appropriate skills needed to perform tasks or due to fatigue. Possible preventive and corrective measures were assessed: measures to correct hazards were identified for 19 hazards, and the staff was shown to have a crucial role in prevention. Three welfare consequences of hazards to which cattle can be exposed during on\\\\farm killing were identified: impeded movement, pain and fear. The welfare consequences and relevant animal\\\\based measures related to these were described.

METHODS: The Anti-Coronavirus Therapy (ACT) trials are parallel factorial international trials that aimed to enroll 3,500 outpatients and 2,500 inpatients with symptomatic COVID-19. The outpatient trial is evaluating colchicine versus usual care, and aspirin versus usual care. The primary outcome for the colchicine randomization is hospitalization or death, and for the aspirin randomization is major thrombosis, hospitalization, or death. The inpatient trial is evaluating colchicine versus usual care, and the combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily and aspirin 100 mg once daily versus usual care. The primary outcome for the colchicine randomization is need for high flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or death, and for the rivaroxaban plus aspirin randomization is major thrombotic events, need for high flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: At the completion of enrolment on February 10, 2022, the outpatient trial had enrolled 3,917 patients and the inpatient trial 2,754 patients. Challenges encountered included lack of preliminary data about the interventions under evaluation, uncertainties related to the expected event rates, delays in regulatory and ethics approvals and in obtaining study interventions, as well as the changing pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The ACT trials will determine the efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapy with colchicine and antithrombotic therapy with aspirin given alone or in combination with rivaroxaban across the spectrum of mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19.

The most striking symptom of this emerging disease is the loss of scales. It was referred to as scale drop syndrome, but the etiology remained enigmatic. By using a next-generation virus discovery technique, VIDISCA-454, sequences of an unknown virus were detected in serum of diseased fish. The near complete genome sequence of the virus was determined, which shows a unique genome organization, and low levels of identity to known members of the Iridoviridae. Based on homology of a series of putatively encoded proteins, the virus is a novel member of the Megalocytivirus genus of the Iridoviridae family. The virus was isolated and propagated in cell culture, where it caused a cytopathogenic effect in infected Asian seabass kidney and brain cells. Electron microscopy revealed icosahedral virions of about 140 nm, characteristic for the Iridoviridae. In vitro cultured virus induced scale drop syndrome in Asian seabass in vivo and the virus could be reisolated from these infected fish. These findings show that the virus is the causative agent for the scale drop syndrome, as each of Kochs postulates is fulfilled. We have named the virus Scale Drop Disease Virus.

Unfortunately, the success of these apps has been limited, partly owing to poor interoperability with manual contact tracing, low adoption rates, and a societally sensitive trade-off between utility and privacy. In this work, we introduce a new privacy-preserving and inclusive system for epidemic risk assessment and notification that aims to address the above limitations. Rather than capturing pairwise encounters between smartphones as done by existing apps, our system captures encounters between inexpensive, zero-maintenance, small devices carried by users, and beacons placed in strategic locations where infection clusters are most likely to originate. Epidemiological simulations using an agent-based model demonstrate several beneficial properties of our system. By achieving bidirectional interoperability with manual contact tracing, our system can help control disease spread already at low adoption. By utilizing the location and environmental information provided by the beacons, our system can provide significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than existing app-based systems. In addition, our simulations also suggest that it is sufficient to deploy beacons in a small fraction of strategic locations for our system to achieve high utility.","output":"Listening to Bluetooth Beacons for Epidemic Risk Mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the spring of 2020, New York City was an epicenter of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a virtual rehabilitation program would lead to improvements in strength and cardiopulmonary endurance when compared with no intervention in patients discharged home with persistent COVID\\\\19 symptoms. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Between April and July 2020, 106 patients discharged home with persistent COVID\\\\19 symptoms were treated. Forty\\\\four patients performed virtual physical therapy (VPT); 25 patients performed home physical therapy (HPT); 17 patients performed independent exercise program (IE); and 20 patients did not perform therapy. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were assessed by physiatry. VPT sessions were delivered via secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant telehealth platform 1\\\\2 times/week. Patients were asked to follow up 2 weeks after initial evaluation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary study outcome measures were the change in lower body strength, measured by the 30\\\\second sit\\\\to\\\\stand test; and the change in cardiopulmonary endurance, measured by the 2\\\\minute step test. RESULTS: At the time of follow\\\\up, 65% of patients in the VPT group and 88% of patients in the HPT group met the clinically meaningful difference for improvement in sit\\\\to\\\\stand scores, compared with 50% and 17% of those in the IE group and no\\\\exercise group (P = .056).

A search strategy was conducted with PubMed, Cochrane, Medline, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine and DH-DATA databases to look for papers answering our research question: What are the ophthalmological complications for patients after bariatric surgery?. Our search gave a total of 59 relevant papers. Bariatric surgery, particularly subtypes that cause direct bypass of nutrients from the stomach, lead to nutritional deficiencies. Vitamin A, crucial for proper functioning of body systems and specialised cells, manifests ophthalmologically as corneal ulceration, nyctalopia, conjunctival xerosis and more. Thiamine levels are also depleted, leading to Wernickes Encephalopathy. Pre-existing diabetic retinopathy is also noted to worsen sub acutely, although evidence is conflicting. Patients undergoing surgery to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension would have reduced IOP and resolving papilloedema. Other comorbidities of obesity like HB(A1C) levels, obstructive sleep apnoea, and metabolic syndrome also resolve post-surgery. History taking remains the cornerstone of medical practice.

The study aimed to assess global COVID-19 vaccination intention, vaccine characteristics influencing vaccination acceptance and desirable vaccine characteristics influencing the choice of vaccines. METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted between 4 January and 5 March 2021 in 17 countries worldwide. Proportions and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and vaccine characteristics influencing vaccination acceptance were generated and compared across countries and regions. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Of the 19,714 responses received, 90.4% (95% CI 81.8C95.3) reported likely or extremely likely to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A high proportion of likely or extremely likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was reported in Australia (96.4%), China (95.3%) and Norway (95.3%), while a high proportion reported being unlikely or extremely unlikely to receive the vaccine in Japan (34.6%), the U.S. (29.4%) and Iran (27.9%).

Less than two-thirds (59.7%; 95% CI 58.4C61.0) reported only being willing to accept a vaccine with an effectiveness of more than 90%, and 74.5% (95% CI 73.4C75.5) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine with minor adverse reactions. A total of 21.0% (95% CI 20.0C22.0) reported not accepting an mRNA vaccine and 51.8% (95% CI 50.3C53.1) reported that they would only accept a COVID-19 vaccine from a specific country\\\\of\\\\origin. Countries from the Southeast Asia region reported the highest proportion of not accepting mRNA technology. The highest proportion from Europe and the Americas would only accept a vaccine produced by certain countries.

DESIGN: This was a population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Seventeen adult ICUs across 14 acute care hospitals in Alberta, Canada. PATIENTS: All adult (age  15 yr) patients admitted to any study ICU. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main exposure was ICU admission during lockdown occurring between March 16, 2020, and June 30, 2020. This period was compared with two nonpandemic control periods: year prior (March 16, 2019, to June 30, 2019) and pre lockdown immediately prior (November 30, 2019, to March 15, 2020). The primary outcome was the number of ICU admissions. Secondary outcomes included the following: daily measures of ICU utilization, ICU duration of stay, avoidable delay in ICU discharge, and occupancy; and patient outcomes. Mixed multilevel negative binomial regression and interrupted time series regression were used to compare rates of ICU admissions between periods. Multivariable regressions were used to compare patient outcomes between periods. During the lockdown, there were 3,649 ICU admissions (34.1 [8.0] ICU admissions/d), compared with 4,125 (38.6 [9.3]) during the prelockdown period and 3,919 (36.6 [8.7]) during the year prior. Mean bed occupancy declined significantly during the lockdown compared with the nonpandemic periods (78.7%, 95.9%, and 96.4%; p < 0.001). Avoidable ICU discharge delay also decreased significantly (42.0%, 53.2%, and 58.3%; p < 0.001). During the lockdown, patients were younger, had fewer comorbid diseases, had higher acuity, and were more likely to be medical admissions compared with the nonpandemic periods. Adjusted ICU and hospital mortality and ICU and hospital lengths of stay were significantly lower during the lockdown compared with nonpandemic periods.

Severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 are often associated with increased proinflammatory cytokine levels including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using plants to produce an anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal antibody (mAb) and examined its utility in reducing IL-6 signaling in an in vitro model, which simulates IL-6 induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The anti-IL6R mAb (IL6RmAb) was quickly expressed and correctly assembled in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Plant-produced IL6RmAb (pIL6RmAb) could be enriched to homogeneity by a simple purification scheme. Furthermore, pIL6RmAb was shown to effectively inhibit IL-6 signaling in a cell-based model system. Notably, pIL6RmAb also suppressed IL-6 signaling that was induced by the exposure of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This is the first report of a plant-made anti-IL-6R mAb and its activity against SARS-CoV-2-related cytokine signaling. This study demonstrates the capacity of plants for producing functionally active mAbs that block cytokine signaling and implies their potential efficacy to curb cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced Interleukin 6 Signaling Is Blocked by a Plant-Produced Anti-Interleukin 6 Receptor Monoclonal Antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunotherapy is an effective new approach in the treatment of many malignancies.

Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturers instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples. AmpSeq accurately detected and genotyped both IBV lineages in three of five samples containing two IBV lineages. Additionally, one sample contained three IBV lineages, and AmpSeq accurately detected two of the three. Strain identification, including detection of different strains from the same lineage, was also possible with this AmpSeq method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MinION-based AmpSeq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of IBV from oral swab samples.","output":"Real-time, MinION-based, amplicon sequencing for lineage typing of infectious bronchitis virus from upper respiratory samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In COVID 19 Pandemic,first line of defence is effective vaccination program.Because of multiple platforms available for vaccine production we tested relative immunogenicity of two vaccines available in India, Covaxin(R) and Covishield(R) We performed quantitative analysis of neutralizing antibodies to SARS Cov2 spike (receptor binding domain) protein, from sera of 53 subjects who completed vaccines schedules.There was significantly higher immunogenic response with Covishield(R) as compared to Covaxin(R) and are independent of age.

Although the evaluation of FDP is crucial for the management of critical care, the variability among FDP reagents is unclear. In this study, we aimed to compare LIASAUTO P-FDP with three FDP reagents and investigate their characteristics. METHODS In total, 172 plasmas samples were used in the correlation. The sample data were divided into three groups including negative, no and positive discrepancy based on the discrepancy percentages calculated from each correlation between LIASAUTO P-FDP and other three reagents. D-dimer, plasmin-2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), fibrin monomer complex (FMC), fibrinogen (Fbg) and Plasmin-2 Plasmin Inhibitor (2 PI) were measured and included in data analysis. RESULTS The positive discrepancy groups showed higher D-dimer, PIC and FMC values than the negative discrepancy groups. The data indicated that LIASAUTO P-FDP had higher reactivity to D-dimer than other reagents and the values were elevated in the fibrinolysis-enhanced samples with various FDP fragments.

Methods: The CT scan images are fed into the various deep learning, machine learning and hybrid learning models to mine the necessary features and predict CT Score. The predicted CT score along with other clinical, laboratory and CT scan image features are then passed to train the various Regression models for predicting the COVID Criticality (CC) Score. These baseline, laboratory and CT features of COVID-19 are reduced using Statistical analysis and Univariate logistic regression analysis. Results: When analysing the prediction of CT scores using images alone, AlexNet+Lasso yields better outcome with regression score of 0.9643 and RMSE of 0.0023 when compared with Decision tree (RMSE of 0.0034; Regression score of 0.9578) and GRU (RMSE of 0.1253; regression score of 0.9323).

Thus, this Narrative Medicine (NM) project aimed to investigate the evolution of the care pathway and the expectations on genetic counseling and gene therapy by patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This project was conducted between July and December 2020, involving five Italian eye clinics specialized in IRDs, targeted pediatric and adult patients, their caregivers, attending retinologists and multidisciplinary healthcare professionals. Narratives and parallel charts, together with a sociodemographic survey, were collected through the project webpage. In-depth interviews were conducted with Patient Association (PA) members and multidisciplinary healthcare professionals. All data were entered into the Nvivo Software for coding and analysis. RESULTS: Three pediatric and five adult patients with early-onset RPE65-related IRDs as well as eight caregivers were enrolled; 11 retinologists globally wrote 27 parallel charts; in-depth interviews were done with five multidisciplinary healthcare professionals and one PA member. Early diagnosis remains challenging, and patients reported to have changed up to 10 healthcare professionals before accessing their specialized center. Despite the oftentimes lack of awareness of patients and caregivers on the purpose of genetic testing, participants generally consider gene therapy as a therapeutic chance and a historic breakthrough for the management of RPE65-related IRDs. Well-organized networks to support the patients referral to specialized centers C as well as a proper communication of the clinical and genetic diagnosis and the multidisciplinary approach C emerge as crucial aspects in facilitating an early diagnosis and management and a timely initiation of the rehabilitation pathway.

We compare seroprevalence in the same HCW population 6 months later, assess changes in risk factors for seropositivity with progression of the pandemic and serological response to vaccination. METHODS: All staff of both hospitals (N = 9,038) were invited to participate in an online questionnaire and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in April 2021. We measured anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike antibodies. Frequencies and percentages for positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were calculated and adjusted relative risks for participant characteristics were calculated using multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: Five thousand and eighty-five HCW participated. Seroprevalence increased to 21 and 13%, respectively; 26% of infections were previously undiagnosed. Black ethnicity (aRR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3C2.2, p < 0.001), lower level of education (aRR 1.4 for secondary level education, 95% CI 1.1C1.8, p = 0.002), living with other HCW (aRR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0C1.4, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with seropositivity. Having direct patient contact also carried a significant risk being a healthcare assistant (aRR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3C2.3, p < 0.001), being a nurse (aRR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0C1.8, p = 0.022), daily contact with COVID-19 patients (aRR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1C1.7, p = 0.002), daily contact with patients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (aRR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1C1.5, p = 0.013). Breakthrough infection occurred in 23/4,111(0.6%) of fully vaccinated participants; all had anti-S antibodies. CONCLUSION: The increase in seroprevalence reflects the magnitude of the third wave of the pandemic in Ireland. Genomic sequencing is needed to apportion risk to the workplace vs. the household/community. Concerted efforts are needed to mitigate risk factors due to ethnicity and lower level of education, even at this stage of the pandemic. The undiagnosed and breakthrough infections call for ongoing infection prevention and control measures and testing of HCW in the setting of close contact.

Most of them were moderate to severely or critically ill patients who are at risk of developing acute brain dysfunction (delirium). Neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and its neurological manifestations have now been confirmed. Hence to find the prevalence, risk factors for developing delirium in patients admitted with COVID-19 infection, was the objective of this research work. METHODOLOGY: The study includes 10,200 covid infected patient who were admitted to Victoria hospital, from June 2020 to June 2021. Among them 550 cases were found to have neuropsychiatric symptoms. Patients who were on life support, prisoners, patients were with pre-existing Psychiatric illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug dependence (Except ADS and NDS), suicide attempt were excluded. Patients who were blind or deaf were also excluded. Patient demographics, delirium assessments, and management strategies were noted and entered in Microsoft Excel sheets. The outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and to find any associated risk factors for delirium the next day. RESULTS: Delirium was diagnosed in 106 patients.The mean age of patients was 60 years. 68 % were males & 32 % were females. 80 % of them had medical history, 10 % had past history of Alcohol dependence. 40 % of cases were treated in ICU& 32 % of them were treated on Invasive mechanical ventilation (Ventilators). On investigations, inflammatory markers raised in almost all (C- reactive protein 100 %, D-dimmer 64% and Serum ferritin 69 %).

The sequence analysis results showed that mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN have the same domains with other vertebrates except primates, and share some conserved motifs in CRD among all the vertebrates which play a crucial role in interacting with Ca(2+) and for recognizing mannose-containing motifs. Gene synteny of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN were analyzed for the first time and gene synteny of L-SIGN was conserved among the five fishes. Interestingly, one gene next to L-SIGN from gene synteny had high similarity with L-SIGN gene that was described as L-SIGN-like in fish species. While only one L-SIGN gene existed in other vertebrates, two L-SIGN in fish may be in consequence of the fish-specific genome duplication to adapt the specific environment. The evolutionary analysis showed that the ancestral lineages of L-SIGN gene in fishes experienced purifying selection and the current lineages of L-SIGN gene in fishes underwent positive selection, indicating that the ancestral lineages and current lineages of L-SIGN gene in fishes underwent different evolutionary patterns.

Laparoscopy was offered to all patients presenting for surgical attention, thus minimizing selection bias. Complicated cases had abscesses, perforations, fistulas, or strictures. Uncomplicated cases had chronic or recurrent diverticulitis. Summary statistics and univariate comparisons were generated. RESULTS A total of 183 patients were analyzed, including 39 complicated cases. The complicated cohort included 12 abscesses or perforations (31%), 18 fistulas (46%), and 11 strictures (28%). Intraoperative complications were comparable between the two groups (7.7 vs. 9.7%), although the complicated cases resulted in more conversions (23 vs. 4.2%; p = 0.0007). More than 79% of the complicated patients and 96% of the uncomplicated patients underwent unprotected primary anastomosis. Medical (23 vs. 1.4%; p < 0.0001) and surgical (28 vs. 14%; p = 0.035) complications were more frequent in the complicated group. Leak rates were acceptably low (6.5 vs. 2.2%; p = 0.23). There were no recorded deaths. Finally, the time until discharge from hospital was significantly longer in the complicated group by a median of 1 day. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic management of complicated diverticular disease is feasible and appears to be safe in the hands of experts. Despite a high rate of conversion to open surgery, laparoscopy was the sole operative intervention for the majority of patients with complicated diverticular disease. Further studies are needed to allow rigorous comparison with an open control group.","output":"Laparoscopic colectomy for complex diverticular disease: a justifiable choice?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cigarette smoking is a known risk factor for severe disease and death from respiratory infection. Initial data suggest that smoking is a risk factor for COVID-19 symptom severity. Exposure to increased pandemic-related stress and subsequent worry about COVID-19 may amplify the desire to smoke to down-regulate distress. The present investigation sought to test this conceptual model by evaluating worry about COVID-19 in relation to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking, perceived barriers for smoking cessation, and smoking abstinence expectancies. Participants were 219 daily combustible cigarette smokers (55.70% female, Mage = 41.43 years, SD = 11.06). Six separate, two-step hierarchical linear regression models were conducted for each of the criterion variables. As expected, worry about COVID-19 was significantly and positively related to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking and perceived barriers for smoking cessation. Worry about COVID-19 also was a positively significant predictor of smoking abstinence expectancies of negative mood, somatic symptoms, and harmful consequences, but not positive consequences. The present study provides novel empirical evidence that worry about COVID-19 is related to key cognitive-affective smoking processes beyond the effects of age, sex, race, ethnicity, COVID-19 exposure, smoking rate, e-cigarette use status, and anxiety symptoms. These results highlight the potential utility in assessing level of worry about COVID-19, a transdiagnostic construct, among combustible cigarette smokers to better understand cognitive-affective factors that may maintain smoking behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Worry about COVID-19 in relation to cognitive-affective smoking processes among daily adult combustible cigarette smokers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) may occur as a serious complication of hematological malignancy.

We assessed whether seasonal respiratory illness patterns changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We categorized emergency department (ED) visits reported to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program according to chief complaints and diagnosis codes, excluding visits with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections. For each week during March 1, 2020 through December 26, 2020 (\\"pandemic period\\"), we compared the proportion of ED visits in each respiratory category with the proportion of visits in that category during the corresponding weeks of 2017-2019 (\\"pre-pandemic period\\"). We analyzed positivity of respiratory viral tests from two independent clinical laboratories. RESULTS: During March 2020, cough, shortness of breath, and influenza-like illness accounted for twice as many ED visits compared with the pre-pandemic period. During the last four months of 2020, all respiratory conditions, except shortness of breath, accounted for a smaller proportion of ED visits than during the pre-pandemic period. Percent positivity for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, and human metapneumovirus were lower in 2020 than 2019. Although test volume decreased, percent positivity was higher for rhinovirus/enterovirus during the final weeks of 2020 compared with 2019; with ED visits similar to the pre-pandemic period. DISCUSSION: Broad reductions in respiratory test positivity and respiratory emergency department visits (excluding COVID-19) occurred during 2020.

Nonetheless, studies addressing the specific role of DA in the frame of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still missing. In the present study, we investigate the role of DA in SARS-CoV-2 replication along with potential links with innate immune pathways in CaLu-3 human epithelial lung cells. We document here for the first time that, besides DA synthetic pathways, SARS-CoV-2 alters the expression of D1 and D2 DA receptors (D1DR, D2DR), while DA administration reduces viral replication. Such an effect occurs at non-toxic, micromolar-range DA doses, which are known to induce receptor desensitization and downregulation. Indeed, the antiviral effects of DA were associated with a robust downregulation of D2DRs both at mRNA and protein levels, while the amount of D1DRs was not significantly affected. While halting SARS-CoV-2 replication, DA, similar to the D2DR agonist quinpirole, upregulates the expression of ISGs and Type-I IFNs, which goes along with the downregulation of various pro-inflammatory mediators. In turn, administration of Type-I IFNs, while dramatically reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication, converges in downregulating D2DRs expression. Besides configuring the CaLu-3 cell line as a suitable model to study SARS-CoV-2-induced alterations at the level of the DA system in the periphery, our findings disclose a previously unappreciated correlation between DA pathways and Type-I IFN response, which may be disrupted by SARS-CoV-2 for host cell invasion and replication.","output":"Dopamine Reduces SARS-CoV-2 Replication In Vitro through Downregulation of D2 Receptors and Upregulation of Type-I Interferons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus equi subspecies equi infection elicits M protein antibody titers in equids.

However, not all recovered patients develop adequate antibody titers for donation and the relationship between avidity and neutralizing titers is currently not well understood. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG titers and avidity were measured in a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients (n=16 individuals) and a cross-sectional sample of convalescent plasma donors (n=130). Epidemiologic correlates of avidity were examined in donors by linear regression. The association of avidity and a high neutralizing titer (NT) were also assessed in donors using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Antibody avidity increased over duration of infection and remained elevated. In convalescent plasma donors, higher levels of anti-spike avidity was associated with older age, male sex, and hospitalization. Higher NTs had a stronger positive correlation with anti-spike IgG avidity (spearmans rho=0.386;p&0.001), than with anti-nucleocapsid IgG avidity (spearmans rho=0.211;p=0.026). Increasing levels of anti-spike IgG avidity were associated with high NT(160) (adjusted prevalence ratio=1.58[95%CI=1.19-2.12]), independent of age, sex, and hospitalization.

If gone untreated, these injuries can lead to pain, loss of function, and psychological trauma. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors and characterize pediatric hand fractures over a 5-year period. METHODS: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) was queried for all hand fractures in patients aged 1 to 19 years presenting to US EDs between 2016 and 2020. Incidence was calculated using US census data. Cases were retrospectively analyzed using age, location of the injury, sex, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) era, and etiology of injury. Bivariate logistic regression was used where appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 21,031 pediatric hand fractures were identified, representing an estimated 565,833 pediatric hand fractures presenting to EDs between 2016 and 2020. The mean incidence of pediatric hand fractures was 138.3 fractures for 100,000 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI): 136.2-140.4], with a 39.2% decrease in incidence occurring between 2019 and 2020. It was found that 42.2% of the fractures were in patients aged 10 to 14. The incidence of hand fractures for males and females was 97.9 (95% CI: 96.2-99.7) and 40.4 (95% CI: 39.2-41.5), respectively, with the male rate peaking at age 14 and the female rate peaking at age 12. Age, sex, location of the injury, and injury during the COVID-19 pandemic were demonstrated to influence the frequency and etiology of the fracture. CONCLUSION: This study determined the incidence of pediatric hand fractures presenting to EDs across the United States. In addition, it identified risk factors for common hand fracture etiologies (sports-related, falling, crush, punching) and demonstrated the change in rates of different etiologies of pediatric hand fractures that presented to US EDs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS AND RESULTS In the present study, we explored the use of LE-PolyICLC, a liposome encapsulated double-stranded RNA, as a possible prophylactic, therapeutic and immune enhancement agent. In a mouse infection model, we showed that the administration of LE-PolyICLC intranasally before or shortly after infection could inhibit virus replication, leading to a significant reduction in pulmonary viral titres and a higher survival rate of infected mice. When used as a molecular adjuvant, LE-PolyICLC significantly enhanced both the humoral and cellular responses elicited by inactivated H5N1 vaccine and augmented the protective efficacy provided by vaccination. Most importantly, the data also demonstrate that LE-PolyICLC could effectively attenuate the development of pulmonary fibrosis during the restoration period at day 14 after H5N1 infection. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, the data obtained in the present study suggest that strong consideration should be given for the use of LE-PolyICLC as prophylactic and therapeutic agents and also as a vaccination adjuvant to combat highly pathogenic influenza infection and its associated complications such as pulmonary fibrosis.","output":"Prophylactic, therapeutic and immune enhancement effect of liposome-encapsulated PolyICLC on highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Establishing how many people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 remains an urgent priority for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This study examined the predictive validity of a two-item swallowing screen on feeding-tube dependence over 72 h in patients following endotracheal extubation. Intensive-care-unit (ICU) patients ( 20 years) successfully extubated after  48 h endotracheal intubation were screened by trained nurses using the swallowing screen (comprising oral stereognosis and cough-reflex tests) 24 h postextubation. Feeding-tube dependence persisting for 72 h postextubation was abstracted from the medical record by an independent rater. To verify the results and cross-check whether the screen predicted penetration and/or aspiration during fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), participants agreeing to receive FEES were analyzed within 30 min of screening. RESULTS: The results showed that 95/123 participants (77.2%) failed the screen, which predicted ICU patients prolonged (> 72 h) feeding-tube dependence, yielding sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.35, and accuracy of 0.68. Failed-screen participants had 2.96-fold higher odds of feeding-tube dependence (95% CI, 1.13C7.76). For the 38 participants receiving FEES, the swallowing screen had 0.89 sensitivity to detect feeding-tube dependence and 0.86 sensitivity to predict penetration/aspiration, although specificity had room for improvement (0.36 and 0.21, respectively). CONCLUSION: This ultra-brief swallowing screen is sufficiently sensitive to identify high-risk patients for feeding-tube dependence persisting over 72 h after extubation.

In-depth interviews were conducted with fifteen women who were married before age 18, recruited from psychiatry outpatient department and eleven key informants. Thematic analysis was used. Low educated, poor family environment with domestic violence and neglect of children, loss of parents, lack of access to education, and traditional social structure were stated as causes for EM. Families' attitudes about EM were characterized as their daughter's reputation would be tarnished which implied the daughter's premarital relationships would be perceived as immoral by community. All women experienced traditional, aggressive rituals for the first night of marriage, husbands were mostly insensitive, and coercive resulting a traumatic experience. Women were subjected to physical, sexual, psychological, and emotional violence; most of them were socially isolated after marriage with restrictions imposed by their spouses and spouses' family that limited communication with their loved ones. The women generally felt unprepared for adult sexual life and motherhood. In order to prevent EM, raising parents' awareness about EM, supporting girls' education, and enforcing legitimate regulations were recommended.

Multiple countries and cities are implementing different mitigation strategies to reduce their transmission (e.g., physical distancing, stay-at-home orders, avoiding large gatherings). Such interventions have been related to positive and negative health externalities. Currently, the selection of mitigation strategies has not been systematically considering a long-term vision for urban health equity. This review presents evidence and a framework linking COVID-19 mitigation strategies, the built environment, and transport to health determinants and outcomes. In addition, the paper provides a set of urban interventions aimed at supporting COVID-19 mitigation strategies and promoting a long-term health equity vision. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 mitigation strategies, in addition to helping reduce disease transmission, have also decreased urban road transport, resulting in indirect benefits on air quality, traffic noise, and traffic incidents. On the other hand, the same mitigation strategies have had negative impacts on physical activity, mental health, home isolation, and access to transport options, among others. COVID-19 mitigation strategies are an opportunity to test and implement built environment and transport interventions aimed to maximize health equity and minimize health risks. National and local authorities should systematically integrate a long-term urban health equity vision when designing and implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies.

For the first problem, increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity [left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve (ODC)] is of advantage, for the second, however, the contrary is the case. Indeed a right shift of the ODC has been found in former studies for anemia caused by reduced cell production or hemolysis. This resulted from increased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) concentration. In three investigations in COVID-19, however, no change of hemoglobin affinity was detected in spite of probably high [2,3-BPG]. The most plausible cause for this finding is formation of methemoglobin (MetHb), which increases the oxygen affinity and thus apparently compensates for the 2,3-BPG effect. However, this useful effect is cancelled by the concomitant reduction of functional hemoglobin. In the largest study on COVID-19, even a clear left shift of the ODC was detected when calculated from measurements in fresh blood rather than after equilibration with gases outside the body. This additional in vivo left shift possibly results from various factors, e.g., concentration changes of Cl(?), 2,3-BPG, ATP, lactate, nitrocompounds, glutathione, glutamate, because of time delay between blood sampling and end of equilibration, or enlarged distribution space including interstitial fluid and is useful for O(2) uptake in the lungs.

Conclusion: obstetric violence infringes on the main bioethical principles (non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy, justice, vulnerability, dignity, and integrity). Beyond whether it is called violence or not, what matters from an ethical perspective is that, as long as women have such negative experiences during pregnancy and childbirth, obstetric care needs better humanizing.","output":"Obstetric Violence as an Infringement on Basic Bioethical Principles.

Since the required molecular proof of reinfection is challenging to obtain, we aimed to provide serological evidence of reinfection in a cohort of potential reinfection cases.Methods: The study comprises 38 RT-PCR confirmed reinfection cases, with a COVID-19 symptom-free interval of at least 8 weeks (range 57-133 days) since their first RT-PCR confirmed episode. Specific disease symptoms were retrieved from 22 cases by contact tracing and compared between the two disease episodes. The oropharyngeal specimens from 13 cases enabled adequate genomic sequence comparisons. Seventeen cases provided a serum specimen, of which 12 within 7 days after onset of symptoms. Antibody determinations included SARS-CoV-2-specific total Ig, IgM, IgG, avidity, and virus neutralization. Antibody data were compared to that of a control group of primary cases (n=86) in relation to time since onset of disease symptoms.Findings: Reinfection cases generally experienced fewer or milder symptoms. Five of 8 cases which passed genomic comparison between both disease episodes showed reinfection with a different lineage. From 12 reinfection cases that provided a serum sample within 7 days after onset of symptoms, 11/12 (92%) and 12/12 (100%) showed high levels of specific total Ig and IgG antibodies, respectively, compared to 1/23 (4%) and 2/23 (9%) within the control group. Virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in 9/12 (75%) reinfection cases, 5 of which were above a titer of 30. Serological discrimination diminished after 7 days, except for IgG avidity;all 17 reinfection cases had antibodies of higher avidity when compared to control cases.Interpretation: IgG concentration and avidity can be used as an additional diagnostic marker to confirm reinfection with SARS-Cov-2.

Not only do such molecules often fulfil critical biological functions, but also, they may alter the binding of newly designed drugs. In crystal structures, sites consistently occupied in each unit cell yield electron density clouds that represent water molecule presence. These are recorded in virtually all high-resolution structures obtained through X-ray diffraction. In this work, we utilized the wealth of data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank to train a residual deep learning model named hotWater to identify sites on the surface of proteins that are most likely to bind water, the so-called water hot spots. The model can be used to score existing water molecules from a PDB file to provide their ranking according to the predicted binding strength or to scan the surface of a protein to determine the most likely water hot-spots de novo. This is computationally much more efficient than currently used molecular dynamics simulations. Based on testing the model on three example proteins, which have been resolved using both high-resolution X-ray crystallography (providing accurate positions of trapped waters) as well as low-resolution X-ray diffraction, NMR or CryoEM (where structure refinement does not yield water positions), we were able to show that the hotWater method is able to recover in the water-free structures many water binding sites known from the high-resolution structures. A blind test on a newly solved protein structure with waters removed from the PDB also showed good prediction of the crystal water positions. This was compared to two known algorithms that use electron density and was shown to have higher recall at resolutions >2.6 ?.

Indications for further investigation and specific therapies (for myocarditis, postural tachycardia syndrome, mast cell disorder) include hypoxia/desaturation, chest pain, palpitations, and histamine-related symptoms. Rehabilitation should be individualised, with careful activity pacing (to avoid relapse) and multidisciplinary support. CONCLUSION: Long COVID clinics should operate as part of an integrated care system, with GPs playing a key role in the multidisciplinary team. Holistic care pathways, investigation of specific complications, management of potential symptom clusters, and tailored rehabilitation are needed.","output":"Recommendations for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of long COVID: a Delphi study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Selenium, a micronutrient is reported to play a very important role in fighting bacterial and viral infections Selenium exerts its effects through incorporation into selenoproteins that are crucial for providing antioxidant defense and maintaining redox homeostasis The deficiency of selenium in the diet leads to impaired immune response and increased pathogenesis of viral diseases On the other hand, supplementation with selenium has been shown to be very effective in reducing infections and mortality against many pathogenic RNA viruses This has encouraged researchers across the world to examine the role of selenium (if any) in the susceptibility and/or severity of the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Some of the emerging findings along with the future scope of research on using selenium for management of viral infections including COVID-19 are discussed ? 2020, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources All rights reserved","output":"Selenium, a micronutrient can modulate viral diseases including COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a significant public health challenge globally. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the understanding of what constitutes expressed RNAseq variants in healthy, convalescent, severe, moderate, and those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is yet to be presented. We characterize the different expressed RNAseq variants in healthy, severe, moderate, ICU, and convalescent individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bulk RNA sequencing data with identifier PRJNA639275 were downloaded from Sequence Reads Archive (SRA). The individuals were divided into: (1) healthy, n = 34, moderate, n = 8, convalescent, n = 2, severe, n = 16, and ICU, n = 8. Fastqc version 0.11.9 and Cutadapt version 3.7 were used to assess the read quality and perform adapter trimming, respectively. STAR was used to align reads to the reference genome, and GATK best practice was followed to call variants using the rnavar pipeline, part of the nf-core pipelines. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrated that different sets of unique RNAseq variants characterize convalescent, moderate, severe, and those admitted to the ICU. The data show that the individuals who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection have the same set of expressed variants as the healthy controls. We showed that the healthy and SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals display different sets of expressed variants characteristic of the patient phenotype. CONCLUSION: The individuals with severe, moderate, those admitted to the ICU, and convalescent display a unique set of variants.

Methods: An on-line, cross-sectional, survey was conducted in Italy between May and July 2020 to investigate risk perception for COVID-19 and the adoption of preventive measures. A total of 964 volunteers participated in the study. Possible predictors of risk perception were identified through a hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis, including sociodemographic, epidemiological and, most of all, psychological factors. A path analysis was adopted to probe the possible mediating role of risk perception on the relationship between the independent variables considered and the adoption of preventive measures. Results: Focusing on the psychological predictors of risk perception, high levels of anxiety, an anxious attachment, and an external locus of control predicted higher perceived risk. Conversely, high levels of openness personality and of avoidant attachment predicted a lower perception of risk. In turn, the higher was the perceived risk the higher was the adoption of precautionary measures. Furthermore, psychological factors influenced the adoption of preventive behaviors both directly and indirectly through their effect on risk perception.

Based on this premise, we sought to design a ventilator with the following criteria: 1) standard components that are accessible to the public, 2) \\"open-source\\" compatibility to allow anyone to easily recreate the system, 3) ability to ventilate in acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 4) lowest possible cost to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Design We pursued development of a pneumatic-type ventilator. The basic design involves three electrically controlled solenoid valves, a pressure chamber, the patient breathing circuit, a positive end-expiratory pressure valve, and an electronics control system. Multiple safety elements were built into the design. The user-friendly interface allows simple control of ventilator settings. The ventilator delivers a hybrid form of pneumatic, assist-control ventilation, with predicted tidal volumes of 300-800 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure 0-20 cm H2O, and Fio2 21-100%. Main Results The ventilator was extensively tested with two separate high-fidelity lung simulators and a porcine in vivo model. Both lung simulators were able to simulate a variety of pathologic states, including obstructive lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The ventilator performed well across all simulated scenarios. Similarly, a porcine in vivo model was used to assess performance in live tissue, with a specific emphasis on gas exchange. The ventilator performed well in vivo and demonstrated noninferior ventilation and oxygenation when compared with the standard ventilator. Conclusions The Portsmouth Ventilator was able to perform well across all simulated pathologies and in vivo. All components may be acquired by the public for a cost of approximately $250 U.S.D.

Although discussions have centered on policies to promote financial liquidity, we examine whether the state apparatus-not only state-owned enterprises but also development agencies and investment funds-can innovate and adjust production processes to improve infrastructure and capabilities to prevent and treat the disease. Potential actions include public-private effort addressing both discovery and coordination problems-such as a collaborative effort to develop prevention and treatment technologies, as well as state capital to stimulate retooling and expansion of strategic infrastructure. The state apparatus can also help access remote and critical areas with relatively lower private returns. In contrast, support to industries must be implemented with caution, especially for sectors whose demand may suffer permanently due to lifestyle changes. Exit strategies must be carefully crafted to avoid the risk of perpetuating unjustified and ineffective state support, establishing milestones and termination clauses based on clear performance indicators. We argue that, although using the state apparatus as a countermeasure entails a set of risks, not using it may increase the risk of extending the crisis and end with an overloaded state sector (e.g., due to massive bailouts), challenging the implementation of subsequent adjustments.","output":"Leviathan as a partial cure?

Objective We assessed antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in people between April-October, 2020. Results Nationally, we estimated a seroprevalence of 30.4% for IgG and 39.7% for IgM. In Dhaka city, seroprevalence for IgG was 35.4% in non-slum areas, while it was 63.5% in slums. In areas outside of Dhaka, the seroprevalence rate for IgG was 37.5 and 28.7%, respectively, in urban and rural areas. Between April and October, 2020, the highest seroprevalence rate (57% for IgG and 64% for IgM) was observed in August. IgM antibody was more prevalent in the younger age participants, while older participants had more frequent IgG seropositivity. Follow-up specimens from COVID-19 patients and their household members suggested that both IgG and IgM seropositivity increased significantly at day 14 and 28 compared to day 1 of enrollment.

Using a dynamic epidemiological model with Covid-19 climate sensitivity in the likely range, we demonstrate why attempts to detect a climate signal in Covid-19 have thus far been inconclusive. Then we formulate a novel methodology and related criteria that can be used to test for seasonal climate sensitivity in observed Covid-19 infection data. We show that if the disease does have a substantial seasonal dependence, and herd immunity is not established during the first peak season of the outbreak (or a vaccine does not become available), there is likely to be a seasonality-sensitive second wave of infections about one year after the initial outbreak. In regions where non-pharmaceutical control has contained the disease in the first year of outbreak and thus kept a large portion of the population susceptible, the second wave may be substantially larger in amplitude than the first if control measures are relaxed. This is simply because it develops under the favorable conditions of a full autumn to winter period and from a larger pool of infected individuals.","output":"Test for Covid-19 seasonality and the risk of second waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During adolescence, sleep and circadian timing shift later, contributing to restricted sleep duration and irregular sleep-wake patterns. The association of these developmental changes in sleep and circadian timing with cognitive functioning, and consequently academic outcomes, has not been examined prospectively. The role of ambient light exposure in these developmental changes is also not well understood. Here, we describe the protocol for the Circadian Light in Adolescence, Sleep and School (CLASS) Study that will use a longitudinal design to examine the associations of sleep-wake timing, circadian timing and light exposure with academic performance and sleepiness during a critical stage of development. We also describe protocol adaptations to enable remote data collection when required during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Approximately 220 healthy adolescents aged 12C13 years (school Year 7) will be recruited from the general community in Melbourne, Australia. Participants will be monitored at five 6 monthly time points over 2 years. Sleep and light exposure will be assessed for 2 weeks during the school term, every 6 months, along with self-report questionnaires of daytime sleepiness. Circadian phase will be measured via dim light melatonin onset once each year. Academic performance will be measured via national standardised testing (National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy) and the Wechsler Individual Achievement TestAustralian and New Zealand Standardised Third Edition in school Years 7 and 9. Secondary outcomes, including symptoms of depression, anxiety and sleep disorders, will be measured via questionnaires. DISCUSSION: The CLASS Study will enable a comprehensive longitudinal assessment of changes in sleep-wake timing, circadian phase, light exposure and academic performance across a key developmental stage in adolescence. Findings may inform policies and intervention strategies for secondary school-aged adolescents.

Objectives: To develop prognosis prediction models for COVID-19 patients attending an emergency department (ED) based on initial chest X-ray (CXR), demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters. Methods: All symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital ED between February 24th and April 24th 2020 were recruited. CXR features, clinical and laboratory variables and CXR abnormality indices extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) diagnostic tool were considered potential predictors on this first visit. The most serious individual outcome defined the three severity level: 0) home discharge or hospitalization  3 days, 1) hospital stay >3 days and 2) intensive care requirement or death. Severity and in-hospital mortality multivariable prediction models were developed and internally validated. The Youden index was used for the optimal threshold selection of the classification model. Results: A total of 440 patients were enrolled (median 64 years; 55.9% male); 13.6% patients were discharged, 64% hospitalized, 6.6% required intensive care and 15.7% died. The severity prediction model included oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen fraction (SatO2/FiO2), age, C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count, extent score of lung involvement on CXR (ExtScoreCXR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer level and platelets count, with AUC-ROC=0.94 and AUC-PRC=0.88.

Examination of the left breast showed 7  4 cm mass, spanning from 10-2 o'clock, free from surrounding structures, with preserved overlying skin. However, the mass was not visualized on mammogram. Ultrasound showed a left breast lobulated hypoechoic mass containing a hyperechoic component. Biopsy showed fat necrosis. After 1 month, she presented with ulceration of the overlying skin.

The goal of the present study was to determine whether developmental delays, possibly mediated by systemic or local hypothyroidism, contribute to the failure to develop hearing in mice lacking Slc26a4 (Slc26a4(-/-)). We evaluated thyroid function by voltage and pH measurements, by array-assisted gene expression analysis, and by determination of plasma thyroxine levels. Cochlear development was evaluated for signs of hypothyroidism by microscopy, in situ hybridization, and quantitative RT-PCR. No differences in plasma thyroxine levels were found in Slc26a4(-/-) and sex-matched Slc26a4(+/-) littermates between postnatal day 5 (P5) and P90. In adult Slc26a4(-/-) mice, the transepithelial potential and the pH of thyroid follicles were reduced. No differences in the expression of genes that participate in thyroid hormone synthesis or ion transport were observed at P15, when plasma thyroxine levels peaked. Scala media of the cochlea was 10-fold enlarged, bulging into and thereby displacing fibrocytes, which express Dio2 to generate a cochlear thyroid hormone peak at P7. Cochlear development, including tunnel opening, arrival of efferent innervation at outer hair cells, endochondral and intramembraneous ossification, and developmental changes in the expression of Dio2, Dio3, and Tectb were delayed by 1-4 days.

The Snap-on concentrator design is easy to hook up to an existing compressed air source, and the unit can then be readily used to produce oxygen for medical applications. It is easily transportable and compared to a traditional oxygen concentrator with its dedicated compressor, the Snap-on concentrator is particularly relevant for the oxygen therapy needs of a larger number of patients in situations such as COVID-19. A commercially available LiLSX zeolite was used for the separation of oxygen from compressed ambient air. The experiments were performed at different feed air pressures using a constant supply of house air in the lab. Further, the device performance was also analyzed using a standalone medium size air compressor. The minimum bed size factor obtained with compressed house air was 100 lb/tons per day contained (TPDc) O(2) at a cycle time of 7 s, whereas the minimum bed size factor obtained with a medium size air compressor weighing about 12 lbs was 210 lb/TPD(c) O(2) at a cycle time of 14.5 s under the same feed pressures of 3.1 bar at an oxygen product purity of 90%. The product oxygen flow rate was nearly double for the same amount of adsorbent when using house air for the Snap-on design. The primary reason for this significantly higher oxygen production was the substantially higher and stable air throughput capacity of a typical house air compressor that enabled rapid cycling of the process at near-constant feed pressure compared to a medium size compressor used in a medical oxygen concentrator. The oxygen recovery was approximately 34% for both cases. Thus, the Snap-on oxygen concentrator was found to be easier to build and it delivered more oxygen for medical use compared to standalone units in locations where a constant supply of compressed feed air is available. This is typically the case in facilities such as hospitals, military medical camps and cruise ships.

The evidence regarding the status of the patient safety culture in Arab countries in general shows that it is at a suboptimal level due to a punitive approach to errors and deficits in the openness of communications. OBJECTIVES To identify factors contributing to the patient safety culture in Saudi Arabia. DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS A systematic search was carried out in May 2018 in five electronic databases and updated in July 2020-MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Relevant journals and reference lists of included studies were also hand-searched. Two independent reviewers verified that the studies met the inclusion criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted their relevant characteristics. The Yorkshire Contributory Factors Framework (YCFF) was used to categorise factors affecting safety culture in the included papers. RESULTS 14 papers were included and the majority of studies were appraised as being of good quality. Strength and weakness factors that contribute to patient safety culture were identified. Ineffective leadership, a blame culture, workload/inadequate staffing and poor communication are reported as the main factors hindering a positive patient safety culture in Saudi Arabia. Conversely, 'strength' factors contributing to a positive patient safety culture included supportive organisational attitudes to learning/continuous improvement, good teamwork within units and support from hospital management for patient safety. There is an absence of patient perspectives regarding patient safety culture in Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION Policymakers in the Saudi healthcare system should pay attention to the factors that may contribute to a positive patient safety culture, especially establishing a blame-free culture, improving communications and leadership capacity, learning from errors and involving patient perspectives in safety initiatives. Further research is required to understand in depth the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a positive patient safety culture in Saudi Arabia.","output":"Factors contributing to the patient safety culture in Saudi Arabia: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: COVID-19 has accelerated the use of digital health, however, there is no universally accepted definition The objective of this scoping review was to provide an overview of definitions in the literature including the context in which it exists e g public health organization, supplier organization, etc to derive those which are aligned with the ISPOR mission of outcomes research Methods: A literature search was undertaken for the past 5 years (2015-2020) on the major specific terms used in digital health (n=38) where these exist with synonyms of definition as a key term Databases searched included Embase, PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library and EconLit A team of 2 volunteers independently reviewed each abstract to identify those which were likely to contain a definition or taxonomy and then reconciled any misalignment between the authors or referred the abstract to a third-party reviewer Independent review by 2 volunteers was also employed to extract the relevant parameters in a recording spreadsheet from the full paper review Results: From 2966 hits in the four different databases (Embase: n=2263;PubMed: n=657, Cochrane n=35, EconLit: n=11), the scoping review identified 2,610 original abstracts Fifteen teams of two independent volunteers undertook the review of the abstracts The agreement between the initial assessments of rater pairs was between 97 1% and 36 2% Cohens kappa ranged from 0 91 to 0 11 A third reviewer reconciled disagreement in 73 (2 8%) citations The number of abstracts taken through to the full paper review was 545 (20 9%) Conclusions: This timely work indicates that definitions included in the literature cover several terms which can be grouped under different applications of digital health An overview of the different terms and their context to identify options which align with the ISPOR Mission will be presented","output":"PNS192 Defining the New Age of Digital Health?

However, they maintain their physical functions with minimal skeletal muscle atrophy and metabolic dysfunction. In bears, resistance to skeletal muscle atrophy during hibernation is likely mediated by seasonally altered systemic factors that are independent of neuromuscular activity. To determine whether there are components in bear serum that regulate protein and energy metabolism, differentiated human skeletal muscle cells were treated with bear serum (5% in DMEM/Ham's F-12, 24 h) collected during active summer (July) and hibernating winter (February) periods. The serum samples were collected from the same individual bears (Ursus thibetanus japonicus, n = 7 in each season). Total protein content in cultured skeletal muscle cells was significantly increased following a 24 h treatment with hibernating bear serum. Although the protein synthesis rate was not altered, the expression of MuRF1 protein, a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase was significantly decreased along with a concomitant activation of Akt/FOXO3a signaling. Increased levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were also observed in hibernating bear serum. These observations suggest that protein metabolism in cultured human myotubes may be altered when incubated with hibernating bear serum, with a significant increase in serum IGF-1 and diminished MuRF1 expression, a potential target of Akt/FOXO3a signaling. A protein sparing phenotype in cultured muscle cells by treatment with hibernating bear serum holds potential for the development of methods to prevent human muscle atrophy and related disorders.","output":"Supplementing cultured human myotubes with hibernating bear serum results in increased protein content by modulating Akt/FOXO3a signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to distinguish between erratic and systematic patterns of change in case count data is crucial for assessing and projecting the course of disease outbreaks.

Within the current study, we investigate whether the sequence of music with different emotional valence can modulate the emotional state. All participants were healthy adults who underwent a sadness induction via a movie clip. They were subsequently divided into four experimental groups. Each was asked to listen to two pieces of music according to a specific sequence: sad-sad; sad-happy; happy-happy; happy-sad. Participants were prompt to rate their current emotional state at different stages of the experiment: prior to and after the movie clip, as well as after each of the two pieces of music. The frame used for the assessment was the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the Self-Assessment Manikin. The results indicate that the movie clip induced sadness. The group of participants who listened to the sad music first and the happy music afterwards ultimately reported a higher positive affect, a higher emotional valence, and a lower negative affect compared with the other groups. However, not all the between-group differences reached significance. We conclude that the sequence of music with different emotional valence affects the current emotional state.

Recently, several variants such as B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and P.1 (gamma), which share a key mutation N501Y on the receptor-binding domain (RBD), appear to be more infectious to humans. To understand the underlying mechanism, we used a cell surface-binding assay, a kinetics study, a single-molecule technique, and a computational method to investigate the interaction between these RBD (mutations) and ACE2. Remarkably, RBD with the N501Y mutation exhibited a considerably stronger interaction, with a faster association rate and a slower dissociation rate. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-molecule force microscopy (SMFS) consistently quantified the interaction strength of RBD with the mutation as having increased binding probability and requiring increased unbinding force. Molecular dynamics simulations of RBDCACE2 complexes indicated that the N501Y mutation introduced additional - and -cation interactions that could explain the changes observed by force microscopy. Taken together, these results suggest that the reinforced RBDCACE2 interaction that results from the N501Y mutation in the RBD should play an essential role in the higher rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that future mutations in the RBD of the virus should be under surveillance.","output":"N501Y mutation of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 strengthens its binding to receptor ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are at increased risk of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. While these infections are frequently encountered in the general population, the spectrum of their clinical presentation including morbidity and mortality is increased in patients undergoing transplantation procedures. Impaired innate and adaptive immunity, potential anatomical abnormalities resulting from extensive surgical procedures, presences of indwelling medical devices, and increased healthcare exposure put transplant recipients at particularly high risk for respiratory tract disease. Infections of the respiratory tract can be divided into those affecting the paranasal sinuses, the upper airways such as bronchitis and tracheobronchitis, and the lower airways like pneumonia. Each of these clinical syndromes can further be classified based on their chronicity, acute vs. chronic; their setting, community vs. nosocomial; and the etiology such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and rarely parasites. It is also important to realize that such immunologically vulnerable patients are at risk for polymicrobial infection that may present concurrently or in a sequential, consecutive fashion.

The sale of live wildlife has been highlighted as a particular risk, and the World Health Organisation has called for the banning of live, wild-caught mammalian species in markets unless risk assessment and effective regulations are in place. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a global scoping review of peer-reviewed information about the sale of live, terrestrial wildlife in markets that are likely to sell fresh food, and collated data about the characteristics of such markets, activities involving live wildlife, the species sold, their purpose, and animal, human, and environmental health risks that were identified. Of the 59 peer-reviewed records within scope, only 25% (n = 14) focussed on disease risks; the rest focused on the impact of wildlife sale on conservation. Although there were some global patterns (for example, the types of markets and purpose of sale of wildlife), there was wide diversity and huge epistemic uncertainty in all aspects associated with live, terrestrial wildlife sale in markets such that the feasibility of accurate assessment of the risk of emerging infectious disease associated with live wildlife trade in markets is limited. Given the value of both wet markets and wildlife trade and the need to support food affordability and accessibility, conservation, public health, and the social and economic aspects of livelihoods of often vulnerable people, there are major information gaps that need to be addressed to develop evidence-based policy in this environment.

The first part of the questionnaire consists of demographic and professional information, and the second part included questions about knowledge and awareness questions about MRONJ. The SPSS software was used for statistical data analysis. A Chi-square test was performed to compare between the groups. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 112 dentists participated in this survey. The participants showed an insufficient level of knowledge regarding MRONJ, as only 56.6% of the participants stated that they had general knowledge about MRONJ.

In particular, the usual task of outpatient care has shifted to the telemedicine format, bringing along all of its attendant advantages and gargantuan challenges. The authors sought to determine the responsiveness of this telemedicine setup to the needs of their disadvantaged patients and explored the application of Bayesian inference to enhance the use of teleconsultation in daily clinical decision-making. METHODS: The authors used the following methods to assess the telemedicine setup used in a low-resource setting during the pandemic: 1) a cross-sectional survey of patients who participated in a medical consultation via telemedicine during the 16-week period from March 16, 2020, to July 15, 2020; 2) a cost-benefit analysis of the use of telemedicine by patients; and 3) a case illustration of a Bayesian approach application unique to the teleconsultation scenario. RESULTS: Of the 272 patient beneficiaries of telemedicine in a 16-week period, 57 responded to the survey. The survey responses regarding neurosurgical outpatient care through telemedicine yielded high ratings of utility for the patients and their caregivers. According to 64% of respondents, the affordability of the telemedicine setup also prevented them from borrowing money from others, among other adverse life events prevented. There were realized financial gains on the part of the patients in terms of cost savings and protection from further impoverishment. The benefit-cost ratio was 3.51 for the patients, signifying that the benefits outweighed the costs. An actual teleconsultation case vignette was reported that is meant to be instructive and contributory to the preparedness of the neurosurgeon on the provider end of the service delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine holds promise as a viable and safe method for health service delivery during the pandemic. In the setting of a health system that is continually challenged by shortages of resources, this study shows that an effective telemedicine setup can come with high benefit-cost ratios and quality of care, along with the assurance of patient satisfaction. The potential for high-quality care can be enhanced by the inclusion of the Bayesian framework to the basic toolkit of remote clinical assessment. When confronted with choices in terms of differential diagnosis and tests, the rigor of a simple application of the Bayesian framework can minimize costs arising from uncertainties.","output":"Recapitulating the Bayesian framework for neurosurgical outpatient care and a cost-benefit analysis of telemedicine for socioeconomically disadvantaged patients in the Philippines during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to assess the repurposing potential of existing antiviral drug candidates (FDA approved and investigational) against SARS-CoV-2 target proteins that facilitates viral entry and replication into the host body. To evaluate molecular affinities between antiviral drug candidates and SARS-CoV-2 associated target proteins such as spike protein (S) and main protease (Mpro ), a molecular interaction simulation was performed using MD software and subsequently the applicability score was calculated by machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the STITCH algorithm was used to predict the pharmacology network involving multiple pathways of active drug candidate(s). Pharmacophores feature of active drug(s) molecules was also determined to predict structure activity relationship. The molecular interaction analysis showed that cordycepin has strong binding affinities with S protein (-180) and Mpro proteins (-205) which were relatively highest among other drug candidates used. Interestingly, compounds with low IC50 showed high binding energy. Furthermore, machine learning algorithm also revealed high applicability scores (0.42-0.47) of cordycepin. It is worth mentioning that the pharmacology network depicted the involvement of cordycepin in different pathways associated with bacterial and viral diseases including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, influenza A, viral myocarditis and herpes simplex infection. The embedded pharmacophore features with cordycepin also suggested strong structure-activity relationship (SAR). Cordycepin's anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity indicated 65% (E-gene) and 42% (N-gene) viral replication inhibition after 48h of treatment. Since cordycepin has both pre-clinical and clinical evidence on antiviral activity, in addition the present findings further validate and suggest repurposing potential of cordycepin against COVID-19.","output":"Repurposing potential of FDA approved and investigational drugs for COVID-19 targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike and main protease and validation by machine learning algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, cases of infection continue to increase and pose a great threat to the safety of people. When an individual perceives a threat in the environment, a stress reaction is automatically triggered. Long-term stress can lead to severe mental problems. Thus, the present study aims to assess the relationship between information disclosure and psychological anxiety and to determine the mediating role of epidemic prevention satisfaction and epidemic prevention confidence. METHOD A survey is conducted on 1,439 respondents to determine the mental health of Chinese residents during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The logit method is used to explore the correlation between information disclosure and psychological anxiety. Furthermore, the bootstrap decomposition method is used to verify the mediation effects of different aspects of epidemic prevention satisfaction and epidemic prevention confidence. RESULTS The study finds that information disclosure exerts a negative impact on psychological anxiety attributable to COVID-19 ( = -.085, p < .001), whereas epidemic prevention satisfaction and epidemic prevention confidence mediated the relationship between information disclosure and psychological anxiety.

However, its determinants remain partially unknown. We aimed to assess the relationship between severity of inflammatory response/coagulation abnormalities and hsTnT in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We then explored the relevance of these pathways in defining mortality and complications risk and the potential effects of the treatments to attenuate such risk. Methods: : In this single-center, prospective, observational study we enrolled 266 consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Primary endpoint was in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. Results: hsTnT, even after adjustment for confounders, was associated with mortality. D-dimer and CRP presented stronger associations with hsTnT than PaO 2 . Changes of hsTnT, D-dimer and CRP were related but only D-dimer was associated with mortality. Moreover, low molecular weight heparin showed attenuation of the mortality in the whole population, particularly in subjects with higher hsTnT. Conclusions: : D-dimer possessed a strong relationship with hsTnT and mortality. Anticoagulation treatment showed greater benefits with regard to mortality. These findings suggest a major role of SARS-CoV-2 coagulopathy in hsTnT elevation and its related mortality in COVID-19.

Lignin is a water-insoluble dietary fiber, but it is second only to cellulose in abundance. Celery is the main source of dietary fiber, but its quality and production are limited by various abiotic stresses. Here, AgNAC1 containing the NAM domain was identified from celery. AgNAC1 was found to be a nuclear protein. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants hosting AgNAC1 have longer root lengths and stomatal axis lengths than the wide type (WT). The evidence from lignin determination and expression levels of lignin-related genes indicated that AgNAC1 plays a vital role in lignin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the results of the physiological characterization and the drought and salt treatments indicate that AgNAC1-overexpressing plants are significantly resistive to salt stress. Under drought and salt treatments, the AgNAC1 transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants presented increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and size of stomatal apertures relatively to the WT plants. The AgNAC1 served as a positive regulator in inducing the expression of stress-responsive genes.

Therefore, it is critical to identify conserved structures in SARS-CoV-2 genomes as potential targets for variant-proof diagnostics and therapeutics. However, the algorithms to predict these conserved structures, which simultaneously fold and align multiple RNA homologs, scale at best cubically with sequence length, and are thus infeasible for coronaviruses, which possess the longest genomes (~30,000 nt) among RNA viruses. As a result, existing efforts on modeling SARS-CoV-2 structures resort to single sequence folding as well as local folding methods with short window sizes, which inevitably neglect long-range interactions that are crucial in RNA functions. Here we present LinearTurboFold, an efficient algorithm for folding RNA homologs that scales linearly with sequence length, enabling unprecedented global structural analysis on SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, on a group of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related genomes, LinearTurboFolds purely in silico prediction not only is close to experimentally-guided models for local structures, but also goes far beyond them by capturing the end-to-end pairs between 5 and 3 UTRs (~29,800 nt apart) that match perfectly with a purely experimental work. Furthermore, LinearTurboFold identifies novel conserved structures and conserved accessible regions as potential targets for designing efficient and mutation-insensitive small-molecule drugs, antisense oligonucleotides, siRNAs, CRISPR-Cas13 guide RNAs and RT-PCR primers. LinearTurboFold is a general technique that can also be applied to other RNA viruses and full-length genome studies, and will be a useful tool in fighting the current and future pandemics.","output":"LinearTurboFold: Linear-Time Global Prediction of Conserved Structures for RNA Homologs with Applications to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased globalization has ushered in changes in diplomatic purposes and practices.

We sought to determine COVID-19 outcomes among patients with RMD 6 months into the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study at Mass General Brigham in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients with RMD matched to up to five comparators by age, sex and COVID-19 diagnosis date (between 30 January 2020 and 16 July 2020) and followed until last encounter or 18 August 2020. COVID-19 outcomes were compared using Cox regression. Risk of mechanical ventilation was compared in an early versus a recent cohort of patients with RMD. RESULTS: We identified 143 patients with RMD and with COVID-19 (mean age 60 years; 76% female individuals) and 688 comparators (mean age 59 years; 76% female individuals). There were no significantly higher adjusted risks of hospitalisation (HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.68C1.11), intensive care unit admission (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 0.86C1.86), or mortality (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.53C1.95) in patients with RMD versus comparators. There was a trend towards a higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the RMD cohort versus comparators, although not statistically significant (adjusted HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.93C2.44). There was a trend towards improvement in mechanical ventilation risk in the recent versus early RMD cohort (10% vs 19%, adjusted HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.17C1.12).

A total of 237 samples [76 bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL(DS)) and 82 endotracheal aspirates (ETA(DS)) obtained at HAP diagnosis, and 79 ETA obtained during follow-up (ETA(TT))], were analyzed independently by routine microbiology testing and FAPP. 58 patients had paired BAL(DS) and ETA(DS). The positivity thresholds of semi-quantified bacteria were 10(3)C10(4) CFUs/mL or 10(4) copies/mL for BAL, and 10(5) CFUs/mL or copies/mL for ETA. Respiratory commensals (H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, S. pneumoniae) were the most common pathogens. Discordant results for bacterial identification were observed in 33/76 (43.4%) BAL(DS) and 36/82 (43.9%) ETA(DS), and in most cases, FAPP identified one supplemental bacteria (23/33 BAL(DS) and 21/36 ETA(DS)).

Interestingly, no comparative/equivalent cases were found in domestic animals. This report describes the pathological and mycological findings associated with diphtheric aspergillosis tracheitis in an immunocompromised calf. The main pathological findings were diphtheric tracheitis and rhinitis, and necrotizing ruminitis associated with intralesional septate, acute branching fungal hyphae consistent with Aspergillus spp. Mycological culture and isolation confirmed the fungal hyphae as A. fumigatus due to characteristic features. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays identified intralesional antigens of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and malignant catarrhal fever virus (MCFV) at the trachea and small intestine; IHC detected intralesional antigens of bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) only at the trachea. These findings confirmed the simultaneous occurrence of A. fumigatus with concomitant infections due to BVDV, MCFV, and BoHV-1 in this calf. Since ovine gammaherpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2) is the cause of MCF in Brail, it is likely that the intralesional MCFV antigens identified were those of OvHV-2. In this case, disseminated aspergillosis was probably associated with the undeveloped immunological status of the calf that was further impaired due to the combined immunodepressive effects of BVDV and BoHV-1 infections. Although BVDV and BoHV-1 are infectious disease pathogens frequently associated with the development of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in feedlot and dairy cattle, the identification of intralesional OvHV-2-like antigens in several parts of the lungs suggest that this MCFV also played a role in the BRD-associated lesions identified in this calf.","output":"Diphtheric aspergillosis tracheitis with gastrointestinal dissemination secondary to viral infections in a dairy calf"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that are emerging as the most promising means of allogeneic cell therapy.

Ripening of tomato fruit is associated with several modifications such as loss of cell wall firmness and transformation of chloroplasts to chromoplasts.

However, the role of different components of oxidative stress metabolism in fruit ripening has been scarcely addressed. Two GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (GGP) Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Micro-Tom mutants which have fruit with low ascorbic acid content (30% of wild type) were used in this work to unravel the participation of ascorbic acid and H2O2 in fruit maturation. Both GGP mutants show delayed fruit maturation with no peak of H2O2; treatment with ascorbic acid increases its own concentration and accelerates ripening only in mutants to become like wild type plants. Unexpectedly, the treatment with ascorbic acid increases H2O2 synthesis in both mutants resembling what is observed in wild type fruit. Exogenous supplementation with H2O2 decreases its own synthesis delaying fruit maturation in plants with low ascorbic acid content. The site of ROS production is localized in the chloroplasts of fruit of all genotypes as determined by confocal microscopy analysis.

Understanding of the immune response and biomarker analysis is needed to progress toward understanding disease pathology and developing improved treatment options. The goal of this study is to identify pathogenic factors that are linked to disease severity and patient characteristics. Patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from March 17 to June 5, 2020 were analyzed for clinical features of disease and soluble plasma cytokines in association with disease severity and sex. Data from COVID-19 patients with acute illness were examined along with an age- and gender-matched control cohort. We identified a group of 16 soluble factors that were found to be increased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls, whereas 2 factors were decreased. In addition to inflammatory cytokines, we found significant increases in factors known to mediate vasculitis and vascular remodeling (PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB-BB, soluble CD40L (sCD40L), FGF, and IP10). Four factors such as platelet-derived growth factors, fibroblast growth factor-2, and IFN-?3-inducible protein 10 were strongly associated with severe disease and ICU admission. Th2-related factors (IL-4 and IL-13) were increased with IL-4 and sCD40L present at increased levels in males compared with females. Our analysis revealed networking clusters of cytokines and growth factors, including previously unknown roles of vascular and stromal remodeling, activation of the innate immunity, as well activation of type 2 immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.

About 70% of OPC were attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV). However, only 51% of U.S. and 43.5% of Texas adolescents have completed the HPV vaccine series. Therefore, modeling the demographic dynamics and transmission of HPV and OPC progression is needed for accurate estimation of the economic and epidemiological impacts of HPV vaccine in a geographic area. An age-structured population dynamic model was developed for the U.S. state of Texas. With Texas-specific model parameters calibrated, this model described the dynamics of HPV-associated OPC in Texas. Parameters for the Year 2010 were used as the initial values, and the prediction for Year 2012 was compared with the real age-specific incidence rates in 23 age groups for model validation. The validated model was applied to predict 100-year age-adjusted incidence rates. The public health benefits of HPV vaccine uptake were evaluated by computer simulation. Compared with current vaccination program, increasing vaccine uptake rates by 50% would decrease the cumulative cases by 4403, within 100 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this strategy was $94,518 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Increasing the vaccine uptake rate by 50% can: (i) reduce the incidence rates of OPC among both males and females; (ii) improve the quality-adjusted life years for both males and females; (iii) be cost-effective and has the potential to provide tremendous public health benefits in Texas.","output":"An economic and disease transmission model of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer in Texas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: On the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown clearance in Saudi Arabia, the high-profile precautions were applied as a major step to resume the normal life activities and to coexist with the pandemic One of those resumed activities is the reopening of the gym and fitness centers The perception and the commitment with safe precautions in terms of personal hygiene and sterilization have dramatically changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic The purpose of this study was to assess the behavior of gym attendees toward preventive precautions prior to the pandemic and the behavioral changes that will be accommodated after the new policy and procedure of attending a gym and fitness centers Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in February 2020, a 1 month prior to the complete lockdown announcement in Saudi Arabia as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak An electronic questionnaire was provided during a personal interview with gym and fitness centers' participants Results: The majority of participants never use sterile wipes or any sterile product before or after using gym equipment (61 6%), and 35 4% of gym attendants do not use any sterilization materials distributed through fitness centers In addition, most of the participants have had an episode of skin infections or respiratory infection at the fitness center for the past 12 months (22 2%), whereas 80 8% do not know about tinea microbial that causes athlete's foot, and 65 7% of them utilize the shower in the gym after their workout Conclusion: The lack of awareness of previous and new gym members regarding safety precautions during indoor exercise should be overcome by more future educational intervention and emphasizing on following the Ministry of Sports in Saudi Arabia, even after the complete clearance of COVID-19 pandemic ?

National guidelines do not currently recommend testing students prior to campus arrival. However, the impact of presemester testing has not been studied. DESIGN: Dynamic SARS-CoV-2 transmission models are used to explore the effects of three presemester testing interventions. INTERVENTIONS: Testing of students 0, 1 and 2 times prior to campus arrival. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Number of active infections and time until isolation bed capacity is reached. SETTING: We set on-campus and off-campus populations to 7500 and 17 500 students, respectively. We assumed 2% prevalence of active cases at the semester start, and that one-third of infected students will be detected and isolated throughout the semester. Isolation bed capacity was set at 500. We varied disease transmission rates (R0=1.5, 2, 3, 4) to represent the effectiveness of mitigation strategies throughout the semester. RESULTS: Without presemester screening, peak number of active infections ranged from 4114 under effective mitigation strategies (R0=1.5) to 10 481 under ineffective mitigation strategies (R0=4), and exhausted isolation bed capacity within 10 (R 0 =4) to 25 days (R0=1.5). Mandating at least one test prior to campus arrival delayed the timing and reduced the size of the peak, while delaying the time until isolation bed capacity was reached. Testing twice in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies (R0=1.5) was the only scenario that did not exhaust isolation bed capacity during the semester. CONCLUSIONS: Presemester screening is necessary to avert early and large surges of active COVID-19 infections. Therefore, we recommend testing within 1 week prior to and on campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the peak outbreak, presemester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to significantly reduce outbreak size and preserve isolation bed capacity.","output":"Modelling the impact of presemester testing on COVID-19 outbreaks in university campuses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Addressing adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions among young adults represents a public health priority since this age group did not directly experience a health risk from COVID-19.

Semen was successfully retrieved in pangolins mainly via electroejaculation with the animal under general anesthesia, though facing a minor risk of urine contamination. The objective of this study is to report the success of semen collection with three different collection methods: electroejaculation, rectal massage and a combination of both methods in pangolins. The semen characteristics of the species are described in this study and the good semen qualities suggest future potential uses for ART. This study has found no difference between methods of semen collection. Captive and confiscated animals only differed in the percentages of live spermatozoa with overall good semen characteristics. The results from this study suggest that gamete recovery and biobank are feasible in the Malayan pangolin, which is essential to the management and conservation of this endangered species. ABSTRACT: This article describes the semen characteristics from different collection methods between captive and confiscated Malayan pangolins, Manis javanica. Semen was collected from 15 pangolins; two captive and 13 confiscated individuals at the mean weight of 9.36  1.94 kg. The three semen collection methods employed were electroejaculation, rectal massage and a combination of both techniques. The semen characteristics (mean  standard deviation) of the Malayan pangolin are volume (73.75  144.57 L), pH (7.63  0.53), spermatozoa concentration (997.19  728.98  10(6) /mL), total motility (59.60%  30.00%), progressive motility (48.95%  30.93%), mass motility (3.50  1.50) and live spermatozoa (80.25%  13.45%). There was no significant difference in semen characteristics between the three collection methods. The percentages of live spermatozoa were significantly different, suggesting better samples from captive compared to confiscated animals. However, there was no significant difference in spermatozoa kinetics between the captive and confiscated samples, suggesting the potential of utilizing confiscated individuals for gamete recovery to conserve the genetic pool of pangolins. All three methods of semen collection were successfully performed in pangolins and should be considered; however, electroejaculation remains the most consistent method of obtaining semen from the species.","output":"The Comparison of Semen Collection in Electroejaculation, Rectal Massage and Combination of Both Methods in the Critically Endangered Malayan Pangolin, Manis javanica"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, cancer services have had to adapt and change to accommodate the challenges.","output":"COVID-19: diary of a cancer nurse specialist: Prostate Cancer UK specialist nurse John Robertson describes a typical day during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global pandemics caused by influenza or coronaviruses cause severe disruptions to public health and lead to high morbidity and mortality.

A single injection of MCMVs expressing either viral protein induced potent neutralizing antibody responses, which strengthened over time. Importantly, MCMV(HA)-vaccinated mice were protected from illness following challenge with the influenza virus, and we excluded that this protection was due to the effects of memory T cells. Conclusively, we show here that MCMV vectors induce not only long-term cellular immunity but also humoral responses that provide long-term immune protection against clinically relevant respiratory pathogens.","output":"MCMV-based vaccine vectors expressing full-length viral proteins provide long-term humoral immune protection upon a single-shot vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemics has led to genetic diversification of SARS-CoV-2 and the appearance of variants with potential impact in transmissibility and viral escape from acquired immunity.

We previously reported that injection of endothelin-1 (ET-1) into one rat hindpaw induces prolonged mechanical and chemical sensitization of the contralateral hindpaw. Here, we examined the role of contralateral efferent activity in this process. METHODS ET-1 (2 nmol, 10 L) was injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of right (ipsilateral) hindpaw (ILP), and the thermal response latency and mechanical threshold for nocifensive withdrawal were determined by the use of, respectively, plantar radiant heating and von Frey filaments, for both ILP and contralateral hindpaws (CLP). Either paw was anesthetized for 60 minutes by direct injection of bupivacaine (0.25%, 40 L), 30 minutes before ET-1. Alternatively, the contralateral sciatic nerve was blocked for 6 to 12 hours by percutaneous injection of bupivacaine-releasing microspheres 30 minutes before injection of ET-1. Systemic actions of these bupivacaine formulations were simulated by subcutaneous injection at the nuchal midline. RESULTS After the injection of ET-1, the mechanical threshold of both ILP and CLP decreased by 2 hours, appeared to be lowest around 24 hours, and recovered through 48 hours to preinjection baseline at 72 hours. These hypersensitive responses were suppressed by bupivacaine injected into the ipsilateral paw before ET-1. Injection of the CLP by bupivacaine also suppressed the hypersensitivity of the CLP at all test times, and that of the ILP, except at 2 hours when it increased the sensitivity. This same pattern of change occurred when the contralateral sciatic nerve was blocked by bupivacaine-releasing microspheres. The systemic actions of these bupivacaine formulations were much smaller and only reached significance at 24 hours post-ET-1. Thermal hypersensitivity after ET-1 injection also occurred in both ILP and CLP and showed the same pattern in response to the 2 contralateral anesthetic procedures. CONCLUSIONS These results show that efferent transmission through the contralateral innervation into the paw is necessary for contralateral sensitization by ET-1, suggesting that the release of substances by distal nerve endings is involved. The release of substances in the periphery is essential for contralateral sensitization by ET-1 and may also contribute to secondary hyperalgesia, occurring at loci distant from the primary injury, that occurs after surgery or nerve damage.","output":"Contralateral Hyperalgesia from Injection of Endothelin-1 into the Ipsilateral Paw Requires Efferent Conduction into the Contralateral Paw."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 5-week-old infant born at term was diagnosed with acute necrotizing encephalopathy associated with SARS-CoV-2 as evidenced by clinical presentation, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid studies.

Conversely, in regions with less inflammation, these previously infected OLs more rapidly extended processes, consistent with normal myelinating function.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated how the inclusion of HI in CEAs may influence the reported value of immunizations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and illustrated the implications for COVID-19 immunization. METHODS: We reviewed immunization CEAs published from 2000 to 2018 focusing on LMICs using data from the Tufts Medical Center CEA Registries. We investigated the proportion of studies that included HI, the methods used, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) reported. When possible, we evaluated how ICERs would change with and without HI. RESULTS: Among the 243 immunization CEAs meeting inclusion criteria, 44 studies (18%) included HI. Of those studies, 11 (25%) used dynamic transmission models, whereas the remainder used static models. Sixteen studies allowed for ICER calculations with and without HI (n = 48 ratios). The inclusion of HI always resulted in more favorable ratios. In 20 cases (42%), adding HI decreased the ICERs enough to cross at least one or more common cost-effectiveness benchmarks for LMICs. Among pneumococcal vaccination studies, including HI in the analyses decreased seven of 24 ICERs enough to cross at least one cost-effectiveness benchmark. CONCLUSION: The full value of immunization may be underestimated without considering a scenario in which HI is achieved. Given the evidence in pneumococcal CEAs, COVID-19 vaccine value assessments should aim to show ICERs with and without HI to inform decision-making in LMICs.

One core challenge for companies is to identify when to join the tide of livestream selling and how to select a right online in?uencer to cooperate with. This paper develops a model of livestream selling that incorporates in?uencers main characteristics and di?erent levels of consumer sophistication in product quality perception to investigate a ?rms optimal livestream adoption strategy. Our research yields the following main insights. First, livestream selling should only be adopted when the in?uencer can attract a considerable number of viewers (i.e., social in?uence is relatively large) and can accurately identify the product quality (i.e., endorsement reliability is high), but requires low price discounts from the ?rm (i.e., bargaining power is relatively small). Depending on the in?uencers characteristics, two pricing strategies can be adopted: the exclusive-discounting strategy (i.e., deep price discount with the guaranteed in?uencers cooperation) and the selective-discounting strategy (i.e., moderate price discount with the in?uencers rejection risk). Second, the livestream adoption always increases the ?rms quality investment level but may decrease the quality-price ratio and consequently lead to lower consumer surplus and even social welfare. Third, while in?uencers with a larger social in?uence are always preferred by the ?rm, the preferences over endorsement reliability and bargaining power are more nuanced.

In particular, a simulation-based risk analysis approach enables scenario evaluation and comparison to guide decision making and action prioritization under uncertainty. We develop a simulation model to characterize the risks and uncertainties associated with infections resulting from aerosol exposure in in-person classes. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to model a semester of courses in a real college with approximately 11,000 students embedded within a larger university. To have practical impact, risk cannot focus on only infections as the end point of interest, we estimate the risks of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths of students and faculty in the college. We incorporate uncertainties in disease transmission, the impact of policies such as masking and facility interventions, and variables outside of the college's control such as population-level disease and immunity prevalence. We show in our example application that universal use of masks that block 40 percent of aerosols and the installation of near-ceiling, fan-mounted UVC systems both have the potential to lead to substantial risk reductions and that these effects can be modeled at the individual room level. These results exemplify how such simulation-based risk analysis can inform decision making and prioritization under great uncertainty.","output":"COVID-19 aerosol transmission simulation-based risk analysis for in-person learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Top priority of governments in containing the COVID-19 pandemic is flattening the curve which implies a slowing down of the virus spread across the entire population.

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to restrictions on trauma services in several hospitals with potential operating delays and unintended negative outcomes. This local study describes the impact of operative pathway changes on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing fragility hip fracture fixation during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A single centre, retrospective analysis was performed for all patients who presented with fragility hip fractures for operative management between the 23(rd) March and 29(th) April 2020. RESULTS: 34 patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The median patient age was 88 years old, with a median inpatient stay of 8 days. Three patients died prior to being operated on. 48% of patients were operated on within 36 hours. The 30 day all-cause mortality from the date of presentation of injury was 20%. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates that the pandemic and changes to operating pathways has had a sizeable impact on the hip fracture service with delays in surgery and an increase in the 30 day mortality. These disruptions to surgical operating systems are likely to continue, with potential ongoing unintended negative consequences as demonstrated in this study. We believe that a focus on solving logistical issues including availability of sufficient operating theatre capacity, redeployment of staff, early multidisciplinary input and counselling patients on the increased outcome risks will help to mitigate risks posed to this vulnerable patient population during these periods.","output":"Fragility hip fractures in the COVID-19 pandemic C a local experience in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with several adverse health outcomes. However, few studies in sub-Saharan Africa have examined its deleterious consequences on mental health. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and changes in boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. METHODS: Data for this study were drawn from an online survey of 811 participants that collected retrospective information on mental health measures including symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, boredom, and well-being. Additional data were collected on COVID-19 related measures, biosocial (e.g. age and sex) and sociocultural factors (e.g., education, occupation, marital status). Following descriptive and psychometric evaluation of measures used, multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationships between predictor variables and boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being scores during the pandemic. Second, we assessed the effect of anxiety on psychological well-being. Next, we assessed predictors of the changes in boredom, anxiety, and well-being. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 63.5% reported better well-being, 11.6% symptoms of anxiety, and 29.6% symptoms of boredom. Comparing experiences before and during the pandemic, there was an increase in boredom and anxiety symptomatology, and a decrease in well-being mean scores. The adjusted model shows participants with existing medical conditions had higher scores on boredom (? = 1.76, p < .001) and anxiety (? = 1.83, p < .01). In a separate model, anxiety scores before the pandemic (? = -0.25, p < .01) and having prior medical conditions (? = -1.53, p < .001) were associated with decreased psychological well-being scores during the pandemic. In the change model, having a prior medical condition was associated with an increasing change in boredom, anxiety, and well-being. Older age was associated with decreasing changes in boredom and well-being scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first in Ghana to provide evidence of the changes in boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings underscore the need for the inclusion of mental health interventions as part of the current pandemic control protocol and public health preparedness towards infectious disease outbreaks.","output":"Prevalence and changes in boredom, anxiety and well-being among Ghanaians during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Workplace accommodations, vital for employees with disabilities, promote diversity and inclusion efforts in organizations. This article examines who requests accommodations and who is more likely to have requests granted. We investigate the roles of individual characteristics and their intersection, including disability, sexual orientation, gender, race/ethnicity, and age. Methods: Using data from a national survey of U.S. lawyers, we estimate the odds of requesting accommodations and having the requests approved. We also estimate differences in odds according to individual characteristics, adjusting for control variables. Results: Personal identity factors, such as disability status, gender, and age, predict requests for accommodations. Odds of requesting accommodations were higher for women and people with disabilities as compared to men and those without disabilities, but lower for older individuals. Odds of requesting accommodations were higher for an older population segmentolder lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) lawyersthan for younger lawyers. Accommodations were granted differentially to individuals with multiple marginalized identities. Counter to predictions, being a person with a disability is negatively associated with having an accommodation granted. Older lawyers generally have higher odds of having accommodations granted, but odds for groups such as women and racial/ethnic minorities decline with age. LGBQ lawyers who are racial minorities have lower odds than White LGBQ lawyers of having their accommodations granted. Longer tenure increases the odds of requesting accommodations. Working for a private organization decreases the odds; working for a large organization generally increases the odds. Conclusions: Those most needing accommodations, such as lawyers with disabilities and women, are more likely to request accommodations. Disabled lawyers, older women lawyers, older racial/ethnic minority lawyers, and LGBQ minority lawyers have relatively low odds of having requests granted. The results highlight the need to consider intersectional identities in the accommodation process.","output":"Diversity and Inclusion in the American Legal Profession: Workplace Accommodations for Lawyers with Disabilities and Lawyers Who Identify as LGBTQ+"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is made up of all kinds of living organisms which also includes microorganisms like bacteria, virus and fungus.

The FCV-19S is a seven-item questionnaire that assesses the severity of fear caused by COVID-19. A total of 2860 participants-1641 female and 1218 male personnel from three hospitals-were included in the study. The internal reliability of the scale was good, with Cronbach's alpha of .902.

However, cobalamin can be synthesized only by few microorganisms so most bacteria need to take it up from the environment through the TonB-dependent transport system. The first stage of cobalamin import to E. coli cells occurs through the outer-membrane receptor called BtuB. Vitamin B12 binds with high affinity to the extracellular side of the BtuB protein. BtuB forms a ?-barrel with inner luminal domain and extracellular loops. To mechanically allow for cobalamin passage, the luminal domain needs to partially unfold with the help of the inner-membrane TonB protein. However, the mechanism of cobalamin permeation is unknown. Using all-atom molecular dynamics, we simulated the transport of cobalamin through the BtuB receptor embedded in an asymmetric and heterogeneous E. coli outer membrane. To enhance conformational sampling of the BtuB loops, we developed the Gaussian force-simulated annealing method (GF-SA) and coupled it with umbrella sampling. We found that cobalamin needs to rotate in order to permeate through BtuB. We showed that the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops is crucial for cobalamin binding and transport and resembles an induced fit mechanism. Loop mobility depends not only on the position of cobalamin but also on the extension of luminal domain. We provided atomistic details of cobalamin transport through the BtuB receptor showing the essential role of the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops. A similar TonB-dependent transport system is used also by many other compounds, such as haem and siderophores, and importantly, can be hijacked by natural antibiotics. Our work could have implications for future delivery of antibiotics to bacteria using this transport system.","output":"Extracellular loops of BtuB facilitate transport of vitamin B12 through the outer membrane of E. coli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) in a COVID-19 dedicated hospital.

To analyze the data and model relationships, we used mixed effects negative binomial regression, z-statistic, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. RESULTS: Comparisons between social media sites showed that CTRs for identical antitobacco health messages differed significantly across social media (P<.001 for all). Instagram showed the statistically significant highest overall mean message engagement (CTR=0.0037; 95% CI 0.0032-0.0042), followed by Facebook (CTR=0.0026; 95% CI 0.0022-0.0030) and Twitter (CTR=0.0015; 95% CI 0.0013-0.0017). Facebook showed the highest as well as the lowest CTR for any individual message. However, the message CTR is not indicative of user engagement with the educational website content. Pairwise comparisons of the social media sites differed with respect to the wCTR (P<.001 for all). Messages on Twitter showed the lowest CTR, but they resulted in the highest level of website engagement (wCTR=0.6308; 95% CI 0.5640-0.6975), followed by Facebook (wCTR=0.2213; 95% CI 0.1932-0.2495) and Instagram (wCTR=0.0334; 95% CI 0.0230-0.0438). We found a statistically significant higher CTR for organic (unpaid) messages (CTR=0.0074; 95% CI 0.0047-0.0100) compared with paid advertisements (CTR=0.0022; 95% CI 0.0017-0.0027; P<.001 and P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence-based insights to guide the design of health promotion efforts on social media. Future studies should examine the platform-specific impact of psycholinguistic message variations on user engagement, include newer sites such as Snapchat and TikTok, and study the correlation between web-based behavior and real-world health behavior change. The need is urgent in light of increased health-related marketing and misinformation on social media.","output":"General Audience Engagement With Antismoking Public Health Messages Across Multiple Social Media Sites: Comparative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serological assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are needed to support clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations. Recently, assays for large-scale detection of total antibodies (Ab), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 antigens have been developed, but there are limited data on the diagnostic accuracy of these assays. This study was a Danish national collaboration and evaluated 15 commercial and one in-house anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays in 16 laboratories. Sensitivity was evaluated using 150 samples from individuals with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate COVID-19, nonhospitalized or hospitalized, confirmed by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT); samples were collected 13 to 73 days either from symptom onset or from positive NAAT (patients without symptoms). Specificity and cross-reactivity were evaluated in samples collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic from >586 blood donors and patients with autoimmune diseases, cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus infections, and acute viral infections. A specificity of &#8805;99% was achieved by all total-Ab and IgG assays except one, DiaSorin Liaison XL IgG (97.2%).

The state of BioMeTs, and associated digitally measured biomarkers, is highly reminiscent of the field of laboratory biomarkers 2 decades ago. In this review, we have summarized and leveraged historical perspectives, and lessons learned from laboratory biomarkers as they apply to BioMeTs. Both categories share common features, including goals and roles in biomedical research, definitions, and many elements of the biomarker qualification framework. They can also be classified based on the underlying technology, each with distinct features and performance characteristics, which require bench and human experimentation testing phases. In contrast to laboratory biomarkers, digitally measured biomarkers require prospective data collection for purposes of analytical validation in human subjects, lack well\\\\established and widely accepted performance characteristics, require human factor testing, and, for many applications, access to raw (sample\\\\level) data. Novel methods to handle large volumes of data, as well as security and data rights requirements add to the complexity of this emerging field. Our review highlights the need for a common framework with appropriate vocabulary and standardized approaches to evaluate digitally measured biomarkers, including defining performance characteristics and acceptance criteria. Additionally, the need for human factor testing drives early patient engagement during technology development. Finally, use of BioMeTs requires a relatively high degree of technology literacy among both study participants and healthcare professionals.

However, there remains a limited understanding of how best to support patients during this time, particularly through the use of digital health interventions. Recognizing and understanding the potential unmet needs of elective orthopedic surgery patients is central to motivating healthier behavior change, improving recovery, and optimizing overall surgical success in the short and long term. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore patient perspectives on technology features that would help support them to change their lifestyle behaviors during the pre- and postoperative periods, and that could potentially maintain long-term healthy lifestyles following recovery. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with pre- and postoperative elective orthopedic patients were conducted between May and June 2020 using telephone and video callCbased software. Patient perspectives on the use of digital technologies to complement current surgical care and support with lifestyle behavior changes were discussed. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Reflexive thematic analysis enabled the development of themes from the data, with QSR NVivo software (version 12) facilitating data management. Ethical approval was obtained from the National Health Service Health Research Authority. RESULTS: A total of 18 participants were interviewed. Four themes were developed from the data regarding the design and functionality of digital technologies to best support the perioperative journey. These center around an interventions ability to incorporate interactive, user-centered features; direct a descriptive and structured recovery; enable customizable, patient-controlled settings; and deliver both general and specific surgical advice in a timely manner. Interventions that are initiated preoperatively and continued postoperatively were perceived as beneficial. Interventions designed with personalized milestones were found to better guide patients through a structured recovery. Individualized tailoring of preparatory and recovery information was desired by patients with previously high levels of physical activity before surgery. The use of personalized progression-based exercises further encouraged physical recovery; game-like rewards and incentives were regarded as motivational for making and sustaining health behavior change. In-built video calling and messaging features offered connectivity with peers and clinicians for supported care delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Specific intervention design and functionality features can provide better, structured support for elective orthopedic patients across the entire surgical journey and beyond. This study provides much-needed evidence relating to the optimal design and timing of digital interventions for elective orthopedic surgical patients. Findings from this study suggest a desire for personalized perioperative care, in turn, supporting patients to make health behavior changes to optimize surgical success. These findings should be used to influence future co-design projects to enable the design and implementation of patient-focused, tailored, and targeted digital health technologies within modern health care settings.","output":"Designing the Optimal Digital Health Intervention for Patients Use Before and After Elective Orthopedic Surgery: Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hip fractures are serious fractures for the elderly.

The involvement of the gastrointestinal tract with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has remained unclear. The following study retrospectively reviews gastrointestinal symptoms and liver function tests at the time of hospital admission to identify patient outcomes including prolonged hospital stay, the requirement for intensive care, and all-cause in-hospital 30-day mortality. Methods A retrospective review of patient charts at the Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center (WMC) was conducted at the time of hospital admission, using a pre-determined selection criterion. All adult patients, both inpatient and outpatient, were included from March 2020 till May 2020. A 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for patient outcomes. Results Of the 520 patients, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea (OR = 0.375, p = 0.015), and nausea and vomiting in combination (OR = 0.400, p = 0.016) had an inverse protective relationship with all-cause in-hospital 30-day mortality among COVID-19 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea (OR = 1.008, p < 0.001), and nausea and vomiting (OR = 1.291, p = 0.043) had a mild impact on the length of hospital stay. Conclusion Elevated liver transaminases including alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at the time of hospital admission can predict critical care requirement and all-cause 30-day hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection.

This virus proved to be very contagious resulting in life-threatening respiratory intricacies posing overall public health and governance challenges. Amid the coronavirus pandemic and the unprecedented increase in healthcare demands, only inventive and adaptive practice among healthcare professionals is the need of the hour. Pharmacy services are an important mainstay in the public health and have considerable potential to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Pharmacists working in several localities and health facilities are linked to patients either directly or indirectly. They can act swiftly in public health response such as drafting professional service guidance to pharmacists working in various healthcare facilities, ensuring effective medicine supply system, monitoring and resolving drug shortage issues, establishing and promoting remote pharmacy services, counseling the public on infection prevention basics, educating about proper use of personal protective equipment, discouraging self-medication, participating in clinical trials, small-scale manufacturing of sanitizers and disinfectants, busting the prevailing myths, and conducting drug evaluation and active surveillance. These interventions will help ease unprecedented burden on healthcare facilities during the ongoing pandemic and eventually will add value to patients and the healthcare system. The current manuscript accentuates the potential roles and activities that pharmacists can initiate in various healthcare facilities to help in relieving pressure on the overwhelmed healthcare system. The information and suggestions offered in this review could help in the restructuring of existing pharmacy services by governments, public health bodies, and policy makers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As the direct cause of accidents, individual unsafe behaviors are closely related to their risk perception. So, it is important to explore the factors affecting miners risk perception and analyze the influencing mechanisms between these factors and risk perception. The questionnaire survey method was used to collect the data of risk perception from nearly 400 respondents working in metal mines in China. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to analyze and process collected data. The impact of four factors affecting miners risk perception was verified, namely: organizational safety atmosphere, organizational trust, knowledge level, and risk communication. Then, regression analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, and structural equation model analysis were used to examine the effect of the four influencing factors on miners risk perception. The four influencing factors all have a positive impact on miners risk perception; knowledge level has the largest explained variation of miners risk perception, followed by risk communication. Organizational trust and organizational safety atmosphere have an indirect and positive impact on miners risk perception intermediated by knowledge level and risk communication.

Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) may help reduce barriers to care; however, there is no literature involving qualitative analyses of client feedback to describe PSP experiences with ICBT. Identifying these experiences is important because it can inform future use of ICBT with this group that has unique needs. The current study was designed to explore how clients (N = 82) experienced ICBT that had been tailored to meet their needs; specifically, the study assessed their perceptions of program impacts, what clients found helpful, and client suggestions for improvements. The ICBT course included five core lessons, client stories, and nine initial additional resources, as well as flexible frequencies (optional, once weekly, or twice weekly) and durations (8 to 16 weeks) of therapist support. A qualitative reliability thematic analysis was used to analyze client communications and feedback. Responses to a Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire administered at eight weeks post-enrollment were available for 57 clients. Client emails with therapists were also examined among all clients, including an additional 25 clients who did not complete the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. Themes identified in the qualitative analyses were related to: reported impacts and hindering events, helpful and challenging course skills and content, helpful aspects of the course, and areas for improvement. Clients who completed the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire and those who did not reported beneficial impacts from the program, with the most commonly endorsed themes being skill development and normalizing mental health issues. Hindering events were experienced by both groups and included timeline challenges, technology challenges, and negative effects. Comments from both groups suggested that clients had more success than challenges when practicing the skills. Thought challenging was the skill most frequently identified as helpful. Clients described many aspects of the program as helpful with the most frequently endorsed themes being the course format and content, the flexible nature of the course, access to additional materials and case stories, and therapist assistance. Clients also provided suggestions for improving the course (e.g., case stories, additional resources, timelines audio and videos).

Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of the acquisition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection (SARS CoV-2) due to their close interaction with infected patients (1, 2). Also, HCWs can serve as reservoirs of SARS CoV-2 cross-transmission both in community and hospital settings (1). However, the extent of COVID-19 infection among HCWs in Sri Lanka is understudied. ObjectivesThis study determined the incidence, demographic characteristics, and risk exposure behavior of HCWs who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 at Base Hospital Wathupitiwala. Furthermore, the rate of acquisition of SARS CoV-2 following COVISHIELD/ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Sinopharm /BBIBP-CorV vaccines in HCWs were studied. MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional descriptive analysis was conducted from May 2021 to August 2021 for a total of 818 HCWs. ResultsHundred and twenty-four HCWs (15.16%) were tested positive for COVID-19. The mean age of infected HCWs was 46.27 years and the majority were females (74.19%). Among all infected persons, 54 (43.55%) were nurses/midwives, 39 (31.45%) were clinical supportive staff and 12(9.68%) were medical officers. The number of infected HCWs rapidly escalated and a total of 64(51.61%) HCWs got an infection during August/2021. No source was identified in most of them (34.68%) followed by community acquisition (33.87%). Thirty-five HCWs (28.23%) had acquired infection during a hospital setting or had a high-risk exposure in recent history. Among hospital-related infections, 37.91% of HCWs had shared meals or shared sleeping rooms with an infected workmate. The majority of the HCWs were tested by the infection control unit as symptomatic screening (70.16%) followed by contact tracing (20.16%). Fifty-six (45.16%) HCWs had a history of single or multiple comorbidities. The vast majority of HCWs (95.97%) presented as mild to asymptomatic disease that followed an uneventful recovery. Body aches, headache, fever, and sore throat were the most commonly reported symptoms among them. Among the five HCWs required therapeutic oxygen supplementation, two unvaccinated HCWs succumbed to the infection. The rate of breakthrough infection among HCWs was 8.93%. The acquisition of disease was significantly higher among unvaccinated HCWs than partially (p<0.0001) or fully vaccinated (p<0.0001) HCWs with either type of vaccine. ConclusionsProtecting HCWs remains a challenge in resource-poor settings. The risk of infection fueled by very contagious circulating variants is continuously high even though vaccination has shown clear benefits in preventing mortality and severe infection. Therefore, all healthcare workers should be vaccinated while ensuring continuous infection control measures in the hospital setting.","output":"COVID-19 infection among health care workers: Experience in Base Hospital Wathupitiwala,Sri Lanka"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The new normal introduced by COVID-19 has ushered in new safety regulations that are required to be implemented by all organisations, including the construction industry. The implementation of the COVID-19 regulations, like any health and safety regulation, is not without hindrances. Consequently, this study aims to explore factors hindering the implementation of COVID-19 safety regulations at construction sites in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a qualitative research method using an open-ended questionnaire as a data collection instrument. The set of questionnaires were distributed by means of purposive and snowball sampling methods. The collected data were analysed by means of the thematic analysis technique. Findings: It became evident that several factors militate against implementing COVID-19 safety regulations at construction sites. Cost of implementing COVID-19 safety measures, lack of compliance and ignorance were identified as the most hindering factors, whereas superstition, lack of personal protective equipment supply and theft of COVID-19 materials were reported by fewer respondents. Research limitations/implications: The set of questionnaires were limited to small construction firms who were operating on site within the Central, Western and Greater Accra regions of Ghana during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the findings may be applicable to firms outside these regions because most of the small construction firms in the country share similar characteristics. Practical implications: The recommendations proffered could help construction organisations devise strategies to overcome the barriers that hamper the implementation of COVID-19 safety regulations on site. Moreover, the findings could inform policymakers on what is required to enforce compliance on site.

The effects of menarche age and menstruation were examined in female adolescents for the period 2001-2018. Results Among the total 11,782 participants, the weighted prevalence of anemia was 4.0%. The prevalence of anemia in male participants significantly decreased (from 3.0% to 0.5%, p < 0.001), whereas that in female participants did not change significantly over time (from 7.9% to 8.5%, p = 0.054). The average age at menarche was 12.4  0.0 years; the prevalence of anemia in females increased from age 13 years onward. Multivariate analysis revealed that anemia was more common in female than male participants (odds ratio [OR], 9.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.19-13.57; p < 0.001). In female adolescents, the prevalence of anemia increased with age (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.15-1.38, p < 0.001) and was 3.6 times higher after than before menarche (OR, 3.65; 95% CI, 2.21-6.05, p < 0.001). Conclusion Over the 21-year study period, the prevalence of anemia decreased among male adolescents but did not change in female adolescents. In female adolescents, age and menarche were identified as significant risk factors that require continued attention.","output":"Changes in the prevalence of anemia in Korean adolescents, 1998-2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Concentrations of Cd, Hg, Pb, As, Al, Cu, Fe, and Zn were determined in the muscles of wild and farmed European seabass in Sinop markets between September and December in 2020, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after microwave digestion. In the study, iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), aluminum (Al), and copper (Cu) were found higher than the other metals both in wild and cultured Dicentrarchus labrax. These are essential elements, but excess amounts act as a poison. Arsenic (As) concentration was higher than cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) both in wild and cultured D. labrax. The estimated maximum total dietary intakes of these eight metals from both wild and farmed European seabass were below the maximum acceptable daily intake values set by the Turkish Food Codex and European Union Regulation. Results showed that according to metal amounts, consumption of D. labrax had no threat to consumers health. The target hazard quotient (THQ) revealed that harmful health impacts may not occur. Furthermore, risk index (RI) indicated that there may have a lower risk of developing cancer in the future who have been exposed to Pb and As through fish intake. Although the fish are not overly contaminated, the metal level is rising. Increased amounts of heavy metals in fish in different areas could be due to an increase in farm inflow water, domestic sewage, and a number of other anthropogenic sources, all of which should be looked into further. Precautions should be made to safeguard this fish from metal contamination and to reduce the risk to human health.","output":"Metals in Wild and Cultured Dicentrarchus labrax (Linnaeus, 1758) from Fish Markets in Sinop: Consumers Health Risk Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the global financial crisis of 2007C8, new laws and regulations have been introduced with the aim of improving the transparency in financial reporting. Despite the dramatically increased flow of information to shareholders and the public, this information flow has not always been meaningful or useful. Often it seems that it is not possible to see the wood for the trees. Financial scalds continue, as Wirecard, NMC Health, Patisserie Valerie, going back to Carillion (and many more) demonstrate. Financial and corporate reporting have never been so fraught with difficulties as companies fail to give guidance about the future in an increasingly uncertain world aided and abetted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This concise book argues that the changes have simply masked an increase in the use of corporate PR, impression management, bullet points, glossy images, and other simulacra which allow poor performance to be masked by misleading information presented in glib boilerplate texts, images, and tables. The tone of the narrative sections in annual reports is often misleading. Drawing on extensive research and interviews with insiders and experts, this book charts what has gone wrong with financial reporting and offers a range of solutions to improve information to both investors and the public. This provides a framework for a new era of forward-looking corporate reporting and guidance based on often conflicting multiple corporate goals. The book also examines and contrasts the latest thinking by the regularity authorities. Providing a compelling exploration of the industrys failings and present difficulties, and the impact of future disruption, this timely, thought-provoking book will be of great interest to students, researchers, and professionals as well as policy makers in accounting, financial reporting, corporate reporting, financial statement analysis, and governance. ? 2021 Krish Bhaskar and John Flower.","output":"Disruption in financial reporting: A post-pandemic view of the future of corporate reporting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Middle\\\\East and Africa Influenza Surveillance Network (MENA\\\\ISN), established in 2014, includes 15 countries at present.

Using Mexico City as a case study, this research examines the main barriers affecting womens access to UGS during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America. We applied a sequential mixed-methods approach in which the results of a survey distributed via social media in June 2020 to women aged 18 and older were used to develop semi-structured interviews with 12 women during October 2020. One year later, in November 2021, the continuity of the themes was evaluated through focus groups with the same group of women who participated in the interviews. Our results suggest that (1) prohibiting access to some UGS during the first months of the pandemic negatively impacted UGS access for women in marginalized neighborhoods;(2) for women, the concept of UGS quality and safety are intertwined, including the security level of the surrounding streets;and (3) women who live in socially cohesive neighborhoods indicated using UGS to a greater extent.

Despite the current acceptance of cannabinoids as a treatment option for nausea and vomiting, there is a lack of data regarding the side effects of its prolonged use leading to possible toxicity due to accumulation, and as a result, exacerbation of nausea and vomiting rather than alleviation. Case report presentation: The patient, a 70-year-old female who was residing in the palliative care unit with the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer. She underwent a course of chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel, docetaxel, and cisplatin. She presented with hair loss, sore mouth, and loss of appetite, diarrhea, neuralgia, nausea and vomiting which developed approximately five hours after chemotherapy. Nabilone was used for the last five years to manage the patient's neuralgia. As her cancer progressed, dosage of nabilone was incrementally increased from 0.5 mg to 2 mg to control her pain; however, it exacerbated refractory nausea and vomiting. Nabilone was discontinued seven weeks after administration due to suspicion of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Hot baths were attempted with temporary relief. Her pain became well controlled with opioids and adjuvants and there has been no recurrence of nausea and vomiting since the cessation of nabilone.

Currently, acellular pertussis vaccines (aP, DTaP, and Tdap) are used to prevent pertussis disease. However, it is clear that the aP vaccine efficacy quickly wanes, resulting in the reemergence of pertussis. Furthermore, recent work performed by the CDC suggest that current circulating strains are genetically distinct from strains of the past. The emergence of genetically diverging strains, combined with waning aP vaccine efficacy, calls for reevaluation of current animal models of pertussis. In this study, we used the rat model of pertussis to compare two genetically divergent strains Tohama 1 and D420. We intranasally challenged 7-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats with 10(8) viable Tohama 1 and D420 and measured the hallmark signs/symptoms of B. pertussis infection such as neutrophilia, pulmonary inflammation, and paroxysmal cough using whole-body plethysmography. Onset of cough occurred between 2 and 4 days after B. pertussis challenge, averaging five coughs per 15 min, with peak coughing occurring at day 8 postinfection, averaging upward of 13 coughs per 15 min. However, we observed an increase of coughs in rats infected with clinical isolate D420 through 12 days postchallenge. The rats exhibited increased bronchial restriction following B. pertussis infection. Histology of the lung and flow cytometry confirm both cellular infiltration and pulmonary inflammation. D420 infection induced higher production of anti-B. pertussis IgM antibodies compared to Tohama 1 infection.

Although many countries have successfully deployed centrally-processed folate-fortified flour for prevention of NTDs, inherent logistical problems preclude widespread implementation of this strategy in India. Because teathe second most common beverage worldwide (after water)is consumed by most Indians every day, and appeared an ideal vehicle for fortification with folate and vitamin B(12), we determined if daily consumption of vitamin-fortified tea for 2 months could benefit young women of childbearing-age in Sangli, India. METHODS: Women (average age=202 SD) used teabags spiked with therapeutic doses of 1 mg folate plus either 0.1 mg vitamin B(12) (Group-1, n=19) or 0.5 mg vitamin B(12) (Group-2, n=19), or mock-fortified teabags (Group-0, n=5) to prepare a cup of tea every day for 2 months, following which their pre-intervention and post-intervention serum vitamin and haemoglobin concentrations were compared. RESULTS: Most women had baseline anaemia with low-normal serum folate and below-normal serum vitamin B(12) levels. After 2 months, women in both Group-1 and Group-2 exhibited significant increases in mean differences in pre-intervention versus post-intervention serum folate levels of 8.37 ng/mL (95% CIs 5.69 to 11.04, p<0.05) and 6.69 ng/mL (95% CI 3.93 to 9.44, p<0.05), respectively; however, Group-0 experienced an insignificant rise of 1.26 ng/mL (95% CI C4.08 to 0.16). In addition, over one-half and two-thirds of women in Group-1 and Group-2, respectively, exhibited increases in serum vitamin B(12) levels over 300 pg/mL. There was also a significant post-interventional increase in the mean haemoglobin concentration in Group-1 of 1.45 g/dL (95% CI 0.64 to 2.26, p=0.002) and Group-2 of 0.79 g/dL (95% CI 0.11 to 1.42, p=0.027), which reflected a bona fide clinical response. CONCLUSION: Tea is an outstanding scalable vehicle for fortification with folate and vitamin B(12) in India, and has potential to help eliminate haematological and neurological complications arising from inadequate dietary consumption or absorption of folate and vitamin B(12).","output":"Potential for elimination of folate and vitamin B(12) deficiency in India using vitamin-fortified tea: a preliminary study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the past 20 years, the notion of bioterror has been a source of considerable fear and panic worldwide.

Massachusetts. At issue is the State of New Hampshires (and its amicis) claim that Massachusettss insistence on applying its income tax to residents of New Hampshire, who once commuted to work in Massachusetts but now work for the same businesses remotely in New Hampshire because of the COVID-19 pandemic, violates the Due Process Clause and dormant Commerce Clause. The claim is simple and seductive: if these New Hampshire residents barely leave their own homes, much less their state, how can it accord with due process for Massachusetts to tax them? In this short colloquium essay, I make the following points about the merits of this case. (I think the case should be dismissed on procedural grounds, but believe the merits are important and will eventually be reached on a similar fact pattern.)1. The plaintiffs are essentially arguing for physical presence as a predicate for individual income taxation. To the extent that the argument is that physical presence is currently required by the Due Process Clause or the dormant Commerce Clause, I argue that contention is wrong.2. I also argue that a physical presence rule should not be created. This is a case where common sense intuitions about work and the creation of value can lead one astray. Here, what intuition misses is the importance of agglomeration economics. The residents of New Hampshire massed on the border with Massachusetts (and paying higher housing prices to do so) are not preparing for an invasion. Rather, they are rationally choosing to live in the Greater Boston area because of the professional and cultural amenities that the area offers and for which the state of Massachusetts can reasonably ask them to contribute. 3. The plaintiffs make a similar argument about apportionment, namely that the Massachusettss regulations fail fair apportionment. Again, as based on current law, this argument is incorrect (and should remain so). Apportionment is judged by a reasonableness standard and here what Massachusetts is doing satisfies that standard. It has long been acceptable for states that are the source of an employees income because that is where the employee works to consider itself the source of all of that income. All Massachusetts has done is argue that the usual source rule should apply during this temporary disruption. Similarly, all New Yorks convenience of the employer rule argues is that the usual source rule of thumb should not be disturbed unless the employer is the driving force behind the employee working elsewhere.4. There is a difference between what the Constitution permits and what would be best as a matter of policy. If, as seems likely, there will be more remote work in the future, then the traditional all-or-nothing rule of thumb as to the source of individual income should be reconsidered. In particular, I argue, it is appropriate for states to shift to apportioning the income of individuals just like they currently do for the income of businesses.","output":"Agglomeration and State Personal Income Taxes: Time to Apportion (With Critical Commentary on New Hampshires Complaint Against Massachusetts)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past few months, COVID-19 has emerged to the world as a new threat to humanity and communities, expanding from a few small infected cities to hundreds of countries around the world impacting businesses, education, economics, and almost every activity associated with human life This had led many researchers and scientists to analyze and study different factors and variables that obtain timely information on the outbreak of COVID-19 One of the main factors that helped in spreading the corona-virus is human mobility Since detailed information about human movement during outbreaks are difficult to obtain, social networks comes as an alternative with its massive volume of publicly available data In this research, we propose mobility detection and identification of social media's spatio-temporal data, as a proxy for human mobility We aim to discover and explore an in-depth level of mobility data extracted from social media applications to uncover the relation between COVID-19 spread and daily mobility ratio in Kuwait regional area With the use of the latest mobility data extracted from Twitter users, we have shown that user mobility is linked to the positive cases of COVID-19, with a relatively high correlation coefficient Moreover, we have analyzed and discussed how the impact of COVID-19 affected user behavior and mobility habits ? 2020 ACM","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Confinement on Regional Mobility of Spatial-Temporal Social Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) functions as a pleiotropic protein, participating in inflammatory and immune responses.

Anti-Synthetase Syndromes and IgG4-related diseases have rarely been seen together. We present a 38-year-old female with connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease from Anti-Synthetase syndrome who eventually develops autoimmune pancreatitis from IgG4-related disease. Case Presentation. A 38-year-old African American female with facial rash, joint swelling, and morning stiffness was seen to have pulmonary fibrosis on CXR and CT chest. Subsequent bronchoscopy was inconclusive. She was treated for presumed mixed Connected Tissue Disease (CTD) and associated pulmonary fibrosis with Mycophenolate, Hydroxychloroquine, and Prednisone. Several months later, she had shortness of breath and was diagnosed with COVID-19. Her mycophenolate was held while she recovered with supplemental oxygen, but has required 2 to 3 liters of supplemental oxygen chronically since her COVID diagnosis. A repeat bronchoscopy with transbronchial and cryobiopsies was suggestive of Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP) and negative for malignancy. At that time, blood work revealed positive melanoma differentiation-associated (MDA) protein 5 antibodies, high antinuclear antibodies (ANA) titers, positive anti-Sj?gren's-syndrome antigen A (SSA) autoantibodies, weakly positive PL-12, and negative Jo-1. Additionally, the patient had elevated concentrations of IgG4. A repeat CT revealed fatty infiltration of the pancreas. Her MDA positivity qualified the patient to begin Rituximab infusions weekly for four weeks. Her shortness of breath continued to improve on her previously stated treatments. However, she presented to a local emergency department for acute abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and improved after receiving intravenous fluids. Discussion. This patient has connective tissue disease associated with interstitial lung disease from Anti-Synthetase syndrome. She has positive anti-MDA-5 antibodies and cryobiopsy diagnosed COP, a known finding in Anti-Synthetase syndrome. It is also possible that this patient has overlapping IgG4-related disease, correlated by elevated concentrations of IgG4 and autoimmune pancreatitis. This overlap is not well studied, considering that the pathophysiology of Anti-Synthetase syndrome involves autoimmunity towards aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase while IgG4-related disease pathophysiology is not well known and could involve abnormal activation of CD4-positive T cells. Interestingly, this patient had fatty infiltration of her pancreas found on imaging before she was symptomatic for autoimmune pancreatitis.

In the case of angiosarcoma, technical difficulties, including multifocality, infiltrative margins, and difficulty in assessing tumor margins, render surgical treatment quite challenging. A limited number of studies showed that adjuvant radiation therapy reduces local recurrences; therefore, it is proposed by many groups for large, high-grade tumors. Chemotherapy has been evaluated retrospectively in a small subset of patients, with some evidence supporting its use in angiosarcoma patients. Approximately half of patients with RIBA will show local recurrence. In the advanced setting, different therapeutic options are discussed in the review, including chemotherapy, antiangiogenic therapy, and immunotherapy, whereas the need for further research on molecular therapeutic targets is pointed out.","output":"Clinical and Molecular Insights of Radiation-Induced Breast Sarcomas: Is There Hope on the Horizon for Effective Treatment of This Aggressive Disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS We sought to evaluate the association of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or AT1 blockers (ARB) therapy with clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS AND RESULTS Electronic databases were searched to identify published studies that reported clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 who were or were not taking an ACEI/ARB. We studied all-cause mortality and/or severe disease outcomes. Fully adjusted effect estimates from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. In total, 34 (31 cohort-based and three case-control) studies met our eligibility criteria. Due to the inherent differences between cohort and case-control studies, we did not combine results of these studies but used them to identify the consistency of their results. The 31 cohort studies provided outcome data for 87 951 patients with COVID-19, of whom 22 383/83 963 (26.7%) were on ACEI/ARB therapy. In pooled analysis, we found no association between the use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality/severe disease [relative risk: 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86-1.03, I2 = 57%, P = 0.20] or occurrence of severe disease (relative risk: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.74-1.17, I2 = 56%, P = 0.55). Analysis of three population-based case-control studies identified no significant association between ACEI/ARB (pooled odds ratio: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.81-1.23, I2 = 0, P = 0.98) and all-cause mortality/severe disease. In 13 of the 31 cohort studies as well as in three case-control studies that reported outcomes separately for ACEI and ARB, there was no differential effect for mortality/severe disease outcomes. CONCLUSION In patients with COVID-19, we found no association between ACEI/ARB treatment and mortality/severe disease. ACEI/ARB should not be discontinued, unless clinically indicated.","output":"Renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors and all-cause mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To report changes in practice brought about by COVID-19 and the implementation of new guidelines, and to explore factors relating to unscheduled re-presentations for patients discharged from the emergency department (ED). DESIGN: Prospective multicentre national audit over 12 weeks from 6th April 2020. SETTING: UK secondary care ENT departments. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with acute epistaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Re-presentation within 10 days for patients discharged from the ED. RESULTS: Eighty three centres from all four UK nations submitted 2631 valid cases. The majority of cases were ED referrals (89.7%, n = 2358/2631). 54.6% were discharged from the ED following ENT review (n = 1267/2322), of whom 19.5% re-presented within 10 days (n = 245/1259) and 6.8% were ultimately admitted (n = 86/1259). 46.7% of patients had a non-dissolvable pack inserted by ED prior to referral to ENT (n = 1099/2355). The discharge rates for ED patients and their subsequent re-presentation rates were as follows: non-dissolvable packs, 29.5% discharged (n = 332/1125), 18.2% re-presented (n = 60/330); dissolvable products, 71.1% discharged (n = 488/686), 21.8% re-presented (n = 106/486); cautery only, 89.2% discharged (n = 247/277), 20.0% re-presented (n = 49/245); and no intranasal intervention, 85.5% discharged (n = 200/234), 15.2% re-presented (n = 30/198). Univariable logistic regression showed that not being packed by ED, antiplatelet medications, failed cautery and recent epistaxis treatment were significant predictors of re-presentation within 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Management of acute epistaxis was notably affected during the initial peak of the pandemic, with a shift towards reduced admissions. This national audit highlights that many patients who may previously have been admitted to hospital may be safely discharged from the ED following acute epistaxis.","output":"Admission avoidance in acute epistaxis: A prospective national audit during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is constantly increasing. However, the association between e-cigarette use and ventricular arrhythmia is unknown. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the markers of ventricular repolarization such as QT interval, corrected QT (QTc), QT dispersion (QTd), peak-to-end interval of the T wave (Tp-e), corrected Tp-e and Tp-e/QT ratios in e-cigarette users. Methods The study population consisted 36 e-cigarette users and 40 healthy subjects. Ventricular repolarization parameters were obtained from 12-lead resting electrocardiogram. Ventricular repolarization parameters of the groups were compared. Results Basal demographic and laboratory data were similar in both groups. According to the electrocardiographic parameters, the Tp-e interval, corrected Tp-e, and Tp-e/QT ratio were significantly higher in individuals using e-cigarettes than in control subjects [74.96.4 milliseconds (ms) vs. 80.14.1ms, <0.001; 82.97.5 ms vs. 87.86.3 ms, p=0.003; 0.200.01 vs. 0.210.01, p=0.002; respectively].

The aim of this work was to develop a portable, low-cost and user-friendly colorimetric instrument for colorimetric ELISA and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) detection. The principle of the developed instrument was employing a light-emitting diode to generate the signal light and using a light-dependent resistor to measure the signal light absorbed by the oxidized 3,3,5,5-tetramethyl benzidine. The absorption spectra revealed that the solution absorbed signal light more strongly after reaction with H(2)SO(4), and blue light would be favorably absorbed. Evaluations on the stability and accuracy of the instrument and interference from ambient light showed that the fabricated instrument was stable, accurate, capable of quantitative detection and insensitive to ambient light changes. In addition, this instrument is user-friendly since it could calculate and report the final amount of AFB(1) to the operator. Measurements of maize and peanuts showed that the instrument provided as accurate results as the professional equipment. With the low fabrication cost (about RMB 129 or USD 20), portability, and user-friendliness, this instrument presents attractive potential in the rapid detection of AFB(1).","output":"A Portable, Cost-Effective and User-Friendly Instrument for Colorimetric Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Rapid Detection of Aflatoxin B(1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D may be a central biological determinant of COVID-19 outcomes.

The high tetra-PEGylation ratio was about 60 %, and PEGylation prolonged the half-life of rhCAT in serum (75 vs. 13.5 min for native rhCAT). The protective effects of PEG-rhCAT were investigated in a mouse model of influenza virus A (H1N1)-associated pneumonia. PEG-rhCAT was more effectively delivered than native rhCAT and was associated with higher survival ratio, less extensive lung injuries, reduced ROS levels, and lower viral replication.

Growing evidence suggests that dream content has a bi-directional relationship with psychopathology, and that dreams react to new, personally significant and emotional experiences. The first lockdown experience was an acute event, characterized by a combination of several unprecedented factors (new pandemic, threat of the disease, global uncertainty, , experience of social isolation, exposure to stressful information) that resulted in a large-scale disruption of life routines. This study aimed at investigating changes in dream, bad dream and nightmare recall;most prevalent dream themes, and the relationship between dreams, bad dreams, nightmares and symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety during the first COVID-19 lockdown (April-May 2020) through a national online survey. Methods: 968 participants completed an online survey. Dream themes were measured using the Typical Dreams Questionnaire;stress levels were measured by the Cohens Perceived Stress Scale;symptoms of anxiety were assessed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale;and symptoms of depression were assessed using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Results: 34% (328) of participants reported increased dream recall during the lockdown. The most common dream themes were centered around the topics of 1) inefficacy (e.g., trying again and again, arriving late), 2) human threat (e.g., being chased, attacked);3) death;and 4) pandemic imagery (e.g., being separated from loved ones, being sick). Dream, bad dream and nightmare frequency was highest in individuals with moderate to severe stress levels. Frequency of bad dreams nightmares and dreams about the pandemic, inefficacy and death were associated with higher levels of stress, as well as with greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Results support theories of dream formation, environmental susceptibility and stress reactivity. Dream content during the lockdown broadly reflected existential concerns and was associated with increased symptoms of mental health indices.","output":"Stuck in a lockdown: dreams, bad dreams, nightmares, and their relationship to stress, depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC?

OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters.

Biochemical measures of eGC integrity included plasma syndecan-1 and total urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Side-stream dark field imaging was used to quantitatively assess integrity of eGC. Plasma angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) was measured as a marker of endothelial activation and also as a possible mediator of eGC breakdown.

In the MSM group, imaging results provided further evidence for eGC degradation. Although not correlated with markers of eGC degradation, vascular function (assessed by non-invasive near infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]) demonstrated reduced microvascular reactivity, particularly affecting the SM group.

Outcomes were 3-month functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2), mortality, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH)/SITS. Results were compared between the groups treated in >3 to 4.5 and 3 hours. RESULTS Median age was 84 years; 61% were female in both groups. Median NIH Stroke Scale score was 12 vs 14 in the >3- to 4.5- and 3-hour group, respectively. Three-month functional independence was 34% vs 35% (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.89, p < 0.001); mortality was 31% vs 32% (aOR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97-1.25, p = 0.13); and SICH/SITS was 2.7% vs 1.6% (aOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.25-2.35, p = 0.001). In EU SmPC-compliant patients, 3-month functional independence was 36 vs 37% (aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68-0.92, p = 0.002), mortality was 29% vs 29.6% (aOR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95-1.28, p = 0.20), and SICH/SITS was 2.7% vs 1.6% (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.12-2.34, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In this observational study, unselected patients >80 years of age treated with IVT after 3 hours vs earlier had a slightly higher rate of SICH and similar unadjusted functional outcome but poorer adjusted outcome. The absolute difference between the treatment groups is small, and elderly patients should not be denied IVT in the later time window solely because of age without other contraindications.","output":"Outcome after stroke thrombolysis in patients >80 years treated within 3 hours vs >3-4.5 hours."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continuous spread of \\"SARS-COV-2\\" around the globe, push the governments to start vaccination campaigns by approving several vaccines under the emergency procedure.

This global pandemic has infected nearly 3 million people and accounted for 200 000 deaths worldwide, with those numbers still climbing. CASE SUMMARY: We present a 54-year-old patient who developed respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation from her infection with SARS-CoV-2. This patient was subsequently found to have a right ventricular thrombus and bilateral pulmonary emboli, likely contributing to her respiratory status. On the 14th day of hospitalization, the patient was successfully extubated, and 5 days later was discharged to the rehabilitation unit. DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 presents primarily with pulmonary symptoms; however, many patients, particularly those who are severely ill, exhibit adverse events related to hypercoagulability. The exact mechanism explaining this hypercoagulable state has yet to be elucidated, but these thrombotic events have been linked to the increased inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. This novel viral illness is still largely misunderstood, but the hypercoagulable state, seen in severely ill patients, appears to play a major role in disease progression and prognosis.","output":"COVID-19 resulting in bilateral pulmonary emboli and a right ventricular thrombus: association or causation?

We collectively call this Janus, and it was eventually replaced by the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of concern (VoC), next replaced by Delta (B.1.617.2), which itself might soon be replaced by a fourth pandemic wave consisting of Omicron (B.1.1.529). We observe that splitting up and redefining variant lineages over time, as was the case with Janus and is now happening with Alpha, Delta and Omicron, is not helpful to describe the epidemic waves spreading globally. Only 5% of the 30 000 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are found to be variable.

It is of great significance to monitor the concentration of these radionuclides for environmental safety. This paper summarizes and critically discusses the separation and measurement methods for ultra-trace determination of 90Sr, 239Pu, and 240Pu in the environment. After selecting the measurement method, it is necessary to consider the decontamination of the interference from matrix elements and the key elements, and this involves the choice of the separation method. Measurement methods include both radiometric methods and non-radiometric methods. Radiometric methods, including alpha spectroscopy, liquid scintillation spectrometry, etc., are commonly used methods for measuring 239+240Pu and 90Sr. Mass spectrometry, as the representative of non-radiometric measurement methods, has been regarded as the most promising analytical method due to its high absolute sensitivity, low detection limit, and relatively short sample-analysis time. Through the comparison of various measurement methods, the future development trend of radionuclide measurement is prospected in this review. The fully automatic and rapid analysis method is a highlight. The new mass spectrometer with ultra-high sensitivity shows strong analytical capabilities for extremely low concentrations of 90Sr, 239Pu, and 240Pu, and it is expected to develop determination methods with higher sensitivity and lower detection limit.","output":"Analytical Methods for the Determination of 90Sr and 239,240Pu in Environmental Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after stroke thrombectomy in clinical practice, and to identify predictors of better HRQoL, we analyzed data of 504 consecutive patients treated in a large university stroke center. METHODS All stroke patients treated by thrombectomy (June 2015-October 2018) were prospectively enrolled in this observational study. At 90 days, functional outcome was assessed by the mRS, and patient-reported HRQoL by the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Self-report Questionnaire, consisting of five health domains. The EQ-5D utility index (EQ-5D-I; -0.594 to 1.00 with higher values indicating better HRQoL) was calculated. Linear regression analysis was applied to identify predictors of better HRQoL (higher EQ-5D-I). RESULTS Of 504 patients (median age 76 years, 51.8% female), the mean EQ-5D-I was 0.39 (SD 0.44). The proportion of stroke survivors who reported complaints in the different domains decreased from 66% in Usual Activities, to 57% in Mobility, 50.4% in Selfcare, 41.7% in Pain/Discomfort and 40.8% Anxiety/Depression. A lower age, a lower pre-stroke mRS, a lower baseline NIHSS, and a higher ASPECT score, concomitant thrombolysis therapy, and a successful recanalization were independent predictors of better HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS Patient-reported HRQoL provides a more comprehensive assessment of stroke outcome than the mRS. Health domains involving motor function showed most frequently complaints in HRQoL after stroke thrombectomy, while a large proportion of patients did not report any complaints across the different health domains.

We conducted individual, semi-structured interviews with eighteen Caucasian women (mean age 45.4y) who were members of nation-wide UK commercial, fee-paying, community weight management programme.

Participants' experiences indicated that the programme helped by triggering several intra- and interpersonal processes that catalysed change across psychological, physiological, dietary and behavioural areas of their life. Risks to program adherence and effectiveness spanned well-known risks such as self-regulation fatigue and the difficulty of recovering from negative self-criticism, as well as new factors such as the confusing nature of weight change, the relatively powerful impact of everyday events, and the difficulty in getting the balance right between personalised support vs. intrusion. The complexity of reported experiences challenges the linear, predictive pathways of change proposed by many health behaviour models of weight management. To improve effectiveness, programmes need to go well beyond behavioural and dietary support.

Also, CQ and HCQ inhibit the production of interferon- (IFN-)  and IFN- and/or tumor necrotizing factor- (TNF-) . Furthermore, CQ blocks the production of prostaglandins (PGs) in the intact cell by inhibiting substrate accessibility of arachidonic acid necessary for the production of PGs. Moreover, CQ affects the stability between T-helper cell (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokine secretion by augmenting IL-10 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Additionally, CQ is capable of blocking lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) triggered stimulation of extracellular signal-modulated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 in human PBMCs. HCQ at clinical levels effectively blocks CpG-triggered class-switched memory B-cells from differentiating into plasmablasts as well as producing IgG.

In this study, we developed a novel, non-invasive, and contactless magnetic sensing platform that can precisely monitor breathing, movement, or sleep patterns of a patient, thus providing efficient monitoring at a clinic or home. A magneto-LC resonance (MLCR) sensor converts the magnetic oscillations generated by breathing of the patient into an impedance spectrum, which allows for a deep analysis of breath variation to identify respiratory-related diseases like COVID-19. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity, the MLCR sensor yields a distinct breathing pattern for each patient tested. The sensor also provides an accurate measure of the strength of breath at multiple stages as well as anomalous variations in respiratory rate and amplitude.

Despite a plethora of information on the Internet, there is little supporting evidence and no human studies. The risk of multiplex ventilation is that ventilation and PEEP effects are largely uncontrollable and depend on the difference between patient resistance, (R) and compliance (C). It is not clear whether volume control or pressure control is safer or more effective. We designed a simulation-based study to allow complete control over the relevant variables to determine the effects of various degrees of RC imbalance on tidal volume (VT), end-expiratory lung volume (VEE), and imputed pH. METHODS Two separate breathing simulators were ventilated with a ventilator using pressure control (PC) and volume control (VC) breaths. Evidence-based lung models simulated a range of differences in R and C (six pairs of simulated patients). Differences in VT, VEE, and imputed pH were recorded. RESULTS Depending on differences in R and C, differences in VT ranged from 1% (equal R and C) to 79%. Differences in VEE ranged from 2% to 109%. Differences in pH ranged from 0% to 5%. Failure due to excessive tidal volume (> 8 mL/kg) did not occur. Failure due to excessive VEE difference (> 10%) was evident in 50% of patient pairs. There was no difference in failure rate between VC and PC. CONCLUSIONS These experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation.

Results: Among 1438 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (858 [59.7%] male, median age, 63 years), those receiving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both were more likely than those not receiving either drug to have diabetes, respiratory rate >22/min, abnormal chest imaging findings, O2 saturation lower than 90%, and aspartate aminotransferase greater than 40 U/L. Overall in-hospital mortality was 20.3% (95% CI, 18.2%-22.4%). The probability of death for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 189/735 (25.7% [95% CI, 22.3%-28.9%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 54/271 (19.9% [95% CI, 15.2%-24.7%]), azithromycin alone, 21/211 (10.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-14.0%]), and neither drug, 28/221 (12.7% [95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%]). In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, compared with patients receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.76-2.40]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.63-1.85]), or azithromycin alone (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.26-1.21]). In logistic models, compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.12-4.05]), but not hydroxychloroquine alone (adjusted OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.96-3.81]) or azithromycin alone (adjusted OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.27-1.56]), . In adjusted logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in the relative likelihood of abnormal electrocardiogram findings. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality. However, the interpretation of these findings may be limited by the observational design.","output":"Association of Treatment With Hydroxychloroquine or Azithromycin With In-Hospital Mortality in Patients With COVID-19 in New York State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To measure the global impact of COVID-19 pandemic on volumes of IV thrombolysis (IVT), IVT transfers, and stroke hospitalizations over 4 months at the height of the pandemic (March 1 to June 30, 2020) compared with 2 control 4-month periods. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective study across 6 continents, 70 countries, and 457 stroke centers. Diagnoses were identified by their ICD-10 codes or classifications in stroke databases. RESULTS: There were 91,373 stroke admissions in the 4 months immediately before compared to 80,894 admissions during the pandemic months, representing an 11.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] -11.7 to -11.3, p < 0.0001) decline. There were 13,334 IVT therapies in the 4 months preceding compared to 11,570 procedures during the pandemic, representing a 13.2% (95% CI -13.8 to -12.7, p < 0.0001) drop. Interfacility IVT transfers decreased from 1,337 to 1,178, or an 11.9% decrease (95% CI -13.7 to -10.3, p = 0.001). Recovery of stroke hospitalization volume (9.5%, 95% CI 9.2-9.8, p < 0.0001) was noted over the 2 later (May, June) vs the 2 earlier (March, April) pandemic months. There was a 1.48% stroke rate across 119,967 COVID-19 hospitalizations. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was noted in 3.3% (1,722/52,026) of all stroke admissions. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a global decline in the volume of stroke hospitalizations, IVT, and interfacility IVT transfers.

Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore the predictors of prehospital delay. Being widowed, educational level, pain intensity, the gradual onset of ACS symptoms, symptoms lasting for more than 30 minutes, patients' feeling anxious about their ACS symptoms, patients' perceiving their symptoms to be particularly dangerous, history of myocardial infarction (MI), and mode of transportation were associated with the time taken before seeking emergency care. Significant predictors of time to seek help were chief complaint of chest pain or palpitations, abrupt onset of symptoms, the associated symptom of vertigo, and a higher number of chronic illnesses; they explained about 17.9% of the variance in the time to seek care. The average time to seek care among patients with ACS during the COVID-19 pandemic was found to be longer than the average time reported by studies conducted prior the pandemic.

In essence, Winnicott's concept of trauma is entirely related to the vicissitudes of the early psychic parent-infant relationship in which the mother's role is fundamental for the development of the newborn's psyche at the beginning and subsequently. While Winnicott acknowledges the difference between physical and psychic trauma, his focus is on how the interpsychic relationship, psyche to nascent psyche, contributes to the infant's intrapsychic world. Thus, early trauma is caused by psychic transmissions that emanate through and because of the mother's affective states of mind towards her fetus-becoming-an-infant and her infant-becoming-a-child. The earlier that psychic trauma occurs in the nascent psyche, the more severe the outcome of the individual's mental health. This is why Winnicott refers to psychosis as an environmental deficiency disease as distinct from psychotic defences. The author outlines Winnicott's key concepts that are intrinsic to his theory of trauma i.e. the antisocial tendency, fear of breakdown and regression.

We derive a formula for the threshold condition of contagion outbreak; also, we provide a lower bound for the threshold parameter to indicate the effect of adaptive rewiring. The threshold analysis is confirmed by extensive simulations. Our results show that awareness-dependent link rewiring plays an important role in enhancing the transmission threshold as well as lowering the epidemic prevalence. Moreover, it is revealed that intensified awareness diffusion in conjunction with enhanced link rewiring makes a greater contribution to disease prevention and control. In addition, the critical phenomenon is observed in the dependence of the epidemic threshold on the awareness diffusion rate, supporting the metacritical point previously reported in the literature.

AIM: To describe the results of a multicenter prospective registry on patients with PD undergoing plaque incision or and grafting (PIG) or plaque excision and grafting (PEG) with collagen fleece TachoSil, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this procedure. METHODS: A prospective non-controlled multicenter study of patients with PD was performed between May 2016 and March 2018. Patients from 10 centers with stable PD for at least 3 months, difficulties in sexual intercourse, normal erectile function with or without pharmacological treatment, curvature >45, and/or penile shortening and/or complex deformities were included. All patients underwent PIG/PEG with collagen fleece TachoSil. OUTCOMES: The main outcome measure of this study were penile curvature correction (intraoperative), penile shortening (intraoperative), erectile function with the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and the Erection Hardness Score, subjective patient outcomes with non-validated questionnaires, and complications. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean (SD) preoperative penile curvature was 72.8 (17.0). PIG was the preferred technique (80.8%). Intraoperatively, complete curvature correction was achieved in 92.3%, and no significant penile shortening was recorded in 80.8% of subjects. Subjective penile shortening was reported in 83.3% of patients at 6 months. No objective measurement of penile curvature and length was recorded during follow-up. No statistically significant difference from the baseline was found in IIEF-5 and Erection Hardness Score at 3 or at 6 months, although 16.7% of men experienced a worsening of IIEF-5 scores and 14.3% required de novo phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use. 6 months after surgery, 78.5% of men were satisfied with intervention. Swelling and ecchymosis/hematoma were the most common perioperative complications (40.4%). 2 cases (3.8%) of wound infection were recorded. At 6 months, 35.7% of patients reported mild penile hypesthesia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results confirm the high success rate of grafting with TachoSil, and the surgeon perceived low percentage of penile shortening. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is the first multicentre study on patients with PD undergoing grafting with TachoSil without concomitant placement of penile prosthesis. The main limitations are the short follow-up and the relatively small sample size. CONCLUSION: Grafting with TachoSil after PIG/PEG in patients with PD is an effective and safe procedure.

The patients underwent dose escalation, and the benefit was assessed by reductions in daily disease symptoms and corticosteroid requirement. Quality of life, organ inflammation, changes in IFN-induced biomarkers, and safety were longitudinally assessed. RESULTS Eighteen patients were treated for a mean duration of 3.0 years (1.5-4.9 years). The median daily symptom score decreased from 1.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.93-1.78) to 0.25 (IQR, 0.1-0.63) (P < 0.0001). In 14 patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline, daily prednisone doses decreased from 0.44 mg/kg/day (IQR, 0.31-1.09) to 0.11 mg/kg/day (IQR, 0.02-0.24) (P < 0.01), and 5 of 10 patients with CANDLE achieved lasting clinical remission. The patients' quality of life and height and bone mineral density Z-scores significantly improved, and their IFN biomarkers decreased. Three patients, two of whom had genetically undefined conditions, discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy, and one CANDLE patient discontinued treatment because of BK viremia and azotemia.

ARDS is defined as respiratory failure not caused by fluid overload or cardiac failure within one week of a known clinical insult with bilateral opacities on chest imaging, and diagnosis is based on these parameters. Increased understanding of the inflammatory cascade associated with ARDS progression shows promise for identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers and additional treatment options. Here, we review recent studies that point to the unifying inflammatory element(s) of the disease process and the use of agents that decrease inflammation as potentially powerful treatments for ARDS patients.","output":"Lung Epithelial Protein Expression and the Use of Volatile Anesthetics in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Schema therapy (ST) is an efficacious psychotherapy for personality disorders (PDs) in adults. The first empirical support for the effectiveness of ST in older adults with cluster C PDs was provided recently. ST partly focusses on the positive, but there is an increasing awareness of imbalance in the ST community because of the emphasis on negative schemas versus attention to positive schemas. Positive schemas may be important vehicles of therapeutic change in psychotherapy with older people, as it may help strengthen the healthy adult mode, and it might also help change a negative life review. Suggestions were made to increase the efficacy and feasibility of ST in older adults, including adjusting the case conceptualisation, modifying the experiential techniques, making use of the patient's wisdom and reactivating positive schemas. The aim of the current study is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of adapted individual ST for older adults. METHODS/DESIGN: A multiple baseline design is used with positive and negative core beliefs as primary outcome measures. Ten older adults (age > 60 years) with cluster C PDs are treated with schema therapy, with weekly sessions during one year. This treatment phase is preceded by a baseline phase varying randomly from 4 to 8 weeks. After treatment, there is a 6-month follow-up phase with monthly booster sessions. Symptomatic distress, schema modes, early maladaptive schemas (EMS) and early adaptive schemas (EAS) are secondary outcome measures. PD will be diagnosed before baseline and after treatment phase. EAS are assessed with the Dutch version of the Young Positive Schema Questionnaire (YPSQ). DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study in which positive schemas are integrated in ST treatment to examine the efficacy of an adapted form of ST for older adults. This is in line with wider developments supporting the integration of positive schema's into ST. It offers the possibility to improve the effectiveness of ST in older adults.

Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has emerged as a promising tool employed in public health response in many countries globally. This study aimed to establish whether the surveillance of aircraft wastewater can be used to provide an additional layer of information to augment individual clinical surveillance testing. Wastewater from 37 long-haul flights chartered to repatriate Australians was tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Children 5 years or older on these flights tested negative for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) (deep nasal and oropharyngeal reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR swab) 48 h before departure. All passengers underwent mandatory quarantine for 14-day post arrival in Australia. Wastewater from 24 (64.9%) of the 37 flights tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical surveillance identified 112 cases of COVID-19 during the 14-day mandatory quarantine. Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in repatriation flight wastewater using pooled results from all three RT-qPCR assays demonstrated a positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.5% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 76.9% for COVID-19 cases during the post-arrival 14-day quarantine period (83.7% accuracy).

This cross sectional study was designed to investigate ABC genotypes and the relationship between virulence factors and fluconazole tolerance among C. albicans isolates from infected pediatric patients. Materials and Methods: C. albicans isolates were identified by germ tube test and ABC typing using PCR. Antifungal susceptibility testing was done according to Clinical Laboratory Standard Institution recommendations. Testing for proteinase and phospholiase production were done using bovine serum albumin agar and egg yolk agar, respectively. All isolates were tested for biofilm formation. Fluconazole tolerance was detected by reading the fluconazole susceptibility testing after 48 hours. Candida albicans isoltes were considered as fluconazole tolerant if they exhibited a susceptible minimum inhibatory concentration (MIC) after 24 hours of incubation and a resistant MIC following 48 hours of incubation. Results: A total of 88 C. albicans isolates were collected. Genotype A was the most prevalent (46 isolates, 52.3%). Biofilm formation, proteinase and phospholipase enzymes activity were detected in 76.1% 77.3% and 65.9% of the C. albicans isolates, respectively. Fluconazole resistance was found in 36.4% of the isolated C. albicans. Fluconazole tolerance was detected in 29 isolates (33%). Fluconazole tolerance has significant positive correlation with proteinase production and biofilm formation. Conclusion: Genotype A was the most prevalent genotype. Biofilm and hydrolytic enzymes production are important Candida albicans virulence determinants in pediatric infections.

We apply Geographic information systems technology to study the distribution of heavy metal elements in tea plantation ecosystems in Jiangsu Province, explore the relationships among metals in the soil, tea leaves and tea infusions, and assess the human safety risks of metals. The concentrations of nine metals in a soil-tea leaves-tea infusion system were studied at 100 randomly selected tea plantations in Jiangsu Province, China. Concentrations of selected metals, zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu), were quantified using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), and cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), plumbum (Pb) and mercury (Hg) were quantified using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Arc-Map 10.3 was used for the spatial analysis of metals in soil, tea leaves and tea infusions. We found that the contents of Mn, Ni and Zn are high level in soil, tea leaves and tea infusions. The Mn level showed a spatial distribution pattern with greater concentrations at the junction of Nanjing and Yangzhou, southwest of Changzhou and west of Suzhou. The hazard index (HI) values in north-central Nanjing, southern Suzhou, southwestern Changzhou and northern Lianyungang were relatively greater. The Zn, Ni, Mn, Cr and Cu levels in the soil-tea infusion system were 17.3, 45.5, 54.5, 1.5 and 14.3%, respectively. The order of the leaching rates of the elements was Ni > Cr > Zn > Mn > Cu. The relative contribution ratios of HI were in the order of Mn > Ni > Cu > Zn > Cr > Pb > Cd > As > Hg. In tea infusions, the Mn level has the greatest potential health risks to consumers. Moreover, using Csoil it was inferred that the safety thresholds of Zn, Ni, Mn, Cr and Cu in soil were 27,700, 50, 1230, 493,000 and 16,800 mg L-1, respectively. The content of heavy metals in soil and tea varies greatly in different regions of Jiangsu Province, 92% of the soil has heavy metal content that meets the requirements of pollution-free tea gardens, 91% of tea samples met the requirements of green food tea. The thresholds for Ni (50 mg L-1) and Mn (1230 mg L-1) can be used as maximum limits in tea plantation soils.

Also, with the ubiquitousness of mobile phone cameras, it is quite common to take pictures of the CT films, which unfortunately suffer from geometric deformation and illumination variation. In this work, we study the problem of recovering a CT film, which marks the first attempt in the literature, to the best of our knowledge. We start with building a large-scale head CT film database CTFilm20K, consisting of approximately 20,000 pictures, using the widely used computer graphics software Blender. We also record all accompanying information related to the geometric deformation (such as 3D coordinate, depth, normal, and UV maps) and illumination variation (such as albedo map). Then we propose a deep framework to disentangle geometric deformation and illumination variation using the multiple maps extracted from the CT films to collaboratively guide the recovery process. Extensive experiments on simulated and real images demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the previous approaches.

Varying COVID-19 health burden and alcohol policies may have contributed to different consumption trends between states. The aim of this study is to assess trends in alcohol consumption and moderation by state of residence. METHODS: We examined trends in adult drinking days, during the first wave of the pandemic (March 10 to June 8) using longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study (N = 6,172 unique participants; N = 28,059 observations). Because state mandates were responsive to disease burden, we modeled the interaction of time by COVID-19 burden, defined as whether the state had the median (or higher) daily incidence of COVID-19 cases on the survey date, and state random effects. We controlled for individual sociodemographics, perceived personal/familial COVID-19 burden, mental health symptomology, and risk avoidance. RESULTS: Drinking days increased throughout the duration (incidence risk ratio [IRR] for drinking per increase in one calendar day = 1.003, 95% CI 1.001, 1.004); trends were heterogeneous by disease burden, with individuals living in states with lower COVID-19 burden increasing (IRR = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003, 1.007) faster than those living in states with higher COVID-19 burden (IRR = 1.000, 95% CI 0.998, 1.002). Trends were heterogeneous between states, but there was no evidence of systematic geographic clustering of state trends.

Recombinant S. typhimurium 3987 (pYATS-1) and 3987 (pYATS-4) expressing constitutively a 53 kDa amino-terminal fragment of the S protein and the full length protein (144 kDa), respectively, showed high stability. After 50 generations in vitro 60% and 20% of the bacteria transformed with pYATS-1 and pYATS-4, respectively, expressed the S-protein antigen. Since S. typhimurium 3987 (pYATS-1) showed a better level of expression and stability in vitro, this recombinant strain was selected as a potential bivalent vector to induce both immunity to Salmonella and TGEV in swine. In order to study colonization of swine tissues by S. typhimurium cya crp, a gene conferring resistance to rifampicin was cloned into the chromosome of S. typhimurium 3987, generating 4509 strain.

Utilizing data from a PNG 2018 rural household survey along with earlier national household survey data, we examine rice consumption patterns in PNG and estimate demand parameters for urban and rural households. Model simulations indicate that a 25% rise in the world price of rice would reduce total rice consumption in PNG by 14% and reduce rice consumption of the poor (bottom 40% of total household expenditure distribution) by 15%. Including the effects of a possible 12% decrease in household incomes because of the COVID\\\\19 related economic slowdown, rice consumption of the urban and rural poor fall by 20% and 17%, respectively.

The impact of ethnicity on mortality of patients with COVID-19 infection is poorly addressed in the literature. Emerging evidence suggests that many risk factors are related to symptoms severity and mortality risk, emphasizing the necessity of fulfilling this knowledge gap that may help reducing mortality from COVID-19 infections through tackling the risk factors. AIMS: To explore epidemiological and demographic characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from different ethnic origins living in the UAE, compare them to findings reported across the globe and determine the impact of these characteristics and ethnicity on mortality during hospitalization. METHODS: A single center, retrospective chart review study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was conducted in a large COVID-19 referral hospital in UAE. The following outcomes were assessed: patients clinical characteristics, disease symptoms and severity, and association of ethnicity and other risk factors on 30-day in hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3296 patients were recruited in this study with an average age of 44.313.4 years old. Preliminary data analysis indicated that 78.3% (n = 2582) of cases were considered mild. Average duration of hospital stay was 6.07.3 days and 4.3% (n = 143) were admitted to ICU. The most frequently reported symptoms were cough (32.6%, n = 1075) and fever (22.2%, n = 731). The 30-day mortality rate during hospitalization was 2.7% (n = 90). Many risk factors were associated with mortality during hospitalization including: age, respiratory rate (RR), creatinine, and C-reactive protein, oxygen saturation (SaO(2)), hemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin, creatinine, C-reactive protein, anemia, COPD, Chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, Vitamin-D Deficiency, and ethnic origin (p <0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that higher mortality rates during hospitalization was associated with anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease, and Middle Eastern origin (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that most COVID-19 cases were mild and morality rate was low compared to worldwide reported mortality. Mortality rate during hospitalization was higher in patients from Middle East origin with preexisting comorbidities especially anemia, COPD, and chronic kidney disease. Due to the relatively small number of mortality cases, other identified risk factors from univariate analysis such as age, respiratory rate, and Vitamin-D (VitD) deficiency should also be taken into consideration. It is crucial to stratify patients on admission based on these risk factors to help decide intensity and type of treatment which, possibly, will reduce the risk of death.","output":"Clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients in UAE: Does ethnic origin have an impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we measure the impact, in relative terms, of Covid-19 pandemic and the actions implemented to deal with it, on the Spanish mortality rates during year 2020. This study has been carried out age by age, distinguishing between male and female populations. The methodology we propose consists of directly comparing the mortality rates for the periods 2018-19 and 2020. First, we estimate the crude mortality rates and then proceed to graduate the mortality curves using non-parametric techniques, particularly, cubic spline functions. The comparison of graduated mortality rates allows to measure the impact of Covid-19 on age-specific mortality rates finding that the pandemic and the measures adopted to face it affected different age groups of male and female populations in different ways. The most striking results are the decrease of infant mortality rates in relative terms for men and women. Also, noteworthy is the relative increase in female mortality rates from age 25 to 45 years with a peak around the age of 34. This peak is, surprisingly, as important as the maximum impact of Covid-19 on the older population. It should also be noted that mortality rates increased with age between 60 to 75 with a peak around 75 for men and 80 for women.

Firstly, the inner ZnS and ZnSe shells confine the excitons inside the cores of QDs and provide a better lattice matching with respect to the outermost shell, which ensures high photoluminescence quantum yields of QDs. Secondly, the CdZnS shell affords its QDs with shallow valence bands (VBs). Therefore, the CdZnS shell could be used as a springboard, which decreases the energy barrier for hole injection from polymers to QDs to be below 1.0 eV. It makes the holes to be easily injected into the QD EMLs and enables a balanced recombination of charge carriers in quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). Thirdly, the RGB QLEDs made by these new QDs exhibit peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 20.2%, 19.2%, and 8.4%, respectively. In addition, the QLEDs exhibit unexpected luminance values at low applied voltages and therefore high power efficiencies.

Manual reduction (taxis) and elective surgery could be an alternative management approach. This study examines the role of taxis with the adjuvant use of the visual analogue scale (VAS) score in treating incarcerated hernias and thereby decreasing the emergency surgery rate, especially during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods All adult patients admitted to the emergency department of our hospital with incarcerated hernias of anterior abdominal wall were prospectively submitted to hernia manual reduction. The VAS score was used as an adjuvant tool for monitoring the success of this maneuver. Patients with successful taxis and low VAS score were hospitalized for a 24-hour period of observation. On their discharge, they were scheduled for an elective hernia repair. Patients with unsuccessful taxis or with less than a 50% reduction in VAS score after successful taxis were submitted to emergency surgical repair. Age, sex, type of hernias, time until taxis, VAS scores before and after taxis, length of hospital stay, and adverse events for both groups were recorded. Results Between September 2018 and September 2020, 86 patients with incarcerated hernias were included. The types of hernias were incisional in 8 patients, umbilical in 15 patients, inguinal in 56 patients, and femoral in 7 patients. Taxis was successful in 66% of patients with a mean reduction in VAS score from 83 to 17 mm. Following successful taxis, patients were hospitalized for a 24-hour period of observation. No taxis-related complications were observed. Fifty-two patients were safely discharged from hospital and scheduled for an elective repair during the first month. Thirty-four patients were operated emergently. Five patients had successful taxis but with a reduction of posttaxis VAS score less than 50% (a mean reduction from 86 to 62 mm), while taxis failed in twenty-nine patients. Patients with emergency surgery had longer time until reduction and longer stay of hospitalization. In this group, two patients required admission to the intensive care unit while one patient died. Conclusion In this protocolized approach, taxis is a safe and feasible option for most patients with incarcerated hernias.

We aimed at describing the longitudinal brain metabolic pattern in COVID-19-related encephalopathy using 18F-FDG-PET/CT. METHODS: Seven patients with variable clinical presentations of COVID-19-related encephalopathy were explored thrice with brain 18F-FDG-PET/CT, once in the acute phase, 1 month later and 6 months after COVID-19 onset. PET images were analysed with voxel-wise and regions-of-interest approaches in comparison with 32 healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients neurological manifestations during acute encephalopathy were heterogeneous. However, all of them presented with predominant cognitive and behavioural frontal disorders. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in the CSF was negative for all patients. MRI revealed no specific abnormalities for most of the subjects. All patients had a consistent pattern of hypometabolism in a widespread cerebral network including the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula and caudate nucleus. Six months after COVID-19 onset, the majority of patients clinically had improved but cognitive and emotional disorders of varying severity remained with attention/executive disabilities and anxio-depressive symptoms, and lasting prefrontal, insular and subcortical 18F-FDG-PET/CT abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The implication of this widespread network could be the neural substrate of clinical features observed in patients with COVID-19, such as frontal lobe syndrome, emotional disturbances and deregulation of respiratory failure perception.

Over the past decade, advanced economies worldwide have tightened their national investment screening mechanisms (ISMs). In March 2019, the European Union (EU) adopted its first common FDI screening framework. This article explores variations in Member State preferences for the creation and nature of a pan-European screening framework. Based on extensive interviews with high-level EU and country officials involved in the negotiation process, and using a unique measure of national support for the EU-wide ISM created through the first-ever elite survey on this subject matter, we find that countries with higher technological levels were more supportive of FDI screening due to concerns over unreciprocated technological transfer. We also show the effects of Chinese FDI on country-level support for FDI screening sector-dependent. We found no evidence that total Chinese FDI predicts preferences for ISM. Instead, countries with high levels of Chinese FDI in strategic sectors are more likely to support the ISM, while those with high levels of Chinese investment in low-tech sectors tend to oppose screening. Our overall findings suggest that EU investment screening, and national-level screening in general, might become more restrictive in the future, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of peripartum depression under the influence of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 2026 pregnant and postpartum women residing in Beijing, Wuhan, and Lanzhou of China were recruited from February 28 to April 9, 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess their depressive symptoms. The women were divided into four subgroups based on pregnancy stage, and a binary logistic regression analysis was conducted on each subgroup. RESULTS: Under the influence of COVID-19, the prevalence rate of peripartum depression among Chinese women was 9.7%. It was 13.6, 10.8, 7.9 and 7.3% in the first, second, third trimester and puerperium, respectively. Regression analysis showed that the influence of current pregnancy status on movement (Mild vs. No, aORs were 3.89, P < 0.001, 2.92, P = 0.003, 1.58, P = 0.150 in the three trimesters, respectively; Severe vs. No, aORs were 13.00, 20.45, 5.38 in the three trimesters, respectively, all P < 0.05), and worries and fears about childbirth (aORs were 2.46, 2.96, 2.50 in the three trimesters, respectively, all P < 0.05) were associated with depression throughout pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of peripartum depression during the COVID-19 outbreak in China was not higher than usual. The influence of current pregnancy status on movement, as well as worries and fears about childbirth were independent risk factors for peripartum depression throughout pregnancy during COVID-19.

This host shutoff phenotype is driven by the conserved herpesviral alkaline exonuclease, termed SOX in KSHV and BGLF5 in EBV, which in gammaherpesviruses has evolved the genetically separable ability to target cellular mRNA. We now show that host shutoff is also a prominent consequence of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) infection, which is widely used as a model system to study pathogenesis of these viruses in vivo. The effector of MHV68-induced host shutoff is its SOX homolog, here termed muSOX. There is remarkable functional conservation of muSOX host shutoff activities with those of KSHV SOX, including the recently described ability of SOX to induce mRNA hyperadenylation in the nucleus as well as cause nuclear relocalization of the poly(A) binding protein. SOX and muSOX localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells. Using spatially restricted variants of these proteins, we go on to demonstrate that all known host shutoff-related activities of SOX and muSOX are orchestrated exclusively from the cytoplasm. These results have important mechanistic implications for how SOX and muSOX target nascent cellular transcripts in the nucleus.

METHODS: We developed a knowledge and attitude questionnaire with 30 items related to five established and two hypothetical psychological antecedents of vaccination (KA-7C). The online questionnaire was distributed from 18 December 2020 to 1 February 2021 through chain-referral via professional networks, yielding a convenience sample. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore the associations of individual and grouped KA-7C items with COVID-19 vaccine intention. RESULTS: Among 5,234 participants, the vaccine intention model fit (pseudo R-squared values) increased slightly but significantly from 0.62 to 0.65 when adding social conformism and confidence in systems items. Intention to vaccinate was associated with the majority opinion among family and friends (OR: 11.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.51C29.67) and a positive perception of employers encouragement to get vaccinated (vs negative; OR: 6.41; 95% CI: 3.36C12.22).

However, the key to clinical application depends on effective gene delivery. METHODS Using a large animal model, we developed two pharmaceutical formulations for gene delivery in the pigs' vagina, which were made up of poly (-amino ester) (PBAE)-plasmid polyplex nanoparticles (NPs) based two gel materials, modified montmorillonite (mMMT) and hectorite (HTT). FINDINGS By conducting flow cytometry of the cervical cells, we found that PBAE-GFP-NPs-mMMT gel was more efficient than PBAE-GFP-NPs-HTT gel in delivering exogenous DNA intravaginally. Next, we designed specific CRISPR/SpCas9 sgRNAs targeting porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and evaluated the genome editing efficacy in vivo. We discovered that PERV copy number in vaginal epithelium could be significantly reduced by the local delivery of the PBAE-SpCas9/sgRNA NPs-mMMT gel. Comparable genome editing results were also obtained by high-fidelity version of SpCas9, SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9, in the mMMT gel. Further, we confirmed that the expression of topically delivered SpCas9 was limited to the vagina/cervix and did not diffuse to nearby organs, which was relatively safe with low toxicity. INTERPRETATION Our data suggested that the PBAE-NPs mMMT vaginal gel is an effective preparation for local gene therapy, yielding insights into novel therapeutic approaches to sexually transmitted disease in the genital tract.

However, there is still a lack of appropriate identification of chemoreceptors and their ligands in Agrobacterium. Here, Atu0526, a sCache-type chemoreceptor from Agrobacterium fabrum C58, was confirmed as the receptor of a broad antibacterial agent, formic acid. The binding of formic acid to Atu0526 was screened using a thermo shift assay and verified using isothermal titration calorimetry. Inconsistent with the previously reported antimicrobial properties, formic acid was confirmed to be a chemoattractant to A. fabrum and could promote its growth. The chemotaxis of A. fabrum C58 toward formic acid was completely lost with the knock-out of atu0526, and regained with the complementation of the gene, indicating that Atu0526 is the only chemoreceptor for formic acid in A. fabrum C58. The affinity of formic acid to Atu0526LBD significantly increased after the arginine at position 115 was replaced by alanine. However, in vivo experiments showed that the R115A mutation fully abolished the chemotaxis of A. fabrum toward formic acid.

During development innate immunity is the first to become functional and is mediated primarily by phagocytic cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. In the olfactory sensory system, the same sensory neurons in contact with the external environment have their first synapse within the central nervous system. This unique architecture presents a potential gateway for the entry of damaging or infectious agents to the nervous system. Here we used zebrafish as a model system to examine the development of the olfactory organ and to determine whether it shares immune characteristics of a host defense niche described in other tissues. During early development, both neutrophils and macrophages appear coincident with the generation of the primitive immune cells. The appearance of neutrophils and macrophages in the olfactory organs occurs as the blood and lymphatic vascular system is forming in the same region.

In contrast, macrophages, although present in greater numbers, mount a slower response to damage. We anticipate our findings will open new avenues of research into the role of the olfactory-immune response during normal neurogenesis and damage-induced regeneration and contribute to our understanding of the formation of a potential host defense immune niche in the peripheral nervous system.","output":"The Olfactory Organ Is Populated by Neutrophils and Macrophages During Early Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid 19 pandemic is the first major crisis facing cryptocurrencies Therefore, the reaction of the cryptocurrency markets is important News about epidemics affects investors' decisions Panic index (PIndex) is an index created from news about the Covid 19 outbreak In the study, it is used to measure the impact of decisions on the crypto money market As cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), Etherium (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), which have the highest transaction volume in the crypto money market, are included in the analysis The relationship between Panic Index and the three major cryptocurrencies with the largest share in the cryptocurrency market was investigated by Ardl and Hatemi-J asymmetric causality test Traditional causality tests acknowledge that the effects of positive and negative changes are the same However, there may be asymmetric information and different investor behaviors in financial markets In the study, Hatemi-J [1] Asymmetric Causality Test was conducted to examine the asymmetric relationship and symmetric relationship between Pindex and cryptocurrencies by separating them into positive and negative shocks According to the results of the Hatemi-J causality analysis, positive shocks in the panic index are the cause of negative shocks for all cryptocurrencies In other words, increases in the panic index are caused to fall the value of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple cryptocurrencies decrease The results show that cryptocurrencies were not a safe haven for the investor during the Covid 19 period, as they acted similarly to other financial assets ?

Early during the pandemic, the clinic adopted a new model of service delivery utilizing telemedicine primary care visits, followed by in-person visits when necessary. As the pandemic progressed, clinic staff strategized to provide increased pandemic-related support to agricultural employers and migrant farmworkers across the state. Emphasis was placed on on-site testing and education regarding social distancing, mask utilization, and hand washing. Eventually, as migrant workers were infected and became symptomatic, more complex mitigation strategies such as isolation, quarantine, and clinical follow-up were also implemented.

Airborne transmission is a vital route of disease infection caused by bacteria and virus. However, tracing methods of airborne bacteria in both lab and field research failed to veritably express the transporting process of microorganism in the air. A new tracing method of airborne bacteria used for airborne transmission was put forward and demonstrated its feasibility by conducting a field evaluation on the basis of genetic modification and bioaerosol technology. A specific gene fragment (pFPV-mCherry fluorescent protein plasmid) was introduced into nonpathogenic E. coli DH5 as tracer bacteria by high-voltage electroporation. Gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing proved the success of the synthesis. Genetic stability, effect of aerosolization on the survival rate of tracer bacteria, and the application of the tracer bacteria to the airborne bacteria transmission were examined in both lab and field. Both the introduced plasmid stability rates of tracer E. coli in pre-aerosolization and post-aerosolization were above 95% in five test days. Survival rate of tracer E. coli at 97.5%  1.2% through aerosolization was obtained by an air-atomizer operated at an air pressure of 30 Psi. In the field experiment, the airborne transmission of E. coli between poultry houses was proved and emitted E. coli was more easily transmitted into self-house than adjacent house due to the ventilation design and weather condition.

We assessed the association between RVD and mortality in COVID-19 patients. We searched electronic databases from inception to February 15, 2021. RVD was defined based on the following echocardiographic variables: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), tricuspid S? peak systolic velocity, fractional area change (FAC), and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS). All meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. Nineteen cohort studies involving 2307 patients were included. The mean age ranged from 59 to 72?years and 65% of patients were male. TAPSE (mean difference [MD], ?3.13?mm;95% confidence interval [CI], ?4.08??2.19), tricuspid S? peak systolic velocity (MD, ?0.88?cm/s;95% CI, ?1.68 to ?0.08), FAC (MD, ?3.47%;95% CI, ?6.21 to ?0.72), and RVFWLS (MD, ?5.83%;95% CI, ?7.47??4.20) were significantly lower in nonsurvivors compared to survivors.

The infection by RNA virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV, from beta class of corona viruses has been found to be responsible for COVID-19. Structural analysis and evidences have been indicated that interaction between a segment of receptor binding domain (RBD) from S protein of virus and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is essential for cellular entry of virus. OBJECTIVE: The current review put the light on structural aspects for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction mediated cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The present study provides a critical review of recently published information on RBD-hACE2 interaction and its inhibitors to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review highlighted the structural aspects of interaction between RBDhACE2 and involved amino acid residues. RESULTS: Recently, several studies are being conducted for inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry to the human cellular system. One of the important targets for viral invasion is its binding with cell surface receptor, hACE2, through RBD on S-protein. Mimicking of three residues on ACE2 (Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain) provided hot target directed strategy for inhibition of early attachment of virus to the cell. Early screening of peptidic or non-peptidic molecules for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction has been raised the hope for potential therapeutics against COVID-19. The higher affinity of molecules toward RBD than ACE2 is important factor for selectivity and minimization of ACE2 related adverse events on cardiovascular system, brain, kidney, and foetus development during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction by different molecular scaffolds can be used as a preferred strategy for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, published reports pointed out Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain of ACE2 as crucial residues for mimicking and design of novel molecules as inhibitors SARS-CoV-2 attachment to human cells. Moreover, some recently identified RBD-hACE2 interaction inhibitors have also been described with their protein binding pattern and potencies (IC50 values) which will help for further improvement in the selectivity.","output":"Inhibition of S-protein RBD and hACE2 Interaction for Control of SARSCoV-2 Infection (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We studied the volatility and cross-sectional return dispersion effect of S&P Health Care Sector under the covid-19 epidemic.

Among the challenges in developing international standards for medical education is the variation in program models, with some regions offering six-year bachelors degrees and others, including North America, customarily requiring a bachelors degree prior to admission to a 4-year graduate-level degree program. This study sought to determine the applicability of the USA Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accreditation standards internationally as the foundation for program development, quality improvement, and program evaluation in a program that follows the North American medical education model in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). METHODS: Using a qualitative political, economic, sociocultural, technological, legal, and environmental (PESTLE) analysis framework, we systematically assessed the applicability of each of the 93 LCME accreditation elements to the nascent doctor of medicine (MD) degree program at Khalifa University. RESULTS: All 93 elements in the most current LCME accreditation standards were deemed applicable internationally in a program developed in accordance with the North American model of medical education. Of these, three elements were deemed applicable with caveats in the legal or regulatory processes required to achieve comparable compliance outside of the USA. No elements were deemed not applicable in an international setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates that the LCME accreditation standards are model-specific and can be effectively applied internationally in programs that follow the North American model of medical education. Countries in which no specialized medical education accrediting body exists can apply the LCME standards and achieve international benchmarks of quality in medical education through rigorous self-assessment and continuous quality improvement.","output":"Applying North American medical education accreditation standards internationally in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Effectiveness of restricting healthcare providers (HCPs) from working based on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-like symptoms should be evaluated.

RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was tested using transcriptase quantitative PCR, and the total antibodies (Ab), IgG, IgA and IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 were tested using Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immuno Assay. Results Among 56 patients without symptoms at admission, 33 cases displayed symptoms and 23 remained asymptomatic throughout the follow-up period. 43.8% of the asymptomatic carriers were children and none of the asymptomatic cases had recognizable changes in C-reactive protein or interleukin-6, except one 64-year-old patient. The initial threshold cycle value of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers was similar to that in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients, but the communicable period of asymptomatic carriers (9.63 days) was shorter than pre-symptomatic patients (13.6 days). There was no obvious differences of the seropositive conversion rate of total Ab, IgG, and IgA among the three groups, though the rates of IgM varied largely.

Autophagy is a degradative process with a crucial anti-viral role; however, several viruses subvert this pathway in their benefit. We determined the role of autophagy in JUNV-infected cells analyzing LC3, a cytoplasmic protein (LC3-I) which becomes vesicle membrane-associated (LC3-II) upon induction of autophagy. Cells overexpressing EGFP-LC3 and infected with JUNV showed an increased number of LC3 puncta structures, similar to that obtained after starvation- or Bafilomycin A1- treatment which leads to autophagosome induction or accumulation, respectively. We also monitored the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II observing LC3-II levels in JUNV-infected cells similar to that observed in starved cells. Additionally, we kinetically studied the number of LC3 dots after JUNV infection and found that the virus activated the pathway as early as 2 h p.i. whereas the UV-inactivated virus did not induce the pathway. Cells subjected to starvation or pre-treated with rapamycin, a pharmacological autophagy inductor, enhanced virus yield. Also, we assayed the replication capacity of JUNV in Atg 5 knock-out or Beclin-1 knock-down cells [both critical components of the autophagic pathway] and found a significant decrease in JUNV replication. Taken together, our results constitute the first study indicating that JUNV infection induces an autophagic response which is functionally required by the virus for efficient propagation.IMPORTANCEMammalian arenaviruses are zoonotic viruses causing asymptomatic and persistent infections in their rodent hosts, but may produce severe and lethal haemorrhagic fevers in humans. Currently, there are neither effective therapeutic options nor effective vaccines, for viral haemorrhagic fevers caused by human pathogenic arenaviruses, except the vaccine Candid #1 against AHF, licensed for human use in endemic areas from Argentina. Since arenaviruses remain a severe threat to global public health, more in-depth knowledge of their replication mechanisms would improve our ability to fight against these viruses. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway involved in maintaining the cellular homeostasis, representing powerful anti-infective machinery.

This search included case reports or case series published up until 17th June 2020 in English or Portuguese. After reading the articles available in their entirety, those related specifically to the potential risks of vertical transmission of COVID-19 during pregnancy were selected.

RESULTS: Pregnancy can make women more susceptible to infections, especially by viral pathogens, given the various physiological and immunological changes that occur to maintain maternal-fetal balance. It is speculated that the fetus may be a possible target for COVID-19. Few studies (3 out of 15) in our analysis have found positive results for SARS-CoV-2 in fetal membranes, placenta, and in newborns right after birth.

Our findings seem to demonstrate that vertical transmission is possible but quite unusual.","output":"Current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission: an integrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is currently no single treatment that mitigates all harms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 antagonist, may have a role as adjunctive immune-modulating therapy. METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective study of hospitalized adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. The intervention group comprised patients who received tocilizumab; the comparator arm was drawn from patients who did not receive tocilizumab. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality censored at 28 days; secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at discharge, time to clinical improvement, and rates of secondary infections. Marginal structural Cox models via inverse probability treatment weights were applied to estimate the effect of tocilizumab. Time-dependent propensity score matching method was used to generate a 1:1 match for tocilizumab recipients; infectious diseases experts then manually reviewed these matched charts to identify secondary infections. RESULTS: This analysis included 90 tocilizumab recipients and 1669 controls. Under the marginal structural Cox model, tocilizumab was associated with a 62% reduced hazard of death (aHR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21-0.70) and no change in time to clinical improvement (aHR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.68-1.87). The 1:1 matched dataset also showed a lower mortality rate (27.8% vs. 34.4%) and reduced hazards of death (aHR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.25-0.88). Elevated inflammatory markers were associated with reduced hazards of death among tocilizumab recipients compared to controls. Secondary infection rates were similar between the two groups.

Such evidence is part of understanding of infectivity and reinfection. We examine direct measures of viral shedding using a linked population-based health administrative dataset. METHODS: Laboratory and sociodemographic databases for Ontario, Canada were linked to identify those testing positive (RT-PCR) between Jan. 15 and April 30, 2020 who underwent subsequent testing by May 31, 2020. To maximise use of available data, we computed two shedding duration estimates defined as the time between initial positive and most recent positive (documented shedding) or second of two negative tests (documented resolution). We also report multivariable results using quantile regression to examine subgroup differences. RESULTS: In Ontario, of the 16,595 who tested positive before April 30, 2020, 6604 had sufficient subsequent testing to allow shedding duration calculation. Documented shedding median duration calculated in 4,889 (29% of 16,595) patients was 19 days (IQR 12C28). Documented resolution median duration calculated in 3,219 (19% of the 16,595) patients was 25 days (IQR 18C34). Long-term care residents had 3C5 day longer shedding durations using both definitions. Shorter documented shedding durations of 2C4 days were observed in those living in higher income neighbourhoods. Shorter documented resolution durations of 2C3 days were observed at the 25(th)% of the distribution in those aged 20C49. Only 11.5% of those with definitive negative test results reverted to negative status by day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Viral shedding continued well beyond 14 days among this large subset of a population-based group with COVID-19, and longer still for long-term care residents and those living in less affluent neighborhoods. Our findings do not speak to duration of infectivity but are useful for understanding the expected duration of RT-PCR positivity and for identifying reinfection.","output":"Duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding: A population-based, Canadian study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, on December 30, 2019, the number of confirmed cases of the disease has increased continuously and exponentially The event has emerged as a clear threat to global health, such that the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 The disease has infected approximately 1,891,000 people and killed around 50,200 in the Eastern Mediterranean region until 29th August 2020 As COVID-19 spreads globally, its economic consequences are also mounting across all countries In this perspective study, we briefly discuss the economic consequences of COVID-19 in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region countries ? 2020, Journal of Advances in Medical and Biomedical Research All rights reserved","output":"Economic consequences of COVID-19 in the middle east and north Africa region countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) progressed to a full-fledged outbreak, primarily in New York City in March 2020.

The mice were exposed intranasally to 103 median tissue culture infectious doses of MHV-JHM on the third day of interferon treatment. Two days after virus exposure, the proportion of mice with MHV in nasal turbinates was reduced from 10 of 10 in the untreated group to 7 of 10 in the interferon-treated group, and mean titers in virus-containing noses were lower in the interferon-treated group.

Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA). Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses. Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR. Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.510(7) copies/mL versus a median of 3.010(4) copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P<0.001).

METHODS: This observational study was conducted in seven Helsinki region hospitals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. The study used data on all non-COVID-19 inpatients, who were initially isolated due to suspected COVID-19, to estimate whether isolation precautions resulted in diagnostic or treatment delays. RESULTS: Out of 683 non-COVID-19 patients, 33 (4.8%) had delays related to isolation precautions. Clinical condition deteriorated non-fatally in seven (1.0%) patients. The following events were associated with an increased risk of treatment or a diagnostic delay: more than three ward transfers (P = 0.025); referral to an incorrect speciality in the emergency department (P = 0.004); more than three SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests performed (P = 0.022); and where cancer was the final diagnosis (P = 0.018).

The mean time interval from the onset of the symptoms to antiviral treatment was 10.63{+/-}0.56 days. Thirty deceased patients (78.9%) were men, showing 2.8 times higher mortality chance compared to women (ORadj=2.77; 95%CI=1.08-7.09). The type of respiratory support on the first day of treatment initiation showed a significantly lower mortality chance in patients receiving O2 only than those who needed non-invasive and/or mechanical ventilation (ORadj=3.91; 95%CI=1.64-9.32). The start time (early vs late administration) and duration (less or more than 7 days) of antiviral treatment had no statistically significant association with mortality or ventilation escalation among the patients (p-value > 0.05).

The systematic search was conducted in Google Scholar, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and PubMed in October of 2020, to determine the current evidence and observations concerning the Internet-based addictive behaviors amid COVID-19. Studies were included if they considered the Internet-based addictive behaviors during the current pandemic. We used all the names of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common Internet-based addictive behaviors, namely Internet addiction, online gaming disorder, online gambling disorder, pornography use, and smartphone use disorder. The study design is PEOs, finding if individuals' exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors.

We present the first immunopathological evaluation of a lung allograft rejection in a patient who underwent LT because of irreversible ARDS related to COVID-19. Methods Two male patients with irreversible ARDS caused by COVID-19 underwent bilateral LT at our Institution. A surveillance transbronchial biopsy (TBB) was performed 2 months after LT in the first patient (Pt#1), while the second patient (Pt#2) died because of allograft rejection at day 62 post LT and explanted lungs were retrieved. CT imaging of the lungs was performed three days before death. Morphological examination was performed by H&E, whereas the immunophenotyping was performed by immunohistochemistry. Results Imaging and morphological examination of Pt#2 lungs indicated the presence of a graft dysfunction with features of a restrictive, widespread usual interstitial pneumonia-like syndrome (Fig. 1A, B). The immunophenotyping showed that B-lymphocytes (CD20-positive) were nearly absent, CD8-T-cells were not particularly expanded (mean positive cells within the lung stroma=13.8%; Fig. 1C), and the CD4/CD8 ratio was not decreased (Fig. 1D). The T-regs (Foxp3-positive) were 6% of the overall population (Fig. 1E). Analysis of the immune checkpoint molecules PD1, Tigit, CTLA4 and PDL1 showed that the expression of PD-L1 alone was highly increased in vases and in alveolar cells of rejected lungs, whereas it was nearly undetectable in the TBB from Pt#1 (Fig. 1F, G). Conclusion PDL1 expression in vases was previously documented as a sign of indirect ARDS.

Also, chemical modification of nucleic acids has emerged as an alternative to impart stability to ONs against nucleases and other degrading enzymes and proteins found in blood. In addition to chemically modifying the nucleic acids directly, another strategy that has emerged, involves conjugating polymers/peptide/aptamers/antibodies/proteins, preferably to the sense strand (3'end) of siRNAs. Conjugation to the siRNA not only enhances the stability and targeting specificity of the siRNA, but also allows for the development of self-administering siRNA formulations, with a much smaller size than what is usually observed for nanoparticle (200nm).

Here we report a pilot open-label trial of a third dose of BBIBP-CorV, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cell), on 136 participants aged between 18 to 63 years. Safety and immunogenicity in terms of neutralizing antibody titers and cytokine/chemokine responses were analyzed as the main endpoint until day 28. While systemic reactogenicity was either absent or mild, SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody titers rapidly arose in all participants within 4 weeks, surpassing the peak antibody titers elicited by the initial two-dose immunization regime. Broad increases of cellular immunity-associated cytokines and chemokines were also detected in the majority of participants after the third vaccination.

Apart from the wide range, the relation between method of assessment and prevalence is not well established. Our objective was to establish the overall prevalence of non-adherence in the apparent treatment resistant hypertension population, explore causes of heterogeneity, and evaluate the effect of the method of assessment on the estimate of non-adherence. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. MEDLINE, EMBASE Classic+EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles.

It has also been suggested that the products of EGCG decomposition by the intestinal microbiota promote the differentiation of nerve cells and that both EGCG and its degradation products act on nerve cells with a time lag. On the other hand, the free amino acids theanine and arginine contained in green tea have stress-reducing effects. While long-term stress accelerates the aging of the brain, theanine and arginine suppress the aging of the brain due to their anti-stress effect. Since this effect is counteracted by EGCG and caffeine, the ratios between these green tea components are important for the anti-stress action.

The comparison of different samples requires the transformation of data through a process called normalisation. Reference or housekeeping genes are candidate genes which are selected on the basis of constitutive expression across samples, and allow the quantification of changes in gene expression. At present, no reference gene has been identified for any organism which is universally optimal for use across different tissue types or disease situations. We used microarray data to identify new reference genes generated from total RNA isolated from normal and osteoarthritic canine articular tissues (bone, ligament, cartilage, synovium and fat). RT-qPCR assays were designed and applied to each different articular tissue. Reference gene expression stability and ranking was compared using three different mathematical algorithms. RESULTS: Twelve new potential reference genes were identified from microarray data. One gene (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 [MRPS7]) was stably expressed in all five of the articular tissues evaluated. One gene HIRA interacting protein 5 isoform 2 [HIRP5]) was stably expressed in four of the tissues evaluated. A commonly used reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was not stably expressed in any of the tissues evaluated. Most consistent agreement between rank ordering of reference genes was observed between Bestkeeper? and geNorm, although each method tended to agree on the identity of the most stably expressed genes and the least stably expressed genes for each tissue. New reference genes identified using microarray data normalised in a conventional manner were more stable than those identified by microarray data normalised by using a real-time RT-qPCR methodology. CONCLUSION: Microarray data normalised by a conventional manner can be filtered using a simple stepwise procedure to identify new reference genes, some of which will demonstrate good measures of stability. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 is a new reference gene worthy of investigation in other canine tissues and diseases. Different methods of reference gene stability assessment will generally agree on the most and least stably expressed genes, when co-regulation is not present.","output":"Identification of new reference genes for the normalisation of canine osteoarthritic joint tissue transcripts from microarray data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People are assumed to represent themselves in terms of body ownership and agency. Studies using the rubber- or virtual-hand illusion have assessed ownership and agency by means of explicit ownership and agency ratings and implicit measures, like proprioceptive drift in the case of ownership. These measures often show similar effects but also some discrepancies, suggesting that they rely on data sources that overlap, but not completely. To systematically assess commonalities and discrepancies, we adopted an immersed virtual hand illusion (VHI) design, in which three independent factors were manipulated: the synchrony between the movement of real and virtual effector, the type of effector, which was a virtual hand or triangle, and the spatial congruency between the real and virtual effector. Commonalities and discrepancies in the effects of these factors were assessed by crossing explicit and implicit measures for ownership and agency. While standard ratings were used as explicit measures, implicit ownership was assessed by means of proprioceptive drift and implicit agency by means of intentional binding. Results showed similar effect patterns for the two agency measures, which, however, were not correlated, different effect patterns for the two ownership measures, and a strong correlation between the two explicit measures. Taken altogether, our findings suggest that explicit and implicit measures of ownership and agency partly rely on shared informational sources, but seem to differ with respect to other sources that are integrated or with respect to the processed dimension (shape vs. time). The findings also suggest that some findings obtained with RHI designs might reflect more the unnatural situation that that design puts individuals into rather than generalizable mechanisms of computing perceived ownership and agency.","output":"Explicit and implicit measures of body ownership and agency: affected by the same manipulations and yet independent."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We used a longitudinal cohort of U.S. adults who were current or former smokers to explore how three participant-reported factors - general stress, COVID-19 distress, and perceived risk of complications from COVID-19 related to smoking - were associated with changes in smoking status. METHODS: Smoking status was assessed at three time points. Timepoint 1 status was assessed at a prior study completion (2018-2020). Timepoint 2 (start of the pandemic) and Timepoint 3 (early phase of the pandemic) statuses were assessed using an additional survey in 2020. After classifying participants into eight groups per these time points, we compared the means of participant-reported factors and used a linear regression model to adjust for covariates. RESULTS: Participants (n=392) were mostly female (73.9%) and non-Hispanic White (70.1%). Between Timepoints 2 and 3, abstinence rates decreased by 11%, and 40% of participants reported a smoking status change. Among those reporting a change and the highest general stress levels, newly abstinent participants had higher perceived risk of complications from COVID-19 related to smoking than those who relapsed during pandemic (mean (standard deviation): 14.2 (3.3) vs. 12.6 (3.8)). Compared to participants who sustained smoking, those who sustained abstinence, on average, scored 1.94 less on the general stress scale (betaeta Coefficient (beta): -1.94, p-value <0.01) and 1.37 less on the perceived risk of complications from COVID-19 related to smoking scale (beta: -1.37, p-value 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased abstinence rates are concerning. Patterns of reported factors were as expected for individuals who sustained their smoking behavior but not for those who changed. IMPLICATIONS: We observed an increase in smoking rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. In exploring how combinations of general stress levels, COVID-19 distress levels, and perceived risk of complications from COVID-19 related to smoking were associated with changes in smoking, we observed expected patterns of these factors among individuals who sustained abstinence or smoking. Among individuals who changed smoking status and reported high stress levels, those who reported a higher perceived risk of complications from COVID-19 related to smoking abstained from smoking. In contrast, those who reported a lower perceived risk of complications from COVID-19 related to smoking, started smoking. An intersectional perspective may be needed to understand smokers' pandemic-related behavior changes.","output":"Characterizing pandemic-related changes in smoking over time in a cohort of current and former smokers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In January, Mologic, embarked on a product development pathway for COVID-19 diagnostics focusing on ELISA and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), with anticipated funding from Wellcome Trust and DFID. 755 clinical samples from known COVID-19 patients and hospital negative controls were tested on Mologics IgG ELISA.

It is essential to establish a sensitive and high-throughput neutralization assay to understand the epidemiology of Vaccinia-specific immunity in current populations in China. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A new anti-Vaccinia virus (VACV) neutralization assay that used the attenuated replication-competent VTT carrying the firefly luciferase gene of Photinus pyralis (rTV-Fluc) was established and standardized for critical parameters that included the choice of cell line, viral infection dose, and the infection time. The current study evaluated the maintenance of virus-specific immunity after smallpox vaccination by conducting a non-randomized, cross-sectional analysis of antiviral antibody-mediated immune responses in volunteers examined 30C55 years after vaccination. The rTV-Fluc neutralization assay was able to detect neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against Vaccinia virus without the ability to differentiate strains of Vaccinia virus. We showed that the neutralizing titers measured by our assay were similar to those obtained by the traditional plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Using this assay, we found a low prevalence of NAb to VTT (7.6%) in individuals born before 1980 from Beijing and Anhui provinces in China, and when present, anti-VTT NAb titers were low. No NAbs were detected in all 222 samples from individuals born after 1980. There was no significant difference observed for titer or prevalence by gender, age range and geographic origin. CONCLUSION: A simplified, sensitive, standardized, reproducible, and high-throughput assay was developed for the quantitation of NAbs against different Vaccinia strains. The current study provides useful insights for the future development of VTT-based vaccination in Beijing and Anhui provinces of China.","output":"A Novel High-Throughput Vaccinia Virus Neutralization Assay and Preexisting Immunity in Populations from Different Geographic Regions in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Intraperitoneal mesh implantation is often associated with formation of adhesion to the mesh. This experimental study examines the potential of minimally invasive pneumoperitoneal-MRI to assess these adhesions in a preclinical context. METHODS Uncoated polyethylene terephthalate meshes were placed intraperitoneally in rats, in regard to the caecum previously scraped to promote petechial bleeding and subsequent adhesions. Examinations were performed 2-weeks post mesh implantation using a rodent dedicated high field MRI. Respiratory-triggered T2-weighted images were acquired prior to and after intraperitoneal injection of ~8-10 mL gas to induce a mechanical stress on the abdominal wall. RESULTS Adhesions are occasionally seen in sham-operated rats as opposed to rats receiving polyethylene terephthalate meshes. On high-resolution images, meshes can be detected due to their characteristic net shape. However, evidence of adherence is only found if intraperitoneal gas injection is performed, when a ~1-cm elevation of the abdominal wall is observed. When adherence occurs between the mesh and the caecum, the latter remains in contact with the wall. Looser adherences between visceral tissue and meshes are also observed. CONCLUSIONS T2-weighted pneumoperitoneal-MRI is a powerful tool for assessing adherence after intraperitoneal mesh implantation. According to the mini-invasive procedure adopted here, this approach may allow a temporal follow-up of adherence fate.","output":"Imaging visceral adhesion to polymeric mesh using pneumoperitoneal-MRI in an experimental rat model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) is one of the most rapidly progressing tumors, with a bad prognosis and no standard-of-care treatment.

METHODS Data from flight itineraries for travellers who flew from Mexico were used to estimate the number of international airports where health screening measures would have been needed, and the number of travellers who would have had to be screened, to assess all air travellers who could have transported the H1N1 influenza virus out of Mexico during the initial stages of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. FINDINGS Exit screening at 36 airports in Mexico, or entry screening of travellers arriving on direct flights from Mexico at 82 airports in 26 other countries, would have resulted in the assessment of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico at the start of the pandemic. Entry screening of 116 travellers arriving from Mexico by direct or connecting flights would have been necessary for every one traveller at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09. Screening at just eight airports would have resulted in the assessment of 90% of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico in the early stages of the pandemic.

Children are known to experience more infections with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) compared to adults. Little is known whether HCoV infections lead to cross-reactive anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. METHODS: We investigated the presence of cross-reactive antiCSARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies to spike 1 (S1), S1-receptor-binding domain (S1-RBD), and nucleocapsid protein (NP) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and neutralizing activity by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, in prepandemic sera collected from children (n = 50) and adults (n = 45), and compared with serum samples from convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 16). RESULTS: A significant proportion of children (up to 40%) had detectable cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S1, S1-RBD, and NP antigens, and the anti-S1 and antiCS1-RBD antibody levels correlated with antiCHCoV-HKU1 and antiCHCoV-OC43 S1 antibody titers in prepandemic samples (P < .001). There were marked increases of antiCHCoV-HKU1 and - OC43 S1 (but not anti-NL63 and -229E S1-RBD) antibody titers in serum samples from convalescent COVID-19 patients (P < .001), indicating an activation of cross-reactive immunological memory to -coronavirus spike. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated cross-reactive antiCSARS-CoV-2 antibodies in prepandemic serum samples from children and young adults. Promoting this cross-reactive immunity and memory response derived from common HCoV may be an effective strategy against SARS-COV-2 and future novel coronaviruses.","output":"Detection of Serum Cross-Reactive Antibodies and Memory Response to SARS-CoV-2 in Prepandemic and PostCCOVID-19 Convalescent Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely rapidly spreading respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Many schizophrenic patients were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province. This study took hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 as the research subjects and observed the changes in psychopathology and stress of patients with COVID-19 and the accompanying social isolation. Methods: To sort and isolate potential COVID-19-infected patients, an isolated ward was set up from January 30, 2020, to March 30, 2020. Schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 were referred to this ward, and long-term hospitalized cases were included in this study. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Perceived Stress Scale were used to evaluate the severity of mental symptoms and psychological stress in the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, after the diagnosis of COVID-19 and after recovery. At the time of diagnosis, we also extracted the patient's routine blood, biochemical and other indicators and asked the patient's perception of COVID-19. Results: 21 hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 were recruited in this study. The changes in PANSS scores were not significant (p = 0.225 baseline vs. diagnosed, p = 0.399 cured vs. diagnosed). The CPSS scores increased significantly after diagnosis and transfer to the isolation ward (p < 0.001 baseline vs. diagnosed, p < 0.001 cured vs. diagnosed). The course of schizophrenia was a protective factor of stress levels to cases (t = ?3.25, p = 0.006), and patients' perception of COVID-19 was a risk factor (t = 2.48, p = 0.038). The final multiple linear regression model was statistically significant (F = 8.16, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 had increased stress levels and negative symptoms but alleviated positive symptoms after medical isolated treatment.

A. Kanso, Phys. Fluids 32, 113101 (2020)]. We did so by beading the capsid and then also by replacing each of its bulbous spikes with a single bead. However, each coronavirus spike is a glycoprotein trimer, and each spike bulb is triangular. In this work, we replace each bulbous coronavirus spike with a bead triplet, where each bead of the triplet is charged identically. This paper, thus, explores the role of bulb triangularity on the rotational diffusivity, an effect not previously considered. We thus use energy minimization for the spreading of triangular bulbs over the spherical capsid. The latter both translates and twists the coronavirus spikes relative to one another, and we then next arrive at the rotational diffusivity of the coronavirus particle in suspension, from first principles.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I, typically 6-8 sessions) has been shown to reduce trauma-related nightmares. Brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBTI, 4 sessions) has been found to be comparable to CBT-I in decreasing insomnia severity; however, the effects of BBTI on nightmares have not been investigated. The current study tested the effects of BBTI on both trauma-related nightmares and non-trauma-related bad dreams using an active control group, progressive muscle relaxation therapy (PMRT). Additionally, we tested whether baseline trauma-related nightmare frequency and baseline non-trauma-related bad dream frequency moderated changes in insomnia severity. METHODS: Participants were 91 military veterans with insomnia disorder randomized to BBTI or PMRT. Participants reported insomnia severity on the Insomnia Severity Index and reported trauma-related nightmare frequency and non-trauma-related bad dream frequency on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index--PTSD Addendum. RESULTS: We found that BBTI significantly reduced trauma-related nightmares from baseline to post-treatment while PMRT did not. However, reductions in trauma-related nightmares were not maintained at six month follow up. Neither BBTI nor PMRT reduced non-trauma-related bad dreams from baseline to post-treatment. We also found that neither baseline trauma-related nightmare frequency nor baseline non-trauma-related bad dream frequency moderated changes in insomnia symptom severity.

Nucleic acid amplification testing or gene sequencing can serve as pathogenic evidence of COVID-19 diagnosing for clinically suspected cases, and dynamic monitoring of specific antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG) is an effective complement for false-negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Antigen tests to identify SARS-CoV-2 are recommended in the first week of infection, which is associated with high viral loads. Additionally, many clinical laboratory indicators are abnormal as the disease evolves. For example, from moderate to severe and critical cases, leukocytes, neutrophils, and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio increase; conversely, lymphocytes decrease progressively but are over activated. LDH, AST, ALT, CK, high-sensitivity troponin I, and urea also increase progressively, and increased D-dimer is an indicator of severe disease and an independent risk factor for death.

Several studies have been conducted to explore different markers associated with CRCI to understand its pathobiology. It is proposed that the underlying mechanisms of CRCI are related to a cascade of physiological adaptive events in response to cancer and/or treatment. Hence, peripheral blood would be a logical source to observe and identify these physiological events. This paper outlines the protocol for a scoping review being conducted to summarise the extant literature regarding blood-based biomarkers of CRCI among patients with non-CNS cancer. METHODS/ANALYSIS Methods will be informed by the updated guidelines of Arksey and O'Malley. The systematic search for literature will include electronic databases, handsearching of key journals and reference lists, forward citation tracking and consultation with content experts. Study selection will be confirmed by duplicate review and calculation of inter-rater reliability. Data to be charted will include study design, sample size, cancer and treatment characteristics, demographic characteristics, cognitive variable/s and biomarkers assessed, associations between cognitive functioning and biomarkers (including statistics used), and rigour in biomarker sample collection and processing. Results will be presented through: (1) a descriptive numerical summary of studies, including a flow diagram based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement, (2) a list of blood-based biomarkers associated with CRCI and (3) a narrative overview developed through collaboration among the research team and consultation with content experts.

The proposed method consists of two modules, contrastive self-supervised learning module extracting features from labeled and unlabeled data and partial label propagation module generating confident pseudo-labels through label propagation. For contrastive learning, we propose an improved twins network model by adding multiple projector layers and the contrastive loss term. Meanwhile, we adopt strong and weak data augmentation to increase the diversity of the dataset and the robustness of the model. For the partial label propagation module, we interrupt the label propagation process according to the quality of pseudo-labels and improve the impact of high-quality pseudo-labels. The performance of our algorithm on three standard baseline datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and miniImageNet is better than previous state-of-the-art transductive deep semi-supervised learning methods.

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposed a novel decentralized method, Human-in-the-loop Based Swarm Learning (HBSL), to integrate user feedback into the loop of learning and inference for recognizing fake news without violating user privacy in a decentralized manner. It consists of distributed nodes that are able to independently learn and detect fake news on local data.

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, older adults were advised to keep isolated and maintain social distancing. Lockdown periods in England may have led to increased isolation and loneliness in older people, possibly resulting in an increased rates of DSH and suicide. This study aimed to explore whether numbers of older adults referred to liaison services with deliberate self harm changed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHOD: Reason for referral and total number of referrals to liaison services for older adults data were collected across 6 mental health trusts who had access to robust data sets. Data were collected prospectively for three months from the start of the UK national lockdown and for the corresponding 3 month period in 2019, via trust reporting systems. This study was registered as service evaluation within each of the participating mental health trusts. RESULT: Overall numbers of referrals to older adult liaison services went down, but the proportion of referrals for older adults with DSH increased. Across the six mental health trusts there there were a total of 2167 referrals over the first three month lockdown period in 2020, and 170 (7.84%) of these referrals were for deliberate self harm. During a corresponding time period in 2019, there were a total of 3416 referrals and 155 (4.54%) of these referrals were for deliberate self harm CONCLUSION: Although numbers of referrals for older adults with delberate self harm appeared to stay the same, the severity of these presentations is not clear. Outcomes of referrals and severity of self harm could be explored by examining individual case records.

The aim of this study was to investigate test performance of both tests for significant bowel disease in those patients referred. DESIGN: All adult patients with simultaneous measurements of f-Hb and f-Cal between April 2019 and September 2020 were included. For those referred, outcomes were determined from clinical records. RESULTS: 650 patients with simultaneous samples for f-Hb an f-Cal were managed in Primary Care; 319 patients were referred to hospital; SBD was found in 32 (10.0%) (CRC 5, high risk adenomas 5, IBD 22). At a cut-off of 10 g/g for f-Hb and 200 g/g for f-Cal, the sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value for diagnosis of SBD were 84.4%, 58.2% and 96.7% and 68.8%, 89.6% and 95.7%, respectively. Performance of both tests would have enabled diagnosis of two more cases of significant, but non-malignant, bowel disease but required over 4% more referrals for investigation.

METHODS: Dog and cat ownership data were collected from 11233 community-dwelling adults age 65 years and older. These data were matched with data about the onset of disability held by the Japanese long-term care insurance system. Local registry data were used to ascertain all-cause mortality. RESULTS: During the approximately 3.5 year follow-up period, 17.1% of the sample suffered onset of disability, and 5.2% died.

Until safe and efficacious vaccines or antiviral drugs become widely available, viral testing remains the primary mitigation measure for rapid identification and isolation of infected cases. Methods: We evaluate the economic tradeoffs of expanding and accelerating SARS-CoV-2 testing using a multi-scale model that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and daily viral load dynamics at the individual level. Findings: Assuming a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per year of life lost (YLL) and a price of $5 per test, the strategy most likely to be cost-effective under a rapid transmission scenario (Re > 2) is daily testing followed by a one-week rather than two-week isolation period subsequent to test confirmation. Under lower transmission scenarios, weekly testing of the population is expected to be more cost effective. Expanded surveillance testing is expected to be cost effective if the price per test is less than $400 across all transmission rates considered. Interpretation: Extensive expansion of testing coupled with isolation of confirmed cases is essential for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, resources recouped from shortened isolation duration could be cost-effectively allocated to more frequent testing.Funding Statement: US National Institutes of Health and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests.Ethics Approval Statement: Not applicable.","output":"Comparative Cost-Effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 Testing Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability of antibodies and Fc-fusion proteins to bind multiple targets cooperatively is limited by their topology.

Classical diagnostic measures like Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are not applicable for mutations in the DNAH11 gene since ultrastructural defects of the ciliary apparatus are absent. Novel mutations encoding for PCD appear all the time with considerable variation in the clinical picture, making it necessary to update data bases and guidelines for PCD diagnostics. METHODS: In this study we examined two unrelated, Finnish families with symptoms of PCD applying the clinical scoring system: Primary ciliary dyskinesia Rule (PICADAR), high speed video microscopy analysis (HSVMA) for ciliary movement, a commercially available gene panel analysis and nasal Nitric Oxide (nNO) measurements if applicable. RESULTS: Two, likely pathogenic variants in the DNAH11 gene (c.2341G > A, p. (Glu781Lys) ja c.7645 + 5G > A) were detected.

In the second family, all three children were homozygotes for the c.2341G > A p.(Glu781Lys) mutation and showed a similar degree of disease severity. However, the phenotype of cilia beating pattern was different ranging from stiff, static cilia to a hyperkinetic movement in one of these children. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we describe two Finnish families with PCD, revealing two novel mutations in the DNAH11 gene which show considerable variety in the clinical and beating cilia phenotype. The results of this study show the clinician that PCD can be much milder than generally expected and diagnosis demands a combination of measures which are only successful in experienced hands. Chronic and repeatedly treated wet cough should raise suspicion of PCD, referring the patient for further diagnostics to a specialised PCD centre.","output":"Two novel mutations in the DNAH11 gene in primary ciliary dyskinesia (CILD7) with considerable variety in the clinical and beating cilia phenotype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had an overwhelming impact on healthcare worldwide. Outstandingly, the aftermath on neoplastic patients is still largely unknown, and only isolated cases of COVID-19 during radiotherapy have been published. We will report the two-months experience of our Department, set in Lombardy red-zone. Methods: : data of 402 cancer patients undergoing active treatment from February 24 to April 24, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed;several indicators of the Department functioning were also analyzed. Results: : dedicated measures allowed an overall limited reduction of the workload. Decrease of radiotherapy treatment number reached 17%, while the number of administration of systemic treatment and follow up evaluations kept constant. Conversely, new treatment planning faced substantial decline. Considering the patients, infection rate was 3.23% (13/402) and mortality 1.24% (5/402). Median age of COVID-19 patients was 69.7 years, the large majority were male and smokers (84.6%);lung cancer was the most common tumor type (61.5%), 84.6% of subjects were stage III-IV and 92.3% had comorbidities. Remarkably, 92.3% of the cases were detected before March 24. Globally, only 2.5% of ongoing treatments were suspended due to suspect or confirmed COVID-19 and 46.2% of positive patients carried on radiotherapy without interruption. Considering only the last month, infection rate among patients undergoing treatment precipitated to 0.43% (1/232) and no new contagions were reported within our staff. Conclusions: : although mortality rate in COVID-19 cancer patients is elevated, our results support the feasibility and safety of continuing anticancer treatment during SARS-Cov-2 pandemic by endorsing consistent preventive measures.","output":"Two months of Radiation Oncology in the heart of Italian red zone during COVID-19 pandemic: paving a safe path over thin ice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air sampling as an aid to infection control is still in an experimental stage, as there is no consensus about which air samplers and pathogen detection methods should be used, and what thresholds of specific pathogens in specific exposed populations (staff, patients, or visitors) constitutes a true clinical risk.

Here, we reflect on the approach we used to establish a cardiac surgery unit in Trinidad and Tobago. METHODS The program started in 1993 with monthly visits by a team from Bristol Heart Institute. A group of local doctors, nurses, and perfusionists were identified for training, and a senior nurse moved to the island to start a teaching program. The visiting support was gradually reduced, and the local team gained independence in managing the service in 2006. RESULTS The initial low volume surgery increased to around 380 cases a year with the implementation of comprehensive service in 2006. Most patients required coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). In-hospital mortality declined from 5% in the nascent years to below 2% thereafter. In the last 5 years (2015-2019), 1764 patients underwent surgery (mean age 59.6  10.8 years, 66% male). The majority were East-Indian-Caribbean (79.1%) or Afro-Caribbean (16.7%), half had diabetes, and two-thirds hypertension (EuroScore II 1.8  1.9). The majority (1363 patients) underwent CABG (99.5% off-pump; conversion to on-pump 1.5%). The mean number of grafts was 2.5  0.7 with 98.5% and 23.1% receiving one and two or more arterial grafts, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 1.1%, re-exploration for bleeding 2%, stroke 0.1%, mediastinitis 0.2%. The length of the postoperative hospital stay was 5.8  2 days.

Classically, psychological assessment tools that evaluate cognitive functioning are administered in face-to-face laboratory sessions, which are time- and resource-consuming. The present study set out to examine whether the eCOGTELan online adaptation of the Cognitive Telephone Screening Instrument (COGTEL; Kliegel et al. in J Psychol 141(2):147C170, 2007)represents a reliable measure of cognitive performance in adulthood. Therefore, an age-stratified adult lifespan sample of 253 participants (aged 19C86 years) completed a face-to-face assessment in the laboratory and a self-administered online version, at their homes. A second, independent sample of 176 younger adults (aged 19C30 years) performed a testCretest assessment of the eCOGTEL. Results showed strong correlations between overall cognitive scores assessed online and in the laboratory, as well as a high testCretest reliability. Further, comparable data distributions between both assessment modes underline the feasibility of the eCOGTEL across the adult lifespan and particularly in older age. Our findings thereby indicate that the eCOGTEL can reliably measure cognitive performance across the lifespan at reduced costs, which may help detecting individuals at risk of developing age-related cognitive decline. Due to these strengths, the eCOGTEL represents a valuable contemporary approach for the resource-efficient online assessment of cognition, which may benefit a broad array of fundamental and applied research fields, such as clinical and organizational psychology.

Measurement of droplet production and size was recorded in vitro using three methods: (1) Malvern Spraytec (LASER particle size measurement device with detectable particle size of 0.1-2500 m) and brushes mounted on a 3D-printed, two-shell form-fit fixture with a supply of tap water; (2) a DustTrak aerosol measurement device and toothpaste slurry, with brushing simulated in the oral cavity of a phantom head; (3) high-speed visualization in a simulated-use situation in the oral cavity of a phantom head, with individual evaluation of tap water, water with detergent, 70% ethanol, glycerin and toothpaste slurry. Both brushes showed the size of emitted droplets was consistently between 200 and 1200 m, categorized as splatter (dental aerosols are <50 m diameter). No significant incremental aerosol-sized matter was detected during toothbrush operation. The high-speed video visualization confirmed only splatter-sized droplets during operation.

We assessed the burden of respiratory illness on a national telehealth system in England and investigated the potential for providing early warning of respiratory infection. We compared weekly laboratory reports for respiratory pathogens with telehealth calls (NHS 111) between week 40 in 2013 and week 29 in 2015. Multiple linear regression was used to identify which pathogens had a significant association with respiratory calls. Children aged <5 and 5-14 years, and adults over 65 years were modelled separately as were time lags of up to 4 weeks between calls and laboratory specimen dates. Associations with respiratory pathogens explained over 83% of the variation in cold/flu, cough and difficulty breathing calls. Based on the first two seasons available, the greatest burden was associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza, with associations found in all age bands. The most sensitive signal for influenza was calls for 'cold/flu', whilst for RSV it was calls for cough. The best-fitting models showed calls increasing a week before laboratory specimen dates. Daily surveillance of these calls can provide early warning of seasonal rises in influenza and RSV, contributing to the national respiratory surveillance programme.","output":"The burden of seasonal respiratory infections on a national telehealth service in England."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact tracing has been a main topic of conversation in the COVID-19 pandemic.

We hypothesized that following implementation of a molecular multiplex respiratory viral panel (RVP), AECOPD patients with viral infections would be more easily identified, limiting antibiotic use in this population. The primary objective of our study was to investigate if availability of the RVP decreased antibiotic prescription at discharge among patients with AECOPD. METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective, before (pre-RVP) - after (post-RVP) study of patients admitted to a tertiary medical center from January 2013 to March 2016. The primary outcome was antibiotic prescription at discharge. Groups were compared using univariable and multivariable logistic-regression. RESULTS: A total of 232 patient-episodes were identified, 133 following RVP introduction. Mean age was 68.1 (pre-RVP) and 68.3 (post-RVP) years respectively (p = 0.88). Patients in pre-RVP group were similar to the post-RVP group with respect to gender (p = 0.54), proportion of patients with BMI < 21(p = 0.23), positive smoking status (p = 0.19) and diagnoses of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, p = 0.16). We found a significant reduction in antibiotic prescription rate at discharge in patients admitted with AECOPD after introduction of the respiratory viral assay (pre-RVP 77.8% vs. post-RVP 63.2%, p = 0.01).

After entry into cells, corona viruses (CoV) activate aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1)-independent mechanism, bypassing the IDO1-kynurenine-AhR pathway. The IDO1-kynurenine-AhR signaling pathway is used by multiple viral, microbial and parasitic pathogens to activate AhRs and to establish infections. AhRs enhance their own activity through an IDO1-AhR-IDO1 positive feedback loop prolonging activation induced by pathogens. Direct activation of AhRs by CoV induces immediate and simultaneous up-regulation of diverse AhR-dependent downstream effectors, and this, in turn, results in a Systemic AhR Activation Syndrome (SAAS) consisting of inflammation, thromboembolism, and fibrosis, culminating in multiple organ injuries, and death. Activation of AhRs by CoV may lead to diverse sets of phenotypic disease pictures depending on time after infection, overall state of health, hormonal balance, age, gender, comorbidities, but also diet and environmental factors modulating AhRs. We hypothesize that elimination of factors known to up-regulate AhRs, or implementation of measures known to down-regulate AhRs, should decrease severity of infection. Although therapies selectively down-regulating both AhR and IDO1 are currently lacking, medications in clinical use such as dexamethasone may down-regulate both AhR and IDO1 genes, as calcitriol/vitamin D(3) may down-regulate the AhR gene, and tocopherol/vitamin E may down-regulate the IDO1 gene. Supplementation of calcitriol should therefore be subjected to epidemiological studies and tested in prospective trials for prevention of CoV infections, as should tocopherol, whereas dexamethasone could be tried in interventional trials. Because lack of physical exercise activates AhRs via the IDO1-kynurenine-AhR signaling pathway increasing risk of infection, physical exercise should be encouraged during quarantines and stay-at-home orders during pandemic outbreaks. Understanding which factors affect gene expression of both AhR and IDO1 may help in designing therapies to prevent and treat humans suffering from Covid-19.","output":"AhR and IDO1 in pathogenesis of Covid-19 and the Systemic AhR Activation Syndrome: a translational review and therapeutic perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In an effort to contain the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, health care systems worldwide implemented telemedical solutions to overcome staffing, technical, and infrastructural limitations. In Germany, a multitude of telemedical systems are already being used, while new approaches are rapidly being developed in response to the crisis. However, the extent of the current implementation within different health care settings, the users acceptance and perception, as well as the hindering technical and regulatory obstacles remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to assess the current status quo of the availability and routine use of telemedical solutions, user acceptance, and the subjectively perceived burdens on telemedical approaches. Furthermore, we seek to assess the perception of public information quality among professional groups and their preferred communication channels. METHODS: A national online survey was conducted on 14 consecutive days in March and April 2020, and distributed to doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals in the German language. RESULTS: A total of 2827 medical professionals participated in the study. Doctors accounted for 65.6% (n=1855) of the professionals, 29.5% (n=833) were nursing staff, and 4.9% (n=139) were identified as others such as therapeutic staff. A majority of participants rated the significance of telemedicine within the crisis as high (1065/2730, 39%) or neutral (n=720, 26.4%); however, there were significant differences between doctors and nurses (P=.01) as well as between the stationary sector compared to the ambulatory sector (P<.001). Telemedicine was already in routine use for 19.6% (532/2711) of German health care providers and in partial use for 40.2% (n=1090). Participants working in private practices (239/594, 40.2%) or private clinics (23/59, 39.0%) experienced less regulatory or technical obstacles compared to university hospitals (586/1190, 49.2%).

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently used for the relief of pain and inflammation, could modulate both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response to the virus. NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs). As PGs play diverse biological roles in homeostasis and inflammatory responses, inhibiting PG production with NSAIDs could affect COVID-19 pathogenesis in multiple ways, including: (1) altering susceptibility to infection by modifying expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; (2) regulating replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells; and (3) modulating the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigate these potential roles. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulates COX-2 in diverse human cell culture and mouse systems. However, suppression of COX-2 by two commonly used NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral replication. In contrast, in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, NSAID treatment reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and impaired the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by reduced neutralizing antibody titers. Our findings indicate that NSAID treatment may influence COVID-19 outcomes by dampening the inflammatory response and production of protective antibodies rather than modifying susceptibility to infection or viral replication.ImportancePublic health officials have raised concerns about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which are critical for the generation of prostaglandins - lipid molecules with diverse roles in homeostasis and inflammation. Inhibition of prostaglandin production by NSAIDs could therefore have multiple effects on COVID-19 pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that NSAID treatment reduced both the antibody and pro-inflammatory cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ability of NSAIDs to modulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has important implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis in patients. Whether this occurs in humans and whether it is beneficial or detrimental to the host remains an important area of future investigation. This also raises the possibility that NSAIDs may alter the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","output":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs dampen the cytokine and antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electron microscopic examination of fecal specimens from adult dairy cows indicated seasonal coronavirus shedding.

Subsequently, the possibilities of applying this technology to various industries have been a subject of debates. While the tourism industry has not been an exception, a marked increase in interest is a recent phenomenon. One of the reasons for this is the unexpected pandemic that, in a way, has forced the tourism industry to search for alternative ways of communicating destinations and reducing the distance between destinations and tourists. The uncertainty of the situation and the change in tourist behaviour as an effect of COVID-19 have prompted the search for new tools to interact with tourists and influence their decisions. The new circumstances might also influence how people evaluate VR tools. The main aim of this paper is thus to diagnose the attitudes and behaviours towards VR during isolation, as well as to present their possible implications for destinations. The research results show that VR has the potential to extend the boundaries of tourism and destinations' activities, and COVID-19 has played a role in shaping people's attitudes and behaviours towards VR.","output":"Destinations, Virtual Reality and Covid-19.

METHODS A Finnish version of the Medication Administration System - Nurses Assessment of Satisfaction (modified MAS-NAS) paper-based questionnaire was sent to all nursing staff (N = 855) working in operative (n = 498) and psychiatric (n = 357) domains in one central hospital. Data were analysed using statistical methods. RESULTS In total, 324 nursing staff members participated. More than half agreed that medication management is efficient (64%), safe for patients (76%), and that the current medication administration system provides the necessary medical treatment information (e.g. prescriptions by physicians, medication data) (64%). Respondents' overall satisfaction with medication management process was slightly above average on a scale from 1 to 10 (mean = 6.2; SD = 1.8; median = 7, range 2-9). Respondents who used electronic medication chart reported higher overall satisfaction with medication management process (median = 7, mean = 6.1, SD = 1.8 and range 2-9) than those not using it (median = 6.5, mean = 6.3, SD = 1.6 and range 2-9).

They often turn to their physicians for help navigating health costs and insurance coverage. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physicians can accurately estimate out-of-pocket expenses when they are given all of the necessary information about a drugs price and a patients insurance plan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This national mail-in survey used a random sample of US physicians. The survey was sent to 900 outpatient physicians (300 each of primary care, gastroenterology, and rheumatology). Physicians were excluded if they were in training, worked primarily for the Veterans Administration or Indian Health Service, were retired, or reported 0% outpatient clinical effort. Analyses were performed from July to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In a hypothetical vignette, a patient was prescribed a new drug costing $1000/month without insurance. A summary of her private insurance information was provided, including the plans deductible, coinsurance rates, copays, and out-of-pocket maximum. Physicians were asked to estimate the drugs out-of-pocket cost at 4 time points between January and December, using the plans 4 types of cost-sharing: (1) deductibles, (2) coinsurance, (3) copays, and (4) out-of-pocket maximums. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess differences in performance by specialty, adjusting for attitudes toward cost conversations, demographics, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The response rate was 45% (405 of 900) and 371 respondents met inclusion criteria. Among the respondents included in this study, 59% (n = 220) identified as male, 23% (n = 84) as Asian, 3% (n = 12) as Black, 6% (n = 24) as Hispanic, and 58% (n = 216) as White; 30% (n = 112) were primary care physicians, 35% (n = 128) were gastroenterologists, and 35% (n = 131) were rheumatologists; and the mean (SD) age was 49 (10) years. Overall, 52% of physicians (n = 192) accurately estimated costs before the deductible was met, 62% (n = 228) accurately used coinsurance information, 61% (n = 224) accurately used copay information, and 57% (n = 210) accurately estimated costs once the out-of-pocket maximum was met. Only 21% (n = 78) of physicians answered all 4 questions correctly. Ability to estimate out-of-pocket costs was not associated with specialty, attitudes toward cost conversations, or clinic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study found that many US physicians have difficulty estimating out-of-pocket costs, even when they have access to their patients' insurance plans. The mechanics involved in calculating real-time out-of-pocket costs are complex. These findings suggest that increased price transparency and simpler insurance cost-sharing mechanisms are needed to enable informed cost conversations at the point of prescribing.","output":"Accuracy of Physician Estimates of Out-of-Pocket Costs for Medication Filling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper estimates the change in policy multipliers in the U.S. relative to their pre-2008 financial crisis levels.

Essential oils (EOs), because of their volatility, can easily reach both the upper and lower parts of the respiratory tract via inhalation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the antibacterial evaluation of clove, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus, thyme, scots pine, peppermint, and citronella EOs against respiratory tract pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the antibacterial effect of these EOs in two different test systems to provide data for the development of an appropriate product formulation. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined with in vitro vapor phase test (VPT) and broth macrodilution test (BDT). The chemical and percentage compositions of the EOs were determined by GC-MS and GC-FID analysis. RESULTS: Among the EOs, thyme was the most effective against S. mutans (MIC: 0.04 mg/mL in BDT, but cinnamon bark and clove oils also presented high inhibition in liquid medium with MIC values of 0.06 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, respectively. M. catarrhalis was the most sensitive to thyme EO (MIC: 0.09 mg/mL). Cinnamon bark EO was the most effective against Haemophilus spp. (MIC: 0.06 mg/mL). In the VPT, cinnamon bark was the most effective oil against all investigated pathogens with MIC values in the range of 15.62C90 l/L. Surprisingly, the eucalyptus and scots pine showed weak activity against the test bacteria in both test systems. CONCLUSIONS: The EO of thyme, clove and cinnamon bark may provide promising antibacterial activity against respiratory tract pathogens either in liquid medium or in vapor phase. However, their effect is lower than that of the reference antibiotics. The combination of EOs and antibiotics may be beneficial in the alternative treatment of respiratory tract diseases. In vivo studies are necessary to calculate the effective dose of EOs in patients and determine their possible side effects and toxicity.","output":"Antibacterial activity evaluation of selected essential oils in liquid and vapor phase on respiratory tract pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significantly negative impact on public sentiment, which has resulted in panic and some irrational buying behavior, which in turn has had a complex impact on agricultural product prices.

Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread. In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region) generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region) 15th-22nd March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort. This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model parameters for this virus's dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are taking place at the regional level. These findings are based on the official data of total death counts up to 15th April 2020 released by ISTAT and up to 10th May 2020 for the number of cases.

Subsequently, the entire Northern part of Italy recorded a high number of cases, while the South was hit following the migratory waves. On March 8th, the Italian Government has issued a decree that imposed a total lockdown defined as a state of isolation and restricted access in Lombardy and in the other 14 provinces of Northern Italy. METHODS We analyzed the virus trend in the period between February 24th and September 8th, 2020, focusing on Calabria, with regards to the following items: new positives, change of total positives and total cases. Furthermore, we included other information, such as the incubation period, symptom resolution period, quarantine period. RESULTS On March 27th, the epidemic curve spiked with 101 new positive cases validating the hypothesis that this abnormal event was related to the displacement of non-residents people, living in the Northern part of Italy, to the home regions in the South. The epidemic curve showed a decreasing trend in the period after lockdown proving the effectiveness of this measure. From the end of the lockdown (May 04th) to September 8th, the registered trend was -94.51%.

Tracking case numbers over time is important to establish the speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. We aimed to assess whether changes in case definitions affected inferences on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. METHODS: We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used exponential growth models to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the number of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. FINDINGS: From Jan 15 to March 3, 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed, the proportion of infections being detected as cases increased by 71 times (95% credible interval [CrI] 48C109) from version 1 to 2, 28 times (19C42) from version 2 to 4, and 42 times (26C73) from version 4 to 5. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by Feb 20, 2020, there would have been 232 000 (95% CrI 161 000C359 000) confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55 508 confirmed cases reported. INTERPRETATION: The case definition was initially narrow and was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan, China, or other known cases. These changes should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

As the coronavirus evades the host innate immune response at the initial stage of infection, the disease can have a long nonsymptomatic period. The uridylate-specific endoribonuclease Nsp15 processes the viral genome for replication and cleaves the polyU sequence in the viral RNA to interfere with the host immune system. This study screened natural compounds in vitro to identify inhibitors against Nsp15 from SARS-CoV-2. Three natural compounds, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), baicalin, and quercetin, were identified as potential inhibitors. Potent antiviral activity of EGCG was confirmed in plaque reduction neutralization tests with a SARS-CoV-2 strain (PRNT50 = 0.20 M). Because the compound has been used as a functional food ingredient due to its beneficial health effects, we theorize that this natural compound may help inhibit viral replication while minimizing safety issues.","output":"Epigallocatechin Gallate Inhibits the Uridylate-Specific Endoribonuclease Nsp15 and Efficiently Neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 Strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid19 pandemic had pushed educational institution to practice online learning because of the physical distancing implemented to prevent further spread of the virus.

As part of the RADAR-CNS consortium, we have conducted research into the application of wearables and smartphone apps in the care of people with multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, or depression. METHODS: We conducted a large online survey study to explore the experiences of HCPs working with patients who have one or more of these conditions. The survey covered smartphone apps and wearables used by clinicians and their patients, and how data from these technologies impacted on the respondents' clinical practice. The survey was conducted between February 2019 and March 2020 via a web-based platform. Detailed statistical analysis was performed on the answers. RESULTS: Of 1009 survey responses from HCPs, 1006 were included in the analysis after data cleaning. Smartphone apps are used by more than half of responding HCPs and more than three quarters of their patients use smartphone apps or wearable devices for health-related purposes. HCPs widely believe the data that patients collect using these devices impacts their clinical practice. Subgroup analyses show that views on the impact of this data on different aspects of clinical work varies according to whether respondents use apps themselves, and, to a lesser extent, according to their clinical setting and job role. CONCLUSIONS: Use of smartphone apps is widespread among HCPs participating in this large European survey and caring for people with epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and depression.

The support received before and during an incident is likely to influence whether clinicians experience psychological growth or injury. An abundance of information is emerging on disease epidemiology, pathogenesis and infection control prevention. However, literature on interventions for supporting the psychological well-being of healthcare workers during disease outbreaks is limited.

Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis is utilised to perform paternity and kinship analysis, due to the polymorphic nature of STR loci. The cost associated with paternity testing is high, and there is a demand for motherless testing. Objectives This study aims to determine what the impact of motherless testing would have been by evaluating 6182 paternity trio cases. Methods The AmpFLSTR? Identifiler? PCR Amplification kit was used to profile each of the trio cases. A scenario was created where the mother was eliminated from the test results to determine if the paternity outcome would change. Results Putative fathers were excluded in 27% of all cases, and in 2.5% of those cases, putative fathers would have been falsely included, had the mother not been tested. These false inclusions are attributed to coincidental STR loci that are shared between the mother and the putative father. The addition of loci to the STR profiling kit may resolve the issue; however, comparable STR data with more loci will have to be evaluated to ensure it overcomes the issue of coincidentally shared loci between unrelated individuals. Conclusion We would recommend that within our setup and within similar setups, the mother always be included for testing, except in extreme scenarios such as death.

SARS-CoV-2 interacting human proteins and GWAS identified respiratory failure associated risk genes provide the input from which the mode-of-action (MOA) proteins/pathways of the resulting disease comorbidities are predicted. These comorbidities are then mapped to their clinical manifestations. Three uncharacterized manifestation categories are found: neoplasms, mental and behavioral disorders, and congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities. The prevalence of neoplasms suggests a possible association between COVID-19 and cancer, whether by shared molecular mechanisms between oncogenesis and viral replication, or perhaps, SARS-CoV-2 is an oncovirus. To assess the molecular basis of each manifestation, the proteins shared across each group of comorbidities were prioritized and subject to global pathway analysis.

However, the regulation of lncRNAs in plant somatic embryos remains unclear. The longan (Dimocarpus longan) somatic embryogenesis (SE) system is a good system for research on longan embryo development. RESULTS: In this study, 7643 lncRNAs obtained during early SE in D. longan were identified by high-throughput sequencing, among which 6005 lncRNAs were expressed. Of the expressed lncRNAs, 4790 were found in all samples and 160 were specifically expressed in embryogenic callus (EC), 154 in incomplete embryogenic compact structures (ICpECs), and 376 in globular embryos (GEs). We annotated the 6005 expressed lncRNAs, and 1404 lncRNAs belonged to 506 noncoding RNA (ncRNA) families and 4682 lncRNAs were predicted to target protein-coding genes. The target genes included 5051 cis-regulated target genes (5712 pairs) and 1605 trans-regulated target genes (3618 pairs). KEGG analysis revealed that most of the differentially expressed target genes (mRNAs) of the lncRNAs were enriched in the plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormone signaling pathways during early longan SE. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed that 20 selected lncRNAs showed significant differences in expression and that five lncRNAs were related to auxin response factors. Compared with the FPKM expression trends, 16 lncRNA expression trends were the same in qPCR. In lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA relationship prediction, 40 lncRNAs were predicted to function as eTMs for 15 miRNAs and 7 lncRNAs were identified as potential miRNA precursors. In addition, we verified the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships by transient expression of miRNAs (miR172a, miR159a.1 and miR398a). CONCLUSION: Analyses of lncRNAs during early longan SE showed that differentially expressed lncRNAs were involved in expression regulation at each SE stage, and may form a regulatory network with miRNAs and mRNAs. These findings provide new insights into lncRNAs and lay a foundation for future functional analysis of lncRNAs during early longan SE.

The atypical thyroiditis induced by Covid-19 is not associated with neck pain, affects more men than women and especially those severely ill, thus coexists with non-thyroidal illness syndrome. Subacute thyroiditis is classically followed by subsequent occurrence of permanent thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity, thus we have started a systematic follow-up program of these patients. Methods: Longitudinal follow-up study of survived Covid-19 patients without previous known history of thyroid disorders and/or medications, assessing serum thyroid function and autoantibodies, C reactive protein (CRP), full blood count (FBC) and thyroid ultrasound (US) every 3 months. Patients showing baseline (at hospitalisation for Covid-19) thyroid dysfunction and/or focal hypoechoic areas suggestive for subacute thyroiditis at US performed 3 months post-infection, also underwent thyroid (99m)Tc or I(123)uptake. Results: To date, 53 patients have been included in the follow-up study. At 3 months post-infection, all of them presented with increased median (IQR) serum TSH concentrations compared with baseline: 1.3 (0.9C2.0) mIU/L versus 0.9 (0.5C1.8) mIU/L (p=0.0001). Similarly, serum concentrations of free-thyroxine, free-triiodothyronine, CRP and FBC had normalised compared with baseline. All patients had negative autoantibodies to TSH receptor; autoantibodies to thyroglobulin and to thyroid peroxidase were positive in 6/53 (11%) and 5/53 (9%) of patients, respectively. The thyroid US showed the presence of focal hypoechoic areas of thyroiditis in 16/51 (32%) patients, with thyroid uptake normal in 6/16 (37%), focally reduced in 8/16 (50%) and diffusely reduced in 2/16 (12%). Conclusions: At 3 months after Covid-19 disease all patients had a normalised thyroid function, however imaging findings suggestive for subacute thyroiditis were still present in about one third of cases. The thyroid dysfunction induced by Covid-19 seems not mediated by autoimmunity. It is important to continue to follow these patients since they might develop thyroid dysfunction during the following months.","output":"Early Follow-up of Atypical Thyroiditis Induced by SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The differentiation of microglia from M1 to M2 exerts a pivotal role in the aggression of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with the differentiation of microglia. However, the underlying mechanism had not been fully clarified. Methods: The expression profile of lncRNAs in thrombin-induced primary microglia was analyzed by RNA sequencing. Under thrombin treatment, the effect of lncRNA TCONS_00145741 on the differentiation of microglia was determined by immunofluorescence staining, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blot. The potential mechanism and related signaling pathways of TCONS_00145741 in the M1 and M2 differentiation of microglia in ICH were assessed by Gene Ontology analysis, flow cytometry, RNA pull-down, RNA Immunoprecipitation, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization followed by immunofluorescence analysis. Results: LncRNA TCONS_00145741 expression was elevated in the thrombin-induced primary microglia, and the interference with TCONS_00145741 restrained the M1 differentiation of microglia and facilitated the M2 differentiation under thrombin treatment. The interference with TCONS_00145741 restrained the activation of the JNK pathway in microglia under thrombin treatment and repressed the JNK phosphorylation levels by enhancing the interaction between DUSP6 and JNK. In vivo experiments further illustrated that the interference with TCONS_00145741 alleviated ICH. Conclusion: LncRNA TCONS_00145741 knockdown prevented thrombin-induced M1 differentiation of microglia in ICH by enhancing the interaction between DUSP6 and JNK.

This situation will fruitfully profit from the study in regards of the spread of the virus, assessing effective countermeasures to weight the impact of the adopted strategies. The standard Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model is a very successful and widely used mathematical model for predicting the spread of an epidemic. We adopt the SIR model on a random network and extend the model to include control strategies {\\\\em lockdown} and {\\\\em testing} -- two often employed mitigation strategies. The ability of these strategies in controlling the pandemic spread is investigated by varying the effectiveness with which they are implemented. The possibility of a second outbreak is evaluated in detail after the mitigation strategies are withdrawn. We notice that, in any case, a sudden interruption of such mitigation strategies will likely induce a resurgence of a second outbreak, whose peak will be correlated to the number of susceptible individuals. In fact, we find that a population will remain vulnerable to the infection until the herd immunity is achieved.

Thus, the optimal treatment strategy for severe COVID-19 should be established urgently. The effects of combination treatment with baricitiniba Janus kinase inhibitor, remdesivir, and dexamethasone (BRD) are unknown. METHODS: Patients who received combination therapy with BRD at the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center were enrolled in the study. All patients received baricitinib (14 d), remdesivir (10 d), and dexamethasone (10 d). The efficacy and adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 44 patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. The 28-d mortality rate was low at 2.3 % (1/44 patients). The need for invasive mechanical ventilation was avoided in most patients (90 %, 17/19 patients). Patients who received BRD therapy had a median hospitalization duration of 11 d, time to recovery of 9 d, duration of intensive care unit stay of 6 d, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation of 5 d, and duration of supplemental oxygen therapy of 5 d. Adverse events occurred in 15 patients (34 %).

Despite an increasing number of confirmed cases, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, its pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, and decision-making differs in the diagnosis and treatment. In addition, it is not evident whether a significant increase in TTS is due to better understanding among practitioners and widespread access to coronary angiography, or if it is a reflection of an actual increase in incidence. We analysed a series of international research studies from 1990 to 2021. Beyond epidemiology and clinical presentation, we evaluated and summarised fundamental knowledge about various predisposing factors, with particular attention to the iatrogenic impact of certain drugs, namely antidepressants, chemotherapy, and antiarrhythmics. Furthermore, we highlighted the main pathophysiological theories to date. In addition, based on published studies and clinical cases, we investigated the role of numerous diagnostic approaches in the differential diagnosis of TTS and identified predictors of TTS complications, such as cardiogenic shock, ventricular fibrillation, and left ventricular thrombi. Accordingly, we sought to propose a diagnostic algorithm and further treatment management of TTS under the presence of possible complications to help practitioners make more informed decisions, as the initial presentation continues to pose a challenge due to its close similarity to acute coronary syndrome with ST-elevation.

Studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced social connectedness and negatively impacted workplace social capital in many non-medical professions, yet studies are limited in the medical field, particularly with physicians. This project sought to uncover resident physician perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on professional relationships and to gain ideas on how to optimize workplace social capital despite and beyond the current limitations of the pandemic. Methods: This study was conducted at a single academic hospital in the United States between March-April 2021. Data was collected from emergency medicine residents via open-ended response online surveys and a semi-structured focus group discussion. A team of three investigators independently analyzed data from open-ended survey responses and the focus group transcription, using a grounded-theory approach and consensus of the independent analyses was subsequently generated to identify final themes and subthemes. Results: Three main themes regarding resident perspective on professional interpersonal relationships and social capital were identified: team, trust, and support.

This paper aims to offer a conceptual model of the relationships between the wellbeing-focused dimensions of a firms activities and CPSW. Building on scholarly insights from the marketing logic and transformative service research (TSR) literature, the paper develops a series of research propositions to articulate the relationships in the conceptual framework. On the basis of the literature review, five wellbeing-focused dimensions of a firms activities have been identified as antecedents to CPSW and five customer factors have been identified as potential moderators of the relationship between the wellbeing-focused dimensions and CPSW. This paper reveals arguments in the existing literature to promote a deeper understanding of the impact of the firms wellbeing-focused activities on CPSW in light of moderating effects of customers psychological and behavioral characteristics. The managerial implication resulting from the framework and the propositions presented here is that managers and service providers need to identify and understand both the wellbeing-focused dimensions of their business and the psychological and behavioral characteristics of their customers; in healthcare services, specifically, both are necessary in order to improve CPSW. This paper highlights a new perspective to better understand the mechanisms of transformative service design that firms should pursue to influence CPSW.

The current study sought to identify an optimal culture supplement of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) for BPD therapy. In this study, we found that UC-MSCs cultured with human platelet lysate (hPL-UCMSCs) were maintained a small size from Passage 1 (P1) to P10, while UC-MSCs cultured with fetal bovine serum (FBS-UCMSCs) became wide and flat. Furthermore, hPL was associated with lower levels of senescence in UC-MSCs during in vitro expansion compared with FBS, as indicated by the results of -galactosidase staining and measures of senescence-related genes (CDKN2A, CDKN1A, and mTOR). In addition, hPL enhanced the proliferation and cell viability of the UC-MSCs and reduced their doubling time in vitro. Compared with FBS-UCMSCs, hPL-UCMSCs have a greater potential to differentiate into osteocytes and chondrocytes. Moreover, using hPL resulted in greater expression of Nestin and specific paracrine factors (VEGF, TGF-1, FGF2, IL-8, and IL-6) in UC-MSCs compared to using FBS. Critically, we also found that hPL-UCMSCs are more effective than FBS-UCMSCs for the treatment of BPD in a rat model, with hPL leading to improvements in survival rate, lung architecture and fibrosis, and lung capillary density. Finally, qPCR of rat lung mRNA demonstrated that hPL-UCMSCs had lower expression levels of inflammatory factors (TNF- and IL-1) and a key chemokine (MCP-1) at postnatal day 10, and there was significant reduction of CD68(+) macrophages in lung tissue after hPL-UCMSCs transplantation. Altogether, our findings suggest that hPL is an optimal culture supplement for UC-MSCs expansion in vitro, and that hPL-UCMSCs promote lung repair in rat BPD disease.","output":"Human Platelet Lysate Maintains Stemness of Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Promote Lung Repair in Rat Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Balkan (or endemic) nephropathy is a chronic tubulointerstitial disease of unknown, presumably exotoxic etiology.

AIM The aim of this study was to establish a porcine model of SFSS. METHODS Twenty-four Landrace pigs underwent liver resection with a remnant liver volume of 50% (group A, n = 8), 25% (group B, n = 8), and 15% (group C, n = 8). After resection, the animals were followed up for 8 days and clinical, laboratory, and histopathological outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS The survival rate was significantly lower in group C compared with the other groups (p < 0.001). The international normalized ratio, bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels increased shortly after surgery in groups B and C, but no change was observed in group A (p < 0.05 for all analyses). The histopathological findings in group A were mainly mild mitoses, in group B severe mitoses and hepatocyte ballooning, moderate congestion, and hemorrhage, along with mild necrosis, and in group C extended tissue damage with severe necrosis, hemorrhage, and congestion. CONCLUSIONS Combination of clinical, laboratory, and histopathological evaluations is needed to confirm the diagnosis of SFSS. 75% liver resection in porcine model results in SFSS. 85% liver resection causes irreversible liver failure.","output":"Establishing a Porcine Model of Small for Size Syndrome following Liver Resection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with a metabolic syndrome (overweight, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) have a particularly bad outcome if infected with SARS-CoV-2.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Descriptive prospective study of children with severe MIS-C mana ged by treatment phases with immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone, according to their clinical response. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging data were obtained. Phenotypes were classified into Kawasaki and not Kawasaki, comparing their findings. RESULTS: 20 patients were analy zed, the median age was 6 years, 60% were female, and 40% presented comorbidity. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 90% of the patients. They presented fever as the first symptom, followed by brief and early gastrointestinal symptoms (70%). 75% presented the Kawasaki phenotype. They evolved with lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation alterations, and elevated systemic and cardiac in flammatory parameters. 80% of the cases presented echocardiographic alterations and 90% shock that required critical care support. All the patients had a short and favorable evolution. All patients responded to the established therapy, but 40% required a second phase of treatment. There were no differences when comparing phenotypes. No deaths were reported. CONCLUSION: MIS-C is a new childhood disease whose presentation could be life-threatening.

Low social support is a key risk factor for developing PND. From an evolutionary perspective this is perhaps unsurprising, as humans evolved as cooperative childrearers, inherently reliant on social support to raise children. The coronavirus pandemic has created a situation in which support from social networks beyond the nuclear family is likely to be even more important to new mothers, as it poses risks and stresses for mothers to contend with; whilst at the same time, social distancing measures designed to limit transmission create unprecedented alterations to their access to such support. Using data from 162 mothers living in London with infants aged 6 months, we explore how communication with members of a mothers social network related to her experience of postnatal depressive symptoms during the first lockdown in England. Levels of depressive symptoms, as assessed via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were high, with 47.5% of the participants meeting a 11 cut-off for PND. Quasi-Poisson regression modelling found that the number of network members seen in-person, and remote communication with a higher proportion of those not seen, was negatively associated with depressive symptoms; however, contact with a higher proportion of relatives was positively associated with symptoms, suggesting kin risked seeing mothers in need. Thematic qualitative analysis of open text responses found that mothers experienced a burden of constant mothering, inadequacy of virtual contact, and sadness and worries about lost social opportunities, while support from partners facilitated family bonding. While Western childrearing norms focus on intensive parenting, and fathers are key caregivers, our results highlight that it still takes a village to raise children in high-income populations and mothers are struggling in its absence.","output":"Communication Across Maternal Social Networks During Englands First National Lockdown and Its Association With Postnatal Depressive Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As we reflect on the work of Douglas Walton, I want to encourage readers of this journal to look beyond the usual applications of logic and consider the domains of medicine and health It is testimony to the intellectual breadth of Walton's ideas in argumentation theory and fallacies that his work should find a home in medical and health disciplines, particularly epidemiology and public health In this paper, I examine three areas of Walton's theoretical approach to argument and fallacies that I have found most beneficial to my work on reasoning in public health First, Walton's collaboration with John Woods resulted in a new, rigorous program of fallacy research Integral to this new approach to the fallacies was the characterization of non-fallacious variants of most of the major informal fallacies Second, Walton advocated for a third category of presumptive argument to sit alongside deduction and induction, with plausibility as the standard of rational evaluation Many so-called informal fallacies, he contended, are rationally warranted presumptive arguments in the practically oriented contexts in which they are advanced Third, Walton argued that presumptive arguments like the argument from expert opinion can be scrutinized using critical questions during systematic reasoning They may also bypass critical questions and facilitate a quick leap to a conclusion based on one or two explicit premises during heuristic reasoning Each of these three areas in Walton's work is discussed in the context of medicine and health, with illustration provided by the current Covid-19 pandemic","output":"Douglas Walton and the Covid-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anxiety Disorders often show a chronic course, even when treated with one of the various effective treatments available.

Therefore, generalizability in current TR-AD research is suboptimal, hampering improvement of clinical care. The objective of this review is to evaluate the currently used definitions of TR-AD by performing a systematic review of available literature. Out of a total of n = 13 042, 62 studies that operationalized TR-AD were included. The current review confirms a lack of consensus on TR-AD criteria.

However, criteria for what constitutes \\"treatment failure\\" were not provided in the majority of studies (58.1%). Definitions for minimal treatment duration ranged from at least 4 weeks to at least 6 months. Almost half of the TR-AD definitions (46.8%) required elevated anxiety severity levels in TR-AD.

METHODS We used a COVID-19 linkable administrative regional database to select diabetic patients over 40 years old. They had at least two prescriptions of antidiabetic drugs in 2019 and a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 between February 15, 2020 and March 15, 2021. The association of metformin use and clinical outcomes was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses and after propensity score matching. Clinical outcomes were all-cause mortality, in-hospital mortality, hospitalization for COVID-19 and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS In multivariable models metformin use was associated with a significantly lower risk of total mortality (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.66-0.75), in-hospital mortality (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.63-0.73), hospitalization for COVID-19 (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.81-0.91) and ICU admission (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.69-0.94) compared with metformin non-users.

Lack of a vaccine or optimized intervention raised the importance of characterizing risk factors and symptoms for the early identification and successful treatment of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze biomedical literature and public social media data to understand the association of risk factors and symptoms with the various outcomes observed in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Through semantic analysis, we collected 45 retrospective cohort studies, which evaluated 303 clinical and demographic variables across 13 different outcomes of patients with COVID-19, and 84,140 Twitter posts from 1036 COVID-19-positive users. Machine learning tools to extract biomedical information were introduced to identify mentions of uncommon or novel symptoms in tweets. We then examined and compared two data sets to expand our landscape of risk factors and symptoms related to COVID-19. RESULTS: From the biomedical literature, approximately 90% of clinical and demographic variables showed inconsistent associations with COVID-19 outcomes. Consensus analysis identified 72 risk factors that were specifically associated with individual outcomes. From the social media data, 51 symptoms were characterized and analyzed. By comparing social media data with biomedical literature, we identified 25 novel symptoms that were specifically mentioned in tweets but have been not previously well characterized. Furthermore, there were certain combinations of symptoms that were frequently mentioned together in social media. CONCLUSIONS: Identified outcome-specific risk factors, symptoms, and combinations of symptoms may serve as surrogate indicators to identify patients with COVID-19 and predict their clinical outcomes in order to provide appropriate treatments.","output":"Identification of Risk Factors and Symptoms of COVID-19: Analysis of Biomedical Literature and Social Media Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Many studies have confirmed headache as one of the most common COVID-19-related neurological symptoms.

Methods: We designed a drug delivery system made of bacterial (Escherichia coli) double layer membrane-derived nanovesicles (DMVs) with the expression of RGD peptides and endogenous targeting ligands of bacteria. The physical and biological characteristics of DMVs were assessed by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, western blotting, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded in DMVs via a pH gradient driven drug loading method. Therapeutical effects of DOX-loaded DMVs were studied in a melanoma xenograft mouse model. Results: In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that DMVs can target neutrophils and monocytes that mediated the transport of DMVs across blood vessel barriers and they can also directly target tumor vasculature and tumor cells, resulting in enhanced delivery of therapeutics to TMEs. Furthermore, we developed a remote drug loading approach to efficiently encapsulate DOX inside DMVs, and the drug loading was 12% (w/w). In the B16-F10 melanoma mouse model, we showed that DOX-RGD-DMVs significantly inhibited the tumor growth compared to several controls.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of emergency carotid artery stent placement in combination with intracranial thrombectomy and the clinical outcome of the treated patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed clinical and angiographic data of patients who underwent emergency cervical ICA stent placement and intracranial thrombectomy with stent-retriever devices in our institution between November 2009 and July 2012. Recanalization was assessed according to the Thrombolysis in Cerebral-Infarction score. Clinical outcome was evaluated at discharge (NIHSS) and after 3 months (mRS). RESULTS Overall, 24 patients were treated. The mean age was 67.2 years; mean occlusion time, 230.2 minutes. On admission, the median NIHSS score was 18. In all patients, the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score was zero before the procedure. Stent implantation was feasible in all cases. In 15 patients (62.5%), a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score  2b could be achieved. Six patients (25%) improved 10 NIHSS points between admission and discharge. After 90 days, the median mRS score was 3.0. Seven patients (29.2%) had a good clinical outcome (mRS 0-2), and 4 patients (16.6%) died, 1 due to fatal intracranial hemorrhage.

SARS-CoV-2 shares almost 80% of the genome with SARS-CoV-1 and 50% with MERS-CoV. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 proteins share a high degree of homology (approximately 95%) with SARS-CoV-1 proteins. Hence, the mechanisms of SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2 infection are similar and occur via binding to ACE2 protein, which is widely distributed in the human body, with a predominant expression in endocrine tissues including testis, thyroid, adrenal and pituitary. PURPOSE: On the basis of expression pattern of the ACE2 protein among different tissues, similarity between SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2 and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease, we aimed at discussing, after almost one-year pandemic, about the relationships between COVID-19 infection and the endocrine system. First, we discussed the potential effect of hormones on the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection; second, we examined the evidences regarding the effect of COVID-19 on the endocrine system. When data were available, a comparative discussion between SARS and COVID-19 effects was also performed. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search within Pubmed was performed. This review has been conducted according to the PRISMA statements. RESULTS: Among 450, 100 articles were selected. Tissue and vascular damages have been shown on thyroid, adrenal, testis and pituitary glands, with multiple alterations of endocrine function. CONCLUSION: Hormones may affect patient susceptibility to COVID-19 infection but evidences regarding therapeutic implication of these findings are still missing. SARS and COVID-19 may affect endocrine glands and their dense vascularization, impairing endocrine system function.

Methods: : This rapid review was completed within four weeks during April C May 2020. The review focused on primary sources describing and evaluating the functional impact of the SARS, MERS and Covid-19 coronavirus pandemics, published since January 2000 in peer reviewed journal articles. All included sources were evaluated for quality, and the International Classification of Function provided a theoretical structure for synthesizing the available evidence. Results: : A total of 65 sources met the inclusion criteria for this review. The majority (n=42, 61.6%) were related to the SARS pandemic, and originated from Asia for North America. Almost half of the reviewed sources (n=32, 49.2%) investigated the impact of coronavirus pandemics on the community, with smaller evidence bases related to people with coronaviruses and their families (n=19, 29.2%) and healthcare workers (n=17, 26.1%).

METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library as well as the top three endodontic journals for relevant papers. We included randomized controlled trials that included adults. Our main outcome was postoperative pain intensity measured with a validated scale. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane criteria and the quality of the included studies using GRADE. We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eight studies involving 810 patients were included. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Seven of eight studies used a visual analog scale to measure pain intensity. Compared with controls, intracanal cryotherapy significantly reduced postoperative pain at 6 (mean difference [MD] -1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.61 to -2.14; P < 0.05; I2 = 76%; moderate quality evidence) and 24 hours after the procedure (MD -1.43; 95% CI -0.70 to -2.15; P < 0.05; I2 = 89%; moderate quality evidence). There was no significant effect on pain at 48 and 72 hours and 7 days after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate quality evidence suggests that intracanal cryotherapy, i.e., using cold saline irrigation as a final irrigant, significantly reduces the intensity of pain at 6 and 24 hours after root canal therapy. Future clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of intracanal cryotherapy is advocated.","output":"Effectiveness of intracanal cryotherapy in root canal therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients are at high risk of severe complications and death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The first part of the article describes a case of COVID-19 in our patient after a recent kidney transplant. The second part of the article presents the outcome of literature search from multiple resources from April 2020 until March 2021. Abstracts were screened, followed by full-text review with data extraction. Part 2 discusses current treatment options of COVID-19, and part 3 refers to this treatment application in patients after solid organ transplant. RESULTS: We have summarized 45 studies from China, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Mortality rates from published studies were variable. Based on early data from Spain, 42% of patients who developed COVID-19 within 60 days of transplant died. According to results of the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database collaboration group, the 28-day COVID-19-related mortality is 21.3% for kidney transplant recipients, which is still markedly higher than what is observed in other populations. Acute kidney injury was common, and mycophenolate mofetil and mammalian target of rapamycin were discontinued in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: Effective therapy has been sought since the outbreak of the pandemic, and at the same time intensive work has been done to produce a vaccine that could effectively protect against the disease. Summing up the efforts of numerous groups of researchers from around the world that have been continued since the beginning of 2020, we may assume the following: (1) we still do not have causal drugs that would reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and allow its complete elimination, but antispike monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 seem to be very promising, and (2) the withdrawal of antiproliferative and antimetabolic drugs and the continuation of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors is now a commonly accepted approach in patients after organ transplant.","output":"The Course of SARS-CoV-2 in a Patient After a Recent Kidney Transplant: A Literature Review on COVID-19 Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Informed consent process has become a challenging issue before surgery for any emergency obstetric care during this COVID pandemic.

Being a parent in this situation was not easy for anyone, much less for parents of children with special needs. The shutting down of special education systems meant that parents lost a vital support network and had to be the sole full-time caregivers despite often lacking the skills to cope with this new and daunting situation. We interviewed parents and learned that the main difficulties faced by homebound autistic children stemmed from the change in routine, lack of special education services, limited physical space, and food- and sleep-related issues. Some children experienced worsening in behavioral, social, and developmental domains, yet others seemed to not only overcome the challenges of changing conditions but even benefit from them. The children's success or failure was directly related to how their parents coped. The key factors that enabled successful coping were the parents' ability to accommodate to the child's needs, their own creativeness and resourcefulness, and a generally positive outlook. The results of this analysis revealed that the best way to benefit autistic children caught up in drastic changes in their routine lifestyle is to invest in a strong support system for their parents.","output":"Core experiences of parents of children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Considering the rapid spread of COVID-19, the scientific community has been looking for ways to recognize factors that may interfere with the outcome of viral infection. Despite the lack of studies with the new coronavirus, it is known that adequate serum levels of micronutrients are essential for the organic response to infectious diseases. Thus, we aim to review the effects of vitamin A, D, iron, zinc, or folate deficiency on the prognosis of patients with respiratory infections with manifestations similar to COVID-19 and discuss about supplementation of the nutrients analyzed in this review. METHODS: The search was conducted in the databases PubMed, Lilacs, and SciELO, including observational studies published between 2010-2020, with results for individuals with respiratory tract infections with manifestations similar to COVID-19. RESULTS: Six articles met the inclusion criteria, all of which were related to deficiencies of vitamins A and D. In general, vitamin A deficiency was associated with cough, fever, and greater total respiratory resistance. Regarding vitamin D, the lack of this nutrient led to higher rates of ICU admission, the need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Evidence linking specific relationships between nutritional deficiencies and COVID-19 remain lacking due to the small number of studies and heterogeneities in population subgroups. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, deficiencies of vitamins A and D seem to negatively affect the prognosis of respiratory tract infections. Supplementation of these nutrients for prevention or treatment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should respect serum levels, nutritional status and housing conditions (e.g.,endemic location) of individuals.","output":"Vitamin A and D deficiencies in the prognosis of respiratory tract infections: A systematic review with perspectives for COVID-19 and a critical analysis on supplementation (preprint)/ pt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contains 23 papers.

Most of these frameworks, however, focus on value to payers rather than patients and healthcare providers and may ignore other sources of economic value such as patient and physician time cost, impact on productivity, and direct health system costs. This article focusses on fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection (PH FDC SC) in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. We review relevant clinical evidence, examine data on time and resource use of the subcutaneous administration of trastuzumab compared with intravenous treatment and how it can be extrapolated to PH FDC SC, and discuss the value PH FDC SC can bring to patients and healthcare providers. We will also provide our own experiences of PH FDC SC from the healthcare (oncologist, healthcare economist, pharmacist) and patient point of view. The data, combined with our personal experiences, suggest that switching from intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab to PH FDC SC could reduce non-drug costs for healthcare providers treating patients with HER2-positive breast cancer through time savings and other economic benefits. Furthermore, PH FDC SC could also save patient time given its shorter administration and post-injection observation time versus intravenous infusions, potentially resulting in reduced productivity loss. These benefits could be applied to other subcutaneous formulations, either currently available or in development.","output":"White Paper on the Value of Time Savings for Patients and Healthcare Providers of Breast Cancer Therapy: The Fixed-Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab for Subcutaneous Injection as an Example"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and hiPSCs-derived cells have the potential to revolutionize regenerative and precision medicine Genetically reprograming somatic cells to generate hiPSCs and genetic modification of hiPSCs are considered the key procedures for the study and application of hiPSCs However, there are significant technical challenges for transgene delivery into somatic cells and hiPSCs since these cells are known to be difficult to transfect The existing methods, such as viral transduction and chemical transfection, may introduce significant alternations to hiPSC culture which affect the potency, purity, consistency, safety, and functional capacity of hiPSCs Therefore, generation and genetic modification of hiPSCs through non-viral approaches are necessary and desirable Nanotechnology has revolutionized fields from astrophysics to biology over the past two decades Increasingly, nanoparticles have been used in biomedicine as powerful tools for transgene and drug delivery, imaging, diagnostics, and therapeutics The most successful example is the recent development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines at warp speed to combat the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which brought nanoparticles to the center stage of biomedicine and demonstrated the efficient nanoparticle-mediated transgene delivery into human body Nanoparticles have the potential to facilitate the transgene delivery into the hiPSCs and offer a simple and robust approach Nanoparticle-mediated transgene delivery has significant advantages over other methods, such as high efficiency, low cytotoxicity, biodegradability, low cost, directional and distal controllability, efficient in vivo applications, and lack of immune responses Our recent study using magnetic nanoparticles for transfection of hiPSCs provided an example of the successful applications, supporting the potential roles of nanoparticles in hiPSC biology This review discusses the principle, applications, and significance of nanoparticles in the transgene delivery to hiPSCs and their successful application in the development of COVID-19 vaccines","output":"Transgene Delivery to Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Using Nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we outlined the types of malnutrition amongst children, the causes of malnutrition intervention at the primary health care level and some recommendations to alleviate childhood malnutrition in South Africa.","output":"Malnutrition in children under the age of 5 years in a primary health care setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Polyherbal formula (PHF) contains extract of Sauropus androgynous (L.)

METHODS: Thirty lactating Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6), each has 7 pups. Group I was treated orally with distilled water as negative control. Groups II, III, and IV were orally administered with PHF at 26.25, 52.5 and 105 mg/kg/day, respectively. Group V was treated with domperidone 2.7 mg/kg/day, orally as positive control. The treatment was performed at third day until fifteenth day of parturition. The observed parameters include the galactagogue activity indicating by milk yield of lactating rats, the pup weight changes and lactating rats body weight changes during lactating period, mRNA expression of LALBA and AQP using quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and histopathological analysis of mammary glands at the end of treatment period. RESULT: The result showed that the PHF groups (52.5 and 105 mg/kg/day) and domperidone were significantly increased milk production of lactating rats (p < 0.05). The levels of mRNA expression of LALBA and AQPs were significantly upregulated by 105 mg/kg/day of PHF or 2.7 mg/kg of domperidone administration (p < 0.0001).

This study aimed to analyze the evolution of different psychological variables during the first coronavirus wave to identify the different psychological response clusters, as well as to keep a follow-up on the changes among these clusters. The sample included 459 Spanish residents (77.8% female, Mage = 35.21 years, SDage = 13.00). Participants completed several online self-reported questionnaires to assess positive functioning variables (MLQ, Steger et al. in J Loss Trauma 13(6):511C527, 2006. 10.1080/15325020802173660;GQ-6, McCullough et al. in J Person Soc Psychol 82:112C127, 2002. 10.1037/0022-3514.82.1.112;CD-RISC, Campbell-Sills and Stein in J Traum Stress 20(6):1019C1028, 2007. 10.1002/jts.20271;CLS-H, Chiesi et al. in BMC Psychol 8(1):1C9, 2020. 10.1186/s40359-020-0386-9;SWLS;Diener et al. in J Person Assess, 49(1), 71C75, 1985), emotional distress (PHQ-2, Kroenke et al. in Med Care 41(11):1284C1292, 2003. 10.1097/01.MLR.0000093487.78664.3C;GAD-2, Kroenke et al. in Ann Internal Med 146(5):317C325, 2007. 10.7326/0003-4819-146-5-200703060-00004;PANAS, Watson et al. in J Person Soc Psychol 47:1063C1070, 1988;Perceived Stress, ad hoc), and post-traumatic growth (PTGI-SF;Cann et al. in Anxiety Stress Coping 23(2):127C137, 2010. 10.1080/10615800903094273), four times throughout the 3 months of the confinement. Linear mixed models showed that the scores on positive functioning variables worsened from the beginning of the confinement, while emotional distress and personal strength improved by the end of the state of alarm. Clustering analyses revealed four different patterns of psychological response: Survival, Resurgent, Resilient, and Thriving individuals. Four different profiles were identified during mandatory confinement and most participants remained in the same cluster. The Resilient cluster gathered the largest number of individuals (30C37%). We conclude that both the heterogeneity of psychological profiles and analysis of positive functioning variables, emotional distress, and post-traumatic growth must be considered to better understand the response to prolonged adverse situations.

Thyroid hormones play a key role in modulating metabolism and the immune system. However, the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction (TD) and its association with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we seek to address this gap and understand the link between TD and COVID-19. METHODS: Herein, we enrolled patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 and had normal or abnormal thyroid function test results at the West Court of Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 29 January and 26 February 2020. We carried out follow up examinations until 26 April 2020. Data on clinical features, treatment strategies, and prognosis were collected and analysed. TD was defined as an abnormal thyroid function test result, including overt thyrotoxicosis, overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, and euthyroid sick syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 25 and 46 COVID-19 patients with and without TD, respectively, were included in the study. COVID-19 patients with TD had significantly higher neutrophil counts and higher levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase, and high-sensitive troponin I and a longer activated partial thromboplastin time but lower lymphocyte, platelet, and eosinophil counts. A longitudinal analysis of serum biomarkers showed that patients with TD presented persistently high levels of biomarkers for inflammatory response and cardiac injury. COVID-19 patients with TD were more likely to develop a critical subtype of the disease. Patients with TD had a significantly higher fatality rate than did those without TD during hospitalisation (20% vs 0%, P<0.0001). Patients with TD were more likely to stay in the hospital for more than 28 days than were those without TD (80% vs 56.52%, P=0.048).

This protocol details the rationale and design of an ex-ante, parallel cluster-randomized trial evaluating the impact of a demand-side, norms-centric behavior change intervention on exclusive toilet use and maintenance in peri-urban Tamil Nadu, India. Methods and Analysis: Following two years of formative research, we developed an evidence-based norm-centric behavior change intervention called Nam Nalavazhvu (Tamil for 'Our wellbeing'). The multi-level intervention aims to shift collective beliefs by shifting empirical expectations or beliefs about other relevant people's sanitation practices. It also provides action-oriented information to aid individuals to set goals and overcome barriers to build, consistently use and maintain their toilets. This trial includes 76 wards in Pudukkottai and Karur districts, where half were randomly assigned to receive the intervention and the remaining serve as counterfactuals. During baseline and endline (conducted one year after the initiation of intervention) assessments, we collect relevant data and compare results between study arms to determine the impacts of the Nam Nalavazhvu intervention on sanitation-related behavioral, health, wellbeing outcomes and potential moderators.

will comprehensively evaluate the distribution of stressors of medical students and explore the personal and environmental predictors of PS during the epidemic Participants and Methods: An online survey was conducted among medical students (n=369) from three medical universities in western China who engaged in online learning A stress process conceptual framework was formed to explore the influencing factors of PS The survey items contained four sections: (a) the potential stressors derived from academic, psychosocial and health-related demands;coping resources such as (b) online

a result of economic activity, thus, it is essential to understand the effect of economic progress on the environment. More importantly, this endeavor is especially suited for the European Union (EU) member states, which account for a sizable portion of the world economy. However, by considering the open border or trade policy approach of the bloc, this study applies a battery of econometrics analysis that consists of mean group, augmented mean group, common correlated effect mean group estimators, and Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality analysis for direction of causality. These techniques are superior to first-generation methods to substantiate the relationship between real income, energy intensity, and carbon emission between annual frequency data from 1990 to 2017. Empirical results from series of cointegration tests reveal the long-run equilibrium relationship between the highlighted variables in the EU. Our study validates the existence of EKC phenomenon where emphasis is based on GDP growth at the expense of environmental quality. This implies that EU growth trajectory comes with an environmental trade-off and consequences. However, few countries in the region have made substantial strides of carbon reduction but not as a bloc. This position is resonated by the regression from all estimators in harmony where energy intensity dampens environmental quality in the blocs investigated. On the direction of causality, feedback Granger causality is observed running from GDP growth and carbon emission. A similar direction of causality is seen between energy intensity and carbon emission. These outcomes have far-reaching consequences on the environment. This study recommends the need for energy transition to cleaner and friendlier energy technologies by EU officials. That is, the need for a paradigm shift from conventional energy based on fossil fuel to renewable energy should be pursued in the region.

Again, convenience and simple random sampling techniques were used to select universities and students respectively. It was confirmed by students that universities shifted from classroom teaching to virtual teaching and that this confirmation was substantiated by students to reveal that Learning Management System was greatly used to conduct virtual teaching that was followed by Zoom and lastly Google meet. In addition, it was found that some students were not digitally literate and this actuated difficulty to excel in the digital classroom created by the universities. It was recommended that universities should factor basic computing into the programme-based courses so that students could become digitally literate and fully prepared for the future.","output":"The Journey of University Students in the Digital Society during the Closure of Schools at the Peak of COVID-19 (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present study, we investigated the distribution of genetic variations in IL6 and IL6R genes, which may be employed as prognostic and pharmacogenetic biomarkers for COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases. The study was performed on 271 samples representative of the Italian general population and identified seven variants (rs140764737, rs142164099, rs2069849, rs142759801, rs190436077, rs148171375, rs13306435) in IL6 and five variants (rs2228144, rs2229237, rs2228145, rs28730735, rs143810642) within IL6R, respectively. These variants have been predicted to affect the expression and binding ability of IL6 and IL6R. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that IL6 and IL6R appeared to be implicated in several pathogenetic mechanisms associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality as well as with neurodegenerative diseases mediated by neuroinflammation. Thus, the availability of IL6-IL6R-related biomarkers for COVID-19 may be helpful to counteract harmful complications and prevent multiorgan failure. At the same time, IL6-IL6R-related biomarkers could also be useful for assessing the susceptibility and progression of neuroinflammatory disorders and undertake the most suitable treatment strategies to improve patients' prognosis and quality of life. In conclusion, this study showed how IL6 pleiotropic activity could be exploited to meet different clinical needs and realize personalized medicine protocols for chronic, age-related and modern public health emergencies.","output":"Investigation of Genetic Variations of IL6 and IL6R as Potential Prognostic and Pharmacogenetics Biomarkers: Implications for COVID-19 and Neuroinflammatory Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic caused by the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 has mobilized scientific attention in search of a treatment. The cysteine\\\\proteases, main protease (Mpro) and papain\\\\like protease (PLpro) are important targets for antiviral drugs. In this work, we simulate the interactions between the Mpro and PLpro with Ebselen, its metabolites and derivatives with the aim of finding molecules that can potentially inhibit these enzymes. The docking data demonstrate that there are two main interactions between the thiol (?SH) group of Cys (from the protease active sites) and the electrophilic centers of the organoselenium molecules, i. e. the interaction with the carbonyl group (O=C()SH) and the interaction with the Se moiety (Se()SH). Both interactions may lead to an adduct formation and enzyme inhibition. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with Ebselen indicate that the energetics of the thiol nucleophilic attack is more favorable on Se than on the carbonyl group, which is in accordance with experimental data (Jin et al. Nature, 2020, 582, 289C293). Therefore, organoselenium molecules should be further explored as inhibitors of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 proteases.

Case studies are a way to engage students in realistic scenarios that contextualize concepts and highlight applications in the life sciences. While case studies are commonly available and adaptable to course goals, the practical considerations of how to deliver and assess cases in online and blended environments can instill panic. Here we review existing resources and our collective experiences creating, adapting, and assessing case materials across different modalities.

Elite quality is a macro-level feature of the political economy that measures the value creation aggregate of all elite business models. Elites are dominant coalitions with the strongest capacity for coordination in societies and operate the highest impact business models. Elite business models can either create sustainable value or extract value from others, primarily from non-elites (i.e., through rent-seeking). Value creation activities include innovation, trade or production;value extraction includes barriers, discrimination or monopolies. The higher the value creation of elite business models on aggregate, the higher the quality of the national elite system. The EQx2021 uses data from 107 indicators to establish comparative elite quality rankings for 151 countries. The EQx Country Scores and Global Rankings result from a rich conceptual architecture designed to offer original analysis and interpretation. This edited work includes commentaries on 21 countries (from Austria to the United States) and six discussions of specific phenomena in the political economy (from diversity and inclusion to global trade). The reader will identify two perspectives in these analyses. The first connects the dots and provides a birds-eye view of a particular countrys performance weaving specific indicator results into a comprehensive story of a countrys political economy. The second offers a more abstract analytical perspective, highlighting different levels of connectivity between, for example, power, political value and creative destruction and then illustrates the linkages with specific indicators (such as those related to COVID-19). Both the birds-eye view and the high abstraction perspectives provide policy recommendations, unique insights into elites, and glimpses into the futures of a diverse range of countries and regions, both leaders and laggards. Beyond providing rich insights for academia, the EQx2021 also aims to impact business leaders and policymakers to further sustainable value creation.

Social media use has been demonstrated to play a role in the low acceptance of vaccines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the topics and sentiments in the public COVID-19 vaccineCrelated discussion on social media and discern the salient changes in topics and sentiments over time to better understand the public perceptions, concerns, and emotions that may influence the achievement of herd immunity goals. METHODS: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, the day the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to January 31, 2021. We used R software to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained the keywords vaccination, vaccinations, vaccine, vaccines, immunization, vaccinate, and vaccinated. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 1,499,421 unique tweets from 583,499 different users. We used R to perform latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling as well as sentiment and emotion analysis using the National Research Council of Canada Emotion Lexicon. RESULTS: Topic modeling of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines yielded 16 topics, which were grouped into 5 overarching themes. Opinions about vaccination (227,840/1,499,421 tweets, 15.2%) was the most tweeted topic and remained a highly discussed topic during the majority of the period of our examination. Vaccine progress around the world became the most discussed topic around August 11, 2020, when Russia approved the worlds first COVID-19 vaccine. With the advancement of vaccine administration, the topic of instruction on getting vaccines gradually became more salient and became the most discussed topic after the first week of January 2021. Weekly mean sentiment scores showed that despite fluctuations, the sentiment was increasingly positive in general. Emotion analysis further showed that trust was the most predominant emotion, followed by anticipation, fear, sadness, etc. The trust emotion reached its peak on November 9, 2020, when Pfizer announced that its vaccine is 90% effective. CONCLUSIONS: Public COVID-19 vaccineCrelated discussion on Twitter was largely driven by major events about COVID-19 vaccines and mirrored the active news topics in mainstream media. The discussion also demonstrated a global perspective. The increasingly positive sentiment around COVID-19 vaccines and the dominant emotion of trust shown in the social media discussion may imply higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines compared with previous vaccines.","output":"COVID-19 VaccineCRelated Discussion on Twitter: Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological syndrome, which is characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis during the rapid eye movement period of sleep.

During this quarantine, communication systems have been characterized by disintermediation, the acceleration of digitization and an infodemic (excess and saturation of information). The following debate arises: Do the levels related to the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs related to the interpretation of information vary before and after social quarantine? OBJECTIVES: This research aims to examine the psychological effects of social quarantine on the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs-experiences of the general nonclinical population. The following hypothesis was posed: social quarantine alters the levels of magical thinking, pseudoscientific beliefs and anomalous perceptions due to quarantine. METHODS: A pre- and posttest analysis design was applied based on the difference in means, and complementary Bayesian estimation was performed. A total of 174 Spanish subjects responded to different questionnaires that evaluated psychopathological risks based on psychotic phenotypes, pseudoscientific beliefs and experiences before and after quarantine. RESULTS: Significant differences were obtained for the variables positive psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and certain perceptual alterations (e.g., cenesthetic perceptions), and a significant increase in pseudoscientific beliefs was also observed. The perceptual disturbances that increased the most after quarantine were those related to derealization and depersonalization. However, paranoid perceptions showed the highest increase, doubling the initial standard deviation. These high increases could be related to the delimitation of physical space during social quarantine and distrust towards information communicated by the government to the population. Is it possible that social alarmism generated by the excess of information and pseudoscientific information has increased paranoid perceptual alterations? CONCLUSIONS: Measures taken after quarantine indicate that perceptual disturbances, subclinical psychotic symptoms and beliefs in the pseudoscience have increased.

And extracting common features plays a critical role in these methods. However, since the ignorance of the fact that data in different modalities shares similar distributions in feature space, most works did not mining the inter-modal distribution relationships completely, which eventually leads to unacceptable common features. To address this issue, we propose the deep multimodal clustering with cross reconstruction method, which firstly focuses on multimodal feature extraction in an unsupervised way and then clusters these extracted features. The proposed cross reconstruction aims to build latent connections among different modalities, which effectively reduces the distribution differences in feature space. The theoretical analysis shows that the cross reconstruction reduces the Wasserstein distance of multimodal feature distributions.

The rate was then combined with estimates of the distribution of the generation interval as reconstructed from the literature. RESULTS: Despite the possible unreliability of some official statistics about COVID-19, the spread of the disease appears to be remarkably similar in most European countries, allowing us to estimate an average R0 in Western Europe of 2.2 (95% CI: 1.9-2.6).

The objectives of this study are to describe the current pediatric procedural sedation and analgesia practice patterns in European emergency departments, to perform a needs assessment-like analysis, and to identify barriers to implementation. A survey study of European emergency departments treating children was conducted. Through a lead research coordinator identified through the Research in European Pediatric Emergency Medicine (REPEM) network for each of the participating countries, a 30-question questionnaire was sent, targeting senior physicians at each site. Descriptive statistics were performed. One hundred and seventy-one sites participated, treating approximately 5 million children/year and representing 19 countries, with a response rate of 89%. Of the procedural sedation and analgesia medications, midazolam (100%) and ketamine (91%) were available to most children, whereas propofol (67%), nitrous oxide (56%), intranasal fentanyl (47%), and chloral hydrate (42%) were less frequent. Children were sedated by general pediatricians in 82% of cases. Safety and monitoring guidelines were common (74%), but pre-procedural checklists (51%) and capnography (46%) less available. In 37% of the sites, the entire staff performing procedural sedation and analgesia were certified in pediatric advanced life support. Pediatric emergency medicine was a board-certified specialty in 3/19 countries. Physician (73%) and nursing (72%) shortages and lack of physical space (69%) were commonly reported as barriers to procedural sedation and analgesia. Nurse-directed triage protocols were in place in 52% of the sites, mostly for paracetamol (99%) and ibuprofen (91%). Tissue adhesive for laceration repair was available to 91% of children, while topical anesthetics for intravenous catheterization was available to 55%. Access to child life specialists (13%) and hypnosis (12%) was rare. Conclusion: Procedural sedation and analgesia are prevalent in European emergency departments, but some sedation agents and topical anesthetics are not widely available. Guidelines are common but further safety nets, nurse-directed triage analgesia, and nonpharmacologic support to procedural sedation and analgesia are lacking.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate medical and dental students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Four hundred and twenty students who attended anatomy classes during COVID-19 outbreak in Greece, were asked to fill in a questionnaire of 22 questions evaluating the formats of the different courses provided. Each student was asked to complete the questionnaire anonymously via the Google Forms? platform. A total of 200 students participated. During the lockdown, 59.5% of students attended all online anatomy lectures compared to 44.5% in the pre-pandemic year. Overall, the higher percentage of 73.5% was satisfied with the traditional anatomy teaching, instead of 56% which were satisfied with the effectiveness of online anatomy lectures. Asking whether any remote educational method can partially or completely replace the traditional anatomy teaching, the majority of students replied \\"no\\" for all the three remote modalities. The traditional anatomy teaching remains the most preferred and effective teaching modality. The students ranked online anatomy lectures and pre-recorded anatomy lectures in second place in terms of effectiveness and preference. The development of remote learning methods has increased students' active participation in anatomy lessons, but significantly negatively affected the students' performance at exams. Remote learning cannot replace the traditional anatomy teaching method, but online lectures could be incorporated into anatomy curricula as an additional tool.","output":"Online educational methods vs. traditional teaching of anatomy during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospitalization is an unparalleled opportunity for physicians to educate patients about the interconnection between poor dietary choices and the occurrence of many chronic diseases. For those patients who are ready to embrace nutrition as an essential part of the healing process, however, it is oftentimes difficult to find healthy menus at hospitals. Meat-based entres, sugar-sweetened beverages and candy appear to be omnipresent in cafeterias and restaurants at U.S. hospitals. On the other hand, healthy plant-based menus are still the exception rather than the rule. Some states undertook considerable efforts to change this and made plant-based meals the law. Upon request by a patient, hospitals in New York are now required by law to provide plant-based options at every meal. This recent development triggered a controversial discussion within the medical community whether other states should follow this example and make plant-based hospital menus the law as well. This editorial illuminates why mandatory plant-based hospital menus could be a win-win situation for many involved stakeholders, including patients, hospitals and food services. This step is not a loss-marking venture for hospitals but rather a chance to save money and to improve corporate brand marketing at the same time. The introduction of mandatory plant-based menus in hospitals at a large scale represents a unique opportunity at the nexus of health, innovative corporate strategies and economics. Adequate framework conditions are necessary to ensure that all individuals can make healthy and affordable dietary choices while being hospitalized.","output":"Should Plant-Based Hospital Meals be the Law?

As of the same date, Italy represents the third country worldwide in total number of cases and the first one in total number of deaths. The purpose of this study is to analyse the Italian case and identify key problem questions and lessons learned from the Italian experience. The study initially provides a general overview of the country's characteristics and health care system, followed by a detailed description of the Italian epidemiological picture regarding COVID-19. Afterwards, all non-pharmaceutical measures adopted by the Government against COVID-19 are presented in chronological order. The study explores some estimations of the economic impact of the epidemic, as well as its implications for society, lifestyle, and social media reactions. Finally, the study refers to two types of mathematical models to predict the evolution of the spread of COVID-19 disease. Having considered all of the above-mentioned aspects, some significant issues can be raised, including the following: (1) the available epidemiological data presents some gaps and potential biases; (2) mathematical models always come with high levels of uncertainty; (3) the high number of deaths should be interpreted in light of the national demographic context; and (4) the long-term management of the epidemic remains an open question.

MAIN TEXT: Despite the advances in health sciences, emerging infectious diseases have become more frequent in recent decades. Furthermore, emerging and reemerging pathogens have led to several global public health challenges. A question, and to an extent a concern, arises from this: Why our health care system is experiencing several challenges in encountering the coronavirus outbreak, despite the ever-growing advances in sciences, and the exponential rise in the number of published articles in the first quartile journals and even the ones among the top 1%? CONCLUSION: Two responses could be potentially provided to the above question: First, there seems to be a significant gap between our theoretical knowledge and practice. And second that many scholars and scientists publish papers only to have a longer list of publications, and therefore publishing is viewed as a personal objective, rather than for improving communities' public health.","output":"Contradictions in the promotion of publishing academic and scientific journal articles, and the inability to cope with the new coronavirus (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Determine the feasibility, strengths, and barriers of offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) telerounding to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care providers.

The aim of this study was to investigate the sleep quality of FMS during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and analyze the relationship between mental health and sleep quality of FMS. METHODS: From February 24, 2020 to March 22, 2020, a cross-sectional study was performed with 543 FMS from a medical center in Western China. A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data anonymously. The following tests were used: The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for symptoms of anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for depressive symptoms, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality assessment. RESULTS: Of the 543 FMS, 216 (39.8%) were classified as subjects with poor sleep quality. Anxiety (P<0.001), depression (P<0.001), and the prevalence of those divorced or widowed (P<0.05) were more common in FMS with poor sleep quality than in participants with good sleep quality. The FMS exhibiting co-occurrence of anxiety and depression were associated with worse scores on sleep quality than those medical staff in the other three groups/categories. The difference in sleep quality between the FMS with only depression and the FMS experiencing co-occurrence of anxiety and depression was statistically significant (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in sleep quality between the FMS experiencing only anxiety and the FMS with co-occurrence of anxiety and depression (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a noteworthy increase in the prevalence of negative emotions and sentiments among the medical staff, along with poor overall sleep quality. We anticipate that this study can stimulate more research into the mental state of FMS during outbreaks and other public health emergencies. In addition, particular attention must be paid to enhance the sleep quality of FMS, along with better planning and support for FMS who are continuously exposed to the existing viral epidemic by virtue of the nature of their profession.","output":"The effect of mental health on sleep quality of front-line medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak in China: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease has affected the different segments of community As the positive cases are increasing day by day across the world and in India, everything should be back to new normal The community should be trained to live along with the virus During or after this pandemic, there will be a new normal life for the Indians and they will be used to these life-style changes to protect themselves and the community from communicable diseases The changes have occurred in the field of education, health sector, economic system, and the lifestyle of the people","output":"COVID-19 - a new normal Indian community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The medical authority in China, especially in Wuhan city, reported on December 2019 a large number of highly fatal, rapidly spreading viral pneumonia caused by an unknown coronavirus. The common history of all the patients was their visiting a Wuhan's whole food store, where live animals and seafood are sold. Irrespective of the efforts of the Chinese authorities, the virus spread rapidly all over the world by travelers, provoking widespread attention by the media and panic. Many previous coronavirus epidemics had been recorded, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recently newly discovered epidemic is named coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). This disease is caused by SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and this virus is antigenically related to the SARS virus (SARS-CoV), which had been detected in 2002, depending on clinical, serological, and molecular findings. There is rapid competition among the researchers to discover the source of the virus, understand the mechanism of the disease development, establish treatment strategies, and determine the factors affecting the incidence of infection and severity of the disease, and focus on the production of a vaccine. Coronaviruses are a group of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome viruses; its genome length varies from 26 to 32 kb. Coronavirus causes mild to severe respiratory disorders. In December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown causes were found in Wuhan city, which is located in the Hubei province in China. Chinese health authorities investigated the problem and found that a new virus caused such infection and, using next-generation sequencing, found the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It has been transferred from humans to humans and animals to humans (zoonotic). Coronaviruses cause multiple respiratory problems, varying from common cold to severe infections such as SARS. General symptoms of infection include fatigue, cough, and breathing problems such as shortness of breath, as described by World Health Organization. Serious cases may result in pneumonia, renal failure, and even death.

The purpose of this review is to examine the extant literature on the reliability of ICD codes to correctly identify STIs. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of empirical articles in which ICD codes were validated with respect to their ability to identify cases of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Articles that included sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of ICD codes were the target. In addition to keyword searches in PubMed and Scopus databases, we further examined bibliographies of articles selected for full review to maximise yield. RESULTS From a total of 1779 articles identified, only two studies measured the reliability of ICD codes to identify cases of STIs. Both articles targeted PID, a serious complication of chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Neither article directly assessed the validity of ICD codes to identify cases of chlamydia, gonorrhoea or syphilis independent of PID. Using ICD codes alone, the positive predictive value for PID was mixed (range: 18%-79%).

Results show that e-shopping motivates shopping trips, and in-store shopping inhibits online shopping. It can be obtained that the increase of one standard deviation of e-shopping will increase the shopping trip by 0.17 standard deviation. When shopping trips increase by one standard deviation, e-shopping behavior also decreases by 0.12 standard deviation. The results also demonstrated that e-shopping and shopping travel behavior is heterogeneous across a variety of exogenous factors such as personal attributes, household characteristics, geography, travel distance/duration, and travel mode.

Current therapeutic options include microsurgical resection, radiosurgery (focused radiation), and endovascular embolization. Endovascular embolization is primarily used as a preoperative adjuvant before microsurgery or radiosurgery. Palliative embolization has been used successfully to reduce the risk of hemorrhage, alleviate clinical symptoms, and preserve or improve neurological function in inoperable or nonradiosurgical AVMs. Less frequently, embolization is used as 'primary therapy' particularly for smaller, surgically difficult lesions. Current embolic agents used to treat brain AVMs include both solid and liquid agents. Liquid agents including N-butyl cyanoacrylate and Onyx are the most commonly used agents.

Adamantane resistance is associated with a single amino acid change (S31N) in the M2 protein, which was shown to rapidly disseminate globally in 2005 in association with a genome reassortment event. However, the exact origin of influenza A/H3N2 viruses carrying the S31N mutation has not been characterized, particularly in South-East Asia. We therefore conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the HA, NA, and M1/2 segments of viral isolates collected between 1997-2007 from temperate localities in the Northern hemisphere (New York State, United States, 492 isolates) and Southern hemisphere (New Zealand and Australia, 629 isolates) and a subtropical locality in South-East Asia (Hong Kong, 281 isolates). We find that although the S31N mutation was independently introduced at least 11 times, the vast majority of resistant viruses now circulating globally descend from a single introduction that was first detected in the summer of 2003 in Hong Kong. These resistant viruses were continually detected in Hong Kong throughout 2003-2005, acquired a novel HA through reassortment during the first part of 2005, and thereafter spread globally. The emergence and persistence of adamantane-resistant viruses in Hong Kong further supports a source-sink model of global influenza virus ecology, in which South-East Asia experiences continuous viral activity and repeatedly seeds epidemics in temperate areas.","output":"The origin and global emergence of adamantane resistant A/H3N2 influenza viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lack of awareness of cognitive impairment (i.e. anosognosia) could be a key factor for distinguishing between neuropsychological post-COVID-19 condition phenotypes.

A battery of neuropsychological, psychiatric, olfactory, dyspnoea, fatigue and quality-of-life tests was administered 227.07  42.69 days post-SARS-CoV-2 infection to 102 patients (mean age: 56.35 years, 65 men, no history of neurological, psychiatric, neuro-oncological or neurodevelopmental disorder prior to infection) who had experienced either a mild (not hospitalized; n = 45), moderate (conventional hospitalization; n = 34) or severe (hospitalization with intensive care unit stay and mechanical ventilation; n = 23) presentation in the acute phase. Patients were first divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of anosognosia for memory deficits (26 anosognosic patients and 76 nosognosic patients). Of these, 49 patients underwent an MRI. Structural images were visually analysed, and statistical intergroup analyses were then performed on behavioural and functional connectivity measures. Only 15.6% of patients who presented mild disease displayed anosognosia for memory dysfunction, compared with 32.4% of patients with moderate presentation and 34.8% of patients with severe disease. Compared with nosognosic patients, those with anosognosia for memory dysfunction performed significantly more poorly on objective cognitive and olfactory measures. By contrast, they gave significantly more positive subjective assessments of their quality of life, psychiatric status and fatigue. Interestingly, the proportion of patients exhibiting a lack of consciousness of olfactory deficits was significantly higher in the anosognosic group.

Molecular dynamics simulation in aqueous milieu aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel axial frequency distribution (AFD) analytical tool.

Clinical Quality Assurance (QA) practices used to detect underreporting rely on on-site audits, however adverse events underreporting remains a recurrent issue. In a recent project, we developed a predictive model that enables oversight of Adverse Event (AE) reporting for clinical Quality Program Leads (QPL). However, there were limitations to using solely a machine learning model. Objective Our primary objective was to propose a robust method to compute the probability of AE underreporting that could complement our machine learning model. Our model was developed to enhance patients safety while reducing the need for on-site and manual QA activities in clinical trials. Methods We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the site reporting rates and assess the risk of underreporting. We designed the model with Project Data Sphere clinical trial data that is public and anonymized. Outcome With the resulting reporting rates and metrics, we could focus quality assurance strategic activities for clinical trials on the investigator sites with the highest risk of underreporting. Conclusion The new model will be integrated into the current dashboard designed for clinical Quality Program Leads. This approach reduces the need for on-site audits, shifting focus from source data verification (SDV) to pre-identified, higher risk areas. It will enhance further quality assurance activities for safety reporting from clinical trials and generate quality evidence during pre-approval inspections.","output":"Bayesian modeling for the detection of adverse events underreporting in clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence that patients with Latent Tuberculosis Infection(LTBI) and Tuberculosis(TB) disease have an increased risk of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and predisposition towards developing severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study we attempted to estimate the number of TB patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have severe disease during the COVID-19 epidemic in Delhi, India. METHODS: Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model was used to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi. Assuming the prevalence of TB in Delhi to be 0.55%, 53% of SARS-CoV2 infected TB cases to present with severe disease we estimated the number of SARS-CoV2 infected TB cases and the number of severe patients. The modelling used estimated R(0) for two scenarios, without any intervention and with public health interventions. RESULTS: We observed that the peak of SARS-CoV-2-TB co-infected patients would occur on the 94th day in absence of public health interventions and on 138(th) day in presence of interventions. There could be 20,880 SARS-CoV-2 infected TB cases on peak day of epidemic when interventions are implemented and 27,968 cases in the absence of intervention. Among them, there could be 14,823 patients with severe disease when no interventions are implemented and 11,066 patients with severe disease in the presence of intervention. CONCLUSION: The importance of primary prevention measures needs to be emphasized especially in TB patients. The TB treatment centres and hospitals needs to be prepared for early diagnosis and management of severe COVID-19 in TB patients.","output":"COVID-19 and Tuberculosis: A mathematical model based forecasting in Delhi, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is known to be a factor in morbidity and mortality associated with acute viral infections including those caused by filoviruses and coronaviruses. IL-6 has been implicated as a cytokine negatively associated with survival after filovirus and coronavirus infection. However, IL-6 has also been shown to be an important mediator of innate immunity and important for the host response to an acute viral infection. Clinical studies are now being conducted by various researchers to evaluate the possible role of IL-6 blockers to improve outcomes in critically ill patients with CRS. Most of these studies involve the use of anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies (-IL-6R mAbs). We present data showing that direct neutralization of IL-6 with an -IL-6 mAb in a BALB/c Ebolavirus (EBOV) challenge model produced a statistically significant improvement in outcome compared with controls when administered within the first 24 hours of challenge and repeated every 72 hours. A similar effect was seen in mice treated with the same dose of -IL-6R mAb when the treatment was delayed 48 hrs post-challenge. These data suggest that direct neutralization of IL-6, early during the course of infection, may provide additional clinical benefits to IL-6 receptor blockade alone during treatment of patients with virus-induced CRS.","output":"anti-IL-6 versus anti-IL-6R Blocking Antibodies to Treat Acute Ebola Infection in BALB/c Mice with Potential Implications for Treating Patients Presenting with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Quarantine is a useful measure for preventing and controlling pandemics; however, it might be stressful for quarantined individuals. Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming. These emotions were reported for individuals in involuntary quarantine facilities dedicated to quarantine purposes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed the individuals in involuntary quarantine institutions (for a planned period of 14 days of quarantine) in two regions of Saudi Arabia. The mental health status of individuals was assessed using the Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: The study surveyed 214 quarantined/isolated individuals. The stress, anxiety, and depression rates were 25.7%, 21.5%, and 32.7%, respectively. On the IES-R, 28.0% of the participants met the criteria for psychological distress. Female gender, self-reported history of psychiatric disorder, and average health status were significantly associated with negative psychological impact and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (p<0.05). Watching television was found to be a factor in reducing rates on the IES-R and DASS-21 scale while working out lowered rates on the IES-R alone (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: During an institutional involuntary quarantine, additional attention should be paid to vulnerable groups like females and individuals with a history of psychiatric illness. More than one-fourth of our sample experienced a negative psychological impact; therefore, coping practices like working out should be encouraged. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion about the psychological aspects of being quarantined.

To investigate the role of viruses in diabetes, we used a model of viral induction of autoimmune diabetes in genetically susceptible biobreeding diabetes-resistant (BBDR) rats. BBDR rats do not develop diabetes in viral-Ab-free environments, but approximately 25% of animals infected with the parvovirus Kilham rat virus (KRV) develop autoimmune diabetes via a mechanism that does not involve beta cell infection. Using this model, we recently documented that TLR agonists synergize with KRV infection and increase disease penetrance. We now report that KRV itself activates innate immunity through TLR ligation. We show that KRV infection strongly stimulates BBDR splenocytes to produce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12p40 but not TNF-alpha. KRV infection induces high levels of IL-12p40 by splenic B cells and Flt-3-ligand-induced bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) but only low levels of IL-12p40 production by thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages or GM-CSF plus IL-4-induced bone marrow-derived DCs. KRV-induced cytokine production is blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of protein kinase R and NF-kappaB. Genomic KRV DNA also induces BBDR splenocytes and Flt-3L-induced DCs from wild-type but not TLR9-deficient mice to produce IL-12p40; KRV-induced up-regulation of B lymphocytes can be blocked by TLR9 antagonists including inhibitory CpG and chloroquine.

METHODS: We performed a systematic search resulting in 10 studies reporting stroke frequency among COVID-19 patients, which were pooled with one unpublished series from Canada. We applied random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the proportion of stroke among COVID-19. We performed an additional systematic search for cases series of stroke in COVID-19 patients (n=125) and we pooled these data with 35 unpublished cases from Canada, USA, and Iran. We analyzed clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality stratified into age groups (<50, 50-70, >70 years). We applied cluster analyses to identify specific clinical phenotypes and their relationship with death. RESULTS: The proportion of COVID-19 patients with stroke (1.8%, 95%CI 0.9-3.7%) and in-hospital mortality (34.4%, 95%CI 27.2-42.4%) were exceedingly high. Mortality was 67% lower in patients <50 years-old relative to those >70 years-old (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.94, P=0.039).

Unfortunately, many hermatypic corals in aquaria are not identified to species level, which hinders assessment of their conservation significance. Traditional methods of species identification using morphology can be challenging, especially to non-taxonomists. DNA barcoding is an option for species identification of Scleractinian corals, especially when used in concert with morphology-based assessment. This study uses DNA barcodes to try to identify aquarium specimens of the diverse reef-forming genus Acropora from 127 samples. We identified to our best current knowledge, to species name 44% of the analysed samples and provided provisional identification for 80% of them (101/127, in the form of a list of species names with associate confidence values). We highlighted a sampling bias in public nucleotide sequences repertories (e.g. GenBank) towards more charismatic and more studied species, even inside a well-studied genus like Acropora. In addition, we showed a potential single observer effect with over a quarter of the reference sequences used for these identifications coming from the same study. We propose the use of barcoding and query matching as an additional tool for taxonomic experts and general aquarists, as an additional tool to increase their chances of making high confidence species-level identifications.

Cognitive status worsened by 22 and 25.9% according to the global deterioration scale (p < 0.001) and Lobos Mini-Examen Cognoscitivo (p 0.01), respectively. Onset of depressive symptoms was found in 48% (p < 0.001). The prevalence of malnutrition increased by 36.8 and 38.4% lost weight. When comparing the functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients no clinical or statistically significant differences were found except for the presence of prior malnutrition, higher in the COVID-19 group. CONCLUSION: We observed a significative functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline in institutionalized elderly after the first wave of COVID-19. These results may be caused by the lockdown itself, since no differences have been found between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. According to these results, interventions are necessary during social isolation or confinement to prevent systemic decline in the elderly.","output":"Functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline in 435 elderly nursing home residents after the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?3 (PPAR?3) is an intracellular transcription factor whose signaling activation by the selective agonist pioglitazone reduces alcohol drinking and alcohol-seeking behavior in rats. The present study utilized the two-bottle choice and operant self-administration procedures to investigate neuroanatomical substrates that mediate the effects of PPAR?3 agonism on alcohol drinking and seeking in msP rats. Bilateral infusions of pioglitazone (0, 5, and 10 g/l) in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) decreased voluntary alcohol drinking and alcohol self-administration. Microinjections of pioglitazone in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), central amygdala (CeA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell had no such effect. Notably, water, food, and saccharin consumption was unaltered by either treatment. The yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking was prevented by infusions of pioglitazone (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 g/l) in the CeA, VTA, and RMTg but not in the NAc shell. These results emphasize the involvement of mesocorticolimbic circuitries in mediating the effects of PPAR?3 agonists on alcohol drinking and seeking. These results will facilitate future studies that investigate the pathophysiological role of PPAR?3 in alcohol use disorder and help clarify the mechanisms by which the activation of this receptor decreases the motivation for drinking.","output":"Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?3 reduces alcohol drinking and seeking by modulating multiple mesocorticolimbic regions in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an association with acute viral infection of the respiratory tract and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Recently, æ T cells have been demonstrated as professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs); however, their role in sepsis remains unknown. In this in vitro study, the APC function of human peripheral æ T cells was assessed using samples collected from 42 patients with sepsis and 27 age-matched healthy controls. The APC-related markers HLA-DR, CD27, CD80, and CCR7 on fresh æT cells were significantly higher in patients with sepsis compared with matched controls; however, they responded poorly to 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butenyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP) stimulation, characterized by the deactivation of these APC markers and impaired proliferation. Furthermore, the adhesion function of æ T cells, essential for antigen presentation, was greatly reduced in patients with sepsis; for instance, in co-cultures with green fluorescent protein-expressing Escherichia coli, HMBPP-activated æT cells from healthy individuals adhered to E. coli efficiently, whereas no such phenomenon was observed with respect to æT cells from patients with sepsis. In line with these results, in co-cultures with isolated CD4(+)  T cells, HMBPP-activated æT cells of healthy individuals promoted the efficient proliferation of CD4(+)  T cells, whereas æT cells from patients with sepsis did not do so. In conclusion, our findings show that the antigen-presenting function of æT cells is severely impaired in patients with sepsis and the mechanisms behind need further study.","output":"Impairment of antigen-presenting function of peripheral æ T cells in patients with sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The expansion of endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery has resulted in an increased demand for reconstructive options. Reconstruction with vascularized tissue has proven indispensable for reliably separating the cranial contents from the paranasal sinuses following extended endoscopic endonasal approaches (EEA). The introduction of the Hadad-Bassagasteguy flap (vascular pedicle nasoseptal flap, HBF) at our institution decreased our postoperative cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak rates from more than 20% to less than 5%. The HBF is not always available, as the nasoseptal area or its vascular supply can be compromised by tumor or prior surgery. In an attempt to keep pace with rapidly expanding reconstructive requirements, we present the anatomic and cadaveric foundations for novel modifications of the facial artery musculo (-mucosal) (FAM[M]) and buccinator flaps to allow vascularized reconstruction of the skull base. STUDY DESIGN Feasibility. Cadaveric study. METHODS Using cadaver dissections and measurements, we investigated the feasibility of transposing pedicled buccinator myo/myomucosal flaps into the nasal cavity and skull base. Both muscular and myomuscular flaps were raised, and techniques for transposition into the nasal cavity were investigated. Three fresh and six preserved human specimens were dissected. RESULTS Pedicled facial buccinator flaps with and without mucosa were transposed into the nasal cavity using a variety of maxillary osteotomies. No facial incisions were required. It was demonstrated that the flaps reach the anterior skull base and planum sphenoidale. CONCLUSIONS The transposition of pedicled buccinator muscle flaps with and without mucosa into the nasal cavity could reach the anterior skull base and planum sphenoidale, if the appropriate surgical technique is used. The pedicled Facial Buccinator Flap holds significant potential as a reconstructive alternative for a variety of skull base defects, alone or in combination with existing reconstructive options. 2010.","output":"Pedicled facial buccinator (FAB) flap: a new flap for reconstruction of skull base defects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The U S government declared the opioid epidemic as a national public health emergency in 2017, but regulatory frameworks that govern the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) through pharmaceutical interventions have remained inflexible The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has effectively removed regulatory restrictions that experts in the field of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) have been proposing for decades and has expanded access to care The regulatory flexibilities implemented to avoid unnecessary COVID-related death must be made permanent to ensure that improved access to evidence-based treatment remains available to vulnerable individuals with OUD who otherwise face formidable barriers to MOUD We must seize this moment of COVOD-19 regulatory flexibilities to demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of delivering treatment for OUD through a low-threshold approach","output":"Leveraging COVID-19 to sustain regulatory flexibility in the treatment of opioid use disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To determine whether there is a disparity in access to telemedical care that may be a function of socioeconomic status, language, or other demographic factors during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at a highly affected urban center (Montefiore Medical Center) in Bronx, NY. Methods We retrospectively investigated potential patient characteristics that might be associated with an increased likelihood of receiving a telephone visit as opposed to a televideo visit for patients followed in the pediatric neurology, adult epilepsy, and general neurology practices at Montefiore Medical Center during the 30-day period starting April 2, 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. Results We found that patients who had telephone encounters, as opposed to televideo encounters, were overall older, less likely to have commercial insurance, and more likely to have Medicaid. Among pediatric patients, a preferred language other than English was also associated with a higher proportion of telephone encounters. New patients in both the adult and pediatric groups were more likely to have televideo visits. Conclusions Our findings identify demographic factors, including age, insurance type, and language preference, which may play a role in access to televideo encounters among neurology patients in an urban center during the COVID-19 pandemic.

STUDY DESIGN: Simulation series with fluorescent 3-dimensional (3D) printed sinonasal models and deidentified cadaveric heads. SETTINGS: Dedicated surgical laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cadaveric specimens irrigated with fluorescent tracer and fluorescent 3D-printed models were drilled. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets of various aerodynamic diameters under 15 m. Large droplet generation was measured by evaluating the field for fluorescent debris. Aerosol plumes through the nares were generated via nebulizer, and mitigation measures, including suction and SPIWay devices, nasal sheaths, were evaluated regarding reduction of aerosol escape from the nose. RESULTS: The drilling of cadaveric specimens without flexible suction generated aerosols 3.30 m, and drilling of 3D sinonasal models consistently produced aerosols 14.1 m. Mitigation with SPIWay or diameter-restricted SPIWay produced same results. There was minimal field contamination in the cadaveric models, 0% to 2.77% field tarp area, regardless of drill burr type or drilling location; cutting burr drilling without suction in the 3D model yielded the worst contamination field (36.1%), followed by coarse diamond drilling without suction (19.4%). The simple placement of a flexible suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx led to complete elimination of all aerosols 14.1 m, as evaluated by a cascade impactor positioned immediately at the nares.

Initially, the patient was fixed in a semiprone position, from which he could be rotated to a prone or left lateral position. Four ports were inserted, and then the patient was rotated to the prone position. Once the patient was prone, gravity caused the lung to move downwards. Next, the chest cavity was inflated with a CO(2) insufflation pressure of 6 mm Hg. Esophagectomy was then performed, and the lymph nodes in the middle and lower mediastinum and along the right recurrent laryngeal nerve were dissected. In the left upper mediastinum, lymph node dissection was performed after the residual esophagus was stripped. Stripping of the residual esophagus created sufficient working space and a clear operative field for lymph node dissection. VATS-E in the prone position has achieved remarkable results in Japan. It allows a clear operative view of the middle and lower mediastinum, but the working space in the upper mediastinum is limited.

In this article, we analyze the state-level correlation between COVID-19 risk and weather/climate factors in the USA. For this purpose, we consider a spatio-temporal multivariate time series model under a hierarchical framework, which is especially suitable for envisioning the virus transmission tendency across a geographic area over time. Briefly, our model decomposes the COVID-19 risk into: (i) an autoregressive component that describes the within-state COVID-19 risk effect; (ii) a spatiotemporal component that describes the across-state COVID-19 risk effect; (iii) an exogenous component that includes other factors (e.g., weather/climate) that could envision future epidemic development risk; and (iv) an endemic component that captures the function of time and other predictors mainly for individual states. Our results indicate that maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, the percentage of cloud coverage, and the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone have a strong association with the COVID-19 pandemic in many states. In particular, the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone demonstrate statistically significant associations with the tendency of COVID-19 spreading in almost all states. Furthermore, our results from transmission tendency analysis suggest that the community-level transmission has been relatively mitigated in the USA, and the daily confirmed cases within a state are predominated by the earlier daily confirmed cases within that state compared to other factors, which implies that states such as Texas, California, and Florida with a large number of confirmed cases still need strategies like stay-at-home orders to prevent another outbreak.","output":"Analysis of the Spread of COVID-19 in the USA with a Spatio-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the relative ubiquity of smartphones, contact tracing and exposure notification apps have been looked to as novel methods to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the COVID-19 Citizen Science Study, launched in March 2020, which recruited participants via press release, word-of-mouth, and partner organizations. Participants completed daily surveys about COVID-19 symptoms and weekly surveys about coronavirus testing. All adults (aged at least 18 years) with a smartphone were eligible to join. For this analysis, US participants with new onset of febrile illness from April 2020 to October 2020 were included. Data analysis was performed from November 2020 to March 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Receipt of a coronavirus test result within 7 days of febrile illness onset. RESULTS: Of the 2679 participants included in this analysis, the mean (SD) age was 46.3 (13.4) years, 1983 were female (74%), 2017 were college educated (75%), and a total of 3865 distinct new febrile illness episodes were reported (300 episodes [7.8%] from Hispanic participants, 71 episodes [1.8%] from Black participants, and 3494 episodes [90.4%] from not Black, not Hispanic participants) between April 2 and October 23, 2020. In weekly surveys delivered during the 14 days after fever onset, 12% overall (753 participants) indicated receipt of a test result. Using serial survey responses and parametric time-to-event modeling, it was estimated that by 7 days after onset of febrile illness, a total of 20.5% (95% CI, 19.1%-22.0%) had received a test result. This proportion increased from 9.8% (95% CI, 7.5%-12.0%) early in the epidemic to 24.1% (95% CI, 21.5%-26.7%) at the end of July, but testing rates did not substantially improve since then, increasing to 25.9% (95% CI; 21.6%-30.3%) in late October at the start of the winter surge.

METHODS: A questionnaire designed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists was adapted and circulated to consultant members of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland following the easing of restrictions. The questionnaire assessed the perceived impact on referral rates, mental health act provision, availability of information technology (IT), consultant well-being and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Thematic analysis was employed to analyse free-text sections. RESULTS: Response rate was 32% (n = 197/623). Consultants reported an initial decrease/significant decrease in referrals in the first month of lockdown (68%, n = 95/140) followed by an increase/significant increase in the second month for both new (83%, n = 100/137) and previously attending patients (65%, n = 88/136).

The author demonstrates how environmental factors negatively impact internal processes, such as anxiety and low self-esteem. It looks at the various external factors that have led to a significant rise in perfectionism among the age group, such as a tougher social and economic environment, changes in parental rearing practices, social media and the way that young people come to define themselves narrowly by wealth and success. This is further exacerbated by the financial and psychological repercussions of the COVID-19 crisis on young people. The author explores her clinical experience as a psychotherapist working with young adults who never feel good enough. The paper will suggest that parents, schools, universities, and employers need to understand that pushing for ever higher standards is problematic and proposes ways to help young adults to value themselves and be more resilient in tackling disappointments and challenges.","output":"I will never be good enough!!

This study reflects on the multiple impacts of Covid-19 on African economy and suggests a pathway for its revitalization in the post Covid-19 environment. Undoubtedly, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world to a temporary halt, with its attendant bruises mostly notable on the economies of almost all African countries. This paper empirically analyse the incapacitation of African states in providing some strategic responses to the economic wreckages caused by the pandemic. Using technological-determinism as a theoretical framework, this study suggests the technological-innovation pathway as a bridge between the pandemic-induced economic circumstances and prosperity for Africa. Sequentially, the five junctions on the pathway splits as pulling, recovery, innovations, growth, and sustainability (PRIGS), but, however, the kernel of the discussion revolves around the commodification of innovation (technology) for Africa's economic growth and development. This study concludes, the five junctions on the PRIGS' highway absorbs the current developmental challenges of African states and hence, recommends an alternative roadmap for Africa, in its long-term quest and vision for development.","output":"The tech-novation pathway from pandemic to prosperity: a post COVID-19 roadmap for African economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tracheostomies are often utilized in critically ill patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation, to enhance respiratory function and facilitate ventilator weaning. Many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop serious respiratory illness requiring ventilator management. In the early phase of this pandemic, the risk of disease spread lead to the development of conservative guidelines which advocated delaying tracheostomy at least two to three weeks from intubation and, preferably, with negative COVID-19 testing. The morbidly obese patient population, however, presents a unique scenario in which early tracheostomy may be beneficial. In this article, we discuss our institution's current practices along with clinical outcomes with reference to intensive care literature and propose that early tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients should be considered on a case by case basis.","output":"Early Tracheostomy in Morbidly Obese COVID-19 Patients: A Case Series and Discussion of Institutional Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiology.

Here we report a design of an all-printed stretchable corneal sensor built on commercially-available disposable soft contact lenses that can intimately and non-invasively interface with the corneal surface of human eyes. The corneal sensor is integrated with soft contact lenses via an electrochemical anchoring mechanism in a seamless manner that ensures its mechanical and chemical reliability. Thus, the resulting device enables the high-fidelity recording of full-field electroretinogram signals in human eyes without the need of topical anesthesia or a speculum. The device, superior to clinical standards in terms of signal quality and comfortability, is expected to address unmet clinical needs in the field of ocular electrodiagnosis.","output":"All-printed stretchable corneal sensor on soft contact lenses for noninvasive and painless ocular electrodiagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?sszefoglal.

Revealing the health effects associated with smoking has been in the focus of intense research for decades. Due to these research efforts, there is a convincing evidence regarding the negative effects of conventional cigarettes. However, much less is known about the replacement products such as electronic cigarettes. Moreover, the effects of waterpipes are also not fully explored, in spite of their long history. The scope of the present work is to survey the open literature to map the knowledge related to the health effects of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes and waterpipes. The analysis of the related scientific literature was performed based on papers retrieved in large publication repositories. Based on the reviewed literature, long-term smoking has demonstrated adverse effects on the respiratory as well as the heart and circulatory systems. In addition, the correlation between cigarette smoking and some gastroenterological and neurological diseases is also increasingly evident. By the same token, though the acute effects of e-cigarette and waterpipe are well documented, the protracted effects are still to be explored. The lack of pertinent information regarding the late effects of e-cigarette and hookah does not imply that there is no health risk associated with their consumption. On the contrary, in addition to the regular antismoke measures, pulmonologists and policy makers should do everything to lower the consumption of these alternative products.

It was originally based on combining practitioner communication skills with participatory methods to facilitate the involvement of animal caretakers and owners (embracing their knowledge, experience, and motivations) in the identification and assessment of animal disease problems, including in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of disease control programs, policies, and strategies. With the importance of understanding social perceptions and drivers receiving increasing recognition by epidemiologists, PE tools are being adapted for an increasingly wide range of settings and endeavors. More recently, PE tools have been adapted for use in food and nutrition security programs, One Health activities, wildlife disease surveillance and as part of mixed-methods research across a range of socio-economic settings. This review describes the evolution of PE (in relation to veterinary epidemiology and briefly in relation to public health epidemiology), the underpinning philosophy and principles essential to its effective application and the importance of gender-sensitive approaches and data triangulation, including conventional confirmatory testing. The article also provides illustrative examples highlighting the diversity of approaches and applications of PE, hallmarks of successful PE initiatives and the lessons we can learn when these are missing. Finally, we look forward, describing the particular utility of PE for dealing with emerging infectious diseases, gaining attention of field-level cross-sector officials who can escalate concerns to a higher level and for continuing to raise the voices of those less-heard (such as women, minority groups, and remote communities with limited exposure to formal education) in defining the problems and planning activities that will likely impact directly on their well-being and livelihoods.","output":"Participatory Epidemiology: Principles, Practice, Utility, and Lessons Learnt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Chest radiographic (CXR) features, particularly portable CXR findings, of COVID-19 have not yet been systematically described, either as a baseline tool or as a follow-up method, despite the continuing global pandemic. There is a marked paucity of articles detailing the CXR findings vis--vis a multitude of articles dedicated to the CT features of COVID-19. The purpose of this article is to describe the morphological and distributional patterns of the lung opacities in CXR and to classify the spectrum of essential features on portable AP chest radiographs of PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital in Scandinavia. To our knowledge, this is the first article to describe the morphological and topographical features of CXRs in COVID-19-positive cases. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of twenty (20) RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital between 12.03.2020 to 10.04.2020 was done in this study. Morphology and distribution of the opacities were reviewed by two senior consultants and analysed for patterns. RESULTS: Most patients had ground-glass opacities (80-85%) and interspersed interstitial opacities (70-75%), often with a characteristic appearance. The opacities were mostly bilateral (80%) and distributed in the lower zones (and to some extent mid zones) and in the middle and peripheral regions, with a tendency to merge towards the hilar areas. There were high interobserver agreements among various parameters and no significant statistical difference between observer 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: Chest radiographics show characteristic patterns and distributions, which can be used as an adjunct in the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 patients in specific clinical contexts.","output":"Morphological patterns and distributions in portable chest radiographs of COVID-19-positive cases admitted to a tertiary care hospital: An early experience from Scandinavia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During New Zealands first outbreak in early 2020 the Southern Region had the highest per capita SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was initially limited by a narrow Case definition and limited laboratory capacity, and cases may have been missed. Our objectives were to evaluate the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assay, alongside spike-based assays, and to determine the frequency of antibodies among PCR-confirmed and probable cases, and higher risk individuals in the Southern Region of New Zealand. Pre-pandemic sera (n=300) were used to establish assay specificity and sera from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (I=78) to establish sensitivity. For prevalence analysis, all samples (n=1214) were tested on the Abbott assay, and all PCR-confirmed cases (n=78), probable cases (n=9), and higher risk individuals with grey-zone (n=14) or positive results (n=11) were tested on four additional SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. The median time from infection onset to serum collection for PCR-confirmed cases was 14 weeks (range 11C17 weeks). The Abbott assay demonstrated a specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.2C99.99%) and a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI 66.0C85.7%). Spike-based assays demonstrated superior sensitivity ranging 89.7C94.9%. Nine previously undiagnosed sero-positive individuals were identified, and all had epidemiological risk factors.

The INDSCI-SIM model is a 9-component, age-stratified, contact-structured compartmental model for COVID-19 spread in India. We use INDSCI-SIM, together with Bayesian methods, to obtain optimal fits to reported cases and deaths across the span of the first wave of the Indian pandemic, over the period Jan 30, 2020 to Feb 15, 2021. We account for lock-downs and other non-pharmaceutical interventions, an overall increase in testing as a function of time, the under-counting of cases and deaths, and a range of age-specific infection-fatality ratios. We first use our model to describe data from all individual districts of the state of Karnataka, benchmarking our calculations using data from serological surveys. We then extend this approach to aggregated data for Karnataka state. We model the progress of the pandemic across the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai, and then for India as a whole. We estimate that deaths were undercounted by a factor between 2 and 5 across the span of the first wave, converging on 2.2 as a representative multiplier that accounts for the urban-rural gradient across the country. We also estimate an overall under-counting of cases by a factor of between 20 and 25 towards the end of the first wave. Our estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) are in the range 0.05 - 0.15, broadly consistent with previous estimates but substantially lower than values that have been estimated for other LMIC countries. We find that approximately 40% of India had been infected overall by the end of the first wave, results broadly consistent with those from serosurveys.

Introduction: In Argentina, the quality of care that elderly subjects with dementia living in the community received has been deeply affected by COVID-19 epidemic. Our objective was to study to what extend mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 had affected behavioral symptoms in subjects with dementia after the first 8 weeks of quarantine. Methods: Relatives of 119 patients with Alzheimer-type Dementia or related disorders living in the community were invited to participate anonymously and voluntarily in an exploratory, cross-sectional and synchronous survey. Characteristics of people with dementia and their caregivers were analyzed with descriptive statistics using the chi-square tests, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Mean age: 81.16 (7.03), 35% of the subjects had more than 85 years of age. Diagnosis were 67% Alzheimers dementia and 26% mixed Alzheimers disease. Stages were 34.5% mild cases, 32% intermediate stage, and 33% severe cases as per Clinical dementia Rating score. In 67% of the sample, a family member was the main caregiver. Important findings were increased anxiety (43% of the sample), insomnia (28% of the subjects), depression (29%), worsening gait disturbance (41%), and increase use of psychotropics to control behavioral symptoms. Behavioral symptoms were more prevalent in subjects with mild dementia compared to subjects with severe dementia. Rehabilitation services had been discontinued in most subjects due to the quarantine. COVID-19 confinement increased stress caregiver (t= -8.657, p<0.001). Conclusion: We concluded from our analysis that during COVID-19 epidemic there was a deterioration of behavioral symptoms in our population of elderly dementia subjects living in the community. Perhaps, our findings are related to a combination of social isolation, lack of outpatient rehabilitation services, and increased stress of family caregivers. It is necessary to develop a plan of action to help dementia subjects deal with the increased stress that this epidemic imposed on them.","output":"COVID-19 y adultos mayores con deterioro cognitivo: ?puede influir el aislamiento social en la enfermedad?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Indication for invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia has been a major challenge. This study aimed to evaluate if lung ultrasound (LUS) can assist identification of requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 23 and November 12, 2020, hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (oxygen demand &#8805;4 L/min) were included consecutively. Lung ultrasound was performed daily until invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV-group) or spontaneous recovery (non-IMV-group). Clinical parameters and lung ultrasound findings were compared between groups, at intubation (IMV-group) and highest oxygen demand (non-IMV-group). A reference group with oxygen demand <4 L/min was examined at hospital admission. RESULTS: Altogether 72 patients were included: 50 study patients (IMV-group, n = 23; non-IMV-group, n = 27) and 22 reference patients. LUS-score correlated to oxygen demand (SpO2 /FiO2 -ratio) (r = 0.728; p < 0.0001) and was higher in the IMV-group compared to the non-IMV-group (20.0 versus 18.0; p = 0.026). Based on receiver operating characteristic analysis, a LUS-score of 19.5 was identified as cut-off for requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (area under the curve 0.68; sensitivity 56%, specificity 74%). In 6 patients, LUS identified critical coexisting conditions. Respiratory rate and oxygenation index ((SpO2 /FiO2 )/respiratory rate) &#8805;4.88 identified no requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation with a positive predictive value of 87% and negative predictive value of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: LUS-score had only a moderate diagnostic value for requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID-19.

The objective of this study was to identify readily available clinical parameters to discriminate between them. METHODS: During a winter period all consecutive patients with an AECOP who were hospitalized in a non-ICU general ward were prospectively enrolled. In addition to blood tests, cultures of spontaneous or induced sputum samples, and genome detection of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swab samples using multiplex RT-PCR assays were obtained. Only patients with positive microbiological results (bacteria, virus, or both) were eventually included. Mixed infections (bacteria plus viruses) were categorized into the bacterial group due to therapeutic implications (ie, need for antibiotics). Demographic and routine clinical and analytical information was collected. RESULTS: A total of 127 AECOPD patients out of 213 initially evaluated met inclusion criteria and were classified as having bacterial (70, 55.1%) or viral (57, 44.9%) infection. Although no single variable was useful to identify bacteria, the combination of serum C-reactive protein >70 mg/L (2 points), >1 day of symptoms (1.5 points), and a blood neutrophil count >9,500 x10(9)/L (1 point) into a scoring system reached an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI=0.73C0.88) for bacterial etiologies. With this model, scoring 0 or 1 point significantly reduced the probability of a bacterial infection (likelihood ratio negative of 0.2), whereas summing up 2.5 points or more increased it sufficiently to be clinically meaningful (likelihood ratio positive >3.7). Viral infections resulted in fewer hospitalization days (78.9% of patients spent 3 days in hospital vs 95.7% of those with bacterial infections; P=0.008).

CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old Caucasian man with a past history of tetrahydrocannabinol vaping and benzodiazepine and methamphetamine abuse presented to the emergency department of our institution with a complaint of feeling malnourished over the past 5 days, along with associated fevers, cough, and vomiting. His past medical, surgical, family, and social histories were significant only for the recent use of marijuana vaping pens. Upon initial presentation, the patient appeared to be in significant respiratory distress. A computed tomographic scan of his chest demonstrated diffuse central predominant interstitial opacities, and he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, where he was eventually intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. No other cause of his respiratory failure was found, and it was ultimately believed that the patient had sustained a vaping-associated lung injury. CONCLUSION: Tetrahydrocannabinol-containing vaping-associated lung injury is still poorly understood overall and is currently being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the meantime, physicians should consider vaping to be a public health emergency. We summarize the appropriate history, physical examination, appropriate workup, and therapies that physicians should be aware of in order to appropriately manage and treat patients presenting with suspected vaping-associated lung injury.","output":"A 23-year-old man with acute lung injury after using a tetrahydrocannabinol-containing vaping device: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Covid-19 pandemic, universities in the UK used social media to raise awareness and provide guidance and advice about the disease to students and staff.

In order to confirm our results, we supplemented our analysis with a study of the introduction of coronavirus-related university webpages. We find that universities with large numbers of students are more likely to use social media and the web to speak about the pandemic sooner than institutions with fewer students. Universities with large financial resources are also more likely to tweet sooner, but they do not introduce Covid-19 webpages faster than other universities.

The model includes eight compartments, uninfected CD4+T cells, latent HIV-infected cells, active HIV-infected cells, free HIV particles, HIV-specific CTLs, latent HTLV-infected cells, active HTLV-infected cells and HTLV-specific CTLs. The HIV can enter and infect an uninfected CD4+T cell by two ways, free-to-cell and infected-to-cell. Infected-to-cell spread of HIV occurs when uninfected CD4+T cells are touched with active or latent HIV-infected cells. In contrast, there are two modes for HTLV-I transmission, () horizontal, via direct infected-to-cell touch, and () vertical, by mitotic division of active HTLV-infected cells. We analyze the model by proving the nonnegativity and boundedness of the solutions, calculating all possible steady states, deriving a set of key threshold parameters, and proving the global stability of all steady states.

The study aims to identify the barriers, facilitators, and process recommendations to implement a rideshare non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) intervention following colonoscopy completion within a safety-net healthcare setting. Methods We used informal stakeholder engagement, story boards - a novel user-centered design technique, listening sessions and the nominal group technique to identify the barriers, facilitators, and process to implementing a rideshare NEMT program following colonoscopy completion in a large safety-net healthcare system. Results Barriers to implementing a rideshare NEMT intervention for colonoscopy completion included: inability to expand an existing NEMT program beyond Medicaid patients and lack of patient chaperones with rideshare NEMT programs. Facilitators included: commercially available rideshare NEMT platforms that were lower cost and had shorter wait times than the alternative of taxis. Operationalizing and implementing a rideshare NEMT intervention in our healthcare system required the following steps: 1) identifying key stakeholders, 2) engaging stakeholder groups in discussion to identify barriers and solutions, 3) obtaining institutional sign-off, 4) developing a process for reviewing and selecting a rideshare NEMT program, 5) executing contracts, 6) developing a standard operating procedure and 7) training clinic staff to use the rideshare platform. Discussion Rideshare NEMT after procedural sedation is administered may improve colonoscopy completion rates and provide one solution to inadequate CRC screening. If successful, our rideshare model could be broadly applicable to other safety-net health systems, populations with high social needs, and settings where procedural sedation is administered.","output":"Operationalizing a Rideshare Intervention for Colonoscopy Completion: Barriers, Facilitators, and Process Recommendations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"mRNA- and vector-based vaccines are used at a large scale to prevent COVID-19.

In two studies, we combined video-observational records of public mask-wearing in two Dutch cities with a natural-experimental approach to evaluate the effect of an area-based mask mandate. We found no observational evidence of an association between mask-wearing and social distancing but found a positive link between crowding and social distancing violations.

Even in less-affected regions, such as Tuscany, the changes in the healthcare system to prevent Covid-19 spread resulted in difficulty in treating time-dependent disorders like ischemic stroke rapidly. OBJECTIVE The aim of our study was to assess the outcome after acute ischemic stroke treatments during the Covid-19 spread in comparison with a similar period of the previous year in Siena-Hospital (Hub center in the South-East Tuscany). METHOD We enrolled all patients admitted to Siena-Hospital for ischemic stroke and submitted them to acute treatments (intravenous and/or mechanical thrombolysis) between February 21st and May 18th, 2020 (study group, n:38) and compared the results with ischemic strokes acutely treated in a similar period in 2019 (control group, n:39). The modified Rankin scale score was assessed at 90 days to evaluate a 3-month clinical outcome. RESULTS In the study group, the time from symptoms onset to hospital arrival and the door-to-groin puncture time were significantly more prolonged than in the control group. In moderate-severe strokes, the 3-month mortality was significantly higher in the study group (31%vs6%; p=0.01), and the number of patients with poor functional outcomes was significantly higher in the study group (73%vs44%; p=0.03).

The number of CUP accounts for roughly 3%C5% of all human malignancies. CUP patients are usually treated with broad-spectrum chemotherapy, which often leads to a poor prognosis. Recent studies suggest that the treatment targeting the primary lesion of CUP will significantly improve the prognosis of the patient. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an efficient method to accurately detect tissue of origin of CUP in clinical cancer research. In this work, we developed a novel framework that uses Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to trace the primary site of CUP based on microarray-based gene expression data. First, we downloaded the microarray-based gene expression profiles of 59,385 genes for 57,08 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 6,364 genes for 3,101 samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Both data were divided into training and independent testing data with a ratio of 4:1. Then, we obtained in the training data 200 and 290 genes from TCGA and the GEO datasets, respectively, to train XGBoost models for the identification of the primary site of CUP. The overall 5-fold cross-validation accuracies of our methods were 96.9% and 95.3% on TCGA and GEO training datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, the macro-precision for the independent dataset reached 96.75% and 98.8% on, respectively, TCGA and GEO.

This paper discusses the role that public health played in these initiatives and makes an appeal for more participatory, community-engaged public health in light of the persistent gaps in its approach to equitable climate change preparedness. METHODS: Pilots were initiated in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA): Bramptons Emergency Managers offered pre-selected FBO volunteers specialized training to be part of the citys emergency response in establishing FBO sites as emergency muster stations. An environmental organization in Hamilton explored how its existing networks could rally around a local social resilience challenge, and a community organizer in Toronto undertook network building to support mostly newcomer populations in one inner-city neighbourhood. All pilots used a mix of cold calling, workshops, municipal presentations, and participation in local programming and public events. Two convened local working groups. RESULTS: By the end of the pilot, Bramptons Emergency Management Office had made one contractual relationship with an FBO and its volunteers. In Hamilton, a multi-stakeholder network emerged to support the climate preparedness of agencies serving local vulnerable populations. In Toronto, a residents working group was established to address neighbour well-being and emergency response in one apartment tower. Work in all three communities is ongoing. CONCLUSION: Multi-stakeholder support for community organizations and local volunteers can enable partnerships in neighbourhood-level climate resiliencebefore, during and after extreme weather events.

First, the identification of the molecular factors that allow chronic infections, that is, the often completely asymptomatic coexistence of infectious agents with the human host. Second, the definition of the mechanisms that allow the switch from pathogen dormancy to pathologic (re)activation. Furthering previous studies, the present study (1) analyzed the frequency of occurrence of synonymous codons in coding DNA, that is, codon usage, as a genetic tool that rules protein expression; (2) described how human codon usage can inhibit protein expression of infectious agents during latency, so that pathogen genes the codon usage of which does not conform to the human codon usage cannot be translated; and (3) framed human codon usage among the front-line instruments of the innate immunity against infections. In parallel, it was shown that, while genetics can account for the molecular basis of pathogen latency, the changes of the quantitative relationship between codon frequencies and isoaccepting tRNAs during cell proliferation offer a biochemical mechanism that explains the pathogen switching to (re)activation. Immunologically, this study warns that using codon optimization methodologies can (re)activate, potentiate, and immortalize otherwise quiescent, asymptomatic pathogens, thus leading to uncontrollable pandemics.","output":"Human Codon Usage: The Genetic Basis of Pathogen Latency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: With relatively high transmission rate and fatal potential, the COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for widespread fear and psychological distress all over the world, including India.

How well a medical test is able to correctly identify or rule out a target disease can be assessed by diagnostic accuracy studies. METHODS The main statistical parameters that are derived from diagnostic accuracy studies, and their proper interpretation, will be presented here in the light of publications retrieved by a selective literature search, supplemented by the authors' own experience. Aspects of study planning and the analysis of complex studies on diagnostic tests will also be discussed. RESULTS In the usual case, the findings of a diagnostic accuracy study are presented in a 2  2 contingency table containing the number of true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and true-positive test results. This information allows the calculation of various statistical parameters, of which the most important are the two pairs sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive value. All of these parameters are quotients, with the number of true positive (resp. true negative) test results in the numerator; the denominator is, in the first pair, the total number of ill (resp. healthy) patients, and in the second pair, the total number of patients with a positive (resp. negative) test. The predictive values are the parameters of greatest interest to physicians and patients, but their main disadvantage is that they can easily be misinterpreted. We will also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) as additional important measures for the assessment of diagnostic tests. Further topics are discussed in the supplementary materials. CONCLUSION The statistical parameters used to assess diagnostic tests are primarily based on 2  2 contingency tables.

This study evaluates the tradeoffs between potential benefits (e.g., reduction in infection spread and deaths) of NPIs for COVID19 and being homebound (i.e., refraining from interactions outside of the household). METHODS: An agent-based simulation model, which captures the natural history of the disease at the individual level, and the infection spread via a contact network assuming heterogeneous population mixing in households, peer groups (workplaces, schools), and communities, is adapted to project the disease spread and estimate the number of homebound people and person-days under multiple scenarios, including combinations of shelter-in-place, voluntary quarantine, and school closure in Georgia from March 1 to September 1, 2020. RESULTS: Compared to no intervention, under voluntary quarantine, voluntary quarantine with school closure, and shelter-in-place with school closure scenarios 4.5, 23.1, and 200+ homebound adult-days were required to prevent one infection, with the maximum number of adults homebound on a given day in the range of 119 K-248 K, 465 K-499 K, 5388 K-5389 K, respectively. Compared to no intervention, school closure only reduced the percentage of the population infected by less than 16% while more than doubling the peak number of adults homebound.

While this variants increased infectivity has been proven, little is known of its clinical presentation and outcomes compared to the old strain. Methods: We identified patients admitted to the Cannes General Hospital for variant alpha-related COVID-19 infection from January to April 2021. Their main demographic parameters, inflammatory markers and clinical characteristics were recorded. Patients admitted from October to December 2020 for 20E (EU1) COVID-19 were selected as controls. Differences between groups were analyzed. Results: We included 157 patients (mean age 73 years; 58% men; mean delay of symptoms 6.9 days). Comorbidities were present in 92% (mainly hypertension, diabetes and obesity or overweight). The prevalence of comorbidities did not differ between groups. In 28% of cases, patients either died or required transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The cause of death or of transfer to the ICU was presumably associated with severe pneumonia. Variant alpha COVID-19 had 3.8-fold higher risk of death or transfer to the ICU compared to the old strain. Discussion: Patients infected with variant alpha COVID-19, despite similar background characteristics, had a higher risk of unfavorable outcomes than those infected with the old strain, suggesting increased virulence related to this variant.","output":"Patients Admitted for Variant Alpha COVID-19 Have Poorer Outcomes than Those Infected with the Old Strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Many adult orthodontic patients suffer from periodontitis, which is caused by oral pathogens such as the gram-negative Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Agac). Like orthodontic tooth movement, periodontitis is associated with inflammation and alveolar bone remodelling thereby affecting orthodontic treatment. Interactions of both processes, however, are not sufficiently explored, particularly with regard to oxidative stress. METHODS After preincubation with Agac lysate for 24 h periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) were either stretched or compressed for further 48 h simulating orthodontic forces in vitro. We analysed the expression of genes and proteins involved in the formation of reactive oxygen species (NOX-4, ROS) and nitric oxide (NOS-2), inflammation (TNF, IL-6, PTGS-2) and bone remodelling (OPG, RANKL). RESULTS Agac lysate elevated the expression of NOX-4, NOS-2, inflammatory IL-6 and PTGS-2 and the bone-remodelling RANKL/OPG ratio during compressive, but not tensile mechanical strain. Agac lysate stimulated pressure-induced inflammatory signalling, whereas surprisingly ROS formation was reduced. Pressure-induced downregulation of OPG expression was inhibited by Agac lysate. CONCLUSIONS Agac lysate impact on the expression of genes and proteins involved in inflammation and bone remodelling as well as ROS formation, when PDLF were subjected to mechanical forces occurring during orthodontic tooth movement.","output":"Effects of mechanical strain on periodontal ligament fibroblasts in presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lysate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the coronavirus pandemic has spread around the world like wildfire since almost 7 months of its emergence, domestic violence has been breeding endlessly like a \\"silent pandemic\\" and is similarly globally persevered.

Limited information is available to identify those greatest risk for cardiac complications. The objective of this study is to analyze risk factors associated with cardiovascular events in COVID-19 patients. Methods This retrospective cohort study of 700 inpatients was conducted at nine hospitals within a large urban midwestern city. Data was collected from March 9, 2020, to June 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria included all COVID-19 inpatients and excluded non-inpatients. Predictor variables included demographics, comorbidities, and current clinical data. The outcomes were CE and mortality. Cardiovascular events included heart failure, deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, stroke, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, reduced ejection fraction, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests were used to examine differences in groups with and without CE. Multiple logistics regression analyses were used to determine predictors of CE and Kaplan-Meier was conducted for survival comparisons between groups. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Inpatients with COVID-19 had greater odds of having a CE (n=126) if they were older, male, black, and had pulmonary and cardiovascular comorbidities (p < 0.001). Inpatients who had higher levels of potassium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, activated partial prothrombin time, domain-dimer, interleukin-6, white blood cell count, and oxygen requirements had an increased odds of having a CE (p < 0.05).

We present a case of incidental durotomy leading to anterior neck pseudomeningocele, compressing the carotid body (CB) resulting in syncopal episodes. To our knowledge, this is the first case report implicating syncopal episodes to CB compression via a pseudomeningocele. CASE PRESENTATION: A mid sixty-year-old patient with history of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes presented with gait impairment and hand weakness. Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) was diagnosed with computed tomography imaging (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Elective surgery was completed with an anterior and posterior approach for decompression and fusion. Hospital course (San Jose, CA, USA) was complicated by respiratory depression and incomplete tetraplegia. On post-operative day (POD) six, CT revealed anterolateral soft tissue neck swelling; subsequent CT and MRI showed fluid collection expansion, with associated syncopal episodes on POD thirty-nine. Despite interventional radiology drainage, the fluid collection and symptoms returned five days later. The patient ultimately underwent durotomy revision and repair with muscle patch. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This case highlights the challenges in managing anterior cervical dural tears resulting in pseudomeningocele. Risk factors include anterior cervical corpectomy and decompression, as well as an underlying diagnosis of OPLL. Untreated dural tears may develop into pseudomeningoceles which can contribute to life-threatening outcomes. CONCLUSION: This case report presents the serious consequences of incidental durotomy, the unique post-surgical complication of syncope due to compression of the CB from a pseudomeningocele, and the challenges of managing a persistent pseudomeningocele.","output":"Anterior cervical pseudomeningocele causing syncope after spinal surgery: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objective: This study aims to investigate the factors that lead to poor compliance in initiating the treatment in patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancers.

Our objective was to examine factors associated with the accessibility of telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults. METHODS: We analyzed the nationally representative Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Rapid Response Supplement Questionnaire of beneficiaries aged 65 years or older. Two weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine associations between usual providers who offered telehealth 1) during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2) to replace a regularly scheduled appointment. We examined factors including sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and digital access and literacy. RESULTS: Of the beneficiaries (n = 6,172, weighted n = 32.4 million), 81.2% reported that their usual providers offered telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among those offered telehealth services, 56.8% reported that their usual providers offered telehealth to replace a regularly scheduled appointment. Disparities in accessibility of telehealth services by sex, residing area (metropolitan vs nonmetropolitan), income level, and US Census region were observed. Beneficiaries who reported having internet access (vs no access) (OR, 1.75, P < .001) and who reported ever having participated in video, voice, or conference calls over the internet before (vs not) (OR, 2.18, P < .001) were more likely to report having access to telehealth.

We report on our RY reconstruction technique and special approaches, and evaluate the usefulness of our reconstruction method based on the surgical results of 100 patients we have experienced to date. METHODS We performed LTG in 100 patients with gastric cancer. After total gastrectomy using five ports, the resected stomach was extracted through a small laparotomy. Through that, we performed sacrifice of the jejunum, Y limb anastomosis, creation of the lifted jejunum. As the OL, a side-to-side anastomosis of the lifted jejunum to the esophageal stump was laparoscopically performed using a linear stapler in an isoperistaltic direction, and the entry hole was closed with full-thickness suturing. The lifted jejunum was fixed with suture to the duodenal stump at a location where the esophagojejunostomy site was made linear, and the duodenal stump was buried. The mesenteric gap was laparoscopically closed with suture. RESULTS The median operative time in 100 patients undergoing LTG was 385 min, the median blood loss was 65 mL, and the median time required for the OL was 32 min. The mean hospitalization period was 10 days, and postoperative complications included bleeding requiring reoperation in one patient; other complications such as pancreatic fistula in five patients (5 %) were treated conservatively. No complication associated with anastomosis occurred. CONCLUSION In RY reconstruction using the OL, there were no complications associated with the anastomosis site in 100 consecutive patients, such as anastomotic leak or stenosis, indicating that it is a very useful and safe reconstruction method.","output":"Technique of Roux-en-Y reconstruction using overlap method after laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer: 100 consecutively successful cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nicholas Agar, Jeff McMahan and Allen Buchanan have all expressed concerns about enhancing humans far outside the species-typical range.

METHODS In June 2016, a systematic literature search was performed using the medical subject heading of peripheral catheterization and tool* or rule* or algorithm*. Data extraction included clinician, patient, and/or product variables associated with PIVC insertion success. Information about TRA reliability, validity, responsiveness, and utility was also extracted. RESULTS We screened 36 studies, and included 13 for review. Seven papers reported insertion success ranging from 61%-90% (4030 insertion attempts), 6 on validity, and 5 on reliability, with none reporting on responsiveness and utility. Failed insertions were associated with obesity (odds ratio [OR], 0.71-1.7; 2 studies) and smaller gauge PIVCs (OR, 6.4; 95% Confidence Interval [CI}, 3.4-11.9). Successful inser tions were associated with visible veins (OR, 0.87-3.63; 3 studies) or palpable veins (OR, 0.79-5.05; 3 studies) and inserters with greater procedural volume (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.6-12.1) or who predicted that insertion would be successful (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.07). Definitions of insertion difficulty are heterogeneous such as time to insert to a number of failed attempts. CONCLUSIONS Few well-validated reliable TRAs exist for PIVC insertion. Patients would benefit from a validated, clinically pragmatic TRA that matches insertion difficulty with clinician competency.","output":"Tools, Clinical Prediction Rules, and Algorithms for the Insertion of Peripheral Intravenous Catheters in Adult Hospitalized Patients: A Systematic Scoping Review of Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indonesia was one of the countries hardest hit by the COVID-pandemic.

Aim: Provide an understanding of the importance of preventing the transmission of COVID-19 and provide skills to make disinfectants using materials commonly used in households such as floor cleaners clothes bleach and water. The implementation method goes through three stages namely the preparation stages the implementation stage and the observation stage. The preparation stage includes observation and coordination with the village. The implementation stage includes socialization activities and spraying of disinfectants while the evaluation stage is carried out through the provision of questionnaires. The community knows the ingredients used to make disinfectant liquid. The community is also able to make disinfectants independently. As well as several points or crowded locations spraying disinfectant has been carried out. The socialization activities and the spraying of disinfectants went very smoothly because of the support from both the village apparatus and the surrounding community. The impact of the implementation of the activities is also very felt for the community this can be seen from the results of the questionnaire which showed a positive response from the respondents answers.","output":"Edukasi pembuatan dan penyemprotan desinfektan pada masyarakat di desa Bukek kecamatan Tlanakan kabupaten Pamekasan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is something about research and theory on well-being and social value that seems na?ve.

Therefore, serious attention is paid to the development and implementation of modern information technologies in teaching practice. All this fully applies to the development of distance learning, which allows each person to improve their educational level with a minimum interruption from production, in their free time and according to an individual training program. Taking this into account, at the present stage of reforming the higher education system in the world, it is becoming more and more difficult to look for effective directions for training highly qualified specialists using traditional teaching aids, to respond promptly and promptly to the emerging needs of the labor market without understanding a large amount of relevant and accurate information. The article carried out a theoretical and methodological study of the very essence of distance education, and also investigated the main methods for assessing this type of education in a pandemic situation. The novelty of the article lies in the acquisition of the development of theoretical and methodological aspects of methods for assessing distance education in COVID-19 conditions.

METHODS: The PNAUM is a cross-sectional study conducted between 2013 and 2014, representing the Brazilian urban population. In the present study, we included 60 years or older (n = 9,019) individuals. We calculated the prevalence of BZD utilization in the 15 days prior to survey data collection according to independent variables, using a hierarchical Poisson regression model. A semistructured interview performed empirical data collection (household interview). RESULTS: The prevalence of BZD utilization in the older adults was 9.3% (95%CI: 8.3C10.4). After adjustments, BZD utilization was associated with female sex (PR = 1.88; 95%CI: 1.52C2.32), depression (PR = 5.31; 95%CI: 4.41C6, 38), multimorbidity (PR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.20C1.73), emergency room visit or hospitalization in the last 12 months (PR = 1.42; 95%CI: 1.18C1.70 ), polypharmacy (PR = 1.26; 95%CI: 1.01C1.57) and poor or very poor self-rated health (PR = 4.16; 95%CI: 2.10C8.22).

This study explores factors that promote or support wellbeing for young people during the pandemic, how they differ by age, using a self-reported online survey with those aged 8 - 25 in Wales between September 2020 and February 2021. Open-ended responses were analysed via thematic analysis to provide further context. A total of 6,291 responses were obtained from 81 education settings across Wales (including primary and secondary schools as well as sixth form, colleges and universities). Wellbeing was highest in primary school children and boys and lowest in those who were at secondary school children, who were girls and, those who preferred not to give a gender. Among primary school children, higher wellbeing was seen for those who played with others (rather than alone), were of Asian ethnicity (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.26 to 4.3), lived in a safe area (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.67 to 2.5) and had more sleep. To support their wellbeing young people reported they would like to be able to play with their friends more. Among secondary school children those who were of mixed ethnicity reported lower wellbeing (OR: 5.10, 95% CI: 1.70 to 15.80). To support their wellbeing they reported they would like more support with mental health (due to anxiety and pressure to achieve when learning online). This study found self-reported wellbeing differed by gender, ethnicity and deprivation and found younger children report the need for play and to see friends to support wellbeing but older children/young people wanted more support with anxiety and educational pressures.","output":"Factors influencing wellbeing in young people during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has globally affected healthcare including the transplantation programmes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied the impact of COVID-19 on live liver donor (LLD) programme at liver transplant centre in Gambat, Pakistan. Standard operative procedures (SOPs) including COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab PCR, CT scans, personal protective equipment use, 6-feet distancing were developed for LLD and transplant team to mitigate COVID-19 exposure. We compared the complications, healthcare utilisation (hospital stay, readmission) and mortality between two LLD cohortsbefore and during COVID-19 pandemic from March 2019 to December 2020. RESULTS: During study period 300 LLD surgeries were performed. There was an increase in rate of LLDs from 132 (44%) in pre-COVID to 168 (56%) during COVID-19 era. Average numbers of transplants per month performed during pre-COVID and during COVID-19 era were 10.1 and 14, respectively. No donor has developed COVID-19 infection during hospitalisation. Rate of all LLD complications (32 (21.47%) and 49 (29.16%), p=0.43), uneventful discharges (120/168 (71.4%) and 88/132 (66.6%), p<0.05), mean hospital stay (62 days and 52 days, p=0.17) and readmission (5 (4%) and 3 (1.8%), p=0.43) were similar during the pre-COVID and COVID-19 era.

It seems that the way MDSCs behave in infection depends on the type and the virulence mechanisms of the invader pathogen, the disease stage, and the infection-related pathology. Increasing evidence showing that in correlation with the severity of the disease, MDSCs are accumulated in COVID-19 patients, in particular in those at severe stages of the disease or ICU patients, contributing to pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection. Based on the involved subsets, MDSCs delay the clearance of the virus through inhibiting T-cell proliferation and responses by employing various mechanisms such as inducing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-mediated hampering of IFN- production, or forcing arginine shortage. While the immunosuppressive characteristic of MDSCs may help to preserve the tissue homeostasis and prevent hyperinflammation at early stages of the infection, hampering of efficient immune responses proved to exert significant pathogenic effects on severe forms of COVID-19, suggesting the targeting of MDSCs as a potential intervention to reactivate T-cell immunity and thereby prevent the infection from developing into severe stages of the disease. This review tried to compile evidence on the roles of different subsets of MDSCs during viral respiratory infections, which is far from being totally understood, and introduce the promising potential of MDSCs for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, especially against COVID-19 disease.","output":"Role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in viral respiratory infections; Hints for discovering therapeutic targets for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There are more than 350 RT-PCR COVID-19 testing kits commercially available but these kits has not been evaluated for pooled sample testing.

To control the infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to perform real-time and explainable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS system, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation (COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and 350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts, opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an average sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification test set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS dataset.

We present LoReTTA (Long Read Template-Targeted Assembler), a tool designed for performing de novo assembly of long reads generated from viral genomes on the PacBio platform. LoReTTA exploits a reference genome to guide the assembly process, an approach that has been successful with short reads. The tool was designed to deal with reads originating from viral genomes, which feature high genetic variability, possible multiple isoforms, and the dominant presence of additional organisms in clinical or environmental samples. LoReTTA was tested on a range of simulated and experimental datasets and outperformed established long-read assemblers in terms of assembly contiguity and accuracy. The software runs under the Linux operating system, is designed for easy adaptation to alternative systems, and features an automatic installation pipeline that takes care of the required dependencies.

Furthermore, ddPCR quantifies the RNA content directly, a feature that, as we show, can be used to identify nonviable samples in pools. Cost-effective strategies require the definition of efficient deconvolution and re-testing procedures. In this paper we analyze the practical implementation of an efficient hierarchical pooling strategy for which we have recently derived the optimal, determining the best ways to proceed when there are impediments for the use of the absolute optimum or when multiple pools are tested simultaneously and there are restrictions on the throughput time.

Despite this, the energetic cost of gestation is largely unknown, as well as the influence of maternal body size on foetal growth rates and calf birth sizes. We combined historical whaling records and drone photogrammetry data to determine foetal growth rates and birth sizes in southern right whales (Eubalaena australis), from which we estimated the cost of gestation. Calf birth size, and consequent foetal growth rates, increased positively with maternal body size. The cost of gestation was negligible for southern right whale females during the first two trimesters, but increased rapidly during the last trimester. These results show that late gestation incur a significant cost for baleen whale females, and needs to be accounted for in bioenergetic models. ABSTRACT: The cost of reproduction greatly affects a species' life history strategy. Baleen whales exhibit some of the fastest offspring growth rates in the animal kingdom. We quantified the energetic cost of gestation for southern right whales (Eubalaena australis, SRWs) by combining whaling catch records of pregnant females with photogrammetry data on SRW mothers and calves from two breeding grounds in Argentina and Australia. The relationship between calf birth size and maternal length (ML) was determined from repeated measurements of individual females before and after giving birth. Foetal growth was determined from generalized linear models fitted to foetal length data from whaling operations between 1961 and 1967. Foetal length was converted to volume and mass, using the volume-to-length relationship of newborn SRWs calves, and published tissue composition and energy content estimates. Foetal maintenance costs (heat of gestation) and the energy content of the placenta was predicted from published relationships, and added to the foetal growth cost to calculate the total cost of gestation. Our findings showed that foetal growth rates and birth size increased linearly with ML, with calves being born at a??35%ML. Foetal length increased curvilinearly through gestation, which resulted in an exponential increase in foetal volume and mass. Consequently, the cost of gestation was very low during the 1st (0.1% of total cost) and 2nd trimester (4.9%), but increased rapidly during the last trimester (95.0%). The heat of gestation incurred the highest cost for pregnant females (73.8%), followed by foetal growth (21.2%) and the placental energy content (5.0%). Abstract figure legend The aim of this study was to estimate the energetic cost of gestation in southern right whales. First, drone photogrammetry were used to measure the size of newborn southern right whale calves on their breeding grounds. Birth lengths were found to be a??35% of maternal lengths. Based on this, foetal growth curves were developed from historical whaling records. The foetus grew slowly in size during the first two trimesters, but increased rapidly during the final trimester. The growth rate of the foetus was positively affected by the size (length) of the mother, with larger females having faster growing foetuses. By converting foetal length to volume and mass, and using the energetic content of different tissues (blubber, muscle, viscera and bones), the cost of foetal growth through gestation could be estimated. Placental cost and heat of gestation were calculated from the foetal size, which together equalled the cost of gestation. This article is protected by copyright.

Vaccine candidate YF-S0 has an outstanding safety profile and induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in hamsters, mice and cynomolgus macaques and concomitantly a protective immunity against YFV. Humoral immunity is complemented by a favourable Th1 cell-mediated immune response as profiled in mice. In a stringent hamster model2 as well as in non-human primates, YF-S0 prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, in hamsters, a single dose confers protection from lung disease in most vaccinated animals within 10 days.

DESIGN: population overall mortality data provided by the Italian National Statistical Office (Istat). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Italian residents 60 years or older from 7,357/7,904 Italian municipalities. For the included municipalities, the number of deaths from any cause from 1 January to 30 May 2020 was available for each day of the 2015-2020 period. Data were stratified by gender, 4 age categories (60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90+), week, and province. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: province- and gender-specific weekly RR curves (age category vs RR), obtained for 13 weeks between 26 February and 26 May; excess mortality; time-varying/weekly classification of provinces. RESULTS: these results provide a weekly classification of the Italian provinces based on their RR curves in 5 groups, 2 of which had high and very high excess mortality during the epidemics. Most of the provinces that appeared at least once in the highest-risk group are neighbouring provinces in the Northern Regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Marche (in central Italy), where most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths were identified. Temporally, most of these provinces remained in the highest-risk group for 4 or 5 weeks; those that entered the group later, improved faster. The overall RR curves for groups differed in magnitude, but also in the shape, which varied markedly also between men and women and, most importantly, in the highest-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: this study gives timely re-analysis of the Istat data at weekly level and provides a classification of the geographical and temporal characteristics of the excess mortality in the Italian provinces during the COVID-19 epidemics. As expected, the used clustering method groups the provinces that have similar RR values in the two gender-specific curves. The results facilitate the presentation of the spatio-temporal mortality patterns of the epidemics and provide evidence of high heterogeneity in the group of provinces that were defined as high-risk groups by others, based on their geographical position or on the time of the observed spread of the virus.","output":"Classification of weekly provincial overall age- and gender-specific mortality patterns during the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory illness in humans; the second-largest and most deadly outbreak to date occurred in Saudi Arabia.

Here, we studied evolutionary relationships for 31 complete genomes of betacoronaviruses, including eight newly sequenced MERS-CoV genomes isolated from dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia. Through bioinformatics tools, we also used available sequences and 3D structure of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein to predict MERS-CoV epitopes and assess antibody binding affinity. Phylogenetic analysis showed the eight new sequences have close relationships with existing strains detected in camels and humans in Arabian Gulf countries. The 2019-nCov strain appears to have higher homology to both bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV strains. The spike protein tree exhibited clustering of MERS-CoV sequences similar to the complete genome tree, except for one sequence from Qatar (KF961222). B cell epitope analysis determined that the MERS-CoV spike protein has 24 total discontinuous regions from which just six epitopes were selected with score values of >80%.

Reference standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. While the RT-PCR shows a high specificity, its sensitivity depends on the duration of symptoms, viral load, quality of the sample, and the assay used. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) of the chest are the imaging modalities primarily used for assessment of the lung manifestations, extent, and complications of COVID-19 pneumonia. PERFORMANCE: Sensitivity and specificity of chest radiography is low. While sensitivity of CT for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia is highaveraging around 90%its specificity is lowbetween 25 and 33%. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Indications for imaging in patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 infection should be carefully considered to minimize the risk of infection for medical personnel and other patients. Imaging, particularly CT, can assess disease extent, complications, and differential diagnoses. COVID-19 pneumonia typically presents with bilateral, subpleural areas of ground glass opacifications with or without consolidations.

The entry-point for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which are highly expressed in the lung. Among other complications, COVID-19leads to fatal pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to development of cytokine storm (CS). The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the viral load and human innate/adaptive immune response that are required for viral elimination in the first phase of COVID-19. However, an exaggerated immune response in the second phase of COVID-19 results in immune overreaction and CS-induced ALI and ARDS. Thus, in view of these considerations, we report here a series of five patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed ALI. In addition to the supportive therapy, the patients received doxycycline in the first week and doxycycline plus colchicine in the second week. Following sequential therapy with doxycycline and/or colchicine in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the patients had reduction of disease severity and symptoms with better clinical and radiological outcomes. However, it is tough to confirm the link between this therapeutic combination and recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia, as it is a small case-series report. Nevertheless, this study gives a rational for large-scale prospective studies to evaluate the dual sequential effect of doxycycline and colchicine on the COVID-19 severity. This case-series illustrated that use of colchicine: doxycycline combination is linked with marked improvements in the clinical, laboratory and radiological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Background: A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) has recently been described. Objective: To evaluate imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. Subjects and Methods: Imaging studies and medical records of sixteen patients (0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C were retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow viscera, peritoneum, as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum. Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were resolved by a third, senior radiologist. Results: Sixteen patients were included (10 male and 6 female; 20 months - 20 years). All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms included: vomiting (12; 75%), abdominal pain (11; 69%), rash (10;62.5%), conjunctivitis (8;50%), diarrhea (7;44%), headache (6;37.5%), and sore throat (5;31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each present in one patient. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly (10; 62.5%), congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema (9; 56%), atelectasis (9; 56%), pleural effusions (7; 44%), adult respiratory distress syndrome (2; 12.5%) and pneumonia (1; 6%).

Anti-RBD-antibodies were detected in almost all patients (34/35, 97%), although the titer was significantly reduced in patients under CTLA-4-inhibitors (median: 465 BAU/mL, IQR: 103-1189, p<0.001) or IL-6-inhibitors (median: 492 BAU/mL, IQR: 161-1007, p<0.001) compared to HCWs (median: 2351 BAU/mL, IQR: 1389-3748). T-cell-specific response scored positive in most of RA patients [24/35, (69%)] with significantly lower IFN- levels in patients under biological therapy such as IL-6-inhibitors (median: 33.2 pg/mL, IQR: 6.1-73.9, p<0.001), CTLA-4-inhibitors (median: 10.9 pg/mL, IQR: 3.7-36.7, p<0.001), and TNF--inhibitors (median: 89.6 pg/mL, IQR: 17.8-224, p=0.002) compared to HCWs (median: 343 pg/mL, IQR: 188-756). A significant correlation between the anti-RBD-antibody titer and spike-IFN--specific T-cell response was found in RA patients (rho=0.432, p=0.009). IFN- T-cell response was mediated by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Finally, no significant increase in disease activity was found in RA patients following vaccination. CONCLUSION: This study showed for the first time that antibody-specific and whole-blood spike-specific T-cell responses induced by the COVID-19 mRNA-vaccine were present in the majority of RA patients, who underwent a strategy of temporary suspension of immunosuppressive treatment during vaccine administration. However, the magnitude of specific responses was dependent on the immunosuppressive therapy administered. In RA patients, BNT162b2 vaccine was safe and disease activity remained stable.","output":"ImmunosuppressiveTherapies Differently Modulate Humoral- and T-Cell-Specific Responses to COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On 16 Jan 2021, India launched its immunization program against COVID-19.

Lifestyle changes are universally recommended for women with obesity seeking fertility treatments, but such intervention has only been assessed in very few robust studies. This studys objectives are therefore to assess the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of an interdisciplinary lifestyle intervention (the Fit-For-Fertility Programme; FFFP) targeting women with obesity and subfertility in a diverse population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) will include 616 women with obesity (body mass index 30 kg/m(2) or 27 kg/m(2) with polycystic ovary syndrome or at-risk ethnicities) who are evaluated at a Canadian fertility clinic for subfertility. Women will be randomised either to (1) the FFFP (experimental arm) alone for 6 months, and then in combination with usual care for infertility if not pregnant; or (2) directly to usual fertility care (control arm). Women in the intervention group benefit from the programme up to 18 months or, if pregnant, up to 24 months or the end of the pregnancy (whichever comes first). Women from both groups are evaluated every 6 months for a maximum of 18 months. The primary outcome is live birth rate at 24 months. Secondary outcomes include fertility, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes; lifestyle and anthropometric measures; and cost-effectiveness. Qualitative data collected from focus groups of participants and professionals will also be analysed.

Previous studies have revealed that the coronaviruses develop various strategies to evade the host innate immunity through the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) signaling pathway. However, the ability of TGEV to inhibit the host innate immune response by modulating the NF-B signaling pathway is not clear. METHODS: In this study, a dual luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the inhibition of NF-B by TGEV infection and to identify the major viral proteins involved in the inhibition of NF-B signaling. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify the mRNA expression of inflammatory factors. The deubiquitination of Nsp3 domains and its effect on IB and p65 were analyzed by western blotting. The ubiquitination level of IB was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: In ST and IPEC-J2 cells, TGEV exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of NF-B activity. Individual TGEV protein screening revealed the high potential of non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) to inhibit NF-B signaling, and leading to the downregulation of the NF-B-induced cytokine production. We demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of Nsp3 was mainly mediated through the suppression of IB degradation as well as the inhibition of p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the amino acid residues at positions 590C1,215 in Nsp3 were demonstrated to inhibit the degradation of IB by inhibiting the IB ubiquitination. CONCLUSION: TGEV infection can inhibit the activation of the NF-B signaling pathway, which is mainly mediated by Nsp3 through the canonical pathway. The amino acid residues at positions 590C1,215 in Nsp3 compose the critical domain that mediates NF-B inhibition. We speculate that this inhibitory effect is likely to be related to the structure of PLP2 with deubiquitinating enzyme activity of the amino acid residues at positions 590C1,215 in Nsp3. Our study provides a better understanding of the TGEV-mediated innate immune modulation and lays the basis for studies on the pathogenesis of coronavirus.","output":"Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus inhibits NF-B activity via nonstructural protein 3 to evade host immune system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a viral pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Due to its highly contagious nature, millions of people are getting affected worldwide knocking down the delicate global socio-economic equilibrium. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has affected over 186 million people with a mortality of around 4 million as of July 09, 2021. Currently, there are few therapeutic options available for COVID-19 control. The rapid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome and development of new virulent strains with increased infection and mortality among COVID-19 patients, there is a great need to discover more potential drugs for SARS-CoV-2 on a priority basis. One of the key viral enzymes responsible for the replication and maturation of SARS-CoV-2 is M(pro) protein. In the current study, structure-based virtual screening was used to identify four potential ligands against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) from a set of 8,722 ASINEX library compounds. These four compounds were evaluated using ADME filter to check their ADME profile and druggability, and all the four compounds were found to be within the current pharmacological acceptable range. They were individually docked to SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) protein to assess their molecular interactions. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was carried out on proteinCligand complex using Desmond at 100 ns to explore their binding conformational stability. Based on RMSD, RMSF and hydrogen bond interactions, it was found that the stability of proteinCligand complex was maintained throughout the entire 100 ns simulations for all the four compounds. Some of the key ligand amino acid residues participated in stabilizing the proteinCligand interactions includes GLN 189, SER 10, GLU 166, ASN 142 with PHE 66 and TRP 132 of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Further optimization of these compounds could lead to promising drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) target.","output":"Structure-based virtual screening, in silico docking, ADME properties prediction and molecular dynamics studies for the identification of potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo O objetivo deste estudo  discutir a reorganiza??o do processo de trabalho do Agente Comunitrio de Sade (ACS) em decorrncia da pandemia da Covid-19, considerando sua importancia enquanto um elo de articula??o entre a comunidade e os servi?os de sade.

We examined changes in marketing awareness one year after initial implementation and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Repeat online cross-sectional surveys with adults in Ireland conducted October 2019 (n = 1,007) and October 2020 (n = 1,020). Participants self-reported past-month awareness of alcohol marketing and completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C). Current drinkers were categorised as those reporting heavy episodic drinking at least monthly and higher-risk drinkers (5 AUDIT-C). RESULTS: In both waves, most participants recalled some marketing awareness (94.1% vs. 93.8%). For 9/13 activities measured in both waves, there were decreases in the proportion reporting any awareness and frequency of awareness, including for the newly restricted activities. For example, any awareness of public transport advertising decreased between waves (ORAdj = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.53-0.81). In both waves, higher past-month awareness was associated with at least monthly heavy episodic drinking and higher-risk consumption. CONCLUSION: We recommend a precautionary interpretation. It is plausible that both Ireland's initial controls and COVID-19 restrictions contributed to decreases in awareness, but longer-term evaluation is required to determine relative contribution.","output":"Awareness of alcohol marketing one year after initial implementation of Ireland's Public Health (Alcohol) Act and during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the third LIGOCVirgo operating run (O3) finishes earlier than planned owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, we look at the ups and down of the past 12 months.","output":"O3 highlights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a significant symptom of COVID-19 and may be the earliest symptom, or it may sometimes be the only manifestation of the disease.

METHODS: The files of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively reviewed, and the ones who had information about smelling status and CT were taken into consideration. A total of 180 patients were divided into two groups: the OD group consisted of 89 patients with self-reported OD, and the No-OD group consisted of 91 subjects who did not complain of OD. The two groups were compared for the amount of lung consolidation on CT, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and blood test parameters (complete blood count, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ferritin, D-dimer, interleukin-6 (IL-6)).

In a previous study, we analyzed the potentiality of a number of distributions to describe the evolution of the pandemic and the potentiality of each distribution to mathematically predict the evolution of the pandemic in Italy. Since the number of daily tests was changing and increasing with time, we used the ratio of the new daily cases per swab. We considered distributions of the type of Gauss (normal), Gamma, Beta, Weibull, Lognormal and in addition of the type of the Planck blackbody radiation law. The Planck law, describing the amount of energy of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body at each wavelength or at each frequency, marked in 1900 the beginning of Quantum Mechanics. The result of our analysis was that, among the considered distributions, the Planck law has the best potentiality to mathematically predict the evolution of the pandemic and the best fitting capability.

We selected 5 scores in normal distribution of these durations as lagging days, which will be used in the following estimation of death rate. We calculated each death rate on accumulative confirmed cases with each lagging day from the current data and then weighted every death rate with its corresponding possibility to obtain the total death rate on each day. While the trendline of these death rate curves meet the curve of current ratio between accumulative death cases and confirmed cases at some points in the near future, we considered that these intersections are within the range of real death rates.

Clinical record systems contain codes to denote when such an offer has been declined by a patient (although these can in some cases be entered for a variety of other reasons including vaccination delay, or other administrative issues). We set out to describe the patterns of usage of codes for COVID-19 vaccines being declined. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England and using the full pseudonymised primary care records for 57.9 million NHS patients, we identified all patients in key vaccine priority groups: aged over 50, or over 16 and at increased risk from COVID-19 (Clinically Extremely Vulnerable [CEV] or otherwise \\"at risk\\"). We describe the proportion of patients recorded as declining a COVID-19 vaccination for each priority group, and by other clinical and demographic factors; whether patients recorded as \\"declined\\" subsequently went on to receive a vaccination; and the distribution of code usage across GP practices. ResultsOf 24.5 million patients in priority groups as of May 25th 2021, 89.2% had received a vaccine, 8.8% had neither a vaccination nor a decline recorded, and 663,033 (2.7%) had a decline code recorded. Of patients with a recorded decline, 125,587 (18.9%) were subsequently vaccinated. Subsequent vaccination was slightly more common in the South Asian population than other ethnicities (e.g. 32.3% vs 22.8%, over 65s). The proportion of declining-unvaccinated patients varied strongly with ethnicity (Black 15.3%, South Asian 5.6%, White 1.5% in over 80s); and was higher in patients from more deprived areas. COVID-19 vaccine decline codes were present in almost all practices (98.8%), but with wide variation between practices in rates of usage. Among all priority groups, declining-unvaccinated status was most common in CEV (3.3%). ConclusionsClinical codes indicative of COVID-19 vaccinations being declined are widely used in English general practice. They are substantially more common among Black and South Asian patients, and patients from more deprived areas. There is a need for more detailed survey and/or qualitative research with patients and clinicians to determine the most common reasons for these recorded declines.","output":"Recording of 'COVID-19 vaccine declined' among vaccination priority groups: a cohort study on 57.9 million NHS patients' primary care records in situ using OpenSAFELY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To understand public preference and immunization willingness for COVID-19 vaccine in China, and analyze influence factors, provide references for sufficient vaccination coverage.

However, without coordinated efforts to organize this knowledge, it can remain hidden away from individual research groups. By extracting and formalizing this knowledge in a structured and computable form, as in the form of a knowledge graph, researchers can readily reason and analyze this information on a much larger scale. Here, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph, an expansive cause-and-effect network constructed from scientific literature on the new coronavirus that aims to provide a comprehensive view of its pathophysiology.

We employed the wavelet decomposition strategies, wavelet-based regime-switching and granger-causality approaches to examine the effect of oil prices on economic performances of sample countries across time scales. Further, through the bootstrap time-varying causality, we detect and date-stamp periods where causality may or may not exist as the technique allows us identify periods of uncertainties such as the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and study the influence of global events on the causal link between oil prices and economic performance. The wavelet-analysis shows diverse underlying cycles in oil price whereas its macroeconomic impact on growth-performance vary across economies and different orthogonal frequency scales aligning the heterogeneous market hypothesis. This corroborates the wavelet-based-regime-switching approach as different signs/magnitudes/significance across regimes and countries reflect asymmetries and heterogeneous behaviors. The wavelet-based Granger-causality approach also reveals strong causal-linkages between oil-prices and growth in the shortest wavelet-scales but not in medium/long term. Further evidences from the bootstrapped time-varying Granger-causality approach shows that causality runs from oil prices to growth for at least 1-month across all samples. We further detect and date-stamp longest periods of causation from growth to oil-prices across countries extending through pre and post Covid-19 pandemic. This affirms the weight and significance of growth performances of these economies in shaping the cyclical variation of oil commodity prices.

Increased levels of circulating complement biomarkers have been implicated in COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and coagulopathy. We characterized systemic complement activation at a cellular level in 49-patients with COVID-19. We found increases of the classical complement sentinel C1q and the downstream C3 component on circulating blood monocytes from COVID-19 patients when compared to healthy controls (HCs). Interestingly, the cell surface-bound complement inhibitor CD55 was also upregulated in COVID-19 patient monocytes in comparison with HC cells. Monocyte membrane-bound C1q, C3 and CD55 levels were associated with plasma inflammatory markers such as CRP and serum amyloid A during acute infection. Membrane-bounds C1q and C3 remained elevated even after a short recovery period. These results highlight systemic monocyte-associated complement activation over a broad range of COVID-19 disease severities, with a compensatory upregulation of CD55.

The study assessed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on diet diversity, calorie consumption and intake of essential nutrients based on the gender of the households. Design/methodology/approach: Mixed-design ANOVA and logistic regression were used to analyze the collected data from 260 female- and 463 male-headed households through an online survey in Pakistan. Findings: The outcomes revealed that the diet diversity of female households was affected more due to the COVID-19 compared to male households. The decline in daily nutrients' (protein, phosphorus, zinc, iron and iodine) intake during the COVID-19 was also greater for female-headed households than male-headed households. The share of all food groups in daily calorie and nutrient provision decreased significantly during the COVID-19 for both types of households. The share of meat and meat products declined more for female-headed households compared to male-headed households. The share of perishable commodities in calorie provision to female and male households decreased 2% during the COVID-19 compared to the normal period. Small- and medium-sized female and male households were less likely to experience worsened diet diversity than large-sized households during the COVID-19. Low-income compared to medium- and high-income female and male households were more likely to report declined food diversity during the COVID-19.

To elucidate the mechanisms connecting metabolically active brown adipose tissue (BAT) and metabolic health may provide insights into methods of treatment for obesity-related conditions. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) is traditionally used to image human BAT activity. However, the primary energy source of BAT is derived from intracellular fatty acids and not glucose. Beta-methyl-p-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) is a fatty acid analogue amenable to in vivo imaging by single photon emission computed tomography/CT (SPECT/CT) when radiolabeled with iodine isotopes. In this study, we compare the use of (18)FDG-PET/CT and (125)I-BMIPP-SPECT/CT for fat imaging to ascertain whether BMIPP is a more robust candidate for the non-invasive evaluation of metabolically active adipose depots. Interscapular BAT, inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), and gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) uptake of (18)FDG and (125)I-BMIPP was quantified in mice following treatment with the BAT-stimulating drug CL-316,243 or saline vehicle control. After CL-316,243 treatment, uptake of both radiotracers increased in BAT and iWAT. The standard uptake value (SUV(mean)) for (18)FDG and (125)I-BMIPP significantly correlated in these depots, although uptake of (125)I-BMIPP in BAT and iWAT more closely mimicked the fold-change in metabolic rate as measured by an extracellular flux analyzer. Herein, we find that imaging BAT with the radioiodinated fatty acid analogue BMIPP yields more physiologically relevant data than (18)FDG-PET/CT, and its conventional use may be a pivotal tool for evaluating BAT in both mice and humans.","output":"Comparison of BMIPP-SPECT/CT to (18)FDG-PET/CT for Imaging Brown or Browning Fat in a Preclinical Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have demonstrated a marked decrease in peripheral lymphocyte levels in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

However, most studies reporting on the potential of bioactives against COVID-19 transmission have been uploaded as preprints with little opportunity to revise content for benefit and impact. The current review discusses current best evidence and information underpinning the role of food ingredients and bioactive compounds in supporting immune functions in humans and animals, specifically in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease. Up to now, some evidence from randomized population and clinical trials has suggested that vitamin D levels may be linked to COVID-19 transmission and severity. Numerous theoretical studies have pointed to polyphenols and particularly flavonoids as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is also inconclusive evidence to support the future use of ?-glucan to address COVID-19 due in part to variability in immune response arising from heterogeneity in polysaccharide branch and chain length for different sources and the absence of a standardized extraction method. To confirm the promising outcomes and hypotheses for bioactive compounds, more randomized and controlled clinical studies are needed.

This area was the first hotspot of COVID-19 in Europe and was severely affected. Composite 24 h samples were collected weekly in eight cities from end-March to mid-June 2020 (first peak of the pandemic). The method developed and optimized, involved virus concentration using PEG centrifugation, and one-step real-time RT-PCR for analysis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in 65 (61%) out of 107 samples, and the viral concentrations (up to 2.1 E + 05 copies/L) were highest in March-April. By mid-June, wastewater samples tested negative in all the cities corresponding to the very low number of cases recorded in the same period.

In comparison with the mainstream and health news, left-leaning group, which are more pro-vaccine, the right-leaning group is influenced more by the anti-vaccine and far-right misinformation/conspiracy communities. The misinformation communities are more vocal either specific to the vaccine discussion or political discussion, and we find other differences in the characteristic behaviours of different communities.

DESIGN: An observational cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nephrology department and Biochemistry and molecular biology department, faculty of medicine, Cairo University. PATIENTS: A total of 256 CRF patients on HD for at least six months (162 male and 103 female) and 160 healthy subjects (122 male and 38 female) were recruited in the current study after signing a consent form. ACE G2350A (rs4343) Insertion/Deletion (I/D) was tested, the association between ACE G2350A (RS4343) gene polymorphisms and patients response to rHuEpo was evaluated. RESULTS: ACE G2350A (rs4343) I/D was the most prevalent genotype, while I/I genotype was the lowest prevalent among patient or control subjects included in the study. D allele is the most prevalent allele, either among patients or the control group. Hemoglobin (Hb) level in patients with I/I and Deletion/Deletion (D/D) genotype was significantly higher compared to those with I/D genotype (P = 0.012 and P = 0.005, respectively). Serum iron in the I/D genotype was significantly higher than those with either I/I or D/D genotype (P = 0.045 and P = 0.018, respectively). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) content, total leukocytic count (TLC), and soluble erythropoietin receptor (sEpoR) were independent predictors of Hb level. The ACE gene, TLC, and serum iron were the independent factors that may affect the Haematocrit (Hct) level. ACE G2350A (rs4343) gene polymorphisms may affect the HD patients responses to rHuEPOs. CONCLUSION: In HD patients, screening for ACE G2350A (rs4343) gene polymorphisms before rHuEpo administration may help predict patient response.","output":"Haematological Indicators of Response to Erythropoietin Therapy in Chronic Renal Failure Patients on Haemodialysis: Impact of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme rs4343 Gene Polymorphism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ferritin even though widely recognized as a representative of total body iron stores, its prognostic utility is linked with COVID-19. This study was aimed at evaluation of the association of ferritin with severity in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hospitalized patients and to test the hypothesis that it is an independent predictor of mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted at Chemical Pathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University (AKU), Karachi. Medical records of all in-patients including both genders, and all age groups with documented COVID-19 from 1st March to 10(th) August 2020 were reviewed. The subjects were divided into two categories severe and non-severe COVID-19; and survivors and non-survivors. The details were recorded on a pre-structured performa. Between-group differences were tested using the MannCWhitney's U-test. The receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted for ferritin with severity and mortality. A binary logistic regression was used to identify variables independently associated with mortality. The data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). RESULTS: A total of 336 in patients were reviewed as declared COVID-19 positive during the study duration, and 157 were included in the final analysis including 108 males and 49 females. Statistically significant difference in ferritin was found in the two categories based on severity and mortality.

In forensic populations, increased rates of self-harm have been reported, and suicide is one of the leading causes of death. Aside from associations between self-harm and mental disorders, knowledge on self-harm in forensic psychiatric populations is limited. The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinical needs of a cohort of forensic psychiatric patients, including self-harm and possible risk factors thereof. Participants (N = 98) were consecutively recruited from a cohort of forensic psychiatric patients in Sweden from 2016 to 2020. Data were collected through file information, self-reports, and complemented with semi-structured interviews. Results showed that self-harm was common among the participants, more than half (68.4%) of whom had at some point engaged in self-harm. The most common methods of non-suicidal self-injury were banging one's head or fist against a wall or other solid surface and cutting, and the most common method of suicide attempt was hanging. The most prominent functions of non-suicidal self-injury among the participants were intrapersonal functions such as affect regulation, self-punishment, and marking distress.

A number of antibiotics exhibit excellent bactericidal effects in vivo, such as fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides (gentamicin) and -lactams (penicillin G, ceftiofur, or amoxicillin), but are less effective for treating STSLS. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new compounds that can reduce the damage caused by STSLS. In the present study, we identified auranofin, an orally bioavailable FDA-approved anti-rheumatic drug as a candidate repurposed drug to treat severe S. suis infections. Our results showed that auranofin can bind to the functional domain of bacterial thioredoxin reductase, decreasing the reducing redox-responsive capacity of target bacteria and allowing for the killing of S. suis cells. We also observed that auranofin has antibacterial activity against other gram-positive bacteria, such as multidrug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP), Streptococcus agalactiae, and vancomycin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, auranofin is capable of eradicating intracellular S.suis present inside infected macrophage cells. Mouse model experimental results showed that auranofin could effectively reduce the mortality of mice infected with S. suis. Compared to the ampicillin treatment group, the survival rate of mice in the auranofin treatment group in severely infected model mice was significantly improved.

Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) offers quick results, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is a more reliable method for disease classification and assessment. The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered extensive research towards developing a COVID-19 detection toolkit. Recent studies have confirmed that the deep learning-based approach, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), provides an optimized solution for COVID-19 classification; however, they require substantial training data for learning features. Gathering this training data in a short period has been challenging during the pandemic. Therefore, this study proposes a new model of CNN and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) that classify CXR images into normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19. The proposed model contains eight convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers, which provide better results than the existing pretrained methods (AlexNet and GoogLeNet). DCGAN performs two tasks: (1) generating synthetic/fake images to overcome the challenges of an imbalanced dataset and (2) extracting deep features of all images in the dataset. In addition, it enlarges the dataset and represents the characteristics of diversity to provide a good generalization effect. In the experimental analysis, we used four distinct publicly accessible datasets of chest X-ray images (COVID-19 X-ray, COVID Chest X-ray, COVID-19 Radiography, and CoronaHack-Chest X-Ray) to train and test the proposed CNN and the existing pretrained methods. Thereafter, the proposed CNN method was trained with the four datasets based on the DCGAN synthetic images, resulting in higher accuracy (94.8%, 96.6%, 98.5%, and 98.6%) than the existing pretrained models. The overall results suggest that the proposed DCGAN-CNN approach is a promising solution for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Deep Learning Algorithm for COVID-19 Classification Using Chest X-Ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an invasive breast cancer with the characteristics of easy to develop distant metastasis. Immune escape is one of the main reasons for TNBC growth and metastasis. Enhancement of T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity may benefit to inhibit tumor metastasis and improve the efficacy of cancer therapy. As a natural bioactive substance, resveratrol shows potential capability to prevent or suppress the development of a variety of cancers through direct or indirect effects, including immunoregulatory effect. However, whether resveratrol might affect lung metastasis of TNBC, and whether the effect of resveratrol might be associated with resveratrol-regulated immune responses in tumor microenvironment is still unknown. In this study, by using an experimental metastatic mouse 4 T1 tumor model, we identified that resveratrol may suppress TNBC lung metastasis by elevating local anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, an increase in the cytotoxic activity of CD8+T cells as well as the levels of type 1 cytokine IFN-?3 and IL-2 in the lungs of resveratrol-treated tumor bearing mice were observed. The enhanced CD8+T cell activity and Th1 immune responses by resveratrol administration might be related to the down-regulated PD-1 expression on pulmonary CD8+T cells and CD4+T cells. Resveratrol may also convert macrophages to M1 phenotype in the lungs of tumor bearing mice.

The nucleocapsid protein can serve as a decent model for determining phylogenetic, evolutionary, and structural relationships between coronaviruses. Therefore, this study uses the nucleocapsid gene and protein to further investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses have revealed the nucleocapsid gene and protein in SARS-CoV-2 are both closely related to those found in Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. Evidence of recombination was detected within the N gene, along with the presence of a double amino acid insertion found in the N-terminal region. Homology modeling for the N-Terminal Domain revealed similar structures but distinct electrostatic surfaces and topological variations in the -hairpin that likely reflect specific adaptive functions.

We examined whether symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) are associated with weight status in the general population with AF. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with electrocardiogram-confirmed AF completed validated questionnaires: the EuroQol 5 Dimensions QoL questionnaire and the Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS). The AFSS assessed the AF burden scoring on AF-related symptoms and the total AF burden measured as a combination of duration, frequency, and severity of an irregular heartbeat. Generalized liner models examined the association of body mass index (BMI) with AF severity and QoL adjusting for confounders. Between 2018 and 2019, 882 of 1901 (46%) mailed questionnaires were returned completed. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 74 (10) years old and a BMI of 27.4 (5.6) kg/m2. Sixteen percent reported having never experienced an irregular heartbeat. A 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a 0.65 (95%CI: 0.25 to 1.06) higher symptom score, where 3 points represent a clinically relevant change in state. A 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a -1.61 (95%CI: -2.72 to -0.50) lower QoL score. The coefficient of the total AF burden for a 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was 0.17 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.68).

The comprehensive discussion on GFRC composition is presented together with the review of glass fibers' influence on various concrete properties. First of all, because of their bridging abilities, they can limit the width, length, and total area of cracks. Additionally, GFRC are characterized by enhanced tensile, flexural, and splitting strength; impact, abrasion, spalling, fire, and freeze-thaw resistance as well as ductility, toughness, and permeability. All of this positively influences the mechanical behavior, durability, and corrosion resistance of concrete elements. Moreover, decreased thermal conductivity allows for better energy performance from the building's point of view. This results in cheaper structures both in manufacturing and maintaining even though GFRC are more expensive materials.

From the environmental point of view, GFRC are eco-friendlier materials than ordinary concretes since their application can decrease the emission of CO2 by 17%. The article also describes the GFRC application fields and emphasizes the possibility of the creation of not only structural elements mainly intended for load transferring but also elements accompanying the building process, as well as elements of small architecture that make public spaces more attractive, durable, and safer.

Combined surgical, psycho-physiological, and experimental perspectives on Music Medicine (MM) and its relationship to autonomic nervous system (ANS) function are discussed. Considerations are given to the inter-related perioperative effects of MM on ANS, pain, and underlying vagal and other neural circuits involved in emotional regulation and dysregulation. Many surgical procedures are associated with significant pain, which is routinely treated with post-operative opioid medications, which cause detrimental side effects and delay recovery. Surgical trauma shifts the sympathetic ANS to a sustained activation impairing physiological homeostasis and causing psychological stress, as well as metabolic and immune dysfunction that contribute to postoperative mortality and morbidity. In this article, we propose a plan to operationalize the study of mechanisms mediating the effects of MM in perioperative settings of orthopedic surgery. These studies will be critical for the implementation of PMM as a routine clinical practice and to determine the potential limitations of MM in specific cohorts of patients and how to improve the treatment.","output":"Review of Perioperative Music Medicine: Mechanisms of Pain and Stress Reduction Around Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On January 6, 2021, the U.S. Capitol was sieged by rioters protesting certification of Joseph R. Bidens election as the 46th president of the United States. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) quickly predicted that the Riot would be a COVID-19 surge event. This study is the first to estimate the impact of the Capitol Riot on risk-averting behavior and community-level spread of the novel coronavirus. First, using anonymized smartphone data from SafeGraph, Inc. and an event-study approach, we document that on January 6th there was a substantial increase in non-resident smartphone pings in the census block groups including the Ellipse, the National Mall, and the U.S. Capitol Building, consistent with a large protest that day. Next, using data from the same source and a synthetic control approach, we find that the Capitol Riot increased stay-at-home behavior among District of Columbia residents, indicative of risk averting behaviors in response to violence and health risks. Finally, turning to COVID-19 case data, we find no evidence that the Capitol Riot substantially increased community spread of COVID-19 in the District of Columbia in the month-long period following the event. This may be due to increases in social distancing and a virtual lockdown of the Capitol prior to the inauguration of the new president. However, exploiting variation in non-resident smartphone inflows into the January 6 Capitol protest, we find that counties with the highest protester inflows experienced a significant increase in the rate of daily cumulative COVID-19 case growth in the month following the protest.

To rapidly reach herd immunity, an affordable, easy to store and versatile vaccine platform is thus desirable. We previously designed a non-infectious adenovirus-inspired nanoparticle (ADDomer), and in the present work, we efficiently decorated this original vaccine platform with glycosylated receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Cryo-Electron Microscopy structure revealed that up to 60 copies of this antigenic domain were bound on a single ADDomer particle with the symmetrical arrangements of a dodecahedron. Mouse immunization with the RBD decorated particles showed as early as the first immunization a significant anti-coronavirus humoral response, which was boosted after a second immunization. Neutralization assays with spike pseudo-typed-virus demonstrated the elicitation of strong neutralization titers. Remarkably, the existence of pre-existing immunity against adenoviral-derived particles enhanced the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2. This plug and play vaccine platform revisits the way of using adenovirus to combat emergent pathogens while potentially taking advantage of the adenovirus pre-immunity.","output":"Elicitation of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses through immunization using a versatile adenovirus-inspired multimerization platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Currently, COVID-19 is a global pandemic disease that has caused a large number of infections worldwide.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate that when appropriate strategies are adopted autopsy is a safe procedure with a minimal infection risk for all subjects involved (pathologists, technical personnel, and others) when proper strategies are adopted. We performed 16 autopsies on cadavers of persons who had died with confirmed COVID-19 with different post-mortem intervals (PMI). To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, for each autopsy, 2 swabs were sampled from lungs, while to evaluate environmental contamination, 11 swabs were taken at three different times: T0 (before autopsy), T1 (at the end of the autopsy, without removing the corpse), and T2 (after cleaning and disinfecting the autopsy room). Specifically, 2 swabs were sampled on face shields used by each pathologist, and 4 swabs were collected on the autopsy table; 4 swabs were also collected from walls and 1 from floor. Lung swabs confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all cases. Environmental swabs, collected at T0 and T2 were all negative, while swabs sampled at T1 were shown to be positive.

Even though causality has not yet been established, intestinal dysbiosis has emerged as a hallmark of several diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs). The fact that the microbiota and central nervous system are co-developing during the first years of life has provided a paradigm suggesting a potential role of psychobiotics for earlier interventions. Studies in animal models of early-life stress (ELS) have shown that they can counteract the pervasive effects of stress during this crucial developmental period, and rescue behavioral symptoms related to anxiety and depression later in life. In humans, evidence from clinical studies on the efficacy of psychobiotics at improving mental outcomes in most NPDs remain limited, except for major depressive disorder for which more studies are available. Consequently, the beneficial effect of psychobiotics on depression-related outcomes in adults are becoming clearer. While the specific mechanisms at play remain elusive, the effect of psychobiotics are generally considered to involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, intestinal permeability, and inflammation. It is anticipated that future clinical studies will explore the potential role of psychobiotics at mitigating the risk developing NPDs in vulnerable individuals or in the context of childhood adversity. However, such studies remain challenging at present in terms of design and target populations; the profound impact of stress on the proper development of the MGBA during the first year of life is becoming increasingly recognized, but the trajectories post-ELS in humans and the mechanisms by which stress affects the susceptibility to various NPDs are still ill-defined. As psychobiotics are likely to exert both shared and specific mechanisms, a better definition of target subpopulations would allow to tailor psychobiotics selection by aligning mechanistic properties with known pathophysiological mechanisms or risk factors. Here we review the available evidence from clinical and preclinical studies supporting a role for psychobiotics at ameliorating depression-related outcomes, highlighting the knowledge gaps and challenges associated with conducting longitudinal studies to address outstanding key questions in the field.","output":"The effects of psychobiotics on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in early-life stress and neuropsychiatric disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concluding chapter summarizes the main theoretical and empirical findings of the study and highlights the books contribution to the fields of comparative politics, legislative and EU studies.

Echocardiography may provide useful insights into COVID\\\\19 physiopathology. METHODS: Twenty\\\\three COVID\\\\19 patients were enrolled in a medical ward. Gas exchange, transthoracic echocardiographic, and hemodynamic variables were collected. RESULTS: Mean age was 57  17 years. The patients were hypoxemic (PaO(2)/FiO(2) = 273.0  102.6 mmHg) and mildly hypocapnic (PaCO(2) = 36.2  6.3 mmHg, pH = 7.45  0.03). Mean arterial pressure was decreased (86.7 [80.0C88.3] mmHg). Cardiac index was elevated (4.32  0.90 L?min(\\\\1)?m(\\\\2)) and the resulting systemic vascular resistance index low (1,458 [1358C1664] dyn?s?cm(\\\\5)?m(\\\\2)). The right heart was morphologically and functionally normal, with pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm, 18.0  2.9 mmHg) and Total Pulmonary Resistances (TPR, 2.3 [2.1C2.7] mmHg?l(\\\\1)?min(\\\\1)) within normal limits. When stratifying for SVRI, patients with an SVRI value below the cohort median had also more severe oxygenation impairment and lower TPR, despite a similar degree of CXR infiltrates. Oxygen delivery index in this group resulted supranormal. CONCLUSIONS: In the early stages of COVID\\\\19 infection the hemodynamic profile is characterized by a hyperdynamic circulatory state with high CI and low SVRI, while the right heart is functionally unaffected. Our findings suggest that hypoxemia, viral sepsis or peripheral shunting are possible mechanisms for the vasodilation that dominates at this stage of the disease and may itself worsen the gas exchange.","output":"Non\\\\invasive hemodynamic profile of early COVID\\\\19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The starting point of this paper are the discussions of the robustness of empirical findings in related disciplines, namely social psychology, which culminated in the so-called replication crisis.

This study explored the underlying mechanism from COVID-19 IU to negative emotions using a moderated mediation model in adolescents. In total, 3037 teenagers completed a cross-sectional survey including measures of COVID-19 IU, risk perception, social exclusion, perceived efficacy, and negative emotions. The results showed that COVID-19 IU positively predicted negative emotions and that risk perception and social exclusion mediated this relationship. In addition, both the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions and the mediating effect of risk perception on this relationship were moderated by perceived efficacy; in particular, COVID-19 IU had a greater impact on negative emotions among adolescents with lower levels of perceived efficacy. These findings suggest that COVID-19 IU is closely associated with negative emotions among adolescents and that effective measures should be taken to enable adolescents to improve their perceived efficacy and develop a reasonable perception of risk, help them eliminate the stigma of the disease, and strengthen their connections with society.","output":"Intolerance of COVID-19-Related Uncertainty and Negative Emotions among Chinese Adolescents: A Moderated Mediation Model of Risk Perception, Social Exclusion and Perceived Efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fresh fruits and vegetables carry a heavy load of microorganisms which may cause the risks of food-borne illness to the consumer.

There is scant scientific evidence to guide surgeons in assessing the protocols that must be implemented before resuming elective orthopaedic surgery safely after the second wave of the coronavirus disease, 2019. METHODS: A retrospective review of elective orthopaedic surgeries performed between May 15, 2020, and November 20, 2020, was conducted. A screening questionnaire was used, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin G and IgM antibodies testing were assessed in all admitted patients. Screening and testing data for coronavirus disease was reviewed for all patients. RESULTS: Of 592 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during the study period, 21 (3.5%) tested positive.

The primary end-point was net adverse clinical events (NACE; a composite of death, non-fatal myocardial reinfarction, stroke, emergency revascularization, and bleeding over BARC type 3). The secondary outcome was a composite of recurrent ischaemia, cardiogenic shock, and exacerbated heart failure. RESULTS: The final analysis included 164 acute STEMI patients from 2020 and 240 from 2019. Eighteen patients (20.2% of those with indications) received fibrinolysis therapy in 2020 with a median door-to-needle time of 60.0 (43.5, 92.0) minutes.

In the subsequent data-driven analysis, we sought to understand the relationship between different styles of user engagement and the participants experiences with the use of Depression Connect. Data analysis consisted of open, axial, and selective coding. To include as diverse perspectives as possible, we opted for purposive sampling. To verify and validate the (interim) results, we included negative cases and performed member checks. RESULTS: We found participation in Depression Connect contributes to a sense of belonging, emotional growth, self-efficacy, and empowerment. Getting too caught up was the most frequently reported negative aspect of using Depression Connect. The deployment and development of three participation styles (ie, reading, posting, and responding) affected the perceived benefits of Depression Connect use differentially, where the latter style was central to enhancing empowerment. Being of value to others boosted the users belief in their personal strength. Finally, Depression Connect was predominantly used to supplement offline support and care for depression, and it mainly served as a safe environment where members could freely reflect on their coping mechanisms for depression and exchange and practice coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed new light on user engagement processes on which internet support groups rely. The online community primarily served as a virtual meeting place to practice (social) skills for deployment in the offline world. It also allowed the members to learn from each others knowledge and experiences and explore newly gained insights and coping skills.","output":"A Newly Developed Online Peer Support Community for Depression (Depression Connect): Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D is an important regulator of calcium and bone homeostasis. It is also involved in the regulation of different genes and cellular functions, particularly in the context of inflammation, regeneration and immune control. Conversely, vitamin D deficiency which is often found in chronic, infectious and inflammatory diseases is thought to drive or enhance uncontrolled inflammation. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways most often because of cigarette smoking. It has been recognized that repetitive airway infections and systemic consequences or co-morbidities also contribute to the progressive nature of COPD. Vitamin D deficiency is known to sneak in from the early stages of COPD, to become highly prevalent at the more severe stages, and may thereby catalyse airway infection, inflammation and systemic consequences. Undoubtedly, vitamin D deficiency enhances bone resorption and osteoporosis in COPD for which appropriate vitamin D supplementation is recommended. However, conflicting evidence has emerged on the extra-calcemic effects of vitamin D in COPD. A recent intervention trial with high-dose supplementation in COPD was only able to reduce exacerbation frequency in the subgroup of patients with lowest baseline vitamin D levels. It confirms that severe vitamin D deficiency is a health hazard but that more clinical and experimental studies are needed to explore how vitamin D deficiency may affect airway biology and systemic effects in the context of smoke-induced lung diseases.","output":"Vitamin D and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study aimed to determine sleep quality, frequency and severity of dyspnoea in COPD patients and to evaluate the relationship between dyspnoea severity and sleep quality. Method: The sample of the study consisted of 110 patients admitted to the Chest Diseases polyclinic of a private hospital and diagnosed as COPD for at least one year. The data of the study were collected using the \\"Individual Information Form\\", \\"COPD and Asthma Sleep Scale (CASIS)\\" and \\"Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea Scale\\". Results: It was found that 6.4% of the patients did not experience dyspnoea, 34.5% had mild, 40.9% had moderate, and 18.2% had severe dyspnoea. The mean CASIS score of the patients without dyspnoea was 29.087.83, with mild dyspnoea was 40.229.30, with moderate dyspnoea was 50.318.97 and with severe dyspnoea was 56.9613.13.

Serotypes A, B, C, W, X, and Y are responsible for nearly all infections worldwide. The most common clinical manifestations are meningitis and invasive meningococcal disease, both characterized by high mortality and long-term sequelae. The infection rate is higher in children younger than 1 year and in adolescents, who are frequently asymptomatic carriers. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infection and transmission. Currently, both monovalent meningococcal vaccines (against A, B, and C serotypes) and quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines (against serogroups ACYW) are available and recommended according to local epidemiology. The purpose of this article is to describe the meningococcal vaccines and to identify instruments that are useful for reducing transmission and implementing the vaccination coverage. This aim could be reached by switching from the monovalent to the quadrivalent vaccine in the first year of life, increasing vaccine promotion against ACYW serotypes among adolescents, and extending the free offer of the anti-meningococcal B vaccine to teens, co-administering it with others proposed in the same age group. Greater awareness of the severity of the disease and increased health education through web and social networks could represent the best strategies for promoting adhesion and active participation in the vaccination campaign.

Design: Retrospective ecological study using routinely collected national and regional surveillance data from eight Public Health England coordinated laboratory, outbreak and syndromic surveillance systems using key dates of UK governmental policy change to assign phases for comparison between 2020 and historic data. Results: Decreases in GI illness activity were observed across all surveillance indicators as COVID-19 cases began to peak. Compared to the 5-year average (2015-2019), during the first six months of the COVD-19 response, there was a 52% decrease in GI outbreaks reported (1,544 vs. 3,208 (95% CI: 2,938 - 3,478) and a 34% decrease in laboratory confirmed cases (27,859 vs. 42,495 (95% CI: 40,068 - 44,922). GI indicators began to rise during the first lockdown and lockdown easing, although all remained substantially lower than historic figures. Reductions in laboratory confirmed cases were observed across all age groups and both sexes, with geographical heterogeneity observed in diagnosis trends. Health seeking behaviour changed substantially, with attendances decreasing prior to lockdown across all indicators. Conclusions: There has been a marked change in trends of GI infections in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The drivers of this change are likely to be multifactorial; while changes in health seeking behaviour, pressure on diagnostic services and surveillance system ascertainment have undoubtably played a role there has likely been a true decrease in the incidence for some pathogens resulting from the control measures and restrictions implemented. This suggests that if some of these changes in behaviour such as improved hand hygiene were maintained, then we could potentially see sustained reductions in the burden of GI illness.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gastrointestinal infection trends in England, February - July 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Gastritis is a prevalent disease and commonly classified into autoimmune (A), bacterial (B), and chemical (C) type gastritis.

METHODS Following informed consent baseline mini-mental status exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and geriatric depression scale (GDS) were obtained. Intraoperatively OAA/S, BIS, and propofol (timing and exact amounts) administered were recorded. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected for Alzheimer's (AD) biomarkers. Mean Ce level (AvgCe) during surgery was calculated using the area under the Ce measurement series from incision to closure, divided by surgical time. Average OAA/S (AvgOAA/S), and BIS (AvgBIS) were similarly calculated. Pearson correlations of AvgCe with AvgOAA/S and AvgBIS were calculated overall and by CDR. Nonparametric locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) fits of AvgOAA/S and AvgBIS on AvgCe were produced, stratified by CDR. Multivariable regression incorporating baseline cognitive measurements or AD biomarkers assessed AvgOAA/S or AvgBIS associations with AvgCe.

In the absence of a full-length molecular clone, however, it has been difficult to address the role of individual viral genes in pathogenesis. By using targeted RNA recombination to introduce the S gene of MHV4, a highly neurovirulent strain, into the genome of MHV-A59, a mildly neurovirulent strain, we have been able to directly address the role of the S gene in neurovirulence. In cell culture, the recombinants containing the MHV4 S gene, S4R22 and S4R21, exhibited a small-plaque phenotype and replicated to low levels, similar to wild-type MHV4. Intracranial inoculation of C57BL/6 mice with S4R22 and S4R21 revealed a marked alteration in pathogenesis. Relative to wild-type control recombinant viruses (wtR13 and wtR9), containing the MHV-A59 S gene, the MHV4 S gene recombinants exhibited a dramatic increase in virulence and an increase in both viral antigen staining and inflammation in the central nervous system. There was not, however, an increase in the level of viral replication in the brain. These studies demonstrate that the MHV4 S gene alone is sufficient to confer a highly neurovirulent phenotype to a recombinant virus deriving the remainder of its genome from a mildly neurovirulent virus, MHV-A59.

METHODS We searched the online databases Scopus, Medline, and CINAHL, as well as the grey literature, without time restrictions, initially on July 31, 2019 followed by an update November 13, 2020. Empirical studies or reports were included if they described the selection of health system performance indicators or frameworks, that included PHC indicators. A combination of the process focussed research question and qualitative analysis meant a quality appraisal tool or assessment of bias could not meaningfully be applied to assess individual studies. We undertook an inductive analysis based on potential indicator selection processes criteria, drawn from health system performance indicator appraisal tools reported in the literature. RESULTS We identified 16 503 records of which 28 were included in the review. Most studies used a descriptive case study design. We found no consistent variations between indicator selection processes of health systems of high income and low- or lower-middle income countries. Identified common features of selection processes for indicators in PHC include literature review or adaption of an existing framework as an initial step; a consensus building process with stakeholders; structuring indicators into categories; and indicator criteria focusing on validity and feasibility. The evidence around field testing with utility and consideration of reporting burden was less clear. CONCLUSION Our findings highlight several characteristics of health system indicator selection processes. These features provide the groundwork to better understand how to value indicator selection processes in PHC.","output":"Common Features of Selection Processes of Health System Performance Indicators in Primary Healthcare: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care ultrasonography (PoCUS) is increasingly used across the medical field. PoCUS is also being implemented in general practice despite a lack of clinical guidelines and training programs for general practitioners (GPs). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to elucidate the employment of PoCUS by Danish GPs following a short training program. METHODS: Thirty GPs were enrolled in a short ultrasound training program and taught how to perform 22 selected scanning modalities. In the following 3 months, the GPs registered all performed PoCUS examinations according to the Audit Project Odense method. After 5 months, the GPs were invited to participate in an evaluation seminar, where questionnaires were distributed. RESULTS: During the registration period, 1598 patients were examined with PoCUS. A total of 1948 scanning modalities were registered, including 207 examinations outside the taught curriculum. The majority of the ultrasound examinations were performed within 10 minutes (89%), most were considered to be conclusive (87%) and/or to increase diagnostic certainty (67%), whereas one in four examinations entailed a change in patient management. Most GPs attending the evaluation seminar continued to use PoCUS and found the scanning modalities included in the course curriculum relevant in their daily work. CONCLUSION: The GPs found several indications for performing PoCUS following the attendance of a 2-day basic training program. The majority of examinations were registered to be conclusive and/or increase diagnostic certainty. However, few GPs used PoCUS on a daily basis and not all examinations were registered to have an impact on patient care.","output":"Introducing point-of-care ultrasound in Danish general practice-elucidating the use through a medical audit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically impacted the global health and economy. Computed tomography (CT) is the prime imaging modality for diagnosis of lung infections in COVID-19 patients. Data-driven and Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions for automatic processing of CT images predominantly rely on large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. Owing to privacy and data availability issues, open-access and publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets are difficult to obtain, thus limiting the development of AI-enabled automatic diagnostic solutions. To tackle this problem, large CT image datasets encompassing diverse patterns of lung infections are in high demand. DATA DESCRIPTION: In the present study, we provide an open-source repository containing 1000+ CT images of COVID-19 lung infections established by a team of board-certified radiologists. CT images were acquired from two main general university hospitals in Mashhad, Iran from March 2020 until January 2021. COVID-19 infections were ratified with matching tests including Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and accompanying clinical symptoms. All data are 16-bit grayscale images composed of 512  512 pixels and are stored in DICOM standard. Patient privacy is preserved by removing all patient-specific information from image headers. Subsequently, all images corresponding to each patient are compressed and stored in RAR format.","output":"COVID19-CT-dataset: an open-access chest CT image repository of 1000+ patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Clinical evidence suggests increased oxidative stress in COVID-19 patients and this worsened redox status could potentially contribute to the progression of the disease.Objectives: To investigate the oxidative stress we have measured oxidative stress parameters, namely, PAT (total antioxidant power, iron reducing) and d-ROMs (plasma peroxides). Additionally we have investigated their correlation with the most frequently used clinical parameters CRP, LDH, and NLR in serum from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary hospital.Methods: PAT and d-ROMs were determined by analytical photometric metric method in serum from 50 hospitalized patients. For each of them, two samples were collected and analyzed immediately after collection seven days apart.Results: All patients at admission had a much higher value for plasma peroxides and a significant correlation between oxidative stress parameters and CRP, LDH, and NLR. (p<0.05), except for OS index (OSI) vs CRP in the severe group. At discharge, plasma peroxides were reduced and OSI was improved in the moderate group.Conclusion: We consider that using OSI at the beginning of COVID-19 disease presents a valuable starting point for the general assessment of oxidative stress and hence enabling a better triage of the patients in terms of disease severity.","output":"Evaluation of oxidative stress markers in hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the stigma associated with coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19) among health care workers (HCWs) in Indonesia during the early phase of the pandemic.

The three S1 ORFs of the avian reovirus strain S1133 were individually expressed in bacterial cells, and their purified translation products used as antigens to raise specific polyclonal antibodies. With these antibodies we were able to demonstrate that all three S1 ORFs from different avian reovirus strains are translatable in infected cells. Proteins p10 and p17, which are specified by ORF1 and ORF2, respectively, are nonstructural proteins which associate with cell membranes, whereas ORF3 directs the synthesis of protein sigma C, a structural oligomeric protein responsible for cell attachment. While intracellular synthesis of protein sigma C was demonstrated a long time ago and that of protein p10 was reported recently, this is the first time that expression of the S1 ORF2 has been demonstrated experimentally. Thus, the previously reported coding capacity of the avian reovirus genome is now expanded to 14 proteins, of which ten are structural (lambda A, lambda B, lambda C, microA, microB, microBC, microBN, sigma A, sigma B, and sigma C) and four are nonstructural (microNS, sigma NS, p17, and p10). Finally, protein p10, but not p17 or sigma C, induces cell-cell fusion when transiently expressed in mammalian cells, supporting a previously published observation that the polypeptide encoded by the S1 ORF1 plays an important role in the syncytial phenotype displayed by avian reoviruses.","output":"The avian reovirus genome segment S1 is a functionally tricistronic gene that expresses one structural and two nonstructural proteins in infected cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus shedding in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can occur before onset of symptoms; less is known about symptom progression or infectiousness associated with initiation of viral shedding.

Cardiac cachexia also worsens skeletal muscle degradation. Cardiac cachexia is the loss of edema-free muscle mass with or without affecting fat tissue. It is mainly caused by a loss of balance between protein synthesis and degradation, or it may result from intestinal malabsorption. The loss of balance in protein synthesis and degradation may be the consequence of altered endocrine mediators such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, leptin, ghrelin, melanocortin, growth hormone and neuropeptide Y. In contrast to many other health problems, fat accumulation in the heart is protective in this condition. Fat in the heart can be divided into epicardial, myocardial and cardiac steatosis. In this review, we describe and discuss these topics, pointing out the interconnection between heart failure and cardiac cachexia and the protective role of cardiac obesity. We also set the basis for possible screening methods that may allow for a timely diagnosis of cardiac cachexia, since there is still no cure for this condition.

In these situations, being able to reengage in other goals as a form of goal adjustment and in response to contextual demands is adaptive. According to previous literature, some aspects of the athletes social context, such as coach-created motivational climates, could encourage more adaptive responses in athletes, and so it is possible that these climates would also promote athletes goal regulation and goal reengagement. The purpose of this study was twofold: to analyze whether athletes perception of empowering and disempowering climates were related to their goal reengagement through the mediation of goal motives; and to examine the interaction between the two climates when they predict reengagement through athletes goal motives. Participants were 414 Spanish university athletes (49.5% male, 50.5% female) who belonged to different university teams, with ages ranging from 17 to 33 years old (M = 20.61, SD = 2.58). In the sport facilities, all of them completed questionnaires that evaluated their perception of empowering and disempowering climates, their goal motives, and their goal reengagement. Structural equation modeling (SEM) results showed that perceived empowering climate positively predicted autonomous goal motives, which in turn had a positive relationship with goal reengagement. Conversely, perceived disempowering climate positively predicted controlled goal motives, which were not related to goal reengagement. Thus, we only found support for the indirect relationship between perceived empowering climate and goal reengagement through autonomous goal motives. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that interaction effects between perceived empowering and disempowering climates were not significant in the prediction of goal reengagement through goal motives. Findings revealed that the perception of empowering climates promotes athletes goal reengagement when goals become unattainable via the increase in their autonomous goal motives. Conversely, when athletes perceive disempowering climates, they have more controlled goal motives, which are not related to goal reengagement. In addition, the study supports the need to educate coaches to create more empowering and less disempowering climates.","output":"Perceived Coach-Created Motivational Climates as Predictors of

alternative mode of production led by mutual principles, such as co-operative work, self-management, and consensual distribution of economic gains. Much has been developed on its potential to include groups marginalized by capitalism in new development schemes, but to date there has been no work regarding immigrants' participation specifically. This research aims to fill this gap. Purpose The article investigates the importance of the partnership between institutions in the host country and immigrants to their insertion in the Solidarity Economy Fairs in Florianopolis. It questions to what extent it has furthered income generation, the formation of social identity, and the construction of community ties. Methods and approach The approach is anchored in intervention-research, proposing a socio-analytical intervention (Aguiar & Rocha, 2007). To pursue qualitative research, an online form was distributed to participants at the Immigrant Fair. The form comprised semi-structured interviews, with the possibility of giving free answers. Findings The data analysis reveals the nuances of the life trajectory of recent immigrants in Brazil: people, mostly of Latin American origin, over 30 years of age, seeking economic insertion in another country. For them, the Solidarity Economy has offered a possibility for social and economic insertion in Brazil. The opportunity for marginalized populations to engage with the Solidarity Economy offers an effective tool against systemic competition. The Fair operates as an alternative to the insertion into the capitalist market for outsider groups, enabling new ways to conduct economic life within the capitalist economy.

In pastoral and nomadic communities in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), camels play a vital role in food security, while commercial milk production and formalized export markets are rapidly emerging as camel populations expand into non-traditional areas. Until recently, little focus was placed on camels as hosts of zoonotic disease, but the emergence of Middle Eastern respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and the discovery of exposure to the virus in Kenyan camels, highlighted the need for further understanding of this area. This systematised review utilised a robust search strategy to assess the occurrence of camel-associated zoonoses in Kenya and to evaluate the quality of the published literature. Seventy-four studies were identified, covering sixteen pathogens, with an increasing number of good quality studies in recent years. Despite this, the area remains under-researched and there is a lack of robust, high-quality research. Trypanosome spp., Echinococcus granulosus and Brucella spp. appeared most frequently in the literature. Pathogens with the highest reported prevalence were MERS-CoV (0-100%), Echinococcus granulosa (7-60%) and Rift Valley fever virus (7-57%). Exposure to Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus showed higher levels in camel or camel-associated vectors than other livestock species, although brucellosis was the only disease for which there was robust evidence linking camel and human exposure. Zoonotic agents with less severe human health outcomes, such as Dermatophilosus congolensis and contagious ecthyma, were also represented in the literature. This review provides an important summary of the scope and quality of current knowledge. It demonstrates that further research, and improved adherence to robust study design and reporting are essential if the zoonotic risk from camels in Kenya, and elsewhere, is to be better understood.","output":"Zoonotic Pathogens of Dromedary Camels in Kenya: A Systematised Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A substantial proportion of airway diseases global burden is attributable to exposure to air pollution. This study aimed to investigate the association between air pollution, assessed as concentrations of particulate matter PM2.5 and PM10 on the upper respiratory tract symptoms (URTS) in children. A nation-wide, questionnaire-based study was conducted in Poland in winter 2018/2019 in a population of 1475 children, comparing URTS throughout the study period with publicly available data on airborne particulate matter. A general regression model was used to evaluate the lag effects between daily changes in PM10 and PM2.5 and the number of children reporting URTS and their severity. PM10 and PM2.5 in the single-pollutant models had significant effects on the number of children reporting URTS. The prevalence of URTS: runny nose, sneezing and cough was positively associated with 12-week mean PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. In the locations with the highest average concentration of PM, the symptoms of runny nose, cough and sneezing were increased by 10%, 9% and 11%, respectively, compared to the cities with the lowest PM concentrations. This study showed that moderate-term exposure (12 week observation period) to air pollution was associated with an increased risk of URTS among children aged 3C12 years in Poland.

Both pathogens and symbionts establish plant-microbe interactions using fascinating intricate extracellular strategies to avoid recognition. Here we distinguish nine different extracellular strategies to avoid recognition by the host, acting at three different levels. To avoid the accumulation of MAMP precursors (Level 1), microbes take advantage of polymorphisms in both MAMP proteins and glycans, or downregulate MAMP production. To reduce hydrolytic MAMP release (Level 2), microbes shield MAMP precursors with proteins or glycans and inhibit or degrade host-derived hydrolases. And to prevent MAMP perception directly (Level 3), microbes degrade or sequester MAMPs before they are perceived. We discuss examples of these nine strategies and envisage three additional extracellular strategies to avoid MAMP perception in plants.","output":"Defeated by the nines: nine extracellular strategies to avoid microbe-associated molecular patterns recognition in plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Kras mutation has been associated with shorter overall survival and time to disease recurrence after resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM). This study evaluated the prognostic value of Kras mutation in patients with CLM treated by percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA). METHODS This is an IRB waived retrospective analysis of the impact of KRAS mutation status on oncologic outcomes after CLM RFA. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), local tumor progression (LTP) rates, and incidence of new liver, lung, and peritoneal metastases. Survival times were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology from the time of RFA. RESULTS The study enrolled 97 patients. Kras exon 2 mutation was detected in 39% (38/97) of patients. On univariate analysis, Kras mutation (P=0.016) (HR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1 - 2.9) was a significant predictor of OS and retained significance on multivariate analysis. Kras mutation was a significant predictor of new liver metastases (P=0.037) (SHR: 2.0; CI: 1.0-3.7) and peritoneal metastases (P=0.015) (sHR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.2-7.2) on multivariate analysis. Kras mutation was a significant predictor of LTP after RFA of CLM ablated with margins of 1-5 mm (P=0.018) (SHR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.2-7.7) with an LTP rate of 80% (12/15) versus 41% (11/27) for wild type. CONCLUSION Kras mutation is a significant predictor of overall survival, new liver, and peritoneal metastases after RFA of CLM.

Methods: Between January 2018 and June 2019, 15 patients underwent ACL revision with double-bundle ACL reconstruction combined with ALL reconstruction. There were 12 males and 3 females with an average age of 30.1 years (range, 17-49 years). The technique of primary ACL reconstruction included single-bundle reconstruction in 13 cases and double-bundle reconstruction in 2 cases. These reconstructions applied autografts in 14 cases and allograft in 1 case. The causes of ACL reconstruction failure were identified as traumatic rupture in 9 cases and non-traumatic failure in 6 cases, including 2 cases of graft absorption and 3 cases of graft laxity. The average time from the primary ACL reconstruction to revision was 28.5 months (range, 8-60 months). The subjective and objective indicators of knee joint function were compared before operation and at last follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness. The subjective indicators included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. The objective indicators included anterior tibial translation (dynamic and static) and side-to-side difference (SSD), pivot-shift test, Lachman test, the difference of single-legged hop test, and the loss ratio of extensor muscle strength on the affected side. Results: All incisions healed by first intetion, and no complications such as infection, venous thrombosis of lower extremity, or neurovascular injury occurred. All patients were followed up for an average of 19.1 months (range, 12-30 months). At last follow-up, all patients had returned to pre-injury sports level. The IKDC score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score were significantly improved ( P<0.05); anterior tibial translations (dynamic and static) significantly decreased when compared with preoperative one ( P<0.05) and returned to the physiological range. The SSD, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, the difference of single-legged hop test, and the loss ratio of extensor muscle strength on the affected side were significantly better than those before operation ( P<0.05).During the follow-up, there was no re-rupture of the graft, no stiffness of the knee joint and limitation of mobility; 1 case had a protruding femoral end compression screw, which was removed through the original incision under local anesthesia. Conclusion: Double-bundle ACL reconstruction combined with ALL reconstruction can significantly improve the knee function in revision patients with ACL graft failure. It can reduce the anterior translation of tibia, and effectively prevent postoperative rotational instability of the knee.","output":"[Effectiveness of double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction combined with anterolateral ligament reconstruction for revision]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The pathophysiology of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has not yet been fully understood and HFpEF is often misdiagnosed. Remodeling and fibrosis stimulated by inflammation appear to be main factors for the progression of HFpEF. In contrast to patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, medical treatment in HFpEF is limited to relieving HF symptoms. Since mortality in HFpEF patients remains unacceptably high with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Exercise seems to be a valid option. However, the optimal training regime still has to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the effects of a high-intensity interval (HIT) training vs. a moderate continuous training (MCT) on exercise capacity and disease-specific mechanisms in a cohort of patients with HFpEF. Methods: The proposed study will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting including 86 patients with stable HFpEF. Patients will undergo measurements of exercise capacity, disease-specific blood biomarkers, cardiac and arterial vessel structure and function, total hemoglobin mass, metabolic requirements, habitual physical activity, and quality of life (QoL) at baseline and follow-up. After the baseline visit, patients will be randomized to the intervention or control group. The intervention group (n = 43) will attend a supervised 12-week HIT on a bicycle ergometer combined with strength training. The control group (n = 43) will receive an isocaloric supervised MCT combined with strength training. After 12 weeks, study measurements will be repeated in all patients to quantify the effects of the intervention. In addition, telephone interviews will be performed at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years after the last visit to assess clinical outcomes and QoL. Discussion: We anticipate clinically significant changes in exercise capacity, expressed as VO2peak, as well as in disease-specific mechanisms following HIT compared to MCT. Moreover, the study is expected to add important knowledge on the pathophysiology of HFpEF and the clinical benefits of a training intervention as a novel treatment strategy in HFpEF patients, which may help to improve both QoL and functional status in affected patients.

Some of the many factors that contribute to medicine shortages, such as manufacturers' production processes and business decisions, are outside the control of Australian stakeholders. But there are many factors that are within the control of stakeholders, including poor communication between stakeholders, incomplete and inaccurate information, unhelpful practices and attitudes of hospital tender authorities, and lack of certainty and incentives for manufacturers in relation to pharmaceutical tenders. The following strategies are designed to address these issues and achieve a significant reduction in the number and frequency of medicine shortages in Australian hospitals. They include improving communication and understanding between stakeholders, providing higher quality information on likely usage, changing practices of hospital tender authorities to better meet stakeholder requirements, and increasing incentives for manufacturers to participate in hospital tenders. The six key actions to implement the medicine shortage-reducing strategies are: (1) initiate a biannual forum for hospitals and industry; (2) establish a medicines substitutes information service operating nationally; (3) share information on likely changes to hospital usage; (4) reform stock allocation strategies; (5) introduce incentives for manufacturers; and (6) change hospital tender authority practices and policies. The first step to reduce medicine shortages is for stakeholders to think differently about the problem, and to act more collaboratively using the proposed strategies and actions, as a framework for change.","output":"Medicine shortages: there are solutions!

However, the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination among general people is questionable. The availability of several vaccines' options against COVID-19 has perplexed people regarding individual vaccines' efficacy and safety. Therefore, we aim to determine the acceptance, preferences, impact factors of future COVID-19 vaccines in Malaysia and the factors influencing the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance among vaccine demand and vaccine delay groups. Material and Methods: An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among Malaysian residents 18 years and above of either gender using the snowball sampling technique. A self-administered questionnaire was made available to participants through various social media networks, email, and telegram. The data obtained from the survey were analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. Association between background characteristics and respondents were analyzed using the Chi-square test in the vaccine delay group and vaccine acceptance group. Results: Total of 1282 responses were considered for the study, mainly from male respondents (71%). Among the respondents, 95.9% thought that vaccination would be an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19, and 96% would accept vaccination if the COVID-19 vaccine were successfully developed and approved for listing in the future. Essential factors influencing vaccination decisions were vaccine convenience (95.7%) and doctors recommendation (97.3%).

DESIGN: This was a pre-post evaluation of the LEAP program. MOVE! coordinators (N = 68) were invited to participate in LEAP; 24 were randomly assigned to four starting times. MOVE! coordinators formed teams to work on improvement aims. Pre-post surveys assessed team organizational readiness for implementing change and self-rated QI skills. Program satisfaction, assignment completion, and aim achievement were also evaluated. PARTICIPANTS: VHA facility-based MOVE! teams. INTERVENTIONS: LEAP is a 21-week QI training program. Core components include audit and feedback reports, structured curriculum, coaching and learning community, and online platform. MAIN MEASURES: Organizational readiness for implementing change (ORIC); self-rated QI skills before and after LEAP; assignment completion and aim achievement; program satisfaction. KEY RESULTS: Seventeen of 24 randomized teams participated in LEAP. Participants' self-ratings across six categories of QI skills increased after completing LEAP (p< 0.0001). The ORIC measure showed no statistically significant change overall; the change efficacy subscale marginally improved (p < 0.08), and the change commitment subscale remained the same (p = 0.66).

In Georgia, Illinois, and Minnesota, we estimate that testing at USPS facilities would provide access to an additional 4.1, 3.1, and 1.3 million people and reduce the median travel distance by 3.0, 0.8, and 1.2 miles, respectively, compared with existing testing sites per 28 July 2020. We also discuss the option of distributing test-at-home kits via USPS instead of private carriers. Finally, our proposal provides USPS an opportunity to increase revenues and expand its mission, thus improving its future prospects and relevance.","output":"Expanding Access to COVID-19 Tests through US Postal Service Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: There is evidence of central nervous system impairments associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, including encephalopathy. Multimodal monitoring of patients with COVID-19 may delineate the specific features of COVID-19-related encephalopathy and guide clinical management. Objectives: To investigate clinical, biological, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in association with electroencephalographic (EEG) features for patients with COVID-19, and to better refine the features of COVID-19-related encephalopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study conducted in Piti-Salptrire Hospital, Paris, France, enrolled 78 hospitalized adults who received a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) and underwent EEG between March 30 and June 11, 2020. Exposures: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay or, in the case of associated pneumonia, on a computed tomography scan of the chest. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data on the clinical and paraclinical features of the 78 patients with COVID-19 were retrieved from electronic patient records. Results: Of 644 patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19, 78 (57 men [73%]; mean [SD] age, 61 [12] years) underwent EEG. The main indications for EEG were delirium, seizure-like events, and delayed awakening in the intensive care unit after stopping treatment with sedatives. Sixty-nine patients showed pathologic EEG findings, including metabolic-toxic encephalopathy features, frontal abnormalities, periodic discharges, and epileptic activities. Of 57 patients who underwent brain MRI, 41 showed abnormalities, including perfusion abnormalities, acute ischemic lesions, multiple microhemorrhages, and white matter-enhancing lesions. Fifty-five patients showed biological abnormalities, including dysnatremia, kidney failure, and liver dysfunction, the same day as the EEG. The results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis were negative for SARS-Cov-2 for all tested patients. Nine patients who had no identifiable cause of brain injury outside COVID-19 were further isolated; their brain injury was defined as COVID-19-related encephalopathy. They represented 1% (9 of 644) of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Six of these 9 patients had movement disorders, 7 had frontal syndrome, 4 had brainstem impairment, 4 had periodic EEG discharges, and 3 had MRI white matter-enhancing lesions. Conclusions and Relevance: The results from this cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 suggest there are clinical, EEG, and MRI patterns that could delineate specific COVID-19-related encephalopathy and guide treatment strategy.","output":"Association of Clinical, Biological, and Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings With Electroencephalographic Findings for Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Goldfish farming gained more attention among the ornamental fishes in aquaculture industry.

The spectrum of neurological manifestations linked to these viruses, and the importance of dual infection, are not known fully. We aimed to investigate whether neurological presentations differed according to the infecting arbovirus, and whether patients with dual infection had a different disease spectrum or severity. METHODS: We report a prospective observational study done during epidemics of Zika and chikungunya viruses in Recife, Pernambuco, a dengue-endemic area of Brazil. We recruited adults aged 18 years or older referred to Hospital da Restaura??o, a secondary-level and tertiary-level hospital, with suspected acute neurological disease and a history of suspected arboviral infection. We looked for evidence of Zika, chikungunya, or dengue infection by viral RNA or specific IgM antibodies in serum or CSF. We grouped patients according to their arbovirus laboratory diagnosis and then compared demographic and clinical characteristics. FINDINGS: Between Dec 4, 2014, and Dec 4, 2016, 1410 patients were admitted to the hospital neurology service; 201 (14%) had symptoms consistent with arbovirus infection and sufficient samples for diagnostic testing and were included in the study. The median age was 48 years (IQR 34C60), and 106 (53%) were women. 148 (74%) of 201 patients had laboratory evidence of arboviral infection. 98 (49%) of them had a single viral infection (41 [20%] had Zika, 55 [27%] had chikungunya, and two [1%] had dengue infection), whereas 50 (25%) had evidence of dual infection, mostly with Zika and chikungunya viruses (46 [23%] patients). Patients positive for arbovirus infection presented with a broad range of CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) disease. Chikungunya infection was more often associated with CNS disease (26 [47%] of 55 patients with chikungunya infection vs six [15%] of 41 with Zika infection; p=00008), especially myelitis (12 [22%] patients). Zika infection was more often associated with PNS disease (26 [63%] of 41 patients with Zika infection vs nine [16%] of 55 with chikungunya infection; p00001), particularly Guillain-Barr syndrome (25 [61%] patients). Patients with Guillain-Barr syndrome who had Zika and chikungunya dual infection had more aggressive disease, requiring intensive care support and longer hospital stays, than those with mono-infection (median 24 days [IQR 20C30] vs 17 days [10C20]; p=00028). Eight (17%) of 46 patients with Zika and chikungunya dual infection had a stroke or transient ischaemic attack, compared with five (6%) of 96 patients with Zika or chikungunya mono-infection (p=0047). INTERPRETATION: There is a wide and overlapping spectrum of neurological manifestations caused by Zika or chikungunya mono-infection and by dual infections. The possible increased risk of acute cerebrovascular disease in patients with dual infection merits further investigation.

In this paper, an analysis of image quality was done for Sentinel-2A/2B satellite images for different north Indian cities with respect to the impact of aerosols on image sharpness and surface reflectance values during the pre-lockdown and lockdown period. The image quality of the images was evaluated through the power spectrum, gradient, and reflectance values in the image. It was observed that the sharpness of the satellite images increased during the lockdown period due to the reduction in aerosols levels in the atmosphere. There was an increase in the power spectrum values from 5% (minimum) to 12% (maximum) in the blue band, 4% (minimum) to 10% (maximum) in the green band, and 1.7% (minimum) to 6% (maximum) in the red band in the satellite images of major cities in the Indo-Gangetic plain during the lockdown period.

He had no risk factors, and denied any further assumption of drugs except for fermented red rice, and berberine supplement. The clinical scenario was complicated by a multi organ failure involving bone marrow, liver, lung, and kidney. For the rapid increase of the inflammatory markers, a cytokine storm was suspected and multi-target biologic immunosuppressive therapy was started, consisting of steroids, anakinra, and eculizumab, which was initially successful resulting in close to normal values of creatine phosphokinase after 17 days of treatment. Unfortunately, 48 days after the vaccination an accelerated phase of deterioration, characterized by severe multi-lineage cytopenia, untreatable hypotensive shock, hypoglycemia, and dramatic increase of procalcitonin (PCT), led to patient death.

Here we used a systems vaccinology approach to comprehensively profile the innate and adaptive immune responses of 56 healthy volunteers who were vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2). Vaccination resulted in the robust production of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (derived from 2019-nCOV/USA_WA1/2020) and, to a lesser extent, the B.1.351 strain, as well as significant increases in antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells after the second dose. Booster vaccination stimulated a notably enhanced innate immune response as compared to primary vaccination, evidenced by (1) a greater frequency of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes; (2) a higher concentration of plasma IFN?3; and (3) a transcriptional signature of innate antiviral immunity. Consistent with these observations, our single-cell transcriptomics analysis demonstrated an approximately 100-fold increase in the frequency of a myeloid cell cluster enriched in interferon-response transcription factors and reduced in AP-1 transcription factors, after secondary immunization. Finally, we identified distinct innate pathways associated with CD8 T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, and show that a monocyte-related signature correlates with the neutralizing antibody response against the B.1.351 variant.

Quantitative fecal microbiota characteristics were obtained by 16S rRNA sequencing, and the data revealed several genera that may be relevant for the transformation of the acetylated DONs. Significant differences in the level of 3-Ac-DON and 15-Ac-DON conversion were observed among microbiota from different human individuals. 3-Ac-DON could be rapidly hydrolyzed; a ten-fold difference was observed between the highest and lowest in vitro conversion after 4 h. However, 15-Ac-DON was not fully transformed in the 4 h culture of all the individual samples. In all cases, the conversion rate of 3-Ac-DON was higher than that of 15-Ac-DON, and the conversion rate of 3-Ac-DON into DON varied from 1.3- to 8.4-fold that of 15-Ac-DON. Based on in vitro conversion rates, it was estimated that 45-452 min is required to convert all 3-Ac-DON to DON, implying that deacetylation of 3-Ac-DON is likely to occur completely in all human individuals during intestinal transit. However, for conversion of 15-Ac-DON, DON formation was undetectable at 4 h incubation in 8 out of the 25 human samples, while for 7 of these 8 samples conversion to DON was detected at 24 h incubation. The conversion rates obtained for these seven samples indicated that it would take 1925-4805 min to convert all 15-Ac-DON to DON, while the other 17 samples required 173-734 min. From these results it followed that for eight of the 25 individuals, conversion of 15-Ac-DON to DON was estimated to be incomplete during the 1848 min intestinal transit time. The results thus indicate substantial interindividual as well as compound specific differences in the deconjugation of acetylated DONs. A spearman correlation analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between deconjugation of both acetyl-DONs at 4 h and 24 h incubation. Based on the in vitro kinetic parameters and their scaling to the in vivo situation, it was concluded that for a substantial number of human individuals the deconjugation of 15-Ac-DON may not be complete upon intestinal transit.","output":"Interindividual Differences in In Vitro Human Intestinal Microbial Conversion of 3-Acetyl-DON and 15-Acetyl-DON"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was dubbed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization and declared a pandemic Initially thought to be a pathogen that primarily attacks the lungs, SARS-CoV-2 has turned out to be a much more formidable foe impacting almost every organ and system aggressively I report the case of a 60-year-old man who came to the ED due to symptoms of high fever, headache, mild confusion, dry cough and exacerbated dyspnea since the last 24 hours He had a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and was undergoing treatment with antifibrotic medication Apart from IPF, he had no other comorbid He acquired SARSCoV-2 infection by close contact and infection deteriorated into pneumonia and septic shock Complete blood count showed white blood cells at 3 3x10(3)/mu L and platelets at 71x10(3)/mu L;lymphocyte count was low Arterial blood gases revealed metabolic acidosis Definitive diagnosis was by a positive real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) finding of new-onset ground-glass opacities on the very first day of admission that was the presenting day The patient became unresponsive and died overnight As numbers of COVID-19 show an uprise, this case highlights that IPF patients with relatively advanced age need to exercise extra caution because they are at high risk for developing overwhelming COVID-19-linked sepsis, which may be fatal","output":"Overwhelming COVID-19 Sepsis in a Patient With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are the leading cause of disability among adolescents worldwide, yet access to treatment is limited. Brief digital interventions have been shown to improve youth mental health, but little is known about which digital interventions are most effective. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of two digital single-session interventions (Shamiri-Digital and Digital-CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy)) among Kenyan adolescents. METHODS: We will perform a school-based comparative effectiveness randomised controlled trial. Approximately 926 Kenyan adolescents will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Shamiri-Digital (focused on gratitude, growth mindsets and values), Digital-CBT (focused on behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring and problem solving) or a study-skills control condition (focused on note-taking and essay writing skills). The primary outcomes include depressive symptoms (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener-7) and subjective well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). The secondary outcomes include acceptability, appropriateness, primary control and secondary control. Acceptability and appropriateness will be measured immediately post-intervention; other outcomes will be measured 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: We hypothesise that adolescents assigned to Shamiri-Digital and adolescents assigned to Digital-CBT will experience greater improvements (assessed via hierarchical linear models) than those assigned to the control group. We will also compare Shamiri-Digital with Digital-CBT, although we do not have a preplanned hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will help us evaluate two digital single-session interventions with different theoretical foundations. If effective, such interventions could be disseminated to reduce the public health burden of common mental health problems.

A growing number of studies suggests a diverse spectrum of neurological manifestations. To investigate the spectrum of symptoms, we here describe the neurological manifestations and complications of patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection who have been hospitalized at the RWTH University Hospital Aachen, Germany. METHODS: Between March and September 2020, we evaluated common symptoms, clinical characteristics, laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis), radiological, and electroencephalography (EEG) data from 53 patients admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA) to screen for cognitive impairment, when feasible. We compared critically ill and non-critically ill patients categorized according to the presence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS: Major clinical neurological features of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were coordination deficits (74%), cognitive impairment (61.5%), paresis (47%), abnormal reflex status (45%), sensory abnormalities (45%), general muscle weakness and pain (32%), hyposmia (26%), and headache (21%). Patients with ARDS were more severely affected than non-ADRS patients. 29.6% of patients with ARDS presented with subarachnoid bleedings, and 11.1% showed ischemic stroke associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cognitive deficits mainly affected executive functions, attention, language, and delayed memory recall. We obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by lumbar puncture in nine of the 53 patients, none of which had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous findings, our results provide evidence for a range of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological manifestations. 26% of patients reported hyposmia, emphasizing the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, which can enter the olfactory bulb. It can therefore be speculated that neurological manifestations may be caused by direct invasion of the virus in the CNS; however, PCR did not reveal positive intrathecal SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we hypothesize it is more likely that the para-infectious severe pro-inflammatory impact of COVID-19 is responsible for the neurological deficits including cognitive impairment. Future studies with comprehensive longitudinal assessment of neurological deficits are required to determine potential long-term complications of COVID-19.

The purpose of this review is to describe and analyze current urogynecologic guidelines for optimizing usage of telemedicine when treating women with pelvic floor disorders.

Telemedicine is key in minimizing exposure without sacrificing treatments and quality of life. Recent studies published prior to the pandemic helped set the stage for successful components of virtual care. Nonsurgical options are crucial to beginning a treatment plan while elective surgeries are still restricted in many hospitals. Medication management and innovative technology, such as smart telephone applications, play a prominent role. The comprehensive literature review discussed here describes the degree of evidence supporting each management option, while also noting the limitations of telemedicine.

We then inhibited SGLT1 expression by lentiviral interference and drug inhibition, respectively. Inhibition studies showed that the level of phosphorylation of the downstream key proteins, MAPKAPK-2 and EZRIN, in the SGLT1-mediated p38MAPK/AKt2 signaling pathway was significantly increased. The surface NHE3 expression was also significantly increased, and NHE3 activity was also significantly enhanced. These results demonstrate that a TGEV infection can inhibit NHE3 translocation and attenuates sodium-hydrogen exchange activity via the SGLT1-mediated p38MAPK/AKt2 signaling pathway, affecting cellular electrolyte absorption leading to diarrhea.","output":"Decreased NHE3 activity and trafficking in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells via the SGLT1-mediated P38 MAPK/AKt2 pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This qualitative study explored the impact of COVID-19 self-isolation and social restriction measures on university students, through the perspectives of both students and the staff supporting them.

Participants were university students (n = 52) with self-isolation experiences and university staff (n = 26) with student-facing support roles. Focus group and interview data were combined and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Four themes emerged: Adaptation during the pandemic, Practical, environmental, and emotional challenges of self-isolating, Social factors and their impact on COVID-19 testing and self-isolation adherence, and Supporting self-isolation. Students and staff struggled with the imposed restrictions and shift to online education. Students found it difficult to adapt to new expectations for university life and reported missing out on professional and social experiences. Students and staff noted concerns about the impact of online teaching on educational outcomes. Students endorsed varied emotional responses to self-isolation; some felt unaffected whilst others experienced lowered mood and loneliness. Students were motivated by pro-social attitudes; campaigns targeting these factors may encourage continued engagement in protective behaviours. Staff struggled to manage their increased workloads delivering support for self-isolating students. Universities must consider the support needs of students during self-isolation and prepare for the long-term impacts of the pandemic on student wellbeing and educational attainment.

We cataloged this data and produced tables and graphs to obtain dynamic curves for certain parameters. In addition, we also calculated the change in active cases with the following formula: (newly infected) - (new deaths) - (new recoveries). Findings. The number of total cases increased by about 40 times in the period 2-20 March (from 2,036 to 80,539). In the same period, the active cases increased by about 21 times (from 1,835 to 37,860). Active cases do not close quickly and remain open for a long time because those who enter in intensive care do not recover before 2-3 weeks.

OBJECTIVES To identify factors that influence the severity of HRV illnesses. METHODS HRV species and types were determined in 1,445 nasal lavages that were prospectively collected from 209 infants participating in a birth cohort who had at least one HRV infection. Questionnaires were used during each illness to identify moderate to severe illnesses (MSI). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Altogether, 670 HRV infections were identified, and 519 of them were solitary infections (only one HRV type). These 519 viruses belonged to 93 different types of three species: 49 A, 9 B, and 35 C types. HRV-A (odds ratio, 8.2) and HRV-C (odds ratio, 7.6) were more likely to cause MSI compared with HRV-B. In addition, HRV infections were 5- to 10-fold more likely to cause MSI in the winter months (P < 0.0001) compared with summer, in contrast to peak seasonal prevalence in spring and fall. When significant differences in host susceptibility to MSI (P = 0.004) were considered, strain-specific rates of HRV MSI ranged from less than 1% to more than 20%. CONCLUSIONS Factors related to HRV species and type, season, and host susceptibility determine the risk of more severe HRV illness in infancy. These findings suggest that anti-HRV strategies should focus on HRV-A and -C species and identify the need for additional studies to determine mechanisms for seasonal increases of HRV severity, independent of viral prevalence, in cold weather months.","output":"Human rhinovirus species and season of infection determine illness severity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Technological communication methods such as telephone calls and video calls can help prevent social isolation and loneliness in frail older adults during confinement. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to determine which virtual communication method (ie, telephone call or video call) was preferred by confined older hospital patients and nursing home residents and the variables influencing this preference. METHODS: The TOVID (Telephony Or Videophony for Isolated elDerly) study was a cross-sectional study that was designed to examine the preference between telephone calls and video calls among frail older adults who were either hospitalized in a geriatric acute care unit or institutionalized in a long-term care and nursing home during the COVID-19 confinement period. RESULTS: A total of 132 older people were surveyed between March 25 and May 11, 2020 (mean age 88.2 years, SD 6.2); 79 (59.8%) were women. Patients hospitalized in the geriatric acute care unit were more able to establish communication independently than residents institutionalized in the long-term care and nursing home (P=.03) and were more satisfied with their communication experiences (P=.02). Overall, older people tended to favor telephone calls (73/132, 55.3%) over video calls (59/132, 44.7%); however, their satisfaction degree was similar regardless of the chosen method (P=.1), with no effect of age (P=.97) or gender (P=.2). In the geriatric acute care unit, the satisfaction degrees were similar for telephone calls (40/41, 98%) and video calls (33/38, 87%) in older patients (P=.10).

We recorded household characteristics, including characteristics of all household members, together with their views on prevention measures. In a subset of households one adult household member was asked to participate in an interview investigating their views on preventive measures. Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics and interview data by rapid framework analysis. A triangulation protocol was used to integrate findings. RESULTS: Thirty-four households (120 household members) were included in the quantitative survey. Twenty-two households were invited to be interviewed, of which 18 completed an interview (response 81.8%). Survey data showed that almost all households implemented some preventive measures, the use of face masks being least frequently reported. Measures taken depended on what was physically possible, the perceived severity of illness of the index patient and to what extent household members were willing to limit social interaction. Respondents did not believe in the effectiveness of wearing face masks within the house, and from the interviews this was explained by media coverage of face masks, impracticality and the stigma associated with wearing masks. Interviewees reported that quarantine had a high emotional burden and wished to have more information about the exact duration of quarantine, their own COVID-19 status, symptoms and when to seek medical help. CONCLUSION: People were willing to implement prevention measures, however actual adherence depended on perceived severity of illness and the perceived risk of becoming infected. Homes are social environments and recommendations for infection prevention should account for this context. Incorporating our findings into policy making could provide households with more relevant and actionable advice.","output":"Experiences and needs of persons living with a household member infected with SARS-CoV-2: A mixed method study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This retracts the article DOI: 10.7759/cureus.17381.].","output":"Retraction: Predictors of Quality of Life in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis in Pakistan: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 The diagnosis of COVID-19 is frequently based on a positive serological test We noted the occurrence of false-positive results for COVID-19 in the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip (ICS) assay in sera from patients with autoimmune diseases (ADs) This study aimed to evaluate the possible reasons for the false-positive results in two ICS assays (Wondfo ICS and Innovita ICS) and to investigate the effect of urea dissociation in reducing false-positive results Methods: The sera of 135 patients with ADs, 13 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 95 disease controls, and 120 healthy controls were tested for immunoglobin M (IgM) and IgG against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using Wondfo and Innovita ICS kits The distributions of auto-antibodies in antibody-positive and antibody-negative groups were also compared, and bivariable logistic regression was used to assess auto-antibodies associated with false-positive results A urea dissociation test of ICS was performed for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive samples Results: Specificity of Wondfo ICS for the 95 disease controls was 94 74% compared to 98 95% and 96 84% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively Specificity of Wondfo ICS for the 120 healthy controls was 97 5% compared to 100% and 99 17% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively Specificity of Wondfo ICS for AD patients was 73 33% compared to 97 78% and 96 30% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively Sensitivity was 74 07% for Wondfo compared to 70 37% for Innovita IgM and 66 67% for Innovita IgG Using the Wondfo ICS, the percentage of elevated rheumatoid factor (RF) level (&gt;20 IU/mL) was higher in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive group compared with the antibody-negative group [27/36 (75 0%) vs 34/99 (34 34%), P=0 001] The elevated RF was associated with antibody positivity, with an odds ratio of 4 671 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1 88-11 69] The specificity of the Wondfo ICS assay for the AD patients was increased from 73 33% to 94 07% after the urea dissociation assay Conclusions: An elevated serum RF level could lead to false-positive results when detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Wondfo ICS kit, and the urea dissociation assay would be helpful in reducing the incidence of false-positive results","output":"False-positive colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip assay reactions for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with autoimmune diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper implements the infection process of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19) in an agent-based model and compares the effectiveness of multiple infection prevention measures.

The COVID-19 pandemic crisis significantly impacted workplaces across the world. Healthcare workers (HCWs) had to promptly manage unpredictable daily severe critical patients, caring for severely traumatized patients, and frequent witnessing of death of patients. More recently, many studies highlighted how the large number of deaths and the way patients were dying significantly impacted mental health of HCWs, exposing them to the risk of developing post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. The main purpose of this study was to explore subtypes of HCWs on the levels of PTS symptoms, considering those workers who cared for patients who died of COVID-19. Materials and Methods. An online survey was conducted using LimeSurvey. We applied latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify profiles of PTS symptoms in a sample of Italian HCWs (n=543). LPA including one to six latent profiles were estimated by using MPlus 7 robust maximum-likelihood estimator (MLR). Results. LPA showed a three-latent-profile solution: high-PTS symptoms (high levels of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal;n=35), moderate-PTS (moderate levels of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal;n=397), and low-PTS (low levels of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal;n=111). Conclusions. To our knowledge, no studies have yet examined whether distinct subgroups of PTS symptoms can be identified among HCWs exposed to the death of COVID19 patients. Using person-centered methods for the identification of latent patterns of PTS symptoms may potentially have conceptual, diagnostic, and treatment implications.","output":"The impact of death of COVID-19 patients on mental health of healthcare workers: a latent profile analysis of post-traumatic stress symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes the clinical course, radiological findings, and outcome of two patients with the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who remained comatose for a prolonged duration following discontinuation of all sedation. These two male patients, one aged 59-years and another aged 53-years, both with a history of hypertension and neurologically intact on admission, developed worsening COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Both required benzodiazepine, opioid, neuromuscular blockade, therapeutic anticoagulation, and vasopressor infusions in addition to renal replacement therapy. Echocardiography demonstrated normal chamber size and systolic function in both cases. Each patient demonstrated only trace flexion to pain 7C10 days following discontinuation of all sedation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging on both patients demonstrated multifocal lesions on diffusion weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient correlate in bilateral middle/anterior cerebral artery borderzones, and no large-vessel occlusion or severe stenosis. In both patients, continuous electroencephalography demonstrated no seizures. Neither patient had any documented period of sustained hypotension (mean arterial pressure <60 mmHg) or hypoxia (SpO(2) <90%). Ninety days following initial presentation, the 59-years-old man was oriented, with fluent speech and able to ambulate with assistance, while the other 53-years-old man was at home and independent, undertaking the basic activities required by daily living. We conclude that critically-ill COVID-19 patients with prolonged coma following sedation discontinuation may demonstrate imaging features of ischemic injury in borderzone regions despite the absence of documented sustained hypotension or hypoxia.

We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity METHODS: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country.

Ten days later he developed more severe symptoms. PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Over the following two months his clinical state fluctuated, from almost symptom-free days to being bedridden and assessed as potentially terminal. After the initial positive test, he had three consecutive negative tests, before he again tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Uncertainty as to whether the patient remained contagious resulted in isolation of the patient for over two months. INTERPRETATION PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 does not differentiate between intact virus and remnants thereof, and patients may test positive for a long time.

However, there is a scarcity of studies exploring their concerns and priorities regarding research and its end products. The aim of this qualitative study was to generate empirical evidence regarding patient and caregiver perspectives on cystic fibrosis research and personalized medicine to foster developments in translational research in Canada. METHODS: A total of 15 focus groups were conducted, engaging 22 adults with CF and 18 caregivers (e.g., parents, siblings and partners) living in Canada. Inductive thematic analysis relied on an iterative process involving themes derived from both participant meaning-making and existing scientific literature. Participant perspectives were considered along intrapersonal, intracommunity, interpersonal, and structural lines. RESULTS: Overall, participants described a relationship to CF research inextricable from the lived experience of CF as a lifelong progressive and terminal disease and from the goal of advancing medical science. They were enthusiastic and excited about the emergence of CFTR modulators, although they had some knowledge gaps regarding the associated research. They largely spoke to positive experiences with researcher communication but had feedback regarding informed consent processes and the return of study results. Participants also voiced concerns about structural access barriers to research and to its end products. Extensive histories of research participation, a relatively small and intercommunicative CF community, and structural overlap between research and care settings contributed to their perspectives and priorities.

However, the specific mechanisms remain largely unexplored, besides as a lifestyle drug, its safety on the gut microbiome homeostasis has never been investigated. In this study, the effects of HXZQ on the gut microbiome of healthy adults were investigated for the first time, and the antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis mice model was applied for verification. Based on healthy adults, our results revealed that HXZQ exhibited mild and positive impacts on the bacterial diversity and the composition of the gut microbiome in a healthy state. As for an unhealthy state of the gut microbiome (with low bacterial diversity and deficient compositions), HXZQ significantly restored the bacterial diversity and recovered the abundance of Bacteroidetes. In the antibiotic-induced mice model, HXZQ distinctly revived the deficient gut microbial compositions impaired by antibiotics. At the genus level, the abundances that responded most strongly and positively to HXZQ were Bifidobacterium in healthy adults and Muribaculaceae, Lactobacillus, and Akkermansia in mice. In contrast, the abundance of Blautia in healthy adults, Enterococcus, and Klebsiella in mice showed inversely associated with HXZQ administration. At last, HXZQ might exhibit an anti-inflammatory effect by regulating the concentration of interleukin-6 in plasma while causing no significant changes in the colon tissue structure in mice. In conclusion, our results elucidate that the safety of HXZQ in daily use further reveals the modulatory effects of HXZQ on gut microbial community structure. These results will provide new insights into the interaction of THM and gut microbiome homeostasis and clues about the safe use of THM as a lifestyle drug for its further development.","output":"Modulatory Effects of Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid on Gut Microbiome Homeostasis Based on Healthy Adults and Antibiotic-Induced Gut Microbial Dysbiosis Mice Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The TriRhenaTech alliance presents a collection of accepted papers of the cancelled tri-national 'Upper-Rhine Artificial Inteeligence Symposium' planned for 13th May 2020 in Karlsruhe.

Amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) was recorded and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was acquired at 24 and 48 h. At 48 h, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive brain cell death, microglial activation/proliferation, astrogliosis, and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) were quantified. Hematology and plasma cytokines were serially measured. RESULTS: Two HT piglets died. aEEG recovery, thalamic and white matter MRS lactate/N-acetylaspartate, and TUNEL-positive cell death were similar between groups. HT increased microglial activation in the caudate, but had no other effect on glial activation/proliferation. HT reduced CC3 overall. HT suppressed platelet count and attenuated leukocytosis. Cytokine profile was unchanged by HT. CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe protection with HT in this piglet IS-HI model based on aEEG, MRS, and immunohistochemistry. Immunosuppressive effects of HT and countering neuroinflammation by LPS may contribute to the observed lack of HT efficacy. Other immunomodulatory strategies may be more effective in IS-HI. IMPACT: Acute infection/inflammation is known to exacerbate perinatal brain injury and can worsen the outcomes in neonatal encephalopathy. Therapeutic HT is the current standard of care for all infants with NE, but the benefit in infants with coinfection/inflammation is unknown. In a piglet model of inflammation (LPS)-sensitized HI, we observed no evidence of neuroprotection with cooling for 24 h, based on our primary outcome measures: aEEG, MRS Lac/NAA, and histological brain cell death. Additional neuroprotective agents, with beneficial immunomodulatory effects, require exploration in IS-HI models.","output":"Hypothermia is not therapeutic in a neonatal piglet model of inflammation-sensitized hypoxiaCischemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: OPD and OPD' are the two main active components of Ophiopogon japonicas in Shenmai injection (SMI). Being isomers of each other, they are supposed to have similar pharmacological activities, but the actual situation is complicated. The difference of hemolytic behavior between OPD and OPD' in vivo and in vitro was discovered and reported by our group for the first time. In vitro, only OPD' showed hemolysis reaction, while in vivo, both OPD and OPD' caused hemolysis. In vitro, the primary cause of hemolysis has been confirmed to be related to the difference between physical and chemical properties of OPD and OPD'. In vivo, although there is a possible explanation for this phenomenon, the one is that OPD is bio-transformed into OPD' or its analogues in vivo, the other one is that both OPD and OPD' were metabolized into more activated forms for hemolysis. However, the mechanism of hemolysis in vivo is still unclear, especially the existing literature are still difficult to explain why OPD shows the inconsistent hemolysis behavior in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, the study of hemolysis of OPD and OPD' in vivo is of great practical significance in response to the increase of adverse events of SMI. METHODS: Aiming at the hemolysis in vivo, this manuscript adopted untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics technology to preliminarily explore the changes of plasma metabolites and lipids of OPD- and OPD'-treated rats. Metabolomics and lipidomics analyses were performed on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system tandem with different mass spectrometers (MS) and different columns respectively. Multivariate statistical approaches such as principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were applied to screen the differential metabolites and lipids. RESULTS: Both OPD and OPD' groups experienced hemolysis, Changes in endogenous differential metabolites and differential lipids, enrichment of differential metabolic pathways, and correlation analysis of differential metabolites and lipids all indicated that the causes of hemolysis by OPD and OPD' were closely related to the interference of phospholipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a comprehensive description of metabolomics and lipidomics changes between OPD- and OPD'-treated rats, it would add to the knowledge base of the field, which also provided scientific guidance for the subsequent mechanism research. However, the underlying mechanism require further research.","output":"Global metabolomic and lipidomic analysis reveals the potential mechanisms of hemolysis effect of Ophiopogonin D and Ophiopogonin D' in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19's lethality as well as its rapid spread are responsible for the current world crisis; therefore, from the beginning, drugs with antiviral action against this agent were sought. It is impossible, for now, to know which person in a mild state will develop a high viral load or have a predisposition to develop an extreme response from the immune system, but early treatment in mild cases would not only guarantee greater efficacy, but would avoid severe cases. Currently, there are no double blind, randomized clinical trials or meta-analyzes available to make safe decisions; meanwhile, the pandemic is advancing in our country, generating pain and death. In this context, in Peru, scientific societies have expressed the need for the use of antiviral drugs, even with little evidence, based on the probability of success prior to treatment, for their in vitro effects and for their early clinical effects, such as: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir, ritonavir. Thus, in the country since march 29, 2020, there is a technical standard from the Ministry of Health, which facilitates the use of these at the national level for moderate and severe cases. We believe that under a structured system, first-level care centers could treat mild cases of COVID-19. Our country, through strategies for the prevention and control of TB and ITS/HIV/AIDS, has experience in managing treatment programs at this level.

However, a significant decrease of MT cases was observed in other countries such as France (2). It is unknown if the same phenomenon was observed across the entire U.S. The purpose of this study was to review the volumes of code stroke activation, emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) activation, and MT cases in a Stroke Belt region during statewide stay-at-home measures to determine if the percentage of ELVO and MT cases to all code stroke activations were equally affected. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed hospital data for code stroke activations, code stroke activations for large vessel occlusion (LVO), and MT cases for the 53-day stay-at-home ordinance in North Carolina (March 30 to May 22, 2020). This data set was compared to the two preceding (Dec 14, 2019 to March 29, 2020) and two following (May 23, 2020, to September 5, 2020) 53-day time periods. Results: Code stroke activation volumes during the preceding two 53-day periods leading up to the stay-at-home ordinance were 857 and 785 but significantly decreased to 632 during the statewide stay-at-home orders (P &lt; 0.01);this was a 23% reduction in volume compared to the mean of the two prior periods. All activations then rebounded to baseline levels (890, 886) in the two time periods after lifting stay-at-home orders. Similar decreases were noted for ELVOs and MTs during the stay-at-home time period as there was no significant change in the percentage of ELVO activations per all stroke activations (9.6%, P = 0.50) and cases that ultimately underwent thrombectomy (5.7%, P = 0.80) when compared to both the mean of the prior two 53-day time periods (8.4%, 5.3%, respectively) and the subsequent two respective time periods (9.0%, 4.8%, respectively). Conclusions: In our large catch-basin metropolitan region within the Southeast stroke belt, there was an overall and similar percentage decline in all code stroke activations, ELVO activations, and MT cases during the implementation of statewide mandatory stay-at-home orders. The data suggests that patients were either deferring care during stay-at-home orders despite the severity of symptoms, or there was an actual decline in stroke incidence across all severities in our region during this time period.","output":"Abstract No. 550 The impact of stay-at-home orders on code stroke activations and mechanical thrombectomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted healthcare delivery across the globe.

Moreover, previous research on epidemics shows that health care services are often disrupted during health crisesleading to less access to and lower utilization of health services unrelated to the health crisis. The primary aim of this research is to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on both routine and urgent health care visits. Using data collected in December 2020 on adults ages 54 to 100 living in one of nine senior living communities (SLCs) in the state of Nebraska (n = 723), logistic regression models were used to investigate correlates of missed health care visits, adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics. The results show that 58% of older adults in SLCs skipped or postponed a routine health care visit due to the pandemic, whereas 8% of older adults missed an urgent health care visit. The results further reveal that older adults with better perceived health (p < 0.05), higher life satisfaction (p < 0.01), and higher resilience (p < 0.05) all had lower odds of missing a routine health care visit due to the pandemic. In contrast, those who missed an urgent health care visit were more likely to have higher perceived financial strain (p < 0.05).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 2019, proper positioning of Forward Surgical Teams (FSTs) has been imperative in peer-to-near-peer conflict and led to the development of a far-forward surgical asset: The Golden Hour Offset Surgical Team (GHOST). Dedicated to damage control surgery close to combat, GHOST made the FST aero-mobile again, with a light logistical footprint and a fast setting. On 19 and 25 March 2020, Niger and Mali confirmed their first COVID-19 cases, respectively. The pandemic was ongoing in Sahel, where 5,100 French soldiers were deployed in the Barkhane Operation. RESULTS: For the first time, the FST had to provide, continuously, both COVID critical care and surgical support to the ongoing operation in Liptako. Its deployment on a Main Operating Base had to be rethought on Niamey, to face the COVID crisis and support ongoing operations. This far-forward surgical asset, embedded with a doctrinal Role-1, sat up a 4-bed COVID intensive care unit while maintaining a casualty surgical care capacity. A COVID training package has been developed to prepare the FST for this innovative employment. This far-forward surgical asset was designed to support a COVID-19 intensive care unit before evacuation, preserving forward surgical capability for battalion combat teams.

In HIV infection, the trans-activator of transcription protein, which has homology with vascular endothelial growth factor, impairs angiogenesis, leading to endothelial injury and possible PE development despite neutralization of their opposing immune states. Markers of ED show strong evidence supporting the adverse role of ART in PE development and mortality compared to treatment-na?ve pregnancies. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) to induce ED and hypertension, thereby mimicking angiotensin II-mediated PE in severe cases of infection. Upregulated ACE 2 in pregnancy is a possible risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent PE development. The potential effectiveness of LPV/r against COVID-19 is inconclusive; however, defective decidualization, along with elevated markers of ED, was observed. Therefore, the safety of these drugs in HIV-positive pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 requires attention. Despite the observed endothelial protective properties of DTG, there is a lack of evidence of its effects on pregnancy and COVID-19 therapeutics.

We report on a demonstration case study of improvements made in the Family Health Center (FHC) of the JPS Health Network in a refugee patient population that illustrate features of QI in a CAS framework as opposed to a traditional QI approach. METHODS We report on changes in health system utilization by new refugee patients of the FHC from 2016 to 2017. We review the literature and summarize relevant theoretical understandings of quality management in complex adaptive systems as it applies to this case example. RESULTS Applying CAS principles in the FHC, utilization of the Emergency Department and Urgent Care Center by newly arrived refugee patients before their first clinic visit was reduced by more than half (total visits decreased from 31%-14% of the refugee patients). Our review of the literature demonstrates that traditional algorithmic top-down QI processes are most often unsuccessful in improving even a few single-disease metrics, and increases clinician burnout and penalizes clinicians who care for vulnerable patients. Improvement in a CAS occurs when front-line clinicians identify care gaps and are given the flexibility to learn and self-organize to enable new care processes to emerge, which are created from bottom-up leadership that utilize existing interdependencies and interact with the top levels of the organization through intelligent top-down causation. We give examples of early adapters who are better applying the principles of CAS change to their QI efforts.

Daily generated variables representing an overall grade for distancing, changes in distances traveled, encounters between individuals, and daily visitation, were modeled as predictors of average R value for the following week, using linear regression techniques for 8 counties surrounding the city of Syracuse, New York. Supplementary analysis examined differences between counties. RESULTS A total of 225 observations were available across the 8 counties, with 166 meeting the mean R(t) < 3 outlier criterion for the regression models. Measurements for distance ( = 1.002, P = .012), visitation ( = .887, P = .017), and encounters ( = 1.070, P = .001) were each predictors of R(t) for the following week. Mean R(t) drops when overall distancing grades move from D+ to C-. These trends were significant (P < .001 for each). CONCLUSIONS Social distancing, when assessed by free and publicly available measures such as those shared by Unacast, has an impact on viral transmission rates. The scorecard may also be useful for public messaging about social distance, in hospital planning, and in the interpretation of epidemiological models.","output":"Social Distancing Metrics and Estimates of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Rates: Associations Between Mobile Telephone Data Tracking and R."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare over ten weeks the number of relapses, hospital admissions, calls made, admissions to therapeutic communities, face-to-face visits, treatment adjustment, number of injectables administered, and number of emergencies attended due to emotional and behavioral alterations and/or substance use disorder, and to describe and quantify social emergencies in an outpatient drug clinic (ODC) in Salamanca (Spain) from March 16, 2020, to May 22, 2020. METHODS: This is an ecological study of the COVID pandemic over ten weeks. The study examines the set of alcohol or other drug-dependent or dual disorder patients in the population of Salamanca, Spain. The measurements were: professionals; calls made; percentage of successful calls; face-to-face visits; first visits made; reviews made; techniques; injectable treatments; other treatments; evolution; relapses. The ODC includes about 375 new patients each year and another 650 other patients annually. RESULTS: The study found the number of relapses to be greater in the last five weeks of the 10-week study period. Patients' psychopathological instability also increased, and face-to-face visits were necessary. The most frequent psychopathology that required face-to-face intervention was depressive disorder. The number of interventions with patients increased. In parallel, social workers' efforts were greater after the seventh week. There was a decrease in response to calls. Throughout this time, the ODC attended to patients who needed to be treated for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: Confinement due to the coronavirus pandemic generated maladaptive emotional responses and other behaviors, such as excessive alcohol consumption. The number of face-to-face consultations, admissions, and referrals to therapeutic communities increased. Patients under stress and in social isolation resorted more often to substance use. The ODC had to adopt a flexible approach to evaluate patients with more serious problems, by using face-to-face assessments.","output":"A real-world ten-week follow-up of the COVID outbreak in an outpatient drug clinic in Salamanca (Spain)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite being trialed in other regions of the world, the use of molecular hydrogen (H(2)) for enhanced plant growth and the postharvest storage of crops has yet to be widely accepted in the UK.

Many of these effects appear to be mediated by the alteration of the antioxidant capacity of plant cells. Some effects seem to involve heme oxygenase, whilst the reduction in the prosthetic group Fe(3+) is also suggested as a mechanism. Although it is difficult to use as a gaseous treatment in a field setting, the use of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) has the potential to be of significant benefit to agricultural practices. However, the use of H(2) in agriculture will only be adopted if the benefits outweigh the production and application costs. HRW is safe and relatively easy to use.

It assesses the quality of services a unit provides in two dimensions: clinical quality and patient experience. Endoscopy units submit results to the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology twice a year. In Alberta, units receive an A, B, C or D grade for each of the 12 C-GRS Items and a C-GRS score. The C-GRS promotes that patient feedback is sought annually. Patient feedback is important because it informs practice improvement opportunities. However, survey creation, distribution, analysis and reporting can be time consuming and costly for an endoscopy unit and is a potential barrier to participation. Aims The purpose of this quality improvement project is to demonstrate how a provincial infrastructure, which includes coordination, management and reporting of an endoscopy patient satisfaction survey, can enhance provincial endoscopy unit survey participation and facilitate C-GRS compliance. Methods The Digestive Health Strategic Clinical Network (DHSCN), the Alberta Colorectal Cancer Screening Program and Primary Data Support (PDS) collaborated on the Provincial Endoscopy Patient Experience Survey (PEPES) in 2019. An existing paper survey was adapted to meet the needs of the 50 endoscopy units in AB with the addition of an electronic version. Education about the PEPES process was provided via a webinar and site visits. Each unit was responsible for distribution of the surveys to their patients. PDS coordinated the paper survey process and the DHSCN managed the electronic survey submissions. Paper survey results were merged with electronic PEPES data. A summary report was provided to units and shared with each AHS Zone Endoscopy Executive Leadership Team. Results Provincially coordinated implementation of the PEPES fosters compliance with C-GRS criteria. Participating endoscopy units were able to achieve at minimum 9 C-GRS descriptors and improve their C-GRS score in the following 7 of the 12 C-GRS Items: consent, comfort, equality, booking, privacy, aftercare and feedback. Initial enrollment in the PEPES increased with the onset of provincial coordination (Figure 1). However, subsequent participation was negatively impacted by COVID-19 as many endoscopy units in AB were required to decrease their capacity and redeploy staff. Conclusions A provincially coordinated approach to the management of an endoscopy patient experience survey is an effective way to enhance site participation and improve C-GRS scores. Units can focus on actioning survey results, rather than the burden of survey administration. Future work includes comparison of results across sites allowing for potential provincial equity issues to be addressed.

While being required to provide patients with high-quality medical services, nurses also bear the responsibilities and pressures from work, face trauma, disease and even death events, and are thereby more inclined to negative psychological feelings, decline in mental health, and reduction in the quality of their clinical nursing services. Under the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is urgent to carry out related intervention in nurses' psychological crisis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The mental health of 400 nurses from three tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China was assessed from September to December 2020. Then, time management training was conducted for 66 nurses who were voluntarily enrolled in the study. They were divided into the intervention group (35 participants) and the control group (31 participants). RESULTS: After the 16-week intervention, (1) there is a significant decrease in the total SCL-90 score of the intervention group and significant decreases in the scores in the 9 dimensions of the scale, suggesting significant improvement in the mental health level; (2) there is a significant increase in the score of the intervention group in subjective well-being, while there is no significant increase in the control group; (3) There is a significant decrease in the score of the intervention group in work stress reaction, but there is no significant decrease in the control group, and there is a significant increase in the physiological reaction of the control group in the measurement after 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: It is critical to pay attention to and solve the low mental health level of nurses during the COVID-19 epidemic; Time management training can effectively improve the mental health level of nurses, and it is an effective intervention model to promote nurses' mental health and relieve their work stress.","output":"Intervention Effect of Time Management Training on Nurses' Mental Health during the COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic brought significant changes on all aspects of health care.

METHODS: All general and vascular procedures performed during April 2020 were included in the study. Peri-operative data were extracted from electronic patient records. We looked into operation notes, COVID status and post-operative complications. Descriptive analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel software. RESULTS: Table 1 shows a breakdown of the 54 operations performed. There were 47 patients, with a male to female ratio at 1:1. Mean age was 46.9 years. There were 6 expedited cases but none elective. Mean duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 8.3 days. Laparoscopic work was kept to a minimum. A consultant was present for 63% of the cases. There were only 2 COVID positive patients, but the majority (74%) were not tested. 20% of patients suffered a complication requiring an intervention. 6/54 had an unplanned return to theatre and there were 5 deaths in total. CONCLUSION: The number of procedures during the first peak was significantly reduced following the uncertainty around the novel coronavirus.

These entities may appear after resolution of the respiratory syndrome. CASE REPORT: A previously healthy 64-year-old male patient came to the hospital reporting severe chest pain. He had a history of a COVID-19 pneumonia with PCR confirmation 4 weeks before. On admission to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU), the patient had a negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2; the following tests were performed: total T3 643.4 ng/dl (reference 35C193 ng/dl), total thyroxine 12.0 g/dl (reference 4.8C11.7 g/dl), free T4 1.85 ng/dl (reference 0.7C1.48 ng/dl), TSH 0.01 IU/ml (reference 0.35C4.94 IU/ml); total bilirubin 0.76 mg/dl (reference 0.0C1.5 mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase 185 U/L (reference 40C150 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 194.6 U/L (reference 6C66 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase 93.4 U/L (reference 9C55 U/L); on admission to the CCU high-sensitivity troponin I 548.3 pg/ml (reference 0.0C34.2 pg/ml), after 24 h in the CCU 801 pg/ml, and after 11 days (as an outpatient) 4.5 pg/ml.

It is associated with long-term disability. Ultrasonography is a reliable tool to quantify muscle mass, but studies that evaluate muscle quality at the critically ill bedside are lacking. Shear wave ultrasound elastography (SWE) provides spatial representation of soft tissue stiffness and measures of muscle quality. The reliability and reproducibility of SWE in critically ill patients has never been evaluated. METHODS: Two operators tested in healthy controls and in critically ill patients the intra- and inter-operator reliability of the SWE using transversal and longitudinal views of the diaphragm and limb muscles. Reliability was calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient and a bootstrap sampling method assessed their consistency. RESULTS: We collected 560 images. Longitudinal views of the diaphragm (ICC 0.83 [0.50C0.94]), the biceps brachii (ICC 0.88 [0.67C0.96]) and the rectus femoris (ICC 0.76 [0.34C0.91]) were the most reliable views in a training set of healthy controls. Intra-class correlation coefficient for inter-operator reproducibility and intra-operator reliability was above 0.9 for all muscles in a validation set of healthy controls. In critically ill patients, inter-operator reproducibility and intra-operator 1 and 2 reliability ICCs were respectively 0.92 [0.71C0.98], 0.93 [0.82C0.98] and 0.92 [0.81C0.98] for the diaphragm; 0.96 [0.86C0.99], 0.98 [0.94C0.99] and 0.99 [0.96C1] for the biceps brachii and 0.91 [0.51C0.98], 0.97 [0.93C0.99] and 0.99 [0.97C1] for the rectus femoris.

Results: Accordingly, 22 cases were decided as community-acquired, 3 cases as probable community-acquired, 5 cases as hospital-acquired, and 4 cases as probable hospital-acquired. The reason for sampling for SARS-CoV-2 was determined as having symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in 23 (67.6%) of 34 cases, preoperative screening of COVID-19 infection in 9 (26.5%), and high risky contact in 2 cases (5.9%). Considering contact histories epidemiologically, it was thought that transmission occurred to 8 healthcare staff from 2 cases, and to other patients or relatives from 8 cases, but sequence analysis could not be performed.

In the TDLUs, basement membrane separates the stroma from the epithelial compartment, which is divided into an inner layer of luminal epithelial cells and an outer layer of myoepithelial cells. Stem cells and progenitor cells also reside within the epithelium and drive a continuous cycle of gland remodelling that occurs throughout the reproductive period. D492 is an epithelial cell line originally isolated from the stem cell population of the breast and generates both luminal and myoepithelial cells in culture. When D492 cells are embedded into 3D reconstituted basement membrane matrix (3D-rBM) they form branching colonies mimicking the TDLUs of the breast, thereby providing a well-suited in vitro model for studies on branching morphogenesis and breast development. Peroxidasin (PXDN) is a heme-containing peroxidase that crosslinks collagen IV with the formation of sulfilimine bonds. Previous studies indicate that PXDN plays an integral role in basement membrane stabilisation by crosslinking collagen IV and as such contributes to epithelial integrity. Although PXDN has been linked to fibrosis and cancer in some organs there is limited information on its role in development, including in the breast. In this study, we demonstrate expression of PXDN in breast epithelium and stroma and apply the D492 cell line to investigate the role of PXDN in cell differentiation and branching morphogenesis in the human breast. Overexpression of PXDN induced basal phenotype in D492 cells, loss of plasticity and inhibition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as is displayed by complete inhibition of branching morphogenesis in 3D culture. This is supported by results from RNA-sequencing which show significant enrichment in genes involved in epithelial differentiation along with significant negative enrichment of EMT factors. Taken together, we provide evidence for a novel role of PXDN in breast epithelial differentiation and mammary gland development.","output":"Peroxidasin Enhances Basal Phenotype and Inhibits Branching Morphogenesis in Breast Epithelial Progenitor Cell Line D492."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have a structure consisting of spikes protruding from an underlying spherical surface. Research in biological and colloidal sciences has revealed secrets of why spikes exist on virus surfaces. Specifically, the spikes favor virus attachment on surfaces via receptor-specific interactions (RSIs), mediate the membrane fusion, and determine or change viral tropism. The spikes also facilitate viruses to approach surfaces before attachment and subsequently escape back to the environment if RSIs do not occur (i.e., easy come and easy go). Therefore, virus spikes create the paradox of having a large capacity for binding with cells (high infectivity) and meanwhile great mobility in the environment.

Three electronic bibliographical databases (CINAHL, EMBASE and MEDLINE) were searched through to 2 September 2020. A coding structure was created to guide the synthesis across the five sources of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 1634 records were retrieved through electronic searches and 57 documents were included in the critical interpretive synthesis. Thirty-one (31) key informant interviews and five focus groups were completed including observations (255 pages) and audio recordings. Twenty-four (24) programme documents were reviewed. The resulting theoretical framework outlines the key factors by context, describes the system drivers that impact the sustainability of midwifery associations and identifies the key-enabling elements involved in designing programmes that strengthen midwifery associations. CONCLUSION: Midwifery associations act as the web that holds the profession together and are key to the integration of the profession in health systems, supporting enabling environments and improving gender inequities.

In this context, a deep reorganization of allergy clinics, in order to ensure proper diagnosis and care despite of social distancing measures expose, is needed. MAIN TEXT: The reorganization of allergy clinics should include programmed checks for severe and poorly controlled patients, application of digital medicine service for mild-to-moderate disease in well-controlled ones, postponement of non urgent diagnostic work-ups and domiciliation of therapies, whenever possible. As far as therapies, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) should not be stopped and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) fits perfectly for this purpose, since a drug home-delivery service can be activated for the entire pandemic duration. Moreover, biologic agents for severe asthma, chronic spontaneous urticaria and atopic dermatitis should be particularly encouraged to achieve best control possible of severe disease in times of COVID-19 and, whenever possible, home-delivery and self-administration should be the preferred choice. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic, allergists have the responsibility of balancing individual patients needs with public health issues, and innovative tools, such as telemedicine and digital medicine services, can be helpful to reduce the risk of viral spreading while delivering up-to-date personalized care.","output":"Allergy clinics in times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: an integrated model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To summarize the measures and rules of Chinese medicine (CM) and provide reference for clinical application in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: The data source was from CM COVID-19 prevention and treatment programs on government websites and official media websites of the different provinces and cities. The search lasted from December 8, 2019 to March 10, 2020. Main variables were medication frequency and combinations of medicines. Cluster analysis and complex network analysis were used by prevention and treatment stage and by area. RESULTS: Among 27 CM diagnosis and treatment plans, 203 therapeutic prescriptions were enrolled, of which the top 4 herbs were: Radix glycyrrhizae, Semen armeniacae amarum, Herba ephedrae, and Herba agastachis, respectively. The core combinations were Herba ephedrae and Semen armeniacae amarum. Forty-eight preventive formulae were identified. Ten herbs, including Radix Astragali seu hedysari, Radix glycyrrhizae, Radix saposhnikoviae, Flos lonicerae, etc. were most frequently used. The core prescription of CM compatibility was Radix astragali seu hedysari, Radix glycyrrhizae, and Radix saposhnikoviae, which is the main component of Yu Ping Feng San. There were 45 prevention and treatment prescriptions in East China; the most used CM was Radix glycyrrhizae, Herba agastachis, Pericarpium citri reticulatae, and Gypsum fibrosum. Fifty prescriptions were identified in North China. According to CM analyses, Herba agastachis, Semen armeniacae amarum, Herba ephedrae, and Poria were most frequently used. CONCLUSIONS: CM for COVID-19 prevention mainly focuses on improving human immunity; for treatment, prescription focuses on clearing the lungs and removing dampness. Prescriptions vary with regions, perhaps due to climatic and environmental differences, which help clinicians to quickly make CM plans and treat patients according to clinical status, further minimizing resource wastage.

Further-more, for progress monitoring towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs), data availability at global scales as well as at different disaggregated levels is required. The high population coverage of mobile cellular signals has been accelerating the generation of large-scale spatiotemporal data such as call detail record (CDR) data. This has enabled resource-scarce countries to collect digital footprints at scales and resolutions that would otherwise be impossible to achieve solely through traditional surveys. However, using such data requires multiple processes, algorithms, and considerable effort. This paper proposes a big data-analysis pipeline built exclusively on an open-source framework with our spatial enhancement library and a proposed open-source mobility analysis package called Mobipack. Mobipack consists of useful modules for mobility analysis, including data anonymization, originCdestination extraction, trip extraction, zone analysis, route interpolation, and a set of mobility indicators. Several implemented use cases are presented to demonstrate the advantages and usefulness of the proposed system. In addition, we explain how a large-scale data platform that requires efficient resource allocation can be con-structed for managing data as well as how it can be used and maintained in a sustainable manner. The platform can further help to enhance the capacity of CDR data analysis, which usually requires a specific skill set and is time-consuming to implement from scratch. The proposed system is suited for baseline processing and the effective handling of CDR data;thus, it allows for improved support and on-time preparation.","output":"Development of Big Data-Analysis Pipeline for Mobile Phone Data with Mobipack and Spatial Enhancement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As studies continue into the development of a vaccine for COVID-19, research to understand and address the concerns raised by anti-vaxxers about vaccinations should also be undertaken in tandem Using the experience of Samoa, which was recently impacted by a measles epidemic, the authors discuss the importance of vaccination to developing countries and the devastation that can be wrought by vaccine-preventable diseases There are fewer laws on vaccination of adults when compared to those applicable for children, and not all countries have mandatory vaccination laws in place With increasing anti-vaxxer rhetoric towards the COVID-19 vaccine that is currently in development, the focus has been on reducing the spread of the misinformation through penalties or company interventions, but less so on addressing the underlying concerns of the anti-vaxxer community The authors suggest that involving anti-vaxxers in the discussion is critical to the acceptance and uptake of the vaccine to COVID-19 when it becomes available","output":"COVID-19 vaccines: Getting Anti-vaxxers involved in the discussion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is characterized by progressive, mild sensory symptoms and progressive areflexic weakness.

METHODS: We collated data on numbers of sexual and CAI partners reported in a continuous scale (write-in number) in thirteen MSM surveys on sexual health and behaviour across 17 countries. Pooled descriptive statistics for the number of sexual and CAI partners during the last twelve (N = 55,180) and 6 months (N = 31,759) were calculated for two sets of categories commonly used in reporting numbers of sexual partners in sexual behaviour surveys. RESULTS: The pooled mean number of partners in the previous 12 months for the total sample was 15.8 partners (SD = 36.6), while the median number of partners was 5 (IQR = 2-15). Means for number of partners in the previous 12 months for the first set of categories were: 16.4 for 11-20 partners (SD = 3.3); 27.8 for 21-30 (SD = 2.8); 38.6 for 31-40 (SD = 2.4); 49.6 for 41-50 (SD = 1.5); and 128.2 for 'more than 50' (SD = 98.1). Alternative upper cut-offs: 43.4 for 'more than 10' (SD = 57.7); 65.3 for 'more than 20' (SD = 70.3). Self-reported partner numbers for both time frames consistently exceeded 200 or 300. While there was substantial variation of overall means across surveys, the means for all chosen categories were very similar. Partner numbers above nine mainly clustered at multiples of tens, regardless of the selected time frame. The overall means for CAI partners were lower than those for sexual partners; however, such difference was completely absent from all categories beyond ten sexual and CAI partners. CONCLUSIONS: Clustering of reported partner numbers confirm common MSM sexual behaviour surveys' questionnaire piloting feedback indicating that responses to numbers of sexual partners beyond 10 are best guesses rather than precise counts, but large partner numbers above typical upper cut-offs are common.","output":"What is the empirical basis for converting banded ordinal data on numbers of sex partners among MSM into a continuous scale level variable?

Differentially modified phosphorylation sites and phosphorylated proteins between peak lactation (PL, 90 days postpartum) and late lactation (LL, 280 days postpartum) were investigated using an integrated approach, namely, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, to determine the molecular changes in the mammary tissues during the different stages of goat lactation. RESULTS: A total of 1,938 (1,111 upregulated, 827 downregulated) differentially modified phosphorylation sites of 1,172 proteins were identified (P values < 0.05 and fold change of phosphorylation ratios > 1.5). Multiple phosphorylation sites of FASN, ACACA, mTOR, PRKAA, IRS1, RPS6KB, EIF4EBP1, JUN, and TSC2 were different in PL compared with LL. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the calcium signaling pathway, oxytocin signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway were enriched. The western blot results showed that the phosphorylation levels of ACACA (Ser80), EIF4EBP1 (Thr46) and IRS1 (Ser312) increased and JUN (Ser63) decreased in PL compared with LL. These results were consistent with the phosphoproteome results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified for the first time the differentially modified phosphorylation sites in goat mammary tissues between PL and LL. These results indicate that the multiple differentially modified phosphorylation sites of FASN, ACACA, mTOR, PRKAA, IRS1, RPS6KB, EIF4EBP1, TSC2, and JUN and proteins involved in the calcium signaling pathway, oxytocin signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway are worthy of further exploration.","output":"Exploration of the lactation function of protein phosphorylation sites in goat mammary tissues by phosphoproteome analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This study explores whether the differences in cognitive performance among individuals with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) are attributable to the duration of AF and anticoagulant therapy and explores the possible inflammatory mechanism of cognitive dysfunction related to AF. METHODS A total of 260 patients aged 50-75 years without previous cerebrovascular events were enrolled in this study. These 260 patients had been divided into the AF group (140 patients) and sinus rhythm group (120 patients). In the AF group, we divided participants into cognitive impairment (CI) group (90 patients) and cognitive normal (CN) group (50 patients). In the sinus rhythm group, we also divided participants into CI group (61 patients) and CN group (59 patients). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess the cognitive function of all participants. Neuronal-derived exosomes were enriched in peripheral blood by immunoprecipitation and were confirmed by a transmission electron microscope, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blot. Alzheimer's disease-pathogenic exosomal proteins and inflammatory cytokines were quantified. The association between AF and cognitive function was estimated by logistic regression analysis. ANOVA or Welch's t-test compared the difference in protein concentrations between groups. RESULTS Non-anticoagulant therapy in patients with AF was significantly associated with CI (OR = 13.99, 95% CI: 2.67-73.36, p < .01). The incidence of dementia in patients with AF > 3 years was significantly higher than in patients with AF  3 years, but there was no significant difference in total cognitive dysfunction (mild cognitive impairment [MCI] + dementia) (p = .126). The adjusted exosome concentrations of T-tau and amyloid- protein 42 (A42) in the CI group were significantly higher than in the CN group (p < .001). The serum concentrations of IL-6 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in patients with AF were higher than those in patients with sinus rhythm (p < .001).

Several aspects, including genetic predisposition and immune dysregulation, are responsible for the development of IBD, with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis being the two most common variants. GVHD and IBD share multiple key features of their onset and development, including intestinal tissue damage and loss of intestinal barrier function. A further common feature in the pathophysiology of both diseases is the involvement of cytokines such as type I and II interferons (IFNs), amongst others. IFNs are a family of protein mediators produced as a part of the inflammatory response, typically to pathogens or malignant cells. Diverse, and partially paradoxical, effects have been described for IFNs in GVHD and IBD. This review summarizes current knowledge on the role of type I, II and III IFNs, including basic concepts and controversies about their functions in the context of GVHD and IBD. In addition, therapeutic options, research developments and remaining open questions are addressed.","output":"Interfering With Inflammation: Heterogeneous Effects of Interferons in Graft-Versus-Host Disease of the Gastrointestinal Tract and Inflammatory Bowel Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 provides an approach for assessing the infection burden across a sewer service area.

Technical replicates for N1 gene concentrations showed a relative standard deviation of 24%, suggesting it is possible to track relatively small (similar to 30%) changes in SARS-CoV-2 concentrations over time. COVID-19 cases were correlated significantly (rho >= 0.70) to wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations across large and small service areas, with weaker relationships (rho >= 0.59) in two communities. SARS-CoV-2 concentrations normalized to per capita slightly improved correlations to COVID-19 incidence, but normalizing to a spiked recovery control (BCoV) or a fecal marker (PMMoV or HF183) reduced correlations for a number of plants. Daily sampling demonstrated that a minimum of two samples collected per week were needed to maintain accuracy in trend analysis. The differences in the strength of SARS-CoV-2 relationships to COVID-19 incidence and the effect of normalization on these data among communities demonstrate that rigorous validation should be performed at individual sites where wastewater surveillance programs are implemented.","output":"Evaluation of Sampling, Analysis, and Normalization Methods for SARS-CoV-2 Concentrations in Wastewater to Assess COVID-19 Burdens in Wisconsin Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The containment of infectious diseases is challenging due to complex transmutation in the biological system, intricate global interactions, intense mobility, and multiple transmission modes. An emergent disease has the potential to turn into a pandemic impacting millions of people with loss of life, mental health, and severe economic impairment. Multifarious approaches to risk management have been explored for combating an epidemic spread. This work presents the implementation of engineering safety principles to pandemic risk management. We have assessed the pandemic risk using Pat-Cornell's six levels of uncertainty. The susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, recovered, deceased (SEIQRD), an advanced mechanistic model, along with the Monte Carlo simulation, has been used to estimate the fatality risk. The risk minimization strategies have been categorized into hierarchical safety measures. We have developed an event tree model of pandemic risk management for distinct risk-reducing strategies realized due to natural evolution, government interventions, societal responses, and individual practices. The roles of distinct interventions have also been investigated for an infected individual's survivability with the existing healthcare facilities.

Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, some of which orchestrate lipid metabolism via interaction with INSIGs. Recently, it was reported that expression of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) was induced by certain oxysterols; the precise of mechanism is unclear. Herein, we show that INSIGs mediate ATF4 upregulation upon interaction with oxysterol. Oxysterols that possess a high affinity for INSIG, such as 27- and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), markedly induced the increase of ATF4 protein when compared with other oxysterols. In addition, ATF4 upregulation by these oxysterols was attenuated in INSIG1/2-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells and recovered by either INSIG1 or INSIG2 rescue. Mechanistic studies revealed that the binding of 25HC to INSIG is critical for increased ATF4 protein via activation of protein kinase RNA-activatedClike ER kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2. Knockout of INSIG1 or INSIG2 in human hepatoma Huh7 cells attenuated ATF4 protein upregulation, indicating that only one of the endogenous INSIGs, unlike overexpression of intrinsic INSIG1 or INSIG2, was insufficient for ATF4 induction. Furthermore, ATF4 proactively upregulated the cell deathCinducible gene expression, such as Chop, Chac1, and Trb3, thereby markedly reducing cell viability with 25HC. These findings support a model whereby that INSIGs sense an increase in oxysterol in the endoplasmic reticulum and induce an increase of ATF4 protein via the protein kinase RNA-activatedClike ER kinaseCeukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 pathway, thereby promoting cell death.","output":"Insulin-induced genes INSIG1 and INSIG2 mediate oxysterol-dependent activation of the PERKCeIF2CATF4 axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose COVID-19 pandemic triggered unexpected crises, which were beyond the imaginations of a common man. It changed the order of routine life and the business world. In this challenging condition, the survival of the small business was at high risk. Following experiential learning theory, the purpose of this paper is to explore women's entrepreneurial learning obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges experienced by them and strategies undertaken to transform businesses. Design/methodology/approach To explore Pakistani women entrepreneurs' lived experiences and learning during the COVID-19, researchers used a qualitative interview design. The interviewees reported their experiences about the effects of COVID-19 on their business and entrepreneurial learning from such a crisis. Findings The findings of the study indicate new fractions of knowledge from the novel learning of the female entrepreneurs throughout the experience of the COVID-19. The transformation from manual business dealings and financial transactions to virtual dealing and the online transaction was the addition of novel learning. Furthermore, the analysis provides insights into the challenges experienced by women entrepreneurs, strategies undertaken and lessons learned from COVID-19. The life lessons learned showed the importance of technical skills and their business operations during the crisis. Research limitations/implications This study is very specific in its context and limitations of this study offers new avenue for research to extend study in different perspectives. First, interviews were conducted from women entrepreneurs running businesses in sub-urban cities of Pakistan, where study can be extended to include both male and female in a comparative study which can expose new dimensions. Second, this study is conducted in the sub-urban areas of the Sindh province of Pakistan, which can be extended to other areas of the country because Pakistan is multicultural and multilingual, which offer different gender specific factors for entrepreneurial activities in general terms but in case of the Covid-19 situation, there exists great variations and social stratifications. Third, this study can be extended to other developing or developed countries or comparative study can provide a new flavor of knowledge. Practical implications The study's finding offers few implications for the entrepreneurs, societies and government at large. Although the pandemic crisis has had devastating effects on health and lifestyle activities, there is always a ray of coming to innovative approaches to fulfill the entrepreneurial desires and serve the community. Thus, entrepreneurs are encouraged to contribute to the economy as a part of society through their sustainable products and services for the greater good. There is also a need for some social policies to find entrepreneurial ways to deal with the COVID-19 crisis that integrates value co-creation for society (Ratten, 2020b). Government and society should also intervene and play their role to encourage women entrepreneurs to feel a sense of empowerment, contribute to family income, alleviate poverty, create jobs and help in economic growth. Originality/value This study's unique contribution and origin are to explore the COVID-19-related entrepreneurial learning experiences of women entrepreneurs in a developing country (Pakistan).

To address the former, we evaluated if a genome-based predictive algorithm designed to predict clinical severity could predict polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results, as a surrogate for viral load and severity. Using a previously published algorithm, we compared the viral genome-based severity predictions to clinically-derived PCR-based viral load of 716 viral genomes. For those samples predicted to be \\"severe\\" (predicted severity score > 0.5), we observed an average cycle threshold (Ct) of 18.3, whereas those in in the \\"mild\\" category (severity prediction < 0.5) had an average Ct of 20.4 (P = 0.0017).

Post-war sociological and psychological studies of middle age regarded the midlife crisis as a manifestation of either biological or psychological change, as a moment in the life course when-perhaps for the first time-people felt themselves to be declining towards death. Although the midlife crisis has often been dismissed as a myth or satirized in novels and films, the concept has persisted not only in stereotypical depictions of rebellion and infidelity at midlife, but also in research that has sought to explain the particular social, physical and emotional challenges of middle age. In the spirit of the pioneering research of John Wilkins, John Bernal and Peter Medawar, each of whom in different ways emphasized the complex interrelations between science and society, I want to argue that the emergence of the midlife crisis-as concept and experience-during the middle decades of the twentieth century was not coincidental. Rather it was the product of historically specific demographic changes and political aspirations-at least in the Western world-to keep alive the American dream of economic progress and material prosperity.","output":"2019 Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar lectureLife begins at 40: the demographic and cultural roots of the midlife crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Differences in jurisdictional public health actions have played a significant role in the relative success of local communities in combating and containing the COVID-19 pandemic. We forecast the possible COVID-19 outbreak in one US state (Utah) by applying empirical data from South Korea and Italy, two countries that implemented disparate public health actions. Forecasts were created by aligning the start of the pandemic in Utah with that in South Korea and Italy, getting a short-run forecast based on actual daily rates of spread, and long-run forecast by employing a log-logistic model with four parameters. Applying the South Korea model, the epidemic peak in Utah is 169 cases/day, with epidemic resolution by the end of May. Applying the Italy model, new cases are forecast to exceed 200/day by mid-April, with the potential for 250 new cases a day at the epidemic peak, with the epidemic continuing through the end of August. We identify a 3-month variation in the likely length of the pandemic, a 1.5-fold difference in the number of daily infections at outbreak peak, and a 3-fold difference in the expected cumulative cases when applying the experience of two developed countries in handling this virus to the Utah context.","output":"Naive forecast for COVID-19 in Utah based on the South Korea and Italy models-the fluctuation between two extremes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are the cornerstone of point-of-care diagnostics.

Plasmonic LFAs (p-LFAs) enabled ultrasensitive detection and quantification of low abundance analytes, without compromising the direct visual detection of conventional LFAs. Dynamic ranges and limits of detection were up to 100-fold superior to gold standard ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). p-LFAs had sample-to-answer time of 20 min, compared to 4 hours for ELISA, while achieving over 95% analytical sensitivity and 100% analytical specificity for antibodies and antigens of SARS-CoV-2 in human specimens. We also demonstrate that the p-LFAs enable quantitative detection of the target analytes in a standard-free manner. p-LFAs offer potential as a broadly adaptable point-of-care diagnostic platform that outperforms standard laboratory tests in sensitivity, speed, dynamic range, ease of use, and cost.","output":"Plasmon-enhanced Quantitative Lateral Flow Assay for Femtomolar Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies and Antigens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article was migrated.

Objective: To gain insight into the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs working in elderly care settings. Design: Cross-sectional study among HCWs working in elderly care in the South-East of the Netherlands, testing for SARS-CoV-2, between March 31 and April 17, 2020. Setting: HCWs working in geriatric rehabilitation, somatic and psychogeriatric wards or small-scale living groups and district nursing, with a total of 5245 HCWs within 4 organisations. Participants: 621 HCWs with mild respiratory symptoms. Main Outcomes: Number of HCWs testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs, using real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene, N-gene, and RdRP. HCWs filled out a survey to collect information on symptoms and possible sources of infection. Results: 133/615 (21.6%) HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 15.6 to 44.4% per elderly care organisation, and from 0 to 64.3% per separate location of the organizations, respectively. 74.6% of tested HCWs were nursing staff, 1.7% elderly care physicians, 20.3% other HCWs with patient contact and 3.4% HCWs without patient contact. In the univariate analysis, fever, runny or stuffy nose, anosmia, general malaise, myalgia, headache and ocular pain were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while gastro-intestinal symptoms and respiratory symptoms, other than runny or stuffy nose were not. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity were contact with patients or colleagues with suspected or proven COVID-19. Whole genome sequencing of 22 samples in 2 facilities strongly suggests spread within facilities. Conclusions and Relevance: We found a high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs in nursing homes and district nursing, supporting the hypothesis of undetected spread within elderly care facilities. Structural testing of elderly care HCWs, including track and trace of contacts, should be performed to control this spread, even when only mild symptoms are present.","output":"Healthcare workers in elderly care: a source of silent SARS-CoV-2 transmission?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES End-of-life and bereavement care support services differ in critical care and inpatient hospice settings. There are limited population-level data comparing deaths in these two locations. We aimed to compare the characteristics of people who die in critical care units and in hospices, identify factors associated with place of death and report 12-year trends in Scotland. METHODS We undertook a cohort study of decedents aged 16 years in Scotland (2005-2017). Location of death was identified from linkage to the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group database and National Records of Scotland Death Records. We developed a multinomial logistic regression model to identify factors independently associated with location of death. RESULTS There were 710 829 deaths in Scotland, of which 36 316 (5.1%) occurred in critical care units and 42 988 (6.1%) in hospices. As a proportion of acute hospital deaths, critical care deaths increased from 8.0% to 11.2%. Approximately one in eight deaths in those aged under 40 years occurred in critical care. Factors independently associated with hospice death included living in less deprived areas, cancer as the cause of death and presence of comorbidities. In contrast, liver disease and accidents as the cause of death and absence of comorbidities were associated with death in critical care. CONCLUSIONS Similar proportions of deaths in Scotland occur in critical care units and hospices. Given the younger age profile and unexpected nature of deaths occurring in critical care units, there is a need for a specific focus on end-of-life and bereavement support services in critical care units.","output":"Deaths in critical care and hospice-prevalence, trends, influences: a national decedent cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through excessive end organ inflammation Despite improved understanding of the pathophysiology, management, and the great efforts worldwide to produce effective drugs, death rates of COVID-19 patients remain unacceptably high, and effective treatment is unfortunately lacking Pharmacological strategies aimed at modulating inflammation in COVID-19 are being evaluated worldwide Several drug therapies targeting this excessive inflammation, such as tocilizumab, an interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitor, corticosteroids, programmed cell death protein (PD)-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition, cytokine-adsorption devices, and intravenous immunoglobulin have been identified as potentially useful and reliable approaches to counteract the cytokine storm However, little attention is currently paid for non-drug therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory and immunological processes that may be useful for reducing COVID-19-induced complications and improving patient outcome Vagus nerve stimulation attenuates inflammation both in experimental models and preliminary data in human Modulating the activity of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways (CAPs) described by the group of KJ Tracey has indeed become an important target of therapeutic research strategies for inflammatory diseases and sepsis Non-invasive transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (t-VNS), as a non-pharmacological adjuvant, may help reduce the burden of COVID-19 and deserve to be investigated VNS as an adjunct therapy in COVID-19 patients should be investigated in clinical trials Two clinical trials on this topic are currently underway (NCT04382391 and NCT04368156) The results of these trials will be informative, but additional larger studies are needed","output":"Vagus Nerve Stimulation: A Potential Adjunct Therapy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate demand forecasting is always critical to supply chain management.

Psychosocial resources are thought to buffer adverse effects of pandemic stressors on mental health. This rapid review summarizes evidence on the specific interplay of pandemic burden and psychosocial resources with regard to the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal was to derive potential starting points for supportive interventions. METHODS: We conducted a rapid systematic review following the recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. We searched 7 databases in February 2021 and included peer-reviewed quantitative studies, that reported related data on pandemic stressors, psychosocial resources, and mental health of HCWs. RESULTS: 46 reports were finally included in the review and reported data on all three outcomes at hand. Most studies (n = 41) applied a cross-sectional design. Our results suggest that there are several statistically significant pandemic risk factors for mental health problems in HCWs such as high risk and fear of infection, while resilience, active and emotion-focused coping strategies as well as social support can be considered beneficial when protecting different aspects of mental health in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence for patterns of interaction between outcomes were found in the context of coping style when facing specific pandemic stressors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that several psychosocial resources may play an important role in buffering adverse effects of pandemic burden on the mental health of HCWs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, causal interpretations of mentioned associations are inadequate due to the overall low study quality and the dominance of cross-sectional study designs.

A central feature of hosts is their population structure (e.g. spatial). Additionally, hosts themselves can exhibit different degrees of symptoms when newly infected; this latency is a key life-history property of pathogens. With an evolutionary-epidemiological model, we examine the role of population structure on the evolutionary dynamics of latency. We focus on specific power-law-like formulations for transmission and progression from the first infectious stage as a function of latency, assuming that the across-group to within-group transmission ratio increases if hosts are less symptomatic. We find that simple population heterogeneity can lead to local evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) at zero and infinite latency in situations where a unique ESS exists in the corresponding homogeneous case. Furthermore, there can exist more than one interior evolutionarily singular strategy. We find that this diversity of outcomes is due to the (possibly slight) advantage of across-group transmission for pathogens that produce fewer symptoms in a first infectious stage. Thus, our work reveals that allowing individuals without symptoms to travel can have important unintended evolutionary effects and is thus fundamentally problematic in view of the evolutionary dynamics of latency.","output":"Evolution of an asymptomatic first stage of infection in a heterogeneous population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SOURCE CITATION: RECOVERY Collaborative Group.

Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been associated with a host of symptoms affecting numerous organ systems, including the lungs, cardiovascular system, kidney, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, among others. OBJECTIVE: Although several risk factors have been identified as related to complications from and severity of COVID-19, much about the virus remains unknown. The host immune response appears to affect the outcome of disease. It is not surprising that patients with intrinsic or secondary immune compromise might be particularly susceptible to complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathogenic loss-of-function or gain-of-function heterozygous variants in nuclear factor-&#954;B2 have been reported to be associated with either a combined immunodeficiency or common variable immunodeficiency phenotype. METHODS: We evaluated the functional consequence and immunologic phenotype of a novel NFKB2 loss of function variant in a 17-year-old male patient and describe the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this context. RESULTS: This patient required a 2-week hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 7 days of mechanical ventilation. We used biologic therapies to avert potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and treat hyperinflammatory responses. The patient had an immunologic phenotype of B-cell dysregulation with decreased switched memory B cells. Despite the underlying immune dysfunction, he recovered from the infection with intense management.

The positivity of a molecular test cannot respond to the question regarding the viral capability to replicate, spread, and give different clinical effects. Despite the fact that some targets are covered by commercially-available assays, the identification of new biomarkers is desired in order to improve the quality of the information given by these assays. Therefore, since the subgenomic transcripts (sgN and sgE) are considered markers of viral activity, we evaluated these subgenomic transcripts in relation to the genomic amplification obtained using five different commercial CE-IVD tools. Methods: Five CE-IVD kits were compared in terms of their capability to detect both synthetic SARS-CoV-2 viral constructs (spiked in TMB or PBS medium) and targets (N, E, RdRp and Orf1ab genes) in twenty COVID-19-positive patients' swabs. The sgN and sgE were assayed by real-time RT-qPCR and digital PCR. Results: None of the diagnostic kits missed the viral target genes when they were applied to targets spiked in TMB or PBS (at dilutions ranging from 100 pg to 0.1 pg). Nevertheless, once they were applied to RNA extracted from the patients' swabs, the superimposability ranged from 50% to 100%, regardless of the extraction procedure. The sgN RNA transcript was detected only in samples with a higher viral load (Ct &#8804; 22.5), while sgE was within all of the Ct ranges. Conclusions: The five kits show variable performances depending on the assay layout. It is worthy of note that the detection of the sgN transcript is associated with a higher viral load, thus representing a new marker of early and more severe infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Subgenomic N (sgN) Transcripts in Oro-Nasopharyngeal Swabs Correlate with the Highest Viral Load, as Evaluated by Five Different Molecular Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serosurveys may help to assess the transmission dynamics in high-risk groups The aim of the study was to assess the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in people who had performed essential activities during the lock-down period in the Province of Prato (Italy), and to evaluate the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 according to the type of service All the workers and volunteers of the Civil Protection, employees of the municipalities, and all the staff of the Health Authority of the Province of Prato were invited to be tested with a rapid serological test A total of 4656 participants were tested SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 138 (2 96%) cases The seroprevalence in health care workers, in participants involved in essential support services and in those who worked from home were 4 1%, 1 4% and 1 0%, respectively Health care workers experienced higher odds of seropositivity (OR 4 38, 95%CI 2 19-10 41) than participants who were assigned to work-from-home;no significant seropositivity differences were observed between support services and work-from-home groups A low circulation of SARS-CoV-2 was observed among participants performing different essential activities Findings highlighted the risk of in-hospital transmission in healthcare workers and that community support services may increase the risk of seropositivity to a limited extent in low incidence areas","output":"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey in people involved in different essential activities during the general lock-down phase in the province of Prato (Tuscany, Italy)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Targeted temperature management is recommended after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Whether advanced internal cooling is superior to basic external cooling remains unknown. The aim of this multicenter, controlled trial was to evaluate the benefit of endovascular versus basic surface cooling. METHODS AND RESULTS Inclusion criteria were the following: age of 18 to 79 years, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to a presumed cardiac cause, time to return of spontaneous circulation <60 minutes, delay between return of spontaneous circulation and inclusion <240 minutes, and unconscious patient after return of spontaneous circulation and before the start of cooling. Exclusion criteria were terminal disease, pregnancy, known coagulopathy, uncontrolled bleeding, temperature on admission <30C, in-hospital cardiac arrest, immediate need for extracorporeal life support or hemodialysis. Patients were randomized between 2 cooling strategies: endovascular femoral devices (Icy catheter, Coolgard, Zoll, formerly Alsius; n=203) or basic external cooling using fans, a homemade tent, and ice packs (n=197). The primary end point, that is, favorable outcome evaluated by survival without major neurological damage (Cerebral Performance Categories 1-2) at day 28, was not significantly different between groups (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-2.16; P=0.107). Improvement in favorable outcome at day 90 in favor of the endovascular group did not reach significance (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-2.35; P=0.07). Time to target temperature (33C) was significantly shorter and target hypothermia was more strictly maintained in the endovascular than in the surface group (P<0.001). Minor side effects directly related to the cooling method were observed more frequently in the endovascular group (P=0.009). CONCLUSION Despite better hypothermia induction and maintenance, endovascular cooling was not significantly superior to basic external cooling in terms of favorable outcome.

As the pandemic continues, variations in SARS-CoV-2 virus strains have been found in many countries. In this study, we directly assess the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 epitope variants. We first predicted potential HLA-A*02:01-restricted CD8(+) T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2. Using the T2 cell model, HLA-A*02:01-restricted T-cell epitopes were screened for their binding affinity and ability to activate T cells. Subsequently, we examined the identified epitope variations and analyzed their impact on immune response. Here, we identified specific HLA-A2-restricted T-cell epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Seven epitope peptides were confirmed to bind with HLA-A*02:01 and potentially be presented by antigen-presenting cells to induce host immune responses. Tetramers containing these peptides could interact with specific CD8(+) T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients, and one dominant epitope (n-Sp1) was defined. These epitopes could activate and generate epitope-specific T cells in vitro, and those activated T cells showed cytolytic activity toward target cells. Meanwhile, n-Sp1 epitope variant 5L>F significantly decreased the proportion of specific T-cell activation; n-Sp1 epitope 8L>V variant showed significantly reduced binding to HLA-A*02:01 and decreased proportion of n-Sp1-specific CD8(+) T cell, which potentially contributes to the immune escape of SARS-CoV-2. Our data indicate that the variation of a dominant epitope will cause the deficiency of HLA-A*02:01 binding and T-cell activation, which subsequently requires the formation of a new CD8(+) T-cell immune response in COVID-19 patients.","output":"CD8(+) T-Cell Epitope Variations Suggest a Potential Antigen HLA-A2 Binding Deficiency for Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe with incendiary events that transformed not only economies and health, but also education at all levels, in all nations, and to all people.

We carry out an inference process to identify the interactions, in which we implement the a pairwise Ising distribution model describing the first and second moments of the distribution of the discretized returns of each asset. Our results indicate that second-order interactions explain more than 80% of the entropy in the system during the Subprime Crisis and slightly higher than 50% during the COVID-19 outbreak independently of the period of high or low volatility analyzed. The evidence shows that during these periods, slight changes in the second-order interactions are enough to induce large changes in assets correlations but the proportion of positive and negative interactions remains virtually unchanged. Although some interactions change signs, the proportion of these changes are the same period to period, which keeps the system in a ferromagnetic state.

In a longitudinal observational design with four assessment waves from March, 27th until June, 15th 2020, a total of 6,551 adults from Germany was assessed. 4,175 individuals participated in one, 1,070 in two, 803 in three, and 503 in all four waves of data collection. Multilevel analyses revealed that across all assessment waves, COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were significantly higher in individuals with vs. without anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders. All symptoms decreased on average over time, and this decrease was significantly stronger in individuals with vs. without anxiety disorders, and particularly driven by individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. Our findings suggest that individuals with mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders - and in particular those with a generalized anxiety disorder - seem to be vulnerable to experience psychological strain in the context of the pandemic, might likely overestimate potential threat, and should be targeted by preventive and therapeutic interventions.","output":"Longitudinal changes of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: The role of pre-existing anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract TGEV and PEDV are porcine coronaviruses with typical coronavirus virion structures and replication cycles.

This contrasted with its Scandinavian neighbours which implemented stringent restrictions. The influence these different approaches had on mobility, and thus on COVID-19 mortality was investigated. METHODS: Datasets indicating restriction severity and community mobility were examined; Google's Community Movement Reports' (CMR) show activity at key location categories; the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker collates legislative restrictions into a Stringency Index (SI). RESULTS: CMR mobility categories were negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality. The strongest correlations were obtained by negatively time lagging mortality data, suggesting restrictions had a delayed influence. During the first wave a model using SI (AIC 632.87) proved favorable to one using contemporaneous CMR data and SI (AIC 1193.84), or lagged CMR data and SI (AIC 642.35). Validation using second wave data confirmed this; the model using SI solely again being optimal (RMSE: 0.2486 vs. 0.522 and 104.62). Cross-country differences were apparent in all models; Swedish data, independent of SI and CMR, proved significant throughout.

Based on 2019 OPTN reports, annualized reduction in kidney transplantation of 25%-100% could result in excess deaths of wait-listed (deceased donor) transplant candidates from 84 to 337 and living donor candidate excess deaths from 35 to 141 (total 119-478 potentially preventable deaths of transplant candidates). Changes in transplant activity due to COVID-19 varied with some centers shutting down while others simply heeded known or suspected pandemic risks. Understanding potential excess mortality for ESRD transplant candidates when circumstances compel curtailment of transplant activity may inform policy and procedural aspects of organ transplant systems allowing ways to best inform patients and families as to potential risks in shuttering organ transplant activity.

The economic model is based on the time-shift of available quarterly projections deriving from the expected delay or acceleration of the national vaccination plan against COVID-19. Findings The basic concept underlying the scenario analysis is that the sustainability of the expected recovery of the Italian economy due to the COVID-19 shock, and consequently the growth of the GDP, is time-dependent on the rollout of the national vaccination plan. Research limitations/implications A delay in the vaccination campaign could have a twofold negative impact on the growth of the Italian gross product: it reduces the quarterly growth over the previous year in the short term and it delays the quarterly upwards trend over the next two years. Policymakers and practitioners are called to promptly face new dynamic scenarios due to public and economic policies to fight the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt of research that focuses attention on the synchrony between the economic time necessary for recovery and the real-time necessary to achieve vaccination coverage for the restart of production activities.","output":"Knowledge management in turbulent times: time-based scenario analysis of vaccinations against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In 2009, the Institute of Medicine published guidelines for implementation of Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) at the state level in the United States (US). Based in part on the then concern for H1N1 pandemic, there was a recognized need for additional planning at the state level to maintain health system preparedness and conventional care standards when available resources become scarce. Despite the availability of this framework, in the years since and despite repeated large-scale domestic events, implementation remains mixed. PROBLEM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rejuvenates concern for how health systems can maintain quality care when faced with unrelenting burden. This study seeks to outline which states in the US have developed CSC and which areas of care have thus far been addressed. METHODS: An online search was conducted for all 50 states in 2015 and again in 2020. For states without CSC plans online, state officials were contacted by email and phone. Public protocols were reviewed to assess for operational implementation capabilities, specifically highlighting guidance on ventilator use, burn management, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, pediatric standards, and reliance on influenza planning. RESULTS: Thirty-six states in the US were actively developing (17) or had already developed (19) official CSC guidance. Fourteen states had no publicly acknowledged effort. Eleven of the 17 public plans had updated within five years, with a majority addressing ventilator usage (16/17), influenza planning (14/17), and pediatric care (15/17), but substantially fewer addressing care for burn patients (9/17). CONCLUSION: Many states lacked publicly available guidance on maintaining standards of care during disasters, and many states with specific care guidelines had not sufficiently addressed the full spectrum of hazard to which their health care systems remain vulnerable.","output":"Crisis Standards of Care Implementation at the State Level in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: There is paucity of literature comparing outcomes of kidney transplant patients with Covid-19 to that of dialysis and waitlisted patients. This report describes our data, provides comparative analysis, together with meta-analysis of published studies and describes our protocols to restart the transplant programme. Methods: Data were analysed on kidney transplant, dialysis and waitlisted patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (naso-pharyngeal swab PCR) between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020 together with meta-analysis of 16 studies. Results: 23/1494 kidney transplant patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to 123/1278 haemodialysis patients (1.5% vs 9.6%, p<0.001), 12/253 waitlisted patients (1.5% vs 4.7%, p=0.002). 19 required hospital admission, 6 died and 13 developed AKI. Overall case fatality ratio was 26.1% compared to patients on haemodialysis (27.6%, p=0.99) and waitlisted patients (8.3%, p=0.38). Within our entire cohort, 0.4% of transplant patients died compared to 0.4% of waitlisted patients and 2.7% of haemodialysis patients. Patients who died were older [Alive (median 71years) vs. Dead (median 59years), p=0.01]. In meta-analysis of 16 studies, including ours, pooled case fatality ratio was 24% [95%CI (19%, 28%)]; AKI proportion in 10 studies was 50% [95%CI (45%, 56%)], with some evidence against no heterogeneity between studies (p=0.02). Conclusions: From our cohort of transplant patients, a significantly lower proportion of patients contracted COVID-19 compared to waitlisted and dialysis patients. The case fatality ratio was comparable to that of dialysis cohort and pooled case fatality ratio from meta-analysis of 16 studies. The pooled AKI ratio in the meta-analysis was similar to our experience.","output":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 and kidney transplant recipients, the South West London Kidney Transplant Network experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine offers a support to traditional medicine, delivering clinical services when distance is a critical factor. Although this tool does not replace a medical examination, during Covid-19 pandemic, it reduces the spread of infection and avoids the need for a patient's visit. It is useful in the management of chronic disorders or for patients undergoing palliative treatment. The University Hospital of Palermo has applied this in cases of chronic illness caring for patients who cannot stop their treatment, such as Department of Onco-Haematology, Internal Medicine, Dermatology, etc. The Department of Legal Medicine of Palermo, in particular, is also using telemedicine to manage medico-legal sudden natural death investigations and dealing with the Public Prosecutor's office of Palermo. Even after the Covid-19 emergency, telemedicine will be essential to streamline outpatient visits, while at the same time limiting costs, with significant benefits for the Italian National Public Health Service budget.

With this study we investigated the perceptions of doctors and nurses on hybridization in clinical directorates (CDs) in hospitals. METHODS: We investigated the attitudes of healthcare professionals (doctors and nurses) towards eight hospital CDs in the Local Health Authority (LHA) of Bologna (Emilia Romagna, Italy) 6 years after their implementation. We used a validated questionnaire by Braithwaite and Westbrook (2004). Drawing on Palmer et al. (2007), we added a section about the characteristics of department heads. In all, 123 healthcare professionals in managerial roles completed and returned the questionnaire. The return rate was 47.4% for doctors and 31.6% for nurses. RESULTS: Doctors reported an increase in clinical governance, interdisciplinarity collaboration, and standardization of clinical work. Hybridization of practices was noted to have taken place. While doctors did not see these changes as a threat to professional values, they felt that hospital managers had taken greater control. There was a large overlap of attitudes between doctors and nurses: inter-professional integration in CDs fostered alignment of values and aims. The polarity index was higher for responses from the doctors than from the nurses. CONCLUSION: The study findings have implications for policy makers and managers: mission and strategic mandate of CDs; governance of CDs, leadership issues; opportunities for engaging healthcare professionals; changes in managerial involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The model implies that inequality has large negative effects on output, while also diminishing the effects of demand-side fiscal stimulus. COVID restrictions can reduce current-period GDP by more than is directly associated with the restrictions themselves when rigid capital costs induce firm exit.

A computational framework of TMVR was developed to assess the neoLVOT area and quantify the sub-aortic flow structure. We observed that the annuloplasty ring serves as the key anchor zone of S3 Ultra THV. A good agreement was found between the numerically-predicted and CT-imaging measurements of neoLVOT area, with differences less than 10% in both patients. The pressure drop across the neoLVOT did not determine hemodynamic impairment in both patients. Quantification of structural and hemodynamic variables by computational modeling may facilitate more accurate predictions of the LVOT obstruction in TMVR, particularly for patients which are considered to have a borderline risk of obstruction.","output":"Simulation of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction in transcatheter mitral valve-in-ring replacement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As epitope mimics, mimotopes have been widely utilized in the study of epitope prediction and the development of new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

Well-established health information systems (HIS) are crucial in providing data to allow evidence-based policymaking and public health interventions in the pandemic response. This study aimed to compare morbidity information between two databases for COVID-19 management in Portugal and identify potential complementarities. METHODS: This is an observational study using records from both COVID-19 cases surveillance (National Epidemiological Surveillance System; SINAVE) and related deaths (National e-Death Certificates Information System; SICO) systems, which were matched on sex, age, municipality of residence and date of death. After the linkage, morbidity reported in SINAVE and identified in SICO, through the application of Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indexes algorithms, were compared to evaluate agreement level. RESULTS: Overall, 2285 matched cases were analyzed, including 53.9% males with a median age of 84 years. According to the method of data reporting assessment, the presence of any morbidity ranged between 26.3% and 62.5%. The reporting of ten morbidities could be compared between the information reported in SINAVE and SICO databases. The proportion of simultaneous reporting in both databases ranged between 5.7% for diabetes and 0.0% for human immunodeficiency virus infection or coagulopathy. Minimal or no agreement was found when assessing the similarity of the morbidity reporting in both databases, with neoplasms showing the highest level of agreement (0.352, 95% IC: 0.277C0.428; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Different information about reported morbidity could be found in two HIS used to monitor COVID-19 cases and related deaths, as data are independently collected. These results show that the interoperability of SICO and SINAVE databases would potentially improve available HIS and improve available information to decision-making and address COVID-19 pandemic management.","output":"Improving morbidity information in Portugal: Evidence from data linkage of COVID-19 cases surveillance and mortality systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paraneoplastic autoimmune and inflammatory disorders are often associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The etiopathogenesis of MDS-associated autoimmune and inflammatory disorders is still unclear and treatment options are limited. Patients with MDS are at high risk of infections, which can be increased by the use of steroids. In the present study, we report on two patients with MDS-related autoimmune and inflammatory disorders who were in remission and reduced the steroid dose with 5-azacytidine treatment. The first case was a 67-year-old patient diagnosed with MDS and the whole-body erythroderma was the chief complaint. When the patient was treated with decitabine, steroid treatment was needed to control the erythroderma. When we changed decitabine to 5-azacytidine, both his erythroderma and his dependency on the steroid treatment were resolved. The second patient was a 68-year-old man with MDS who presented with Sweet's syndrome. Sweet's syndrome was completely treated after the first cycle of 5-azacytidine. In addition, Sweet's syndrome can occur as an adverse reaction of 5-azacitidine, so we illustrate that it is important to distinguish whether Sweet's syndrome is MDS-related skin disorders or 5-azacitidine-related skin side-effects.","output":"Response of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders in myelodysplastic syndromes to 5-azacytidine: report of two cases and literature review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to chemotherapy services were implemented as a means of managing imposed workload strains within health services and protecting patients from contracting COVID-19. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic many changes were rapidly adopted and were not substantiated by robust evidence. This study aimed to describe the changes adopted internationally to chemotherapy services, which may be used to guide future changes to treatment delivery. METHODS: A survey was developed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of systemic anti-cancer therapies (SACT). It comprised 22 questions and examined the strategies implemented during the pandemic to prioritise and protect patients receiving SACT and the participants' professional opinion of the strategies employed. The survey was available in English, Spanish and French and was distributed via professional bodies. RESULTS: 129 responses were obtained from healthcare professionals working across 17 different countries. 45% of institutions had to implement treatment prioritisation strategies and all hospitals implemented changes in the delivery of treatment, including: reduction in treatments (69%), using less immunosuppressive agents (50%), allowing treatment breaks (14%) and switching to oral therapies (45%). Virtual clinic visits were perceived by participants as the most effective strategy to protect patients. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has forced chemotherapy healthcare professionals to adopt new ways of working by reducing health interactions.

It provides a set of findings and recommendations in relation to certain key elements of the Funds lending framework that have important ramifications on SODR processes, namely debt sustainability assessments (DSAs), the exceptional access policy (EAP) for financing above normal access limits, and the criteria for lending to countries with payments arrears to private creditors (LIA) or official bilateral creditors (LIOA). It also considers other indirect channels through which the Fund can affect SODRs, including its support for enhancing the transparency and public disclosure of sovereign debt information, its collaboration with the Paris Club and the G20 debt-related initiatives, the promotion of contractual standards for sovereign debt, and the monitoring of relevant legislative developments.","output":"The Imf's Role in Sovereign Debt Restructurings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to 1) determine the validity of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) for use in the assessment of burnout in a sample of pharmacists using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and 2) use the CBI items and other measures of work-life to assess burnout in pharmacists employed in various types of practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to a sample of 2,582 pharmacists in a single Midwestern US state. The survey included the three subscales of the CBI, each of which measures personal, work-related, and patient-related dimensions of burnout. Other items included demographics, practice type, workload, and work-life balance. CFA was used to measure fit, and Cronbachs alpha was used to assess reliability. Correlation was used to assess criterion validity of the CBI. Logistic regression and bivariate analyses were used to assess pharmacist burnout based on demographics. RESULTS: Following the removal of 2 items from the measurement model, a 17-item 3-factor CBI was found to possess satisfactory psychometric properties for use in pharmacists. The CBI correlated with measures of work-life demonstrating criterion validity. A logistic regression showed that younger pharmacists and community pharmacists experience higher burnout than older pharmacists and clinical pharmacists. Community pharmacists also more often reported high workloads and poorer work-life integration. Both community and clinic pharmacists desired more time providing patient care services and less time dispensing.

This study aimed to develop and test a valid questionnaire on the knowledge of analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin, tramadol, codeine, oxycodone) during lactation, using a structured, stepwise approach. As a first step, literature was screened to generate a preliminary version consisting of a pool of item subgroups. This preliminary version was subsequently reviewed during two focus groups (midwives: n = 4; pediatric nurses: n = 6), followed by a two-round online Delphi with experts (n = 7) to confirm item and scale content validity. This resulted in an instrument consisting of 33 questions and 5 specific clinical case descriptions for both disciplines. Based on the assumption of an a priori difference in knowledge between midwives and pediatric nurses related to their curricula (known-groups validity), high construct validity was demonstrated in a pilot survey (midwives: n = 86; pediatric nurses: n = 73). We therefore conclude that a valid instrument to assess knowledge on lactation-related exposure to analgesics was generated, which could be further validated and used for research and educational purposes.

Antigen testing methods such as enzyme immunoassay, fluorescent antibody and visually-read immunochromatographic rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests eliminated the above mentioned disadvantages of the RT-PCR. The aim of this study was to determine the performance of a RAD test kit (V-Chek, SGA Ltd, Ankara, Turkey). Two paired nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each patient, and one of them was used for the RAD test, while the other one (different swab) was used to perform the RT-PCR test. SARS CoV-2 Double Gene RT-PCR kit (Bioeksen, Turkey) was used for RNA amplification on the Light Cycler 480 plate-based RT-PCR instrument (Roche, Switzerland). The SARS-CoV-2 double gene RT-PCR kit targeting the SARS-CoV-2 specific N (nucleocapsid) and Orf1ab gene regions was used for RNA amplification. The human RNaseP gene was used for nucleic acid extraction and inhibition control. The shape of the growth curves was examined and the non-sigmoidal curves were recorded as \\"negative\\". Sigmoidal curves with cycle threshold (Ct) <38 were evaluated as \\"positive\\". The Ct values of all positive results were recorded. V-Chek RAD test kit uses a colloidal gold enhanced double antibody sandwich type antigen test kit. A SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen produces a distinct color band in the test region, formed by the specific antibody-antigen colored conjugate complex. A positive or negative result is indicated by a colored line appearance on the test region. A colored line appears in the control region, independent of the SARS-CoV-2 presence. The result is visually read 10 minutes after the last drop of the sample liquid is dispensed into the sample well. Specificity and sensitivity values were calculated accepting the RT-PCR results as a standard. Agreement between two different techniques was assessed using Cohen's kappa score. 110 patients were enrolled in this study; 34 (30.9 %) of these patients had positive RT-PCR samples, with the mean of Ct values of 25.8 (95% CI= 24.1-27.5), median of Ct values of 26. In our study population, the overall sensitivity was 61.8% (95% CI= 45.4-78.1), and specificity was 100%. Taking RT-PCR as reference, Cohen's kappa score for the antigen test was 0.691.

METHODS: The numbers of elective and emergent/urgent shunt surgeries performed at a single institution were queried for a 28-d period starting on the third Monday of March, between years 2015 and 2020. These were further stratified by how they presented as well as the type of surgery performed.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a sandwich complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or neutralization activity.

The generation of autoantibodies has been proposed as a mechanism to explain these symptoms. To understand the prevalence of autoantibodies associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we investigated the frequency and specificity of clinically relevant autoantibodies in 84 individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, suffering from COVID-19 of varying severity in both the acute and convalescent setting. These were compared with results from 32 individuals who were on the intensive therapy unit (ITU) for non-COVID reasons. We demonstrate a higher frequency of autoantibodies in the COVID-19 ITU group compared with non-COVID-19 ITU disease control patients and that autoantibodies were also found in the serum 3-5 months post-COVID-19 infection. Non-COVID patients displayed a diverse pattern of autoantibodies; in contrast, the COVID-19 groups had a more restricted panel of autoantibodies including skin, skeletal muscle and cardiac antibodies. Our results demonstrate that respiratory viral infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the detection of a limited profile of tissue-specific autoantibodies, detectable using routine clinical immunology assays. Further studies are required to determine whether these autoantibodies are specific to SARS-CoV-2 or a phenomenon arising from severe viral infections and to determine the clinical significance of these autoantibodies.","output":"Establishing the prevalence of common tissue-specific autoantibodies following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tourism was a constantly growing industry until the halt brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. In cities, its negative impact was increasing, with significant cases of overcrowding. COVID-19 has emerged as an exceptional disruptive stage, yet it is also an opportunity to abandon the rush towards unsustainability. This study is a critical analysis of tourism, looking at the most appropriate post-pandemic perspective for urban cultural tourism, based on sustainability and leaving aside the search for profit as the ultimate goal. The main objective is to make proposals for an alternative paradigm. This is a theoretical paper that draws on a literature review of 180 works of scientific reference. Complementarily, information published by the media is accessed and direct observation is carried out as fieldwork. Proposals are made on limiting the number of visitors, improving guided visits, tourist routes, experiential tourism, and virtual tours. We also propose a new centralised tourism governance and regulation of private agents. Therefore, the present text is of interest for public representatives working in the field of urban tourism. ? 2021 Asociacion de Geografos Espanoles.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The prospectively collected data of patients who underwent thyroid surgery with intraoperative neuromonitoring for external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve exploration were assessed retrospectively. The surface endotracheal tube-based Medtronic NIM3 intraoperative neuromonitoring device was used. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve function was evaluated by the cricothyroid muscle twitch. In addition, contribution of external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve to the vocal cord adduction was evaluated using electromyographic records. RESULTS The study included data of 126 (female, 103; male, 23) patients undergoing thyroid surgery, with a mean age of 46.212.2 years (range, 18-75 years), and 215 neck sides were assessed. Two hundred and one (93.5%) of 215 external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified, of which 60 (27.9%) were identified visually before being stimulated with a monopolar stimulator probe. Eighty-nine (41.4%) external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified visually after being identified with a probe. Although 52 (24.1%) external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified with a probe, they were not visualized. Intraoperative neuromonitoring provided a significant contribution to visual (p<0.001) and functional (p<0.001) identification of external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves. Additionally, positive electromyographic responses were recorded from 160 external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves (74.4%). CONCLUSION Intraoperative neuromonitoring provides an important contribution to visual and functional identification of external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves. We believe that it can not be predicted whether the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is at risk or not and the nerve is often invisible; thus, intraoperative neuromonitoring may routinely be used in superior pole dissection. Glottic electromyography response obtained via external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve stimulation provides quantifiable information in addition to the simple visualization of the cricothyroid muscle twitch.","output":"Contribution of intraoperative neuromonitoring to the identification of the external branch of superior laryngeal nerve."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The study was conducted to determine the anxiety and sleep quality levels of emergency medical service personnel as well as factors affecting them during the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study included 247 medical professionals working in emergency medical services. Results: The mean age of the medical personnel was 32.627.36 years, of whom 54.3% were females, 49.8% were married, 89.9% were university graduates and 47.8% nurse. Of the medical staff, 21.9% had mild anxiety, 15.8% had moderate anxiety, and 33.2% had high anxiety. Pittsburgh sleep quality index scores of all participants were >5. A strong and positive relationship (p<0.001) was found between the anxiety level (19.2415.67) and sleep quality (14.393.13) of participants. The study revealed that healthcare personnel who worked 24 hour shifts, smoked and/or drank alcohol, had a psychological disorder, and lacked adequate protective equipment had high anxiety scores and poor sleep quality. Moreover, healthcare professionals who experienced problems with childcare, thought that working conditions affect their children negatively, and were afraid of COVID-19 transmission to themselves and their families had high anxiety scores and poor sleep quality. Conclusion: During the pandemic, monitoring the emergency medical personnels' health and work is important to determine their levels of anxiety and sleep quality and to provide necessary psychological support.

However, because this problem and its variants are NP-hard, practical multiassembly tools either use heuristics or solve simpler, polynomial-time solvable versions of the problem, which may yield solutions that are not mini-mal or do not perfectly decompose the flow. Many RNA assemblers also use integer linear programming(ILP) formulations of such practical variants, having the major limitation they need to encode all the potentially exponentially many solution paths. Moreover, the only exact solver for MFD does not scale to large instances and cannot be efficiently generalized to practical MFD variants. In this work, we provide the first practical ILP formulation for MFD (and thus the first fast and exact solver for MFD), based on encoding all of the exponentially many solution paths using only a quadratic number of variables. On both simulated and real flow graphs, our approach solves any instance in under 13 seconds. We also show that our ILP formulation can be easily and efficiently adapted for many practical variants, such as incorporating longer or paired-end reads or minimizing flow errors. We hope that our results can remove the current tradeoff between the complexity of a multi assembly model and its tractability and can lie at the core of future practical RNA assembly tools.","output":"Fast, Flexible, and Exact Minimum Flow Decompositions via ILP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective states govern by some combination of enforcement and voluntary compliance. To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical decision is the extent to which policy makers rely on voluntary as opposed to enforced compliance, and nations vary along this dimension. While enforcement may secure higher compliance, there is experimental and other evidence that it may also crowd out voluntary motivation. How does enforcement affect citizens' support for anti-COVID-19 policies? A survey conducted with 4,799 respondents toward the end of the first lockdown in Germany suggests that a substantial share of the population will support measures more under voluntary than under enforced implementation. Negative responses to enforcement-termed control aversion-vary across the nature of the policy intervention (e.g., they are rare for masks and frequent for vaccination and a cell-phone tracing app). Control aversion is less common among those with greater trust in the government and the information it provides, and among those who were brought up under the coercive regime of East Germany. Taking account of the likely effectiveness of enforcement and the extent to which near-universal compliance is crucial, the differing degrees of opposition to enforcement across policies suggest that for some anti-COVID-19 policies an enforced mandate would be unwise, while for others it would be essential. Similar reasoning may also be relevant for policies to address future pandemics and other societal challenges like climate change.","output":"Enforcement may crowd out voluntary support for COVID-19 policies, especially where trust in government is weak and in a liberal society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/SETTING: In San Francisco, HIV viral suppression is 71% among housed individuals, but only 20% among unhoused individuals. We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) at a San Francisco public HIV clinic to evaluate care preferences among people living with HIV (PLH) experiencing homelessness/unstable housing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From July-November 2020, we conducted a DCE among PLH experiencing homelessness/unstable housing who accessed care through a) an incentivized, drop-in program (\\"POP-UP\\") or b) traditional primary care. We investigated five program features: single provider vs team of providers; visit incentives ($0, $10, $20); location (current site vs current+additional site); drop-in vs scheduled visits; in-person only vs optional telehealth visits; and navigator assistance. We estimated relative preferences using mixed-effects logistic regression and conducted latent class analysis to evaluate preference heterogeneity. RESULTS: We enrolled 115 PLH experiencing homelessness/unstable housing, 40% of whom lived outdoors. The strongest preferences were for the same provider (?=0.94, 95%CI 0.48-1.41), visit incentives (?=0.56 per $5; 95%CI 0.47-0.66), and drop-in visits (?=0.47, 95%CI 0.12-0.82). Telehealth was not preferred. Latent class analysis revealed two distinct groups: 78 (68%) preferred a flexible care model; while 37 (32%) preferred a single provider. CONCLUSION: We identified heterogeneous care preferences among PLH experiencing homelessness/unstable housing during the COVID pandemic, with two-thirds preferring greater flexibility and one-third preferring provider continuity. Telehealth was not preferred, even with navigator facilitation. Including patient choice in service delivery design can improve care engagement, particularly for marginalized populations, and is an essential tool for ending the HIV epidemic.","output":"Heterogeneous preferences for care engagement among people with HIV experiencing homelessness or unstable housing during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By revisiting the air distribution and bioaerosol dispersion in Ward 8A where the largest nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak occurred in Hong Kong in 2003, we found an interesting phenomenon. Although all the cubicles were in 'positive pressure' towards the corridor, the virus-containing bioaerosols generated from the index patient's cubicle were still transmitted to other cubicles, which cannot be explained in a traditional manner. A multi-zone model combining the two-way airflow effect was used to analyse this phenomenon. The multi-zone airflow model was evaluated by our experimental data. Comparing with the previous computational fluid dynamic simulation results, we found that the air exchange owing to the small temperature differences between cubicles played a major role in SARS transmission. Additionally, the validated multi-zone model combining the two-way airflow effect could simulate the pollutant transport with reasonable accuracy but much less computational time. A probable improvement in general ward design was also proposed.","output":"Role of two-way airflow owing to temperature difference in severe acute respiratory syndrome transmission: revisiting the largest nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Hong Kong."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To compare online versus physical teaching in the period of Covid-19.

Individual interviews were conducted with 18 health care professionals using the video meeting platform in 2020. A semi-structured interview guide included: (a) behavior and lifestyle related to decision-making, (b) desired place to die, and (c) facilitators and barriers to autonomy in patients with severe COPD who live alone. Five main themes were identified: information sharing among team members, patient readiness, desired place of death, economic constraints, and care at the time of and after death. Partly due to the heterogeneity and complexity of clinical courses and treatment responses of COPD, a wide range of social issues of a person's life were related to practicality in the completion of ACP for older people with COPD living alone.

Readily available, alcohol is often one of the drugs of choice for adolescents. Whereas in the past 30 years, the overall consumption of alcohol is down, the data in the past 10 years have shown more girls are binge drinking and meeting criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD). The alarm of early alcohol use is the association with problems with the substances later in life. Historically, men and male adolescents consumed more alcohol than females. Recent studies indicate girls' alcohol use surpasses boys, whereas women now are developing AUD at the same rate as men. The consequences of early use can result in women's increased risk for multiple cancers, having a more severe form of AUD with less alcohol consumption as well as premature death. To further exacerbate this growing concern, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created a perfect storm for increased use of alcohol to cope with the stress of living in an uncertain world. Normal daily activities have been halted with the uncertainty of school closures, zoom classroom sessions, and living in mandated social isolation. All nurses need to be screening for how families under their care have been managing stress. The time is opportune to educate and support parents in engaging their children in conversations around substance use. Parents can be supported to increase awareness of their own coping mechanisms and strengthen positive coping. Adolescents need support to strengthen interpersonal skills as well as make informed decisions concerning when and how they engage in alcohol consumption.

However, from an economic and public policy perspective, we find that the CICP design has unintended consequences: locating CICP in the executive agency DHHS potentially creates a conflict of interest, and not permitting judicial review generates a lack of checks and balances, both of which could jeopardize justice. These fundamental problems would subsequently weaken four key performance indicators of CICP compared with its judicial counterpart in the Court of Federal Claims. CICP lacks accountability, transparency, and cost-effectiveness efficiency, with 94% of its total costs spent on administration rather than compensation. CICPs ability to compensate is also questionable. If COVID-19 claims were compensated at its historical rate, CICP would face around $21.16 million in compensation outlays and $317.94 million in total outlays, 72.1 times its current balance. To ensure just compensation for injured petitioners during COVID-19 and future public health emergencies, we recommend Congress (1) initiate a major reform by relocating CICP from DHHS to the Claims Court or (2) keep CICP within DHHS and make incremental changes by permitting judicial review of DHHS administrative adjudication of CICP claims. We further recommend Congress audit and adjust budgets for CICP and DHHS promptly propose an injury table for COVID-19 claims.

School and university closures are significantly disrupting the lives of students, educators and researchers alike. With the sudden shift to online learning platforms, the limitations on research projects and the lack of standardised policies and procedures, many concerns arise surrounding the unequal impacts of this crisis. This article brings together diverse perspectives on the effects of COVID-19 on post-secondary life for students and scholars engaged in the field of Indigenous health research. The authors reflect on how this time has impacted them as a graduating student, incoming PhD student, junior faculty member and mid-career faculty member respectively. Their experiences of teaching and learning at a large, research-intensive university in Toronto, Canada have been profoundly transformed, and will continue to change the way they work, research and interact at the graduate level. Working with Indigenous communities and organisations requires relationship building, collaboration and ceremony. In these unprecedented times, scholars cannot simply continue \\"business as usual\\". They must adapt everything, including how they teach, learn and work with Indigenous peoples, who are particularly vulnerable to this pandemic. Reflecting on the impacts that have already occurred and those that are still likely to come, the authors discuss what changes may need to be made in academia to support diverse actors within their scholarly community.
