As an emergency response, students from Philippine public schools were provided learning modules based on a minimized list of essential learning competencies in Biology. Using a cross-sectional survey method, we investigated students' perceptions of the Biology self-learning modules (BSLM) that were designed in print and digitized formats according to a constructivist learning approach. Senior high school STEM students from grades 11 (n = 117) and 12 (n = 104) participated in a survey using a 3-point Likert-scale questionnaire uploaded online through Google Forms. The survey results indicate that majority of the students perceived the modules positively, suggesting that aspects of the modules that were salient to students corresponded to essential elements of constructivist pedagogies. However, during interviews, students reported several difficulties in learning with BSLM as it was constrained by, to name a few, the use of unfamiliar words, lack of access to supporting resources, slow internet connection, and time constraints. To address these problems, teachers reported that they gave deadline extensions, complemented modules with other channels of support, and used online and offline platforms for reaching out to students to answer their queries and plan out their schedule for the week. The findings across the data sources point to the complex demands of emergency distance education that teachers, as curriculum designers and enactors, need to bear in mind in order to craft productive pedagogies, constructivist or otherwise, during this unprecedented time. ? 2021 The authors and IJLTER.ORG.

These include H1N1 cases with proven coinfections showing clinical association with bacterial contagions. PURPOSE: The objective was to identify H1N1 and copathogens in the Oaxaca (Mexico) population. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 2009 to 2012. A total of 88 study patients with confirmed H1N1 by quantitative RT-PCR were recruited. METHODS: Total nucleic acid from clinical samples of study patients was analyzed using a TessArray RPM-Flu microarray assay to identify other respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: High prevalence of copathogens (77.3%; 68 patients harbored one to three pathogens), predominantly from Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Pseudomonas, were detected. Three patients (3.4%) had four or five respiratory copathogens, whereas others (19.3%) had no copathogens. Copathogenic occurrence with Staphylococcus aureus was 5.7%, Coxsackie virus 2.3%, Moraxella catarrhalis 1.1%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1.1%, and parainfluenza virus 3 1.1%. The number of patients with copathogens was four times higher to those with H1N1 alone (80.68% and 19.32%, respectively). Four individuals (4.5%; two males, one female, and one infant) who died due to H1N1 were observed to have harbored such copathogens as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. CONCLUSION: In summary, copathogens were found in a significant number (>50%) of cases of influenza in Oaxaca.

The characteristics of disease propagation evolve with time, as a result of a multitude of environmental and anthropic factors, this non-stationarity is a key factor in this huge complexity. In the absence of appropriate external data sources, to correctly describe the disease propagation, we explore a flexible approach, based on stochastic models for the disease dynamics, and on diffusion processes for the parameter dynamics. Using such a diffusion process has the advantage of not requiring a specific mathematical function for the parameter dynamics. Coupled with particle MCMC, this approach allows us to reconstruct the time evolution of some key parameters (average transmission rate for instance). Thus, by capturing the time-varying nature of the different mechanisms involved in disease propagation, the epidemic can be described. Firstly we demonstrate the efficiency of this methodology on a toy model, where the parameters and the observation process are known. Applied then to real datasets, our methodology is able, based solely on simple stochastic models, to reconstruct complex epidemics, such as flu or dengue, over long time periods. Hence we demonstrate that time-varying parameters can improve the accuracy of model performances, and we suggest that our methodology can be used as a first step towards a better understanding of a complex epidemic, in situation where data is limited and/or uncertain.","output":"Accounting for non-stationarity in epidemiology by embedding time-varying parameters in stochastic models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have shown previously that transplanted bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC), which are a cell fraction rich in hematopoietic stem cells, can activate cerebral endothelial cells via gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction.

In contrast to BM-MNC, for MSC we observed suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor uptake into endothelial cells and transfer of glucose from endothelial cells to MSC in vitro. The transfer of such a small molecule from MSC to vascular endothelium was subsequently confirmed in vivo and was followed by suppressed activation of macrophage/microglia in stroke mice. The suppressive effect was absent by blockade of gap junction at MSC. Furthermore, gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction was observed between circulating white blood cells and MSC. Our findings indicate that gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction is one of the major pathways for MSC-mediated suppression of inflammation in the brain following stroke and provides a novel strategy to maintain the blood-brain barrier in injured brain. Furthermore, our current results have the potential to provide a novel insight for other ongoing clinical trials that make use of MSC transplantation aiming to suppress excess inflammation, as well as other diseases such as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).","output":"Gap Junction-Mediated Cell-Cell Interaction Between Transplanted Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Vascular Endothelium in Stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: New coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic socioeconomically affected the world. In this study, we measured the perceived stress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic among Iranians to determine the groups at both extremes of the spectrum followed by identifying the stressors and coping mechanisms. METHODS: This study was a mixed-methods study. We distributed a web-based 10-item perceived stress scale (PSS-10), to measure perceived stress score (PSS), through social networks from March 12 to 23, 2020. Then, we interviewed 42 students, 31 homemakers, 27 healthcare providers, and 21 male participants to identify the sources of stress and coping mechanisms. RESULTS: Finally, 13,454 participants completed the questionnaires. The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the participants' PSS was 21 (15-25). Students, homemakers, and healthcare workers (HCWs) showed a higher median (IQR) of PSS compared to other groups (23 [18 to 27], 22 [16 to 26], and 19 [14 to 24], respectively). Male participants showed a lower median (IQR) PSS (17 [12 to 23]). Content analysis of 121 participants' answers showed that the most common stressors were school-related issues mentioned by students, family-related issues mentioned by homemakers, and COVID-19-related issues mentioned by healthcare providers. Male participants' coping mechanisms were mostly related to the perception of their abilities to cope with the current crisis. CONCLUSION: Our participants clinically showed a moderate level of PSS.

The prevention of T2D has become imperative to stem the rising rates of this disease. Weight loss is highly effective in preventing T2D; however, the at-risk pool is large, and a clinically meaningful metric for risk stratification to guide interventions remains a challenge. The objective of this study is to predict T2D risk using full-information continuous analysis of nationally sampled data from white and black American adults age 45 years. METHODS AND FINDINGS A sample of 12,043 black (33%) and white individuals from a population-based cohort, REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) (enrolled 2003-2007), was observed through 2013-2016. The mean participant age was 63.12  8.62 years, and 43.7% were male. Mean BMI was 28.55  5.61 kg/m2. Risk factors for T2D regularly recorded in the primary care setting were used to evaluate future T2D risk using Bayesian logistic regression. External validation was performed using 9,710 participants (19% black) from Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) (enrolled 1987-1989), observed through 1996-1998. The mean participant age in this cohort was 53.86  5.65 years, and 44.6% were male. Mean BMI was 27.15  4.92 kg/m2. Predictive performance was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) statistics. The primary outcome was incident T2D. By 2016 in REGARDS, there were 1,602 incident cases of T2D. Risk factors used to predict T2D progression included age, sex, race, BMI, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, blood pressure, and blood glucose. The Bayesian logistic model (AUC = 0.79) outperformed the Framingham risk score (AUC = 0.76), the American Diabetes Association risk score (AUC = 0.64), and a cardiometabolic disease system (using Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) (AUC = 0.75). Validation in ARIC was robust (AUC = 0.85). Main limitations include the limited generalizability of the REGARDS sample to black and white, older Americans, and no time to diagnosis for T2D. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that a Bayesian logistic model using full-information continuous predictors has high predictive discrimination, and can be used to quantify race- and sex-specific T2D risk, providing a new, powerful predictive tool. This tool can be used for T2D prevention efforts including weight loss therapy by allowing clinicians to target high-risk individuals in a manner that could be used to optimize outcomes.","output":"Development and validation of a model for predicting incident type 2 diabetes using quantitative clinical data and a Bayesian logistic model: A nationwide cohort and modeling study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This observational study aims to assess the outcome and safety of O2-therapy by high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in 28 consecutive patients with severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (hARF) consequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection, unresponsive to conventional O2-therapy.

Methods: Studies were identified through systematic searches of PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane library, ongoing clinical trial registries (clinicaltrials.gov), and preprint servers (medRxiv, ChinaXiv) on August 10, 2020, as well as eligibility checks according to predefined selection criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (version 5.3) and STATA 12.0. Results: Thirty-one studies were included in the pooled analysis of mortality, and 12 studies were identified for the analysis of risk of secondary infections. For mortality analysis, 5630 COVID-19 cases including 2,132 treated patients and 3,498 controls were analyzed. Anti-IL-6 signaling agents plus standard of care (SOC) significantly decreased the mortality rate compared to SOC alone (pooled OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45C0.84, p = 0.002). For the analysis of secondary infection risk, 1,624 patients with COVID-19 including 639 treated patients and 985 controls were included, showing that anti-IL-6 signaling agents did not increase the rate of secondary infections (pooled OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.70C2.08, p = 0.50). By contrast, for patients with critical COVID-19 disease, anti-IL-6 signaling agents failed to reduce mortality compared to SOC alone (pooled OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.42C1.33, p = 0.33), but they tended to increase the risk of secondary infections (pooled OR = 1.85, 95% CI 0.95C3.61, p = 0.07). A blockade of IL-6 signaling failed to reduce the mechanical ventilation rate, ICU admission rate, or elevate the clinical improvement rate. Conclusion: IL-6 signaling inhibitors reduced the mortality rate without increasing secondary infections in patients with COVID-19 based on current studies.

PARTICIPANTS: Persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not receive subsequent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were compared with persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection who received a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least 3 months after infection. INTERVENTION: Forty-one randomized controlled trials were emulated, in which 107 413 Maccabi Healthcare Services' members aged 16 years and older were eligible for at least 1 trial. MEASUREMENTS: SARS-CoV-2Crelated outcomes of infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalization, and death, between 2 March and 13 December 2021. RESULTS: A statistically significant decreased risk (hazard ratio, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.20]) for reinfection was found among persons who were previously infected and then vaccinated versus those who were previously infected but remained unvaccinated. In addition, there was a decreased risk for symptomatic disease (hazard ratio, 0.24 [CI, 0.20 to 0.29]) among previously infected and vaccinated persons compared with those who were not vaccinated after infection. No COVID-19Crelated mortality cases were found. LIMITATION: Hybrid protection against non-Delta variants could not be inferred. CONCLUSION: Persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 gained additional protection against reinfection and COVID-19 from a subsequent single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Nonetheless, even without a subsequent vaccination, reinfection appeared relatively rare.

However, there is no comprehensive summary on the occurrence and distribution of these infections in Algeria. This systematic review provides a comprehensive summary on the prevalence of different abortive diseases and assesses potential risk factors in small ruminants in Algeria. Five databases were used to search epidemiological data on the prevalence of different abortive diseases (bacterial, parasitic, and viral). Data were collected from 25 papers published between 2003 and 2020. The total mean sample size was 53,080 small ruminants. The majority of the diseases/infections were diagnosed by serological and molecular tests. The overall prevalence of brucellosis was 0.39% in sheep and 5.31% in goats. Chlamydia and Q fever were observed in 32.72% and 20.62% of small ruminants, respectively. The prevalence of peste des petits ruminants was 15.76% and the overall prevalence of bluetongue in sheep and goats was, respectively, 13.41% and 44.50%. Border disease and bovine viral diarrhea were detected in 22.68% and 1.01% of sheep examined, respectively. Toxoplasma gondii infection prevalence among sheep and goats was 21.43% and 32.31% respectively. This study is a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of abortion diseases in small ruminants in Algeria and will therefore be a useful tool for researchers.

However, both techniques have difficulties to identify viruses in clinical samples because of the host genomic nucleic acid content (hg/cont). Both propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium bromide monoazide (EMA) have the capacity to bind free DNA/RNA, but are cell membrane-impermeable. Thus, both are unable to bind protected nucleic acid such as viral genomes within intact virions. However, EMA/PMA modified genetic material cannot be amplified by enzymes. In order to assess the potential of EMA/PMA to lower the presence of amplifiable hg/cont in samples and improve virus detection, serum and lung tissue homogenates were spiked with porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) and were processed with EMA/PMA. In addition, PRRSV RT-qPCR positive clinical samples were also tested. EMA/PMA treatments significantly decreased amplifiable hg/cont and significantly increased the number of PVDA positive probes and their signal intensity compared to untreated spiked lung samples. EMA/PMA treatments also increased the sensitivity of HTS by increasing the number of specific PRRSV reads and the PRRSV percentage of coverage. Interestingly, EMA/PMA treatments significantly increased the sensitivity of PVDA and HTS in two out of three clinical tissue samples. Thus, EMA/PMA treatments offer a new approach to lower the amplifiable hg/cont in clinical samples and increase the success of PVDA and HTS to identify viruses.","output":"Propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium bromide monoazide (EMA) improve DNA array and high-throughput sequencing of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus identification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context/Objectives: It is paramount that clinicians assess and document patients' priorities to guide goal-concordant interventions, especially during a public health crisis.

Methods: We examined electronic medical records (EMRs) to discern goals-of-care (GOC) conversations with COVID-19 patients seen at some point by palliative care during their hospitalization, and all clinicians' use of a structured note template during the peak incidence of COVID-19 from March to May 2020. Patients were grouped based on comorbidities and preadmission living situation. GOC discussions were categorized into three types: code status decisions, other treatment decisions, and no treatment decisions. Results: Nearly all (97%) patients had GOC documentation within 48 hours of admission. Forty-four percent of first GOC conversations incorporated the template. Patients with dementia living in nursing facilities had GOC documentation within hours of hospital admission, whereas healthier patients had their first GOC conversation at one week of hospitalization. Decisions about code status predominated in the first (83%) and second (49%) discussions, followed by a focus on other treatment decisions in subsequent discussions (44%-57%). Many did not require a treatment decision (19%-27%) but focused on quality-of-life definitions. Nearly all survivors were discharged to a facility and only four patients returned home.

Evidence has shown increased mortality rates associated with COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 negative patients in a pandemic environment. In addition, the impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in COVID-19 hip fracture patients has yet to be determined. METHODS: This multicentre observational study included 1,633 patients who sustained a hip fracture across nine hospital trusts in North West England. Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if Vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality. RESULTS: The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In 2020 there was a significant increase in 30-day mortality rates of patients who were COVID-19 positive but not of patients who were COVID-19 negative.

The organization of dialysis units to treat chronic HD patients with COVID-19 is demanding to prevent virus transmission both in COVID-free patients and the staff. These constraints may have an impact on the dialysis delivery to COVID-free HD patients. We report our experience in French NephroCare (NC) centers. METHODS: We report retrospectively dialysis and nutritional indicators among COVID-free prevalent chronic HD patients' cohort treated in French NC units from February 2020 to April 2020. The COVID-free HD patients were split into 2 subgroups for the analysis, Paris region and other regions because the incidence of COVID-19 was different according to the French regions. RESULTS: The Paris region was the most impacted by COVID-19 with 73% of all the contaminations that occurred in French NC units (n = 118). The dialysis frequency was not reduced all over the NC regions. 2,110 COVID-free HD patients were split into 2 subgroups including Paris region (748 patients) and other regions (1,362 patients). The weekly treatment time decreased significantly in Paris region from February to April (723C696 min [p < 0.00001]) but remained stable in the other regions. The processed blood volume, KT/V, and convective volume declined significantly in the Paris region subgroup but not in other regions. The 3-month weight loss significantly increased in the whole group of patients whatever the region from 0.0 to 0.2% between February 2020 and April 2020 (p < 0.00001). Ultrafiltration rate (UFR) and the normalized proteic catabolic rate remained stable all along the period. The stepwise regression analysis identified February serum albumin level and April UFR as negatively associated with 3-month weight loss. CONCLUSION: HD delivery to COVID-free HD patients was negatively impacted in the Paris region because of the strong constraints on units' organization related to the treatment of COVID-19+ HD patients and with a higher proportion of limited care/self-care units with less staff resources. The 3-month weight loss increase may be related to the suppression of intradialytic snack that impacted mostly the more malnourished patients or patients with lower interdialytic weight gain. These consequences of the COVID-19 crisis on COVID-free HD patients must be recognized and corrected to prevent further deleterious effects on patients' outcomes.","output":"Impact of First Wave COVID-19 Crisis on Dialysis Parameters of COVID-Free Hemodialysis Patients: A NephoCare France Longitudinal Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the WHO European Region, COVID-19 surveillance was implemented 27 January 2020.

Ventilators evaluated: Covidien PB 840, Maquet Servo-i, and Dr?ger Evita XL, PC breaths at preset inspiratory time (TI) 0.6-1.4s. VT error was defined as ventilator displayed VT minus the simulator displayed VT (mL/kg or % of true). RESULTS Relaxation of inspiratory effort caused flow reversal (exhalation) during TI, which led to VT error. For the PB 840, VT error was proportional to TI (maximum -2.0mL/kg, -19%). For the Servo-i, VT error was not related to TI (maximum error -0.2mL/kg or -1.2%). Volume error for Evita XL was not related to TI (maximum error was -0.7mL/kg or -6%). CONCLUSIONS Calculation of VT as the integral of flow over the preset inspiratory time rather than the period between zero crossings of flow may result in underestimation of both inhaled and exhaled volumes.

One of the main failures in PAH remediation in soil using plant species was the negative impact on germination and seedling growth. The objective of this study was to evaluate grass seed germination and seedling growth affected by drill cuttings to determine the resistance of selected grass species to the impact of PAH and their suitability for an effective phytoremediation of soils contaminated with waste that contain compounds from this group. In the study four grass species: tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), red fescue (Festuca rubra), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and common meadow-grass (Poa pratensis). The germination energy of all species decreased as the amount of drill cuttings increased. Among the species studied, the highest germination energy and capacity were found in Lolium perenne (54.1 and 73.2 respectively), and the lowest - in Poa pratensis (16.7 and 23.3 respectively). With an increasing amount of drill cuttings, the root and seedling height were decreased. Festuca arundinacea seedlings were distinctly the highest and had the longest roots (96.7 and 52.7, respectively), while Poa pratensis seedlings showed the significantly slowest seedling and root elongation rate (30.4 and 12.4, respectively). However, the strongest decrease in seedling height and root length compared to the control was observed in Festuca rubra. Based on IC50, the greatest tolerance to the addition of drilling waste to the substrate was found for Festuca arundinacea and Festuca rubra. The conducted investigation indicates that Festuca arundinacea and Lolium perenne are grass species that are least sensitive to drilling waste in the substrate because no significant differences were found in root length and seedling height between the control soil and the soil where a PAH dose of 5% and 10% was applied.","output":"Effect of soil contamination with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from drilling waste on germination and growth of lawn grasses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is well evidenced. However, there is little research on how individuals' coping strategies were related to changes in mental health over time. METHODS: The current study used data from the COVID-19 Social Study in the United Kingdom (N = 26,505) to explore whether coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-focused, avoidant, and socially-supportive) were associated with (i) better mental health as lockdown was introduced, and (ii) faster recovery over time. RESULTS: People with greater use of problem-focused, avoidant, and supportive coping displayed more mental health symptoms, while greater use of emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer mental health symptoms. Symptoms decreased over time for all coping strategies, but only socially-supportive coping was associated with a faster decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating a potential protective effect of social support on psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Problem-, avoidant- and emotion-focused coping strategies were not associated with faster improvements in mental health. Suggesting the adoption of one of these coping styles in itself is not necessarily a driver of improvements in mental health; rather, specific attributes of the behaviours expressed as part of this coping style appear to be important in and of themselves.","output":"Coping strategies and mental health trajectories during the first 21 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 is rapidly expanding across the world.

Several studies have shown the efficacy of masks at curbing droplet dispersion in lab settings. Using individual response data from the Imperial College London-YouGov personal measures survey, this study investigates reported mask use and its association with the spread of COVID-19. Methods We examine the association of reported mask-wearing in a population within a country with the growth rate of active cases COVID-19 cases. The analysis uses country-wide data from weekly surveys of individuals mask-wearing behavior in public places, as well as other concurrently implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions, mobility changes, new cases of COVID-19 data and other control variables. The mask-wearing data were obtained from the Imperial College-YouGov multi-country survey of peoples personal habits before and during COVID-19. Because mask-wearing showed substantial variation across countries and over time, we use a reduced form econometric model to relate population-wide changes in mask-wearing to the growth rate in COVID-19. Results The results indicate that reported mask-wearing could play an important role in mitigating the growth of COVID-19. Widespread mask-wearing within a country associates with an expected 7% (95% CI: 3.94%-9.99%) decline in the growth rate of daily active cases of COVID-19 in the country. This daily decline equates to an expected 88.5% drop in the growth of daily active cases over a 30-day period when compared to zero percent mask-wearing, all else held equal. The decline in daily growth rate due to the combined effect of reported mask-wearing, reduced social mobility, and non-pharmaceutical interventions averages 28.1% (95% CI: 24.2%-32%). These estimates remain robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Face mask usage as a preventative measure against the transmission of COVID-19 varies widely across countries. This observational study uses data from 24 countries and finds that reported face mask usage associates with a decline in new COVID-19 cases. Even though the model controls for a large variety of variables that affect spread, and we run a number of robustness checks, it remains possible that some of the decline associated with face masks is related to confounding variables not included in the model. In summary, due to the confounding variables and the variations in the type of mask and its usage, randomized control trials of mask usage in populations are needed to determine the true effect of mask wearing on mitigating the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases.","output":"Mask-Wearing During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early reports and case series suggest cognitive deficits occurs in some patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the frequency, severity, and profile of cognitive dysfunction in patients recovering from prolonged COVID-19 hospitalization who required acute inpatient rehabilitation prior to discharge. We analyzed cross-sectional scores from the Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET) in a cohort of N = 57 COVID-19 patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation, calculating the frequency of impairment based on neuropsychologist diagnosis and by age-normed BMET subtests. In total, 43 patients (75%) were male, 35 (61%) were non-white, and mean age was 64.5 (SD = 13.9) years. In total, 48 (84%) were previously living at home independently. Two patients had documented preexisting cognitive dysfunction; none had known dementia. Patients were evaluated at a mean of 43.2 (SD = 19.2) days after initial admission. In total, 50 patients (88%) had documented hypoxemic respiratory failure and 44 (77%) required intubation. Forty-six patients (81%) had cognitive impairment, ranging from mild to severe. Deficits were common in working memory (26/47 [55%] of patients), set-shifting (21/44 [47%]), divided attention (18/39 [46%]), and processing speed (14/35 [40%]). Executive dysfunction was not significantly associated with intubation length or the time from extubation to assessment, psychiatric diagnosis, or preexisting cardiovascular/metabolic disease.

The disease has created a system wide worsening shortage of N95, medical masks, and other personal protective equipment (PPE) that is regularly used by healthcare personnel and emergency service providers for their protection. Considering the number of infected patients and the stressed supplies of PPE reuse of PPE can serve as an efficient contingency plan. Multiple studies have investigated the effect of different decontamination methods. We chose the most user-friendly, easily scalable viral decontamination methods, including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and heat treatment. In this paper, we investigated a unique approach to reuse the mask by creating a hybrid model that efficiently sanitizes the infected mask. The advantages of the proposed hybrid model as compared to the respective single arms is its decontamination efficacy, operational speed, as well as the number of reuse cycles as verified by mathematical analysis and simulation. This model is mainly intended for medical PPE but can also be used for other domestic and personal sanitization during the COVID-19 pandemic. As per the situation, the hybrid system can be used as standalone systems also. This sanitization process is not only limited to the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 but can be extended to any other infectious agents. Thus, our results indicate that the proposed hybrid system is more effective, meets disinfection criterion and time saving for the reuse of respirators and PPE.","output":"A Hybrid Model integrating warm heat and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation might efficiently disinfect respirators and personal protective equipment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Wuhan has been reported. However, the clinical characteristics of patients who died of COVID-19 in regions with relatively scarce healthcare resources remain unknown. METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 14 patients who were admitted from January 18 to February 11, 2020 and died of COVID-19 were evaluated. The epidemiological, symptomatic, laboratory, radiological and treatment records were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the 14 patients was 56.7 (SD 15.3) years, and 8 (57.1%) were older than 50 years. Eight (57.1%) were men, and 11 (78.6%) had one or more high risk factors. The most common chronic diseases among these patients were cardiovascular disease (7, 50.0%), hypertension (6, 42.9%), and chronic kidney disease (5, 35.7%). General symptoms included cough (12, 85.7%), fever (11, 78.6%), and dyspnea (10, 71.4%). The median duration from the onset of symptoms to death was 11 (IQR 6.5-19.5) days, and the median duration from admission to death was 4.5 (1.0-11.8) days. Patients who died within 4.5 days had more severe pulmonary lesions, significantly reduced lymphocytes and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems provide a means of objectively capturing and quantifying deterioration under operational conditions. Computer vision technology has gained considerable attention in the field of SHM due to its ability to obtain displacement data using non-contact methods at long distances. Additionally, it provides a low cost, rapid instrumentation solution with low interference to the normal operation of structures. However, even in the case of a medium span bridge, the need for many cameras to capture the global response can be cost-prohibitive. This research proposes a roving camera technique to capture a complete derivation of the response of a laboratory model bridge under live loading, in order to identify bridge damage. Displacement is identified as a suitable damage indicator, and two methods are used to assess the magnitude of the change in global displacement under changing boundary conditions in the laboratory bridge model. From this study, it is established that either approach could detect damage in the simulation model, providing an SHM solution that negates the requirement for complex sensor installations.","output":"Bridge Damage Detection Approach Using a Roving Camera Technique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obtaining informed consent from vulnerable patients participating in clinical trials of investigational therapies for COVID-19 is a major ethical challenge.

All experiments were based on crown preparation of an artificial maxillary central incisor using a high-speed air turbine over a ten-minute period. Fluorescein dye was introduced into the irrigation system of the handpiece (model 1) and the mannequin's mouth was used to simulate salivary flow (model 2) under varying experimental conditions (suction flow rate, cross ventilation and exposure time). Six experiments were conducted in the open plan clinic while three experiments were undertaken in the clinical laboratory. Customised rigs with collection platforms consisting of filter papers were placed in open plan bays and adjacent walkways. Samples were also collected from a 400 cm2 area in each of the eight adjacent bays. Time course experiments repeated the same procedures on three occasions in a clinical laboratory and utilised a rig with eight four-metre rods supporting collection platforms around a dental mannequin. The distribution of fluorescein dye was analysed by fluoroscopy and spectrofluorometry.Results Contamination levels showed variations under different experimental conditions. In the absence of suction and cross ventilation, contamination was observed at large distances. Use of suction reduced contamination in the operating bay by 53% and 81.83%, while cross ventilation reduced contamination in adjacent and distant areas by 80-89%. Minimal contamination was detected at a distance of >5 m from the operating bay, with the use of medium-volume suction demonstrating that 1.5-metre-high partitions with open fronts limit 99.99% of splatter from aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) to the operating bay. Minimal additional aerosol contamination was detected ten minutes after the procedure.Conclusions Contamination from dental AGPS has the potential to contaminate distant sites in open plan clinics. Risk of cross infection is small if the bays are >5 m apart and contamination can be minimised with the use of suction and cross ventilation.","output":"COVID-19: dental aerosol contamination in open plan dental clinics and future implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As paediatric cancer survivors are living into adulthood, they suffer from the age-related, accelerated decline of functional skeletal muscle tissue, termed sarcopenia. With ionizing radiation (radiotherapy) at the core of paediatric cancer therapies, its direct and indirect effects can have lifelong negative impacts on paediatric growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle. Utilizing our recently developed preclinical rhabdomyosarcoma mouse model, we investigated the late effects of paediatric radiation treatment on skeletal muscles from late adolescent (8 weeks old) and middle-aged (16 months old) mice. METHODS: Paediatric C57BL/6J male mice (3 weeks old) were injected with rhabdomyosarcoma cells into their right hindlimbs, and then fractionated irradiation (3  8.2 Gy) was administered to those limbs at 4 weeks old to eliminate the tumours. Radiation-alone and tumour-irradiated mice were assessed at either 8 weeks (3 weeks post-irradiation) or 16 months (14 months post-irradiation) of age for muscle physiology, myofibre characteristics, cell loss, histopathology, fibrosis, inflammatory gene expression, and fibrotic gene expression. RESULTS: Mice that received only paediatric radiation demonstrated reduced muscle mass (-17%, P < 0.001), muscle physiological function (-25%, P < 0.01), muscle contractile kinetics (-25%, P < 0.05), satellite cell number (-45%, P < 0.05), myofibre cross-sectional area (-30%, P < 0.0001), and myonuclear number (-17%, P < 0.001). Paediatric radiation increased inflammatory gene expression, increased fibrotic gene expression, and induced extracellular matrix protein deposition (fibrosis) with tumour elimination exacerbating some phenotypes. Paediatric tumour-eliminated mice demonstrated exacerbated deficits to function (-20%, P < 0.05) and myofibre size (-17%, P < 0.001) in some muscles as well as further increases to inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression. Examining the age-related effects of paediatric radiotherapy in middle-aged mice, we found persistent myofibre atrophy (-20%, P < 0.01), myonuclear loss (-18%, P < 0.001), up-regulated inflammatory and fibrotic signalling, and lifelong fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this paediatric radiotherapy model are consistent and recapitulate the clinical and molecular features of accelerated sarcopenia, musculoskeletal frailty, and radiation-induced fibrosis experienced by paediatric cancer survivors. We believe that this preclinical mouse model is well poised for future mechanistic insights and therapeutic interventions that improve the quality of life for paediatric cancer survivors.","output":"Muscle-specific functional deficits and lifelong fibrosis in response to paediatric radiotherapy and tumour elimination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cultivated cardoon (Cynara cardunculus var. altilis L.) is a promising candidate species for the development of plant cell cultures suitable for large-scale biomass production and recovery of nutraceuticals.

A growing body of evidence supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in several chronic neuropathic pain conditions; however, its role and efficacy remain unclear. Purpose To summarize current evidence for the mechanistic rationale of HBOT in chronic neuropathic pain conditions and to evaluate its clinical efficacy. Methods This narrative review was conducted after searching the following databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, PsycINFO, the Web of Science, Scopus, ClinicalTrials. gov, WHO ICTRP, and ProQuest Digital Dissertation) from January 1946 to March 2020. Articles published in English that involved either animal or human studies with acute or chronic neuropathic pain evaluating any HBOT-related intervention were included. Results A total of 2971 citations were identified. A total of 29 studies were included in this review. The mechanisms of action for HBOT use in neuropathic conditions included the primary effects of hyperoxia and edema resolution, as well as the secondary effects pertinent to the production of oxygen and nitrogen reactive species (serving as pain signaling molecules), nitric oxide-dependent release of opioid peptides, and reduction of inflammatory mediators. A robust evidence for HBOT use in the clinical setting was associated with chronic regional pain syndrome and chronic primary bladder pain syndrome. Some evidence supported its use for chronic secondary (peripheral) neuropathic pain including radiation-induced plexus neuropathies, postherpetic neuralgia, and trigeminal neuralgia. Conclusions HBOT has been shown to have antinociceptive and analgesic effects in animal models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and chronic pain. Human studies demonstrated beneficial effects of HBOT in improving clinical outcomes such as pain scores, pain-related symptoms, and quality of life.

METHODS: The study population consisted of 181 SARSCoV-2 seronegative healthcare workers (median age 42 years, 59.7% women), receiving two doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty). Serum samples were collected before receiving the first vaccine dose, 21 days (before the second vaccine dose) and 50 days afterwards. We then measured anti-spike trimeric IgG (Liaison XL, DiaSorin), anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG (Access 2, Beckman Coulter) and anti-spike S1 subunit IgA (ELISA, Euroimmun). Results were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). RESULTS: Vaccine administration elicited all anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies measured. Thirty days after the second vaccine dose, 100% positivization occurred for anti-spike trimeric IgG and anti-spike RBD IgG, whilst 1.7% subjects remained anti-spike S1 IgA negative. The overall increase of antibodies level ratio over baseline after the second vaccine dose was 576.1 (IQR, 360.7-867.8) for anti-spike trimeric IgG, 1426.0 (IQR, 742.0-2698.6) for anti-spike RBD IgG, and 20.2 (IQR, 12.5-32.1) for anti-spike S1 IgA.

We tested whether a math training (XtraMath?) versus an active control condition (Cogmed?; working memory) improved school performance. Training feasibility was also evaluated. METHODS: Preterm born first graders, N = 65 (28C35 + 6 weeks gestation) were recruited into a prospective randomized controlled multicenter trial and received one of two computerized trainings at home for 5 weeks. Teachers rated academic performance in math, reading/writing, and attention compared to classmates before (baseline), directly after (post), and 12 months after the intervention (follow-up). Total academic performance growth was calculated as change from baseline (hierarchically orderedpost test first, follow-up second). RESULTS: Bootstrapped linear regressions showed that academic growth to post test was significantly higher in the math intervention group (B = 0.25 [95% confidence interval: 0.04C0.50], p = 0.039), but this difference was not sustained at the 12-month follow-up (B = 0.00 [?0.31 to 0.34], p = 0.996).

Due to the current demographic distribution in Bangladesh, young adults comprise almost one-third of the total population of the country. Therefore, their precautionary behavior is very important to ensure the success of preventive policies. This exploratory study examined the differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors among young adults, and estimated and compared the predictors of precautionary behavior adoption among young adults living in the capital city Dhaka and a nearby district, Tangail. Subject and methods: A total of 350 respondents from each district participated in the study. ANOVA and two-sample t-tests were utilized to detect differences in precautionary behavior across demographic groups of young adults, and quantile regression modeling was used to find the predictors of adopting precautionary behaviors and to compare these predictors between the two districts. Results: Individuals who had a postgraduate education and had good mental health tended to show better precautionary behaviors in Dhaka. Female respondents from Tangail who had no psychological distress took precautionary behaviors more often than their male counterparts. However, no significant differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among young adults were found between the two districts. Better self-control ability, higher education and good mental health emerged as factors that significantly shaped the precautionary behaviors of young adults in this study. Conclusion: Having better knowledge did not ensure better adoption of precautionary behaviors among the participants. In effect, the government's strong intervention to keep people maintaining social distance and a strict lockdown in severely affected areas are probable immediate solutions.","output":"COVID-19 in Bangladesh: measuring differences in individual precautionary behaviors among young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than 200 viruses have been detected in bats. Some unique bat characteristics can explain the roles played in the maintenance and transmission of viruses: long phylogenetic history can have originated coevolution processes, great number of species are adapted to live in different environments, big mobility, long lifespan and gregarious behaviour of many species. To analyse zoonoses long longitudinal studies are needed with a multidisciplinary approximation to obtain the following eco-epidemiological data: colony size, number of bats per species, population structure, behaviour of each species, degree of contact between bats, social structure, remaining time of bats in the colony, colony type, foraging area, turnover rate of individuals, shelter temperature, relationship with other colonies and co-infection processes. These data allows assessing the epidemiological risk and which preventive measures are necessary to take. The structure and functionality of ecosystems are changing worldwide at an unprecedented rate and can modify the interactions between humans and infected bats. There are more or less local factors that can affect the emergence and spread of diseases (environmental alterations, changes in land use, human population growth, changes in human socioeconomic behavior or social structure, people mobility increase, trade increase, forest fires, extreme weather events, wars, breakdown in public health infrastructure, etc.). Twenty-three percent of all bat species in the world are decreasing. How does the regression of bat species affect the dynamic of viruses?

Aims: To further elucidate the possible role of vitamin D population status in the COVID-19 pandemic, we examined the associations between published representative and standardized population vitamin D data on European population vitamin D status and the Worldometer COVID-19 data. Methods: Data from the Worldometer on 26 European countries populated &amp;gt;4 million (M) were analyzed. Results: On 19-June-2020, linear regression found no correlation between published representative-standardized population vitamin-D concentrations and the total cases-recovered/M, but negative correlations predicting a reduction of 47-64-80% in serious-critical illnesses/M and of 61-82-102.4% in deaths/M, further enhanced when adapting for life expectancy by 133-177-221% if 25(OH)D concentrations reach 100-125-150 nmol/L. On 15-August-2020 these correlations were sustained indicating a truthful association, yet not proving causality. Weighted ANOVA was performed to evaluate serious-critical/M (R2=0.22) by the vitamin-D population status (deficient-D &amp;lt;50, insufficient-IN 50C62.5, mildly insufficient-MIN &amp;gt;62.5C75 and sufficient-S &amp;gt;75 nmol/L) and ANCOVA the deaths/M (R2=0.629) after controlling for life expectancy (R2=0.47). Serious-critical showed a decreasing trend (p&amp;lt;0.001) from population status D (p&amp;lt;0.001) to IN: 9.2%, p&amp;lt;0.001, MIN: 47.6%, p&amp;lt;0.044 and S: 100% (reference). For deaths/M the respective decreasing trend (p&amp;lt;0.001) was 62.9% from D (p&amp;lt;0.001) to IN (p&amp;lt;0.001), 65.15% to MIN (p&amp;lt;0.001) and 78.8% to S (p=0.041). Conclusions: Following the Endocrine Societys expert committee recommendations, without previous testing being necessary, reaching and maintaining a serum 25(OH)D of 100C150 nmol/L (40C60 ng/ml) could be achieved by an initial supplementation with the upper tolerable daily intake doses (IU/day) for up to two months: &amp;lt;1yr 2000, 1-18yrs 4000 and all adults 10,000 (obese x 2C3 times more) and then with the maintenance proposed doses that do not require medical supervision, practically identical with the IOMs upper tolerable limits: 1000 &amp;lt;6m, 1500 6m-1yr, 2500 1-3yrs, 3000 4-8yrs, and 4000 &amp;gt;8yrs, with adults and adolescents requiring 4000C5000 (obese x 2).

METHODS: Secondary data from a national external evaluation of PHC conducted in 2017 and 2018 were analyzed. The construction of the score used 14 variables, divided into the following: structural characteristics of the PHC, infection control equipment under conditions of use, and biosafety supplies in sufficient quantity. The questions were mostly dichotomous (yes/no). Descriptive analyses were carried out to characterize the OHT and factor analyses to reduce the number of observed variables to a specific number of factors. RESULTS: Among 20,301 health units with OHT, 4,510 (22.2%) units did not have washable floors, ceilings, and walls; 8,406 (41.4%) did not have a sealer; 16,780 (82.7%) did not have taps with noncontact activation, and 4,663 (23.0%) units did not have rubber gloves. Regarding personal protective equipment (PPE), 1,618 (8.0%) units did not have a sufficient quantity of basic PPE. Three factors were defined to explain the 14 evaluated variables.

The results show that the detected clusters vary with the clustering radius. Forty-three space-time clusters were detected with a maximum clustering radius of 100 km and 88 clusters with a maximum clustering radius of 10 km from 2 December 2019 to 20 June 2020.

However, these trials have mostly recruited patients with germline BRCA mutations, and it is unclear whether PARPi have similar efficacy in patients with somatic BRCA mutations. Our study aimed to determine the efficacy of PARPi in patients with somatic BRCA mutations. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis comparing overall response rate to PARPi in patients harboring somatic versus germline BRCA mutations. We looked at studies including somatic and germline mutations in BRCA patients that received PARPi. RESULTS: After screening and removing duplicates, 18 studies met our criteria for including both somatic and germline BRCA mutations. Only 8 studies reported response rates for both somatic and germline BRCA mutations. In those studies, 24 out of 43 patients with somatic BRCA mutations (55.8%), and 69 out of 157 (43.9%) patients with germline BRCA patients had a response to therapy to PARPi. This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.399). In all five studies that reported progression-free survival, there was no obvious difference in outcomes between somatic versus germline BRCA patients, however a precise statistical analysis could not be performed.

Day cases (no overnight stay) dropped by around 37% per week. Both admissions and discharges for inpatients (at least one overnight stay) decreased leading to a small reduction in hospital bed days but no reduction in hospital bed nights. The effect on hospital activity on different patient groups varied substantially with some groups such as medical oncology day cases increasing by 13%. As a result, the patient case mix in the hospital was very different during the pandemic. Overall weekly medication administrations decreased for day cases and inpatients, but weekly medication administrations per bed day increased by 10% for day cases and 6% for inpatients. Conclusions Despite not being badly affected by the disease itself, specialist paediatric hospital services have been greatly affected by the pandemic.

Several publicized drugs are being used with not much evidence of their efficacy such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or lopinavir-ritonavir. Yet, the cardiac safety of these drugs in COVID-19 deserves scrutiny as they are known to foster cardiac adverse ADRs, notably QTc interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram and its arrhythmogenic consequences. METHODS: Since March 27th, 2020, the French Pharmacovigilance Network directed all cardiac adverse drug reactions associated with \\"off-label\\" use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 to the Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance. Each Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance first assessed causality of drugs. We performed a specific analysis of these cardiac adverse drug reactions amidst an array of risk factors, reassessed the electrocardiograms and estimated their incidence in coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: In one month, 120 reports of cardiac adverse drug reactions have been notified, 103 of which associated with hydroxychloroquine alone (86%), or associated with azithromycin (60%). Their estimated incidence is 0.77% to 1.54% of all patients, notwithstanding strong underreporting. Lopinavir-ritonavir came third with 17 reports (14%) and chloroquine fourth with 3 reports (2.5%).

While national and local policies propose mitigation and adaptation strategies for different sectors, public perception is a key component of any implementation plan. This study investigates the CC perception in Romania, based on a national-scale online survey performed in the spring of 2020, aiming to outline the prominence of environmental and CC issues, level of information and interest, perceived causes, changes perceived in meteorological phenomena at the regional scale, perceived impacts, and the psychological representation of the CC. The study investigates single causal factors of perception. We found that particularly (i) the regional differences on climate change intensity strongly bias the perception of CC causes; (ii) age is very likely to influence the acceptance of CC, the importance of environmental issues, and the levels of information and interest; while (iii) age, gender, and place of residence (ruralCurban) are very likely to control the changes perceived in the occurrence of various meteorological phenomena, and their impact.

This study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on all lifestyle medicine pillars, namely diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, social support and use of risky substances. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on a convenient sample of adults who resided in Cyprus during the Spring 2020 lockdown. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire comprised of six validated tools regarding the following lifestyle behaviours before and during lockdown: adherence to the Mediterranean diet, physical activity, stress and social support levels, sleep pattern and use of risky substances such as smoking and alcohol. Paired before and during lockdown comparisons for each lifestyle pillar were undertaken using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Bowker symmetry Test where response was numerical (non-parametric data) and categorical respectively. Furthermore, stratified analyses for sociodemographic characteristics were performed. RESULTS: Out of 745 participants, 74% were female and median age was 39 years. Overall participants reported significantly higher perceived stress score (22 v 25, p < 0.01), lower social support score (71 v 68, p < 0.001), and worse sleep quality score (4 v 5, p < 0.01) during lockdown. Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence was moderate and increased significantly only in those practicing religious fasting (score of 6 v 7, p < 0.01). Total minutes spent sitting increased (120 v 180, p < 0.01) although overall physical activity score did not significantly change.

Methods This was a retrospective observational study using the Hospital Episode Statistics administrative dataset. Patients aged  18 years who had a diagnosis of COVID-19 during a hospital stay in England that was completed between March 1st and July 31st, 2020 were included. In-hospital mortality was the primary outcome of interest. In secondary analysis, critical care admission, length of stay and mortality within 30 days of discharge were also investigated. Multilevel logistic regression was used to adjust for covariates. Findings There were 86,356 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 included in the study, of whom 22,944 (26.6%) died in hospital with COVID-19 as the primary cause of death. After adjusting for covariates, the extent of the variation in-hospital mortality rates between hospital trusts and regions was relatively modest. Trusts with the largest baseline number of beds and a greater proportion of patients admitted to critical care had the lowest in-hospital mortality rates.

Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was measured along with personal protection behaviours and occupations. A total of 2047 participants provided valid responses. The willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine among the participants was lower in the third wave (34.8%) than the first wave (44.2%). There were more concerns over vaccine safety in the third wave. Clerical/service/sales workers were less likely to accept the vaccine (adjusted odds ratio: 0.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.43C0.91). A high-level compliance of facemask wearing was found, and more people maintained social distancing and used alcohol hand rub in the third wave.

To demonstrate the use of RV for damage detection, we simulate accelerated damage on sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrodes using potential cycling. RV measurements of the degraded electrodes are compared against standard characterization methods of cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.Main results.Our theoretical discussion illustrates how an intrinsic RV arises even from perfectly balanced biphasic pulses due to leakage via the charge-transfer resistance. Preliminary data inin-vivorat experiments follow the derived model of RV growth, thereby validating our hypothesis that RV is a characteristic of the electrode-tissue interface. RV can therefore be utilized for detecting damage at the electrode. Our experimental results for damage detection show that delamination of SIROF electrodes causes a reduction in charge storage capacity, which in turn reflects a measurable increase in RV.Significance.Chronically implanted electrical stimulation systems with multi-electrode arrays have been the focus of physiological engineering research for the last decade. Changes in RV over time can be a quick and effective method to identify and disconnect faulty electrodes in large arrays. Timely diagnoses of electrode status can ensure optimal long term operation, and prevent further damage to the tissue near these electrodes.","output":"Residual voltage as an ad-hoc indicator of electrode damage in biphasic electrical stimulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A transmissible agent (Breda agent) was isolated from a calf with diarrhea and shown to be infectious by inoculation orally into gnotobiotic and conventionally reared calves.

Attempts to culture the virus in cell or organ cultures or in embryonated eggs, were unsuccessful. The virus was either spherical or kidney shaped, with 7C9 nm peplomers on the surface. A few particles possessed coronavirus processes of 17C20 nm, but these were arranged irregularly and were thought to be tissue debris. Three out of eight experimental calves developed severe diarrhea and the lesions in the small and large intestines were similar to those reported for coronavirus. The virus replicated in the jejunal and ileal regions of the small intestine and in the spiral colon, as judged by immunofluorescence. The virus multiplied in all experimental calves and was excreted in the feces; excretion correlating with the onset of diarrhea or a change in the appearance of the feces. There was little or no malabsorption measured by the uptake of D-xylose and the fact that infection of both the crypt and villus epithelial cells was observed, suggests that the pathogenesis may be different from rotavirus and coronavirus.

The transfer of virus from person to person has been confirmed widely, while the actual source of origin is still unknown. COVID-19 is a highly contagious and infectious disease, and the worldwide transmission of coronavirus has intense effects on the lives of human beings. The spread of the virus is observed mainly through close contact with the infected person due to coughing, sniffing or indirectly through the contaminated surfaces.

The debate is noteworthy because almost one billion people around the globe are estimated to have hypertensive diseases, according to the Global Burden of Disease study. Considering the SARS-CoV-2's high infectivity rates, a possible interaction between COVID-19 and hypertension is worrisome. Additionally, antihypertensive drugs, especially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, could also influence the natural course of COVID-19 infection. Not only can these associations hold from an epidemiologic standpoint, a mechanistic scenario possibly exists. Hypertension and antihypertensive drugs can increase the expression of transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors, the entry target of the viruses, thus facilitating infectivity. On the other hand, an increase in ACE-2 could be protective considering the anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic effects of the ACE-2-angiotensin 1-7/Mas pathway. So far, little is known about the whole picture. Observational studies appear to indicate at least a twofold increased risk of mortality for hypertensive patients with COVID-19; however, the previous and continued use of RAAS inhibitors may be protective in this subgroup of patients.

Despite recent reports of the modified delivery system, its safety is still unknown. OBJECTIVE To illustrate the intraprocedural and periprocedural complication rate with this new device in 30 consecutive patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Clinical, procedural, and angiographic data, including aneurysm size and location, device or devices used, angiographic and clinical data were analyzed. RESULTS 30 patients harboring 30 aneurysms were analyzed. 39 devices were placed properly. Multiple Pipeline embolization devices (PEDs) were used in 7 cases. In 28 devices the distal end opened fully from the beginning with a complete wall apposition. In the remaining 11 devices, distal-end opening of the devices was instant but partial, but fully opened easily after recapture. Among the 30 procedures, recapture and reposition of the Pipeline Flex was performed four times owing to proximal migration/malposition of the device during delivery. Four intraprocedural/periprocedural complications occurred, of which 2 resulted in major complications, with neurologic deficits persisting for longer than 7 days. The 30-day morbidity rate was 6.6%, with no deaths. No aneurysm rupture or parenchymal hemorrhage was seen. CONCLUSIONS The Pipeline Flex embolization device allows more precise and controlled deployment than the first-generation device.

METHODS: Consensus suggestions for EMCC were derived from published clinical practice guidelines and medical resource utilization data for the everyday critical care conditions that are anticipated to predominate during mass critical care events. When necessary, expert opinion was used. TASK FORCE MAJOR SUGGESTIONS: The Task Force makes the following suggestions: (1) one mechanical ventilator that meets specific characteristics, as well as a set of consumable and durable medical equipment, should be provided for each EMCC patient; (2) EMCC should be provided in hospitals or similarly equipped structures; after ICUs, postanesthesia care units, and emergency departments all reach capacity, hospital locations should be repurposed for EMCC in the following order: (A) step-down units and large procedure suites, (B) telemetry units, and (C) hospital wards; and (3) hospitals can extend the provision of critical care using non-critical care personnel via a deliberate model of delegation to match staff competencies with patient needs.

Arteriviruses and coronaviruses (order Nidovirales) are unique among plus-stranded RNA viruses for using a mechanism of discontinuous RNA synthesis to produce a nested set of 5'- and 3'-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs, which serve to express the viral structural protein genes. The discontinuous step presumably occurs during minus-strand synthesis and joins noncontiguous sequences copied from the 3'- and 5'-proximal domains of the genomic template. Nidovirus genome amplification (\\"replication\\") and subgenomic mRNA synthesis (\\"transcription\\") are driven by 13 to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp's), generated by autocatalytic processing of two large \\"replicase\\" polyproteins. Previously, using a replicon system, the N-terminal nsp1 replicase subunit of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) was found to be dispensable for replication but crucial for transcription. Using reverse genetics, we have now addressed the role of nsp1 against the background of the complete EAV life cycle. Mutagenesis revealed that nsp1 is in fact a multifunctional regulatory protein. Its papain-like autoprotease domain releases nsp1 from the replicase polyproteins, a cleavage essential for viral RNA synthesis. Several mutations in the putative N-terminal zinc finger domain of nsp1 selectively abolished transcription, while replication was either not affected or even increased.

Therefore, to explore conserved features in S protein dynamics and to identify potentially novel regions for drugging, we measured variability derived from 791 viral genomes and studied its properties by MD simulation. The findings indicated that S2 subunit (HR1, CH, and CD domains) showed low variability, low fluctuations in MD, and displayed a trimer cavity. By contrast, the RBD domain, which is typically targeted in drug discovery programmes, exhibits more sequence variability and flexibility. Interpretations from MD suggest that the monomer is in constant motion showing transitions up-to-down state, and the trimer cavity may function as a 'bouncing spring' that may facilitates S protein interactions with ACE2. Feasibility of trimer cavity for potential drug target was examined by SBVS screening. Several hits that have already been validated or suggested to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus in cell systems were identified;in particular, the data suggest an action mechanism for such molecules including Chitosan and macrolide types. These findings identify a novel binding-site formed by the S protein, that might assist in future drug discovery programmes aimed at targeting the CoV family of viruses.","output":"Highly Conserved Homotrimer Cavity Formed by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein: A Novel Binding Site"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How can political elites learn from the past to enhance sustainability of their leadership in a pandemic situation? In this article, we develop a theoretical framework of policy implementation that combines collaboration from public and private sectors (\\"Public-Private Partnership,\\" or PPP) to efficiently deal with urgent crises such as COVID-19. We explain the role of new institutions prompted by policy failure precedence (Time 1) that at a later time period (Time 2) allow for the activation of PPPs with the aim to extend the political life of incumbent leaderships. Specifically, we examine the case of South Korea, a country in which a prior case of MERS in 2015 (Time 1) had established new policies for pandemic governance. In 2020, such policies were activated by the incumbent leadership in order to contain COVID-19 (Time 2). In particular, for swift and effective management of the pandemic, the South Korean government utilized partnerships with the private sector to exponentially increase the amount of Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. We apply Policy Feedback Theory to demonstrate the political effects of failed policy precedents and how the political outcomes again shape new policies in a dynamic and cyclical manner. Empirically, we conduct a content analysis of South Korea's pharmaceutical sector in government procurement and exports of test-kits during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that as the pandemic situation progressed, South Korea's leader, who had been in danger of plummeting support to the extent that impeachment was discussed as a viable option, drastically shifted public opinion to achieve a landslide victory in general elections in April 2020. Our findings suggest that democratic governments, aware of precedents and wary of their fate in elections, are pressured to perform well in crisis management, and thus turn to rapidly mobilizing public and private means for survival.

Since genome size is usually correlated to cell size, reduction of genome size in unicells could be a parallel outcome of warming at ecological and evolutionary time scales. In this study, the short-term response of cell size and nucleic acid content of coastal marine prokaryotic communities to temperature was studied over a full annual cycle at a NE Atlantic temperate site. We used flow cytometry and experimental warming incubations, spanning a 6C range, to analyze the hypothesized reduction with temperature in the size of the widespread flow cytometric bacterial groups of high and low nucleic acid content (HNA and LNA bacteria, respectively). Our results showed decreases in size in response to experimental warming, which were more marked in 0.8 m pre-filtered treatment rather than in the whole community treatment, thus excluding the role of protistan grazers in our findings. Interestingly, a significant effect of temperature on reducing the average nucleic acid content (NAC) of prokaryotic cells in the communities was also observed. Cell size and nucleic acid decrease with temperature were correlated, showing a common mean decrease of 0.4% per C. The usually larger HNA bacteria consistently showed a greater reduction in cell and NAC compared with their LNA counterparts, especially during the spring phytoplankton bloom period associated to maximum bacterial growth rates in response to nutrient availability. Our results show that the already smallest planktonic microbes, yet with key roles in global biogeochemical cycling, are likely undergoing important structural shrinkage in response to rising temperatures.","output":"Experimental Warming Decreases the Average Size and Nucleic Acid Content of Marine Bacterial Communities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is no consensus on immunosuppression management for kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

METHODS: All laboratory-confirmed positive cases among PEH (n = 169) and documented in Utah's surveillance system were included in this analysis. The general population comparison group (n = 163) were systematically selected from all laboratory-confirmed cases identified during the same period. RESULTS: Ninety-three PEH cases (55%) were interviewed compared to 163 (100%) cases among the general population (P < .0001). PEH were more likely to be lost to follow-up at end of isolation (14.2%) versus the general population (0%; P-value < .0001) and provided fewer contacts per case (0.3) than the general population (4.7) (P-value < .0001). Contacts of PEH were more often unreachable (13.0% vs. 7.1%; P-value < .0001).

We discuss the need for digital health solutions to overcome these barriers to better and safely take care of patients, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A review of the literature was conducted for technology and logistics necessary in forming a digital health program. RESULTS Digital health encounters can take place in both a synchronous and asynchronous manner. Factors involving patients include cognitive capacity, physical safety, physical capacity, connectivity, and technological security. Physician factors include examining the patient, system diagnostics, and adjusting stimulation or medications. Technology is focused on bridging the gap between patient and physician through integrating the DBS lead, implantable pulse generator (IPG), programmer, novel devices/applications to grade motor function, and teleconference modalities.

As the response to the pandemic intensifies through the application of non-pharmacologic interventions as well as enforcement of the lockdowns across African cities, there is a significant risk that more children will miss out on life-saving vaccines that can prevent childhood killer diseases. This study was therefore conducted to look at the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on routine immunization in Oyo State, Nigeria. Method: We conducted a descriptive secondary analysis of immunization data between July 2019 and August 2020. These data were retrieved from the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of Oyo State Primary Health Care Board. The data were extracted from the original paper format and entered into Excel sheets. Line graphs were plotted to compare the trends of the coverage rates before and after the index case of COVID-19 pandemic. Results The average coverage rates for BCG before and after index case was 85.8% and 82.1% respectively, while it was 63.5% and 60.0% for HBV0. For the co-administered vaccines at 14 weeks, Penta 3, OPV 3, PCV 3 and IPV coverage rates dropped from 76.1%, 75.4%, 75.1% and 73.5C72.0%, 71.4%, 72.0% and 71.9% respectively. The average coverage rates for yellow fever and measles dropped sharply from 77.0% and 74.5C64.6% and 58.6% respectively. The average drop-out rates for the pre-and post-index case periods were 5.0% and 4.7% respectively. For the planned fixed and outreach sessions, none of the monthly sessions met the target of 100.0% in the post-index case period. Conclusion Decreased vaccination coverage for vaccine-preventable diseases could cause parallel outbreaks with COVID-19 and further exacerbate the strain on health systems attempting to end the acute phase of this pandemic.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Radiology SZPGMI, Lahore. Information on clinical data, chest radiography appearance and comorbidities were recorded ona designed proforma. HRCT chest findings were recorded in terms of pattern, distribution, laterality, and other findings. HRCT chest severity was calculated using a 25 point CT severity score. Kendall's Tau test applied to investigate the correlation between the severity of HRCT chest with clinical severity levels of COVID-19. Results: Fever (74%) was the most reported presenting symptom, followed by dry cough (70%). The majority of patients had abnormal chest X-ray (57%) as well as abnormal HRCT chest (90%). The majority of patients were in mild clinical scoring levels of disease (61%) and mild category (49%) of HRCT chest severity. In majority of the patients (46%), all five pulmonary lobes were involved, whereas the right lower lobe was most frequently affected. The pattern of ground-glass opacity (GGO) was found in 82% of patients. Most common distribution was 'peripheral', reported in 90% patients. Multiple lobe involvement was found in 82% of patients.

PURPOSE: To train a deep learning classification algorithm to predict chest radiography severity scores and clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we identified patients of ages of 21 to 50 who presented to the emergency department (ED) of a multicenter urban health system from March 10C26, 2020 with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We collected the initial chest radiographs (CXRs), clinical variables, and outcomes including admission, intubation, and survival within 30 days (n = 338; median age 39; 210 men). Two fellowship-trained cardiothoracic radiologists examined CXRs for opacities and assigned a clinically validated severity score. We trained a deep learning algorithm to predict outcomes on a holdout test set composed of confirmed COVID-19 patients who presented from March 27C29, 2020 (n = 161; median age 60; 98 men) for both younger (ages 21C50; n = 51) and older (ages > 50; n = 110) populations. Bootstrapping methods computed confidence intervals. RESULTS: The model trained on the CXR severity score produced the following areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUCs): 0.80 (0.73,0.88) for the CXR severity score, 0.76 (0.68,0.84) for admission, 0.66 (0.56,0.75) for intubation, and 0.59 (0.49,0.69) for death. The model trained on clinical variables produced the following AUCs 0.64 (0.55,0.73) for intubation and 0.59 (0.50,0.68) for death. Combining CXR and clinical variables increased AUC of intubation and death to 0.86 (0.79,0.96) and 0.82 (0.72,0.91), respectively.

This study was conducted by directing phylogenetic analysis on 17 samples of Covid-19 sequences from several countries taken from the NCBI database and followed by ORF analysis of each Covid-19 sample for further characterization. Based on the study, it is known that from 17 samples of Covid-19 sequences, Covid-19 sequences from Taiwan have the lowest similarity compared to 16 other Covid-19 sequences. These results are confirmed by the ORF analysis of each sample, which shows that the longest ORF in the Covid-19 sequence from Taiwan is an ORF 20 with lengthened by 4405 amino acids, and the shortest ORF is an ORF 38 with lengthened by 50 amino acids. However, 16 other sequence samples have the longest ORF 6, ORF 6, with lengthened by 4405 amino acids and the shortest ORF 44 with lengthened by 50 amino acids.

Containing the virus outbreak in the office is prioritised to relieve socio-economic burdens caused by COVID-19 and potential pandemics in the future. However, what is the transmissible distance of SARS-CoV-2 and what are the appropriate ventilation rates in the office have been under debate. Without quantitative evaluation of the infection risk, some studies challenged the current social distance policies of 1C2 m adopted by most countries and suggested that longer social distance rule is required as the maximum transmission distance of cough ejected droplets could reach 3C10 m. With the emergence of virus variants such as the Delta variant, the applicability of previous social distance rules are also in doubt. To address the above problem, this study conducted transient Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to evaluate the infection risks under calm and wind scenarios. The calculated Social Distance Index (SDI) indicates that lower humidity leads to a higher infection risk due to weaker evaporation. The infection risk in office was found more sensitive to social distance than ventilation rate. In standard ventilation conditions, social distance of 1.7 mC1.8 m is sufficient distances to reach low probability of infection (PI) target in a calm scenario when coughing is the dominant transmission route. However in the wind scenario (0.25 m/s indoor wind), distance of 2.8 m is required to contain the wild virus type and 3 m is insufficient to contain the spread of the Delta variant.

India had one of the longest lockdowns in 2020 to curb the spread of COVID-19, leading to reductions in the emissions from anthropogenic activities. In this article, the frequency distributions of different pollutants have been analysed over two densely populated megacities: Delhi (28.70 N; 77.10 E) and Kolkata (22.57 N; 88.36 E). In Delhi, the percentage of days with PM(2.5) levels exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) between 25 March and 17 June dropped from 98% in 2019 to 61% in 2020. The lockdown phase 1 brought down the PM(10) (particulate matter having an aerodynamic diameter  10 m) levels below the daily NAAQS limit over Delhi and Kolkata. However, PM(10) exceeded the limit of 100 gm(?3) during phases 2C5 of lockdown over Delhi due to lower temperature, weaker winds, increased relative humidity and commencement of limited traffic movement. The PM(2.5) levels exhibit a regressive trend in the highest range from the year 2019 to 2020 in Delhi. The daily mean value for PM(2.5) concentrations dropped from 85C90 gm(?3) to 40C45 gm(?3) bin, whereas the PM(10) levels witnessed a reduction from 160C180 gm(?3) to 100C120 gm(?3) bin due to the lockdown. Kolkata also experienced a shift in the peak of PM(10) distribution from 80C100 gm(?3) in 2019 to 20C40 gm(?3) during the lockdown. The PM(2.5) levels in peak frequency distribution were recorded in the 35C40 gm(?3) bin in 2019 which dropped to 15C20 gm(?3) in 2020. In line with particulate matter, other primary gaseous pollutants (NO(x), CO, SO(2), NH(3)) also showed decline. However, changes in O(3) showed mixed trends with enhancements in some of the phases and reductions in other phases. In contrast to daily mean O(3), 8-h maximum O(3) showed a reduction over Delhi during lockdown phases except for phase 3. Interestingly, the time of daily maximum was observed to be delayed by ~ 2 h over Delhi (from 1300 to 1500 h) and ~ 1 h over Kolkata (from 1300 to 1400 h) almost coinciding with the time of maximum temperature, highlighting the role of meteorology versus precursors. Emission reductions weakened the chemical sink of O(3) leading to enhancement (120%; 11 ppbv) in night-time O(3) over Delhi during phases 1C3.

Thus, this study examined the 7 March building collapse in Quanzhou City as a case study. This case was a typical compound disaster involving a public health emergency and an accident disaster during COVID-19. Based on the network analysis, the overall response and dynamic characteristics of the emergency collaboration for compound disasters were examined in this study. A compound disaster emergency collaboration network (ECN) was constructed by identifying the interactional relationships between emergency organizations. After applying time slices, the dynamic evolution of network structure, organizationalCfunctional relations, organizational attributes, and cross-organizational relationships were discussed. The research results showed the following: (1) The density and connectivity of the compound disaster ECN first decreased before increasing. Meanwhile, the evolution of the network structure followed a path from decentralized to concentrated and from being uneven to an equilibrium. (2) The characteristics and practices of compound disasters during different periods indicated varied emergency needs for emergency organizations. We found that the formation of emergency tasks not only involved the passive adaptation to match the practice for compound disasters, but also the active choices of emergency organizations when facing compound disasters according to their collective experiences and decisions. (3) The national emergency management departments, the government emergency rescue organizations, and the local governments were the core organizations of the ECN. Public health management departments and social organizations were also required to participate in the ECN to improve the diverse and heterogeneous distribution of resources.

Fully vaccinated were more likely than unvaccinated persons to be infected by variants carrying mutations associated with decreased antibody neutralization (L452R, L452Q, E484K, and/or F490S) (78% versus 48%, p = 1.96e-08), but not by those associated with increased infectivity (L452R and/or N501Y) (85% versus 77%, p = 0.092). Differences in viral loads were non-significant between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated persons overall (p = 0.99) and according to lineage (p = 0.09 - 0.78). Viral loads were significantly higher in symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic vaccine breakthrough cases (p < 0.0001), and symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections had similar viral loads to unvaccinated infections (p = 0.64). In 5 cases with available longitudinal samples for serologic analyses, vaccine breakthrough infections were found to be associated with low or undetectable neutralizing antibody levels attributable to immunocompromised state or infection by an antibody-resistant lineage. These findings suggest that vaccine breakthrough cases are preferentially caused by circulating antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that symptomatic breakthrough infections may potentially transmit COVID-19 as efficiently as unvaccinated infections, regardless of the infecting lineage.","output":"Predominance of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in vaccine breakthrough cases from the San Francisco Bay Area, California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The increase in multidrug resistance (MDR) among pathogenic bacteria responsible for infectious diseases has led to lack of effectiveness of some antibiotics. The ability of Escherichia coli to harbor resistant genes has made the treatment of infections a major challenge. This study was carried out to assess antibiotic resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production of E. coli from various sources in Aba metropolis, Nigeria. RESULTS: From a total of 350 samples collected from clinical and non-clinical sources, 137 were presumptively identified as E. coli by standard phenotypic methods and 83 were confirmed as E. coli by the detection of E. coli specific 16S rRNA gene fragments. The majority of these isolates (52, 62.7%) were from non-clinical sources. The clinical isolates, however, exhibited a higher level of resistance against 62.5% of tested antibiotics. Both group of isolates exhibited similar levels (58.1% vs 53.9%) of MDR, though. A low rate of ESBL production was observed (1.2%) following phenotypic detection of ESBL-producing abilities using the double-disc synergy test. An assessment of the presence of three beta-lactamase gene genotypes (bla(TEM), bla(SHV) and bla(CTX-M)) revealed that none of the three predominant ESBL genotypes was identified in this study. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports high levels of antibiotic resistance in both clinical and non-clinical E. coli isolates. Though higher rates of resistance were observed among the non-clinical isolates, both group of organisms had similar levels of MDR. Strikingly, however, was the low level of ESBL producers detected in this study and the absence of the three main genotypes associated with ESBL production in this study.","output":"Antibiotic resistance and ESBL production in Escherichia coli from various sources in Aba metropolis, Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE During the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinicians started offering telemedicine services. The objective of this study is to describe the experience of US family planning providers with the rapid adoption of telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during this period. STUDY DESIGN This is a cross-sectional web-based survey of family planning providers practicing in the United States. RESULTS A total of 172 providers completed the survey (34% response rate). Of these, 156 (91%) provided telemedicine services in the two months preceding the survey. Most (78%) were new to telemedicine. About half (54%) referred less than a quarter of contraception patients for in-person visits, and 53% stated that the most common referral reason was LARC insertion. A majority of providers strongly agree that telemedicine visits are an effective way to provide contraceptive counseling (80%), and that this service should be expanded after the pandemic (84%). If asked to provide telemedicine visits after the pandemic, 64% of providers would be very happy about it. Many providers used personal phones or smartphones to conduct telemedicine visits but stated that ideal devices would be work-issued computers, tablets, or phones. More than half (59%) of providers prefer video over phone visits. CONCLUSIONS Family planning clinicians in the United States reported a positive experience with telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and believe that this service should be expanded.

The maturity of mAb technologies now allow us to identify and advance neutralizing mAb products to the clinic at \\"pandemic pace\\", as the pipeline of mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated. Ensuring global access to these products for passive immunization, however, will require both low manufacturing cost and multi-ton production capacity - particularly for those infectious diseases where the geographic burden falls mostly in low- and middle-income countries or those with pandemic potential. Analysis of process economics and manufacturing technologies for antibody and other parenteral protein therapeutics demonstrates the importance of economies of scale to reducing the cost of goods for drug substance manufacturing. There are major benefits to convergence on a standardized platform process for antibody production that is portable to most existing very large-scale facilities, carries low risk for complications during process transfer and scale-up, and has a predictable timeline and probability of technical and regulatory success. In the case of an infectious disease with pandemic potential which could be treated with an antibody, such as COVID-19 or influenza, these advantages are paramount.

COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rates have varied widely across nations. Psychosocial factors, such as common mental disorders, may influence the risk of disease spread and death during outbreaks, and these factors are in turn influenced by the prevailing environmental conditions. This study examined the correlation between the prepandemic prevalence of anxiety and depression and indices of the impact of COVID-19. METHODS: Data from 94 countries reporting at least 1000 cases of COVID-19 to date was included. The impact of COVID-19 was assessed using the prevalence and mortality rates per 1 million population and the case fatality rate. The prevalence rates of depression and anxiety were obtained from World Health Organization statistics. The correlations between these variables were examined after correcting for the confounding effects of population, median age and urbanization. RESULTS: The pre-COVID prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders were both positively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence (Spearman's =0.433, P<0.001 for depression, =0.387, P<0.001 for anxiety) and mortality rates (=0.497, P<0.001 for depression, =0.486, P<0.001 for anxiety). The association between anxiety disorder prevalence and COVID-19 mortality and case fatality rates remained significant after correcting for population, median age and degree of urbanization. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide preliminary evidence of a link between the pre-COVID prevalence of common mental disorders and COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rates. Alarge proportion of this relationship may be due to shared environmental vulnerability. However, in the case of anxiety disorders, more specific behavioral or biological mechanisms may also need to be considered.","output":"The relationship between pre-COVID prevalence of common mental disorders and the impact of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the period 1990-2019 the world economy grew and declined with good and bad periods, with smaller and stronger crises (such as the 2009 one), which seems to have not ended Word seaborne trade, directly related to international world and merchandise trade followed their upward and downward trends, but with much higher amplitudes The comparative analysis of global economic developments in 2005-2018 period shows a declining trend of all economic indicators, accentuated in the covid and post-covid 19 era ? 2020 SBNA This work is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4 0 License All rights reserved","output":"World seaborne trade in the 1990-2019 period and its perspective in Covid era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples for antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) require qualified healthcare professionals and are frequently perceived as uncomfortable by patients. Methods: We performed a manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, comparing professional-collected anterior nasal (AN) to nasopharyngeal swab, using the test kits of a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT (STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test, SD Biosensor), which is also being distributed by Roche. Individuals with high suspicion for COVID-19 infection were tested. The reference standard was RT-PCR using a combined oro-/nasopharyngeal swab sample. Percent positive and negative agreement, as well as sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results: Among the 179 participants, 41 (22.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The positive percent agreement of the two different sampling techniques for the Ag-RDT was 93.5% (CI 79.3-98.2). The negative percent agreement was 95.9% (CI 91.4-98.1). The Ag-RDT with AN-sampling showed a sensitivity of 80.5% (33/41 PCR positives detected; CI 66.0-89.8) and specificity of 98.6% (CI 94.9-99.6) compared to RT-PCR. The sensitivity with NP-sampling was 73.2% (30/41 PCR positives detected; CI 58.1-84.3) and specificity was 99.3% (CI 96.0-100). In patients with high viral load (>7.0 log10 RNA SARS-CoV2/swab), the sensitivity of the Ag-RDT with AN-sampling was 100% and 94.7% with NP-sampling. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that sensitivity of a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT using a professional AN-sampling kit is at least equal to that of the NP-sampling kit, although confidence intervals overlap. Of note, differences in the IFUs of the test procedures could have contributed to different sensitivities. AN-sampling can be performed with less training, reduces patient discomfort, and it enables scaling of antigen testing strategies. Additional studies of patient self-sampling should be considered to further facilitate the scaling-up of Ag-RDT testing.","output":"Head-to-head comparison of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid test with professional-collected anterior nasal versus nasopharyngeal swab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has presented a lot of learning for the community through various new information and vocabulary related to the nature and meaning of COVID-19 The emergence of this new vocabulary is responded to and understood differently in the community This study aims to identify and explain the phenomenon of the emergence of trending words (trend words) about COVID-19, news sources, understanding, and curiosity (curiosity) of the public about trending words COVID-19 in the perspective of non-formal education The study was conducted with a quantitative descriptive approach by taking the population of Malang Raya, which included Malang City, Malang Regency, and Batu City The sample was chosen purposively by considering the research process must be carried out quickly, data collection should not be done physically close together, and respondents must have an android mobile phone to fill in the instruments in Google Form Data was collected using a closed questionnaire technique that was distributed through the Google Form Information Technology Application Data analysis was performed using percentage descriptive statistics The results showed that (1) there was the addition of new vocabulary about COVID-19, and (2) there were variations in sources, understanding, and curiosity about news and the meaning of vocabulary about COVID-19","output":"Literacy About COVID-19: Trending Words, News Sources, Comprehension, And Community Curiosity In Perspectives Nonformal Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new report from the Charities Aid Foundation shows that the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are indeed being felt by nonprofits in communities all around the world","output":"Report shows global impact of pandemic on charitable sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shipping management has an essential influence on the development of shipping industry.

Based on a two-stage data envelopment analysis, we establish a novel congestion management system to comprehensively examine the organization's congestion from three aspects, including the macro-level, the micro-level, and resource allocation. Accordingly, we apply three congestion models, namely stage congestion, slack-based congestion, and resource reallocation congestion, respectively, to measure Hapag-Lloyd's congestion index from 2017 to 2020. We find that: 1) Hapag-Lloyd's capacity is higher than its market share;2) major events (e.g., merger and acquisition, COVID-19) have significant impacts on the congestion index of the company;3) excessive redistributable resource input invalidate the congestion index.","output":"Assessing the management efficiency of shipping company from a congestion perspective: A case study of Hapag-Lloyd"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To limit the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), governments have ordered a series of restrictions that may affect glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), since physical activity (PA) was not allowed outside home. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated glycemic control of individuals with T1DM using hybrid closed loop (HCL) system in the period before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy (February 10-23, 2020-Time 1), when movements were only reduced (February 24-March 8, 2020-Time 2) and during complete lockdown (March 9-22, 2020-Time 3). Information about regular PA (at least 3 h per week) prior and during the quarantine was collected. Results: The study included 13 individuals with a median age of 14.2 years and a good glycemic control at baseline (glucose management indicator of 7%, time in range [TIR] of 68%, time below range [TBR] of 2%). All individuals continued to show good glycemic control throughout the study period. There was an increase in TIR during the study period (+3%) and TIR was significantly higher during Time 3 (72%) than during Time 2 (66%). TBR was significantly lower during Time 3 (1%) both compared with Time 1 and Time 2 (2%). A meaningful variance in TIR at Time 3 between individuals who performed or not PA during quarantine and a significant increase in TIR between Time 2 and Time 3 in individuals both doing PA at baseline and during quarantine was found. At logistic regression, only the presence of PA during quarantine significantly predicted a TIR >70%. Conclusions: Glycemic control of T1DM in adolescents using HCL system did not worsen during the restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemics and further improved in those who continued PA during the quarantine.

These negative effects are explained by three main underlying mechanisms: reduced sleep, time allocated for more media consumption; increased mental, emotional, or psychological stimulation by media content; and the effects of light emitted by digital devices on circadian rhythms and sleep physiology and arousal. In this study, we focused not only on sleep duration, but also on sleep problems. We conducted a large-scale survey to examine the relationship between excessive use of digital devices, Internet addictive behaviour, sleep duration, and sleep problems. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of children enrolled in 20 public primary schools in Nagoya City, Japan. Childrens parents/guardians completed a questionnaire including the brief sleep questionnaire for Japanese children which is a shortened version of the Childrens Sleep Habits Questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify associations between sleep problems and grade, sex, weekday sleep time, weekend sleep time, ownership of digital devices, frequent checking of digital devices, use of digital devices for more than 4 hours per day, and Internet addiction. RESULTS: In total, 8172 responses were received (91.6% response rate). After excluding incomplete responses, we analysed complete datasets for 6893 children with a mean age of 9.0 years. When adjusted for sex, grade, sleep duration on weekdays, and sleep duration on weekends, failure to control (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29C1.70; p < .001), more use than intended (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.12C1.44; p < .001), and use to escape a dysphoric mood (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.03C1.64; p = .027) were associated with childrens sleep problems.

Induction of transcription factor zinc finger and BTB domain containing protein 7a (Zbtb7a) was an early response critical in the DSA-induced chronic rejection. A cohort of human lung transplant recipients who developed DSA and chronic rejection demonstrated greater Zbtb7a expression long before clinical diagnosis of chronic rejection compared to nonrejecting lung transplant recipients with stable pulmonary function. Expression of DSA-induced Zbtb7a was restricted to alveolar macrophages (AMs), and selective disruption of Zbtb7a in AMs resulted in less bronchiolar occlusion, low immune responses to lung-restricted self-antigens, and high protection from chronic rejection in mice. Additionally, in an allogeneic cell transfer protocol, antigen presentation by AMs was Zbtb7a-dependent where AMs deficient in Zbtb7a failed to induce antibody and T cell responses. Collectively, we demonstrate that AMs play an essential role in antibody-induced pathogenesis of chronic rejection by regulating early inflammation and lung-restricted humoral and cellular autoimmunity.","output":"Zbtb7a induction in alveolar macrophages is implicated in anti-HLA-mediated lung allograft rejection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children and adolescents are susceptible to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic and tend to show posttraumatic distress. Immediately after an epidemic, governments and social organizations often provide psychological services for children and adolescents to relieve their distress. However, many adolescents report distress even long after a traumatic event because of the unaddressed traumatic atmosphere in schools or families. To advance this issue, this article proposes a cooperative model of psychological services provision for children and adolescents in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. This model suggests that psychological services should simultaneously include social, school, and family systems, which interact and have a synergistic effect. The social system provides direct services not only for children and adolescents but also for their school and family systems; school and family systems cooperate to support adolescents. Psychological work also needs to emphasize the key elements of school and family systems. Attention should be given to teachers' distress, teacher-student relationships, and peer relationships in the school system, as well as to parents' distress, parent-child relationships, and the marital relationship in the family system. In these ways, adolescents can achieve an efficient and sustainable recovery following a disaster.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize existing evidence on the prevalence of alcohol use among bisexual people compared to their lesbian/gay and heterosexual counterparts. METHODS: A systematic review of literature from 1995 to May 2020 was performed using Medline, PsycInfo, and Embase (OVID), Scopus, CINHAL and LGBT Life (EBSCO), combining keywords for bisexuality and alcohol use. Peer-reviewed publications that reported quantitative data on alcohol use among bisexual people were included. A random-effects model was used to pool the prevalence of two outcomes: any alcohol use and heavy episodic drinking (HED). Subgroup analysis and random-effects meta-regression were used to explore heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 105 studies eligible for data extraction, the overall prevalence of alcohol use was higher among bisexuals compared to lesbian/gay and heterosexual people. For example, the prevalence of past-month HED was 30.0% (28.2, 31.8) among bisexual people versus 25.5% (23.8, 27.2) among lesbian/gay and 21.3% (19.6, 23.0) among heterosexual individuals. Pooled odds ratio estimates showed that bisexual people were more likely to report alcohol use and HED compared to their counterparts. Gender was a significant effect modifier in meta-regression analysis, with greater disparities among women than among men.

INTRODUCTION: Beliefs regarding coronavirus vaccination provide very actual and socially important area in mental health research. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to differentiate the opinions related to coronavirus vaccination (acceptance, refusal, ignorance, hesitation). We analyzed advantages and disadvantages of vaccination, and the different channels in getting information about the vaccine. METHOD: Our study is part of the \\"Longitudinal examination of mental factors caused by the coronavirus epidemic\\" research project, wave of December 2020. We analyzed the responses of 1009 people by one-way analysis of variance tests. RESULTS: Our results show that elder people, males, and those who have higher education are more likely to accept the vaccine. In addition, those who live in Budapest and Cental Hungary are more likely to choose vaccination against the coronavirus than those living in other areas. The groups with different opinions on vaccination are better discriminated by benefit-related than risk-related opinions. Those benefit-related items showed the largest variance between groups, which focused on social usefulness on curbing the epidemics, preventing the spread of the infection. Analyzing the sources of information, we found that all groups rely more on personal (family, friends) and medical health information than on news from the media. CONCLUSION: The opinions of the vaccination groups differ mostly regarding the positive benefits of vaccination, especially the social usefulness. Opinions are mostly formed through personal relationships including relations with healthcare workers.

Consequently, there is an increasing demand for alternative diagnostic approaches aimed at the molecular annotation of the disease on a patient-by-patient basis and the design of more personalized treatments. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) technology enables the development of such novel approaches. For instance, in diagnostics, the use of the RNA-specific C2c2 system allows ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection and could be used to characterize the mutational repertoire and transcriptional breast cancer signatures. In disease modeling, CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be applied to selectively engineer oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in disease pathogenesis. In treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to develop gene-therapy, while its catalytically-dead variant (dCas9) can be applied to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of malignant cells. As immunotherapy becomes increasingly prominent in cancer treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can engineer the immune cells to redirect them against cancer cells and potentiate antitumor immune responses. In this review, CRISPR strategies for the advancement of breast cancer diagnostics, modeling, and treatment are highlighted, culminating in a perspective on developing a precision medicine-based approach against breast cancer.","output":"CRISPR Technology for Breast Cancer: Diagnostics, Modeling, and Therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 infection, which emerged in December 2019 in China and has spread all over the world,1 continues to be a serious health problem and many dermatological findings have been reported.2-6 This study patients who had at least one positive COVID-19-PCR sample in Kayseri province and were followed up and treated for COVID-19 were contacted via the Internet and telephone.

Furthermore, H2S increased the gene transcription of NtSOD3, NtPOD1, and CAT1, to enhance antioxidant enzyme activity, which reduces the generation of the reactive oxygen protective membrane integrity. Additionally, H2S increased the gene expression of the tobacco PC genes, Pr2 and Pr8 promoted the formation of the Cd2+ complexes and transportation to the vacuole, resulting in improved Cd-ATPase gene expression, away from organelles, to alleviate the Cd2+ poison. Furthermore, H2S regulated the relative absorption of K+ and Ca2+, which antagonized the Cd2+, and reduced its transportation to the aboveground plant material. Finally, the expression level of CaM increased with the application of H2S, and was highly correlated with the fitted results of a variety of resistance indicators, thereby indicating that H2S regulatory resistance mechanisms might be associated with Ca2+ signal transduction.","output":"The multiple effects of hydrogen sulfide on cadmium toxicity in tobacco may be interacted with CaM signal transduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 vaccine distribution chain faced multiple challenges associated with the lack of production capacity, security issues, and miscommunication between different actors.

OBJECTIVE: To test hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Household-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04328961). SETTING: National U.S. multicenter study. PARTICIPANTS: Close contacts recently exposed (<96 hours) to persons with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTION: Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d for 3 days followed by 200 mg/d for 11 days) or ascorbic acid (500 mg/d followed by 250 mg/d) as a placebo-equivalent control. MEASUREMENTS: Participants self-collected mid-turbinate swabs daily (days 1 to 14) for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at enrollment. RESULTS: Between March and August 2020, 671 households were randomly assigned: 337 (407 participants) to the hydroxychloroquine group and 334 (422 participants) to the control group. Retention at day 14 was 91%, and 10 724 of 11 606 (92%) expected swabs were tested. Among the 689 (89%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline, there was no difference between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by day 14 (53 versus 45 events; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66]; P > 0.20).

Since histopathology is often unspecific, we aimed to assess placental weight, birthweight/placental-weight (b/p) ratio and the metabolic scaling exponent ?, an indicator of a normal fetal-placental growth, in order to analyze the placental function. METHODS: We included 153 singleton pregnancies with SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR in our study, who delivered at three referring hospitals in Switzerland. Placental weight and b/p ratio were compared to published reference charts. Logistic regression analysis investigated the role of time of infection and other confounding factors on placental weight. The scaling exponent  was compared to the reference value of ?. RESULTS: Placental weight was inferior or equal to the 10(th) centile in 42.5%(65/153) and to the 3(rd) centile in 19%(29/153) of the cases. The risk of low placental weight was not influenced by the trimester of infection. B/p ratio was >50(th) centile in 80.4%(123/153) of the cases. Incidence of fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes was 11.8%(18/153), 3.3%(5/153) and 19.6%(30/153). Linear regression modelling revealed a pathologic metabolic scaling exponent  of 0.8710.064 (R(2)=0.56).

Methods: Participants (n=66) were first-year psychology students from a university in Spain with no prior meditation experience. Intervention lasted for 16 days and was designed ad-hoc. Using a pre-post within-subjects design, feasibility was assessed in five domains (acceptability, satisfaction, implementation, practicality, and limited efficacy testing). Participants completed both baseline and post-intervention assessments of perceived stress, anxiety, and self-compassion. Results: The intervention showed to be feasible in all domains evaluated. It was implemented as planned with constrained resources, and limited efficacy testing showed promising results. After the intervention, stress and anxiety levels decreased significantly (p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.5146; p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.6068, respectively) whereas self-compassion levels were augmented significantly (p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.6968).

Conversely, the AR agonist inhibits ISC differentiation but augments proliferation in ovariectomized mice.

In severe cases the disease progresses into an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which in turn depends on an overproduction of cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IL-12, IL-8, CCL-2 and IL1) that causes alveolar and vascular lung damage. Clearly, it is essential to find an immunological treatment that controls the cytokine storm. In the meantime, however, it is essential to have effective antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs available immediately. PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR COVID-19: Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine have been widely adopted worldwide for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. However, the choice of this treatment was based on low quality of evidence, i.e. retrospective, non-randomized controlled studies. Recently, four large Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) have been performed in record time delivering reliable data: (1) the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RCT included 60 hospitals participating all over the world and showed the efficacy of remdesivir in reducing the recovery time in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 pneumonia; (2) three large RCTs already completed, for hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone and Lopinavir and Ritonavir respectively. These trials were done under the umbrella of the 'Recovery' project, headed by the University of Oxford. The project includes 176 participating hospitals in the UK and was set up to verify the efficacy of some of the treatments used for COVID-19. These three Recovery RCTs concluded definitely: (a) that treatment with hydroxychloroquine provides no benefits in patients hospitalized with COVID-19; (b) that treatment with dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in COVID-19 patients that were mechanically ventilated, and by one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen only; (c) that the combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir is not effective in reducing mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these four large RCTs have provided sound indications to doctors for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and prompted the correction of many institutional provisions and guidelines on COVID-19 treatments (i.e. FDA, NIH, UK Health Service, etc.). Even though a definitive treatment for COVID-19 has not yet been found, large RCTs stand as the Gold Standards for COVID-19 therapy and offer a solid scientific base on which to base treatment decisions.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone in COVID-19: who won and who lost?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Separation and detection are ubiquitous in our daily life and they are two of the most important steps toward practical biomedical diagnostics and industrial applications A deep understanding of working principles and examples of separation and detection enables a plethora of applications from blood test and air/water quality monitoring to food safety and biosecurity;none of which are irrelevant to public health Microfluidics can separate and detect various particles/aerosols as well as cells/viruses in a cost-effective and easy-to-operate manner There are a number of papers reviewing microfluidic separation and detection, but to the best of our knowledge, the two topics are normally reviewed separately In fact, these two themes are closely related with each other from the perspectives of public health: understanding separation or sorting technique will lead to the development of new detection methods, thereby providing new paths to guide the separation routes Therefore, the purpose of this review paper is two-fold: reporting the latest developments in the application of microfluidics for separation and outlining the emerging research in microfluidic detection The dominating microfluidics-based passive separation methods and detection methods are discussed, along with the future perspectives and challenges being discussed Our work inspires novel development of separation and detection methods for the benefits of public health","output":"Public-Health-Driven Microfluidic Technologies: From Separation to Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging often involves a significant change in roles and social positions.

Knowledge of the etiology of a RTI is essential to facilitate the appropriate management and the implementation of the most effective control measures. This perspective explains why laboratory methods that can identify pathogens in respiratory secretions have been developed over the course of many years. High-complexity multiplex panel assays that can simultaneously detect up to 20 viruses and up to four bacteria within a few hours have been marketed. However, are these platforms actually useful in pediatric clinical practice? In this manuscript, we showed that these platforms appear to be particularly important for epidemiological studies and clinical research. On the contrary, their routine use in pediatric clinical practice remains debatable. They can be used only in the hospital as they require specific equipment and laboratory technicians with considerable knowledge, training, and experience. Moreover, despite more sensitive and specific than other tests routinely used for respiratory pathogen identification, they do not offer significantly advantage for detection of the true etiology of a respiratory disease. Furthermore, knowledge of which virus is the cause of a respiratory disease is not useful from a therapeutic point of view unless influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus are the infecting agents as effective drugs are available only for these pathogens. On the other hand, multiplex platforms can be justified in the presence of severe clinical manifestations, and in immunocompromised patients for whom specific treatment option can be available, particularly when they can be used simultaneously with platforms that allow identification of antimicrobial resistance to commonly used drugs. It is highly likely that these platforms, particularly those with high sensitivity and specificity and with low turnaround time, will become essential when new drugs effective and safe against most of the respiratory viruses will be available. Further studies on how to differentiate carriers from patients with true disease, as well as studies on the implications of coinfections and identification of antimicrobial resistance, are warranted.","output":"Multiplex Platforms for the Identification of Respiratory Pathogens: Are They Useful in Pediatric Clinical Practice?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is currently one of the main causes of death worldwide.

A large number of patients with severe COVID-19 face death in hospital. Hospice care is truly a philosophy of care that delivers patient-centred care to the terminally ill and their families. Hospice care could provide many benefits for patients, families, and for hospice caregivers. The aim of this study is to investigate hospice care self-efficacy and identify its predictors among Chinese clinical medical staff in COVID-19 isolation wards of designated hospitals. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used. The Hospice Care Self-Efficacy, Self-Competence in Death Work Scale, Positive Aspects of Caregiving, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaires were administered between February and April 2020. A total of 281 eligible medical staff responded to the questionnaires, with a response rate of &#8805;78.9%. RESULTS: The mean score of hospice care self-efficacy was 47.04 (SD = 7.72). Self-efficacy was predicted by self-competence in death work (B = 0.433, P < 0.001), positive aspects of caregiving (B = 0.149, P = 0.027), positive coping (B = 0.219, P < 0.001), giving hospice care to dying or dead patients before fighting against COVID-19 (B = -1.487, P = 0.023), occupational exposure while fighting against COVID-19 (B = -5.244, P = 0.004), holding respect for life and professional sentiment as motivation in fighting against COVID-19 (B = 2.372, P = 0.031), and grade of hospital employment (B = -1.426, P = 0.024). The variables co-explained 58.7% variation of hospice care self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Clinical nurses and physicians fighting COVID-19 reported a moderate level of hospice care self-efficacy during this pandemic. Exploring the traditional Chinese philosophy of life to learn from its strengths and make up for its weaknesses and applying it to hospice care may provide a new framework for facing death and dying during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continuous hospice care education to improve self-competence in death work, taking effective measures to mobilize positive psychological resources, and providing safer practice environments to avoid occupational exposure are also essential for the improvement of the hospice care self-efficacy of clinical nurses and physicians. These measures help caregivers deal effectively with death and dying while fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Hospice care self-efficacy among clinical medical staff working in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) isolation wards of designated hospitals: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19-associated mortality in patients who require mechanical ventilation is unknown in the Mexican population.

We included randomised controlled trials with non-hospitalised, non-quarantined participants of interventions to address COVID-19 mental health challenges. We synthesized results descriptively but did not pool quantitatively due to substantial heterogeneity of populations and interventions and concerns about risk of bias. Findings: We identified 9 eligible trials, including 3 well-conducted, well-reported trials that tested interventions designed specifically for COVID-19 mental health challenges, plus 6 trials of standard interventions (e.g., individual or group therapy, expressive writing, mindfulness recordings) minimally adapted for COVID-19, all with risk of bias concerns.

METHODS: Information on hunting and fauna use was obtained through semi-structured interviews, complemented with free interviews and informal conversations. The cultural importance of the species was calculated through the current use value. The generalized linear model was created to verify whether the sociodemographic profile of hunters influences the knowledge and use of game species.

This is the first study to focus on highly time-resolved chemical speciation and source apportionment of PM2.5 to assess the impact of the lockdown and subsequent relaxations on the sources of ambient PM2.5 in Delhi, India. The elemental, organic, and black carbon fractions of PM2.5 were measured at the IIT Delhi campus from February 2020 to May 2020. We report source apportionment results using positive matrix factorization (PMF) of organic and elemental fractions of PM2.5 during the different phases of the lockdown. The resolved sources such as vehicular emissions, domestic coal combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) were found to decrease by 96%, 95%, and 86%, respectively, during lockdown phase-1 as compared to pre-lockdown. An unforeseen rise in O3 concentrations with declining NOx levels was observed, similar to other parts of the globe, leading to the low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) increasing to almost double the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the lockdown. The effect of the lockdown was found to be less pronounced on other resolved sources like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions, which were also swayed by the changing meteorological conditions during the four lockdown phases. The results presented in this study provide a basis for future emission control strategies, quantifying the extent to which constraining certain anthropogenic activities can ameliorate the ambient air. These results have direct relevance to not only Delhi but the entire Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP), citing similar geographical and meteorological conditions common to the region along with overlapping regional emission sources. SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS: We identify sources like vehicular emissions, domestic coal combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) to be severely impacted by the lockdown, whereas ozone levels and, in turn, low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) rise by more than 95% compared to the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the lockdown. However, other sources resolved in this study, like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions, were mainly driven by the changes in the meteorological conditions rather than the lockdown.","output":"Variation in chemical composition and sources of PM2.5 during the COVID-19 lockdown in Delhi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the dynamic changes of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the role of KL-6 as a noninvasive biomarker for predicting long-term lung injury, the clinical information and laboratory tests of 166 COVID-19 patients were collected, and a correlation analysis between KL-6 and other parameters was conducted.

We aim to identify the prevalence and nuances of reported burnout in general surgery resident physicians to better understand which factors contribute the greatest risk. METHODS: A 42-question anonymous online survey was distributed by the Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) to general surgery resident physicians. ANOVA, chi-square and multinomial regression analyses were performed with significance defined as p < 0.05. This survey was reported in line with the STOCSS criteria. RESULTS: 81 survey responses were received. Burnout was reported by 89.5% of university-hospital affiliated respondents and 95.2% of community teaching hospital affiliated respondents. After adjustment, community respondents showed a nearly fifteen times greater likelihood of burnout (aOR = 14.735, 95% CI: 0.791,274.482). Females were 2.7 times as likely as males to report burnout (aOR = 2.749, 95% CI: 0.189,39.960) and nearly twice as likely to report contemplating suicide (aOR = 1.819, 95% CI: 0.380,8.715). Burnout rates by hours worked/week revealed that 100% of those working 80 h/week report experiencing burnout. CONCLUSION: Overall burnout rates reported by surgical residents respondents were high.

Fluoroscopy was the most prevalent spine surgery navigation technique (96.5 %), followed by freehand (55.8 %), stereotactic without intraoperative CT scan (31.9 %), robotic with intraoperative CT scan (29.2 %), stereotactic with intraoperative CT scan (8.8 %), and robotic without intraoperative CT scan (6.2 %). Cost of equipment (94.7 %), lack of trained staff to service (63.7 %), or run the equipment (60.2 %) were the most common barriers to the availability of spine instrumentation navigation. In addition, there were significant regional differences in access to trained staff to run and service the equipment (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: There is a need to increase access to more advanced navigation techniques, and we identified the determinants of availability.","output":"Prevalence of spine surgery navigation techniques and availability in Africa: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Other than its direct impact on cardiopulmonary health, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection affects additional body systems, especially in older adults. Several studies have reported acute neurological symptoms that present at onset or develop during hospitalisation, with associated neural injuries. Whilst the acute neurological phase is widely documented, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on neurocognitive functioning remain unknown. Although an evidence-based framework describing the disease chronic phase is premature, it is important to lay the foundations for future data-driven models.

New pathogens in wastewater are constantly emerging. For example, SARS-CoV-2 has been recently detected in domestic sewage and primary sludge. Knowledge about the reduction of viruses in wastewater treatment and their partitioning between the treated liquid effluent versus the sludge or biosolids is still very scarce, especially in countries with emerging economies and tropical climates. Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors are among the top three most commonly used technologies for the treatment of sewage in Latin America and the Caribbean, and their use has become increasingly common in many other low- and middle-income countries. High-rate algal ponds (HRAP) are regarded as a sustainable technology for the post-treatment of UASB effluent. This study evaluated the overall reduction and the liquid-solid partitioning of somatic coliphages, F-specific coliphages, and E. coli in a pilot-scale system comprised of a UASB reactor followed by HRAPs treating real wastewater. Average log removal for somatic and F-specific coliphages were 0.40 and 0.56 for the UASB reactor, and 1.15 and 1.70 for HRAPs, respectively. The overall removal of both phages in the system was 2.06-log. Removal of E. coli was consistently higher. The number of viruses leaving the system in the UASB solids and algal biomass was less than 10% of the number leaving in the clarified liquid effluent. The number of E. coli leaving the system in solids residuals was estimated to be approximately one order of magnitude higher than the number of E. coli leaving in the liquid effluent. Results from this study demonstrate the suitability of UASB-HRAP systems to reduce viral and bacterial indicators from domestic sewage and the importance of adequately treating sludge for pathogen reduction before they are used as biosolids.","output":"Reduction and partitioning of viral and bacterial indicators in a UASB reactor followed by high rate algal ponds treating domestic sewage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease COVID-19 has spread worldwide extremely rapidly. Although many individuals have been infected and have cleared the virus, developing virus-specific antibodies and effector/memory T cells, an important question still to be answered is what levels of T cell and antibody responses are sufficient to protect from the infection. Methods: In 5,340 Moscow residents, we evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG titers and the frequencies of the T cells specific to the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, using IFNy; ELISpot, and we also evaluated the fractions of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using intracellular staining of IFNy; and IL2 followed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we analyzed the post-inclusion COVID-19 rates as a function of the assessed antibody and T cell responses using the Kaplan-Meyer estimator method. Results: We showed that T cell and antibody responses are closely interconnected and commonly are induced concurrently. Individuals positive for both antibody and T cell immunities demonstrated the highest levels of protectivity against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, indistinguishably from individuals with antibody response only. Meanwhile, individuals with T cell response only demonstrated slightly higher protectivity than individuals without both types of immunity, as measured from N-protein-specific or CD4+IL2+ T cells. However, these individuals were characterized by higher IgG titers than individuals without any immunity, although the titers were below the seropositivity cut-off. Conclusions: The results of the study indicated the advantage of serology testing over the analysis of T cell responses for the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates on a populational level.","output":"A prospective study of the protective effect of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and T cells in Moscow residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Topic models are widely used in studying social phenomena.

The trapezius and serratus anterior (SA) muscles are the main stabilizers and are therefore the main target muscles of therapeutic exercises. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the current literature investigating the optimal activation ratio of the scapular muscles during a range of closed kinetic chain exercises. METHODS A systematic review search was conducted to identify studies reporting shoulder electromyography (EMG) activity during rehabilitation exercises in healthy participants. The search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and ScienceDirect. The included studies reported closed kinetic chain exercises and the muscle activity as a percentage of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) or muscle ratios of the lower trapezius (LT), middle trapezius (MT), and SA with respect to the upper trapezius (UT). Muscle ratios were classified as optimal if they were equal to or lower than 0.6, and the adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the selected studies. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies were included in this review; 7 main exercises and 30 variations of these were reported. The average electromyographic activity of the concentric and eccentric phase was considered. Half Push Up, Push Up Plus, and Scap Protraction exercises showed optimal SA activity (UT/SA < 0.6), while Press Up, Half Push Up, and One Hand Plank exercises showed optimal LT activity (UT/LT < 0.6). According to the NOS, 15 studies were classified as moderate methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS The exercises in higher positions (e.g. exercises with the trunk closest to the vertical line) or unstable surfaces tend to favor UT activity over the MT, LT and SA. The exercises including scapular retraction showed optimal UT/MT and UT/LT ratios, while those including scapular protraction showed optimal UT/SA ratios. This will assist therapists in the correct selection of exercises for shoulder rehabilitation.","output":"Optimal activation ratio of the scapular muscles in closed kinetic chain shoulder exercises: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute renal injury (AKI) causes a long-term risk for progressing into chronic kidney disease (CKD) and interstitial fibrosis. Yes-associated protein (YAP), a key transcriptional cofactor in Hippo signaling pathway, shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, which is required for the renal tubular epithelial cells repair in the acute phase of AKI. In this study we investigated the role of YAP during ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI to CKD. Mice were subjected to left kidney IR followed by removal of the right kidney on the day before tissue harvests. Mouse shRNA expression adenovirus (Ad-shYAP or Ad-shKLF4) and mouse KLF4 expression adenovirus (Ad-KLF4) were delivered to mice by intrarenal injection on D7 after IR. We showed that the expression and nucleus distribution of YAP were persistently increased until the end of experiment (D21 after IR). The sustained activation of YAP in post-acute phase of AKI was accompanied by renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis. Knockdown of YAP significantly attenuated IR-induced renal dysfunction and decreased the expression of fibrogenic factors TGF-? and CTGF in the kidney. We showed that the expression of the transcription factor KLF4, lined on the upstream of YAP, was also persistently increased. Knockdown on KLF4 attenuated YAP increase and nuclear translocation as well as renal functional deterioration and interstitial fibrosis in IR mice, whereas KLF4 overexpression caused opposite effects. KLF4 increased the expression of ITCH, and ITCH facilitated YAP nuclear translocation via degrading LATS1. Furthermore, we demonstrated in primary cultured renal tubular cells that KLF4 bound to the promoter region of YAP and positively regulates YAP expression. In biopsy sample from CKD patients, we also observed increased expression and nuclear distribution of YAP. In conclusion, the activation of YAP in the post-acute phase of AKI is implicated in renal functional deterioration and fibrosis although it exhibits beneficial effect in acute phase. Reprogramming factor KLF4 is responsible for the persistent activation of YAP. Blocking the activation of KLF4-YAP pathway might be a way to prevent the transition of AKI into CKD.","output":"KLF4 initiates sustained YAP activation to promote renal fibrosis in mice after ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dispersion of aerosols was studied experimentally in several concert halls to evaluate their airborne route and thus the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreading.

As such action is designed to be disruptive, it creates substantial ethical tension, the most cited of which relates to patient harm, that is, a strike may not only disrupt an employer, but it could also have serious implications for the delivery of care. This article systematically reviewed the literature on strike action in healthcare with the aim of providing an overview of the major justifications for strike action, identifying relative strengths and shortcomings of this literature and providing direction for future discussions, and theoretical and empirical research. Three major themes emerged related to (1) the relationship between healthcare workers, patients and society; (2) the consequences of strike action; and (3) the conduct of strike action. Those who argue against strike action generally cite the harms of such action, particularly as it relates to patients. Many also argue that healthcare workers, because of their skills and position in society, have a special obligation to their patients and society more generally. Those who see this action as not only permissible but also, in some cases, necessary have advanced several points in response, arguing that healthcare workers do not necessarily have any special obligation to their patients or society, and even if so, this obligation is not absolute. Overwhelmingly, when talking about the potential risks of strike action, authors have focused on patient welfare and the impact that a strike could have. Several directions for future work are identified, including greater explorations into how structural and systemic issues impact strike action, the need for greater consideration about the contextual factors that influence the risks and characteristics of strike action and finally the need to tie this literature to existing empirical evidence.","output":"The justification for strike action in healthcare: A systematic critical interpretive synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the fast global spread of the disease resulted in unprecedented decline in world trade and travel.

Sensitivity of 47%, 80% and 88% and specificity of 100%, 98% and 98% in detection of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies, respectively, were observed. IgG antibody levels against the RBD were demonstrated to be up regulated between 1-7 days after COVID-19 detection, earlier than both IgM and IgA antibodies. Study of the antibody kinetics of seven COVID 19 patients revealed that while IgG levels are high and maintained for at least 3 months, IgM and IgA levels decline after a 35-50 days following infection. Altogether, these results highlight the usefulness of the RBD based ELISA, which is both easy and cheap to prepare, to identify COVID-19 patients even at the acute phase.

We give SPCF a sampling-style operational semantics  la Borgstr?m et al., and study the associated weight (commonly referred to as the density) function and value function on the set of possible execution traces. Our main result is that almost surely terminating SPCF programs, generated from a set of primitive functions (e.g. the set of analytic functions) satisfying mild closure properties, have weight and value functions that are almost everywhere differentiable. We use a stochastic form of symbolic execution to reason about almost everywhere differentiability. A by-product of this work is that almost surely terminating deterministic (S)PCF programs with real parameters denote functions that are almost everywhere differentiable. Our result is of practical interest, as almost everywhere differentiability of the density function is required to hold for the correctness of major gradient-based inference algorithms.","output":"Densities of Almost Surely Terminating Probabilistic Programs are Differentiable Almost Everywhere"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV2 has now spread globally. Replication/transcription machinery of this virus consists of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12 or RdRp) and its two cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 proteins. Hence, RdRp has emerged as a promising target to control COVID-19. In the present study, we are reporting a novel inhibitor VTRM1.1 against the RdRp protein of SARS CoV2. A series of antivirals were tested for binding to the catalytic residues of the active site of RdRp protein. In-silico screening, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis suggest ribavirin, and remdesivir have good interaction with the binding site of the RdRp protein as compared to other antiviral investigated. Hence, ribavirin and remdesivir were used for the denovo fragments based antiviral design. This design, along with docking and MDS analysis, identified a novel inhibitor VTRM1 that has better interaction with RdRp as compared to their parent molecules. Further, to produce a lead-like compound, retrosynthetic analysis, and combinatorial synthesis were performed, which produces 1000 analogs of VTRM1. These analogs were analysed by docking and MDS analysis that identified VTRM1.1 as a possible lead to inhibit RdRp protein. This lead has a good docking score, favourable binding energy and bind at catalytic residues of the active site of RdRp. The VTRM1.1 also interacts with RdRp in the presence of RNA primer and other cofactors. It was also seen that, VTRM1.1 do not have off-target in human.

This study explores the communication-related experiences of healthcare professionals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 7 chairman of healthcare facilities, 19 general practitioners, and 15 specialists were conducted from September to December 2020. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis revealed five themes related to internal communication among health care providers. The study was a component of the National research programme VPP-COVID-2020/1-0011. RESULTS: The 1st theme, Initial chaos paralyzing the system', illustrated the disorderly format of delivering the information that created confusion and anxiety. The 2nd theme, Overwhelming amount of information', revealed the challenge to process new information received daily and from various sources. The 3rd theme, Decentralized decision-making' highlighted the lack of clearly communicated algorithms for specific patients' groups, leaving the decision-making to the health care providers. The 4th theme, Collegial support of the peers, emerged as a crucial coping mechanism and information channel, substituting for the lack of official information. The 5th theme, Opportunity for growth', consolidated suggestions from health care professionals for improving internal communication in future. CONCLUSIONS: Internal communication as experienced among healthcare professionals was overwhelming and insufficient at the same time. It created an environment promoting closer collaboration among different specialists and suggestions for necessary improvements.

Our goal was to restore normal ciliary beating in DNAI1Cdeficient human airway epithelial cells. A lentiviral vector based on Simian Immunodeficiency Virus pseudotyped with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Glycoprotein was used to transduce cultured human airway epithelial cells with a cDNA of DNAI1 driven by the Elongation Factor 1 promoter. Transcription and translation of the transduced gene were tested by RTCPCR and western blot, respectively. Human airway epithelial cells that were DNAI1Cdeficient due to compound heterozygous mutations, and consequently had immotile cilia and no outer dynein arm, were transduced by the lentivirus. Cilia beating was recorded and electron microscopy of the cilia was performed. Transcription and translation of the transduced DNAI1 gene were detected in human cells treated with the lentivirus. In addition, immotile cilia recovered a normal beat and outer dynein arms reappeared.

As the persistent air leak can be a significant barrier to vent-weaning and clinical stability, these patients present a unique clinical challenge. Clinical case A 65-year-old male intubated and on prolonged mechanical ventilation for severe COVID-19 Pneumonia developed a pneumothorax complicated by a persistent alveolar-pleural fistula with a persistent air-leak. Given his critical state with ongoing pressor requirements and elevated vent requirements, surgical repair was not an option. A bedside bronchoscopy occlusion study with isolation of the air leak, and subsequent autologous endobronchial blood-patch repair with thrombin was performed with rapid and definitive resolution of the air leak. The patient progressed favorably, ultimately being weaned from the ventilator, decannulated, and walking out of the hospital. Conclusion In critically ill ventilated patients with pneumothorax complicated by a persistent air-leak, bedside endobronchial evaluation and blood-patch repair is a feasible approach to management.","output":"Endobronchial blood-patch: A novel technique for a persistent pleural air leak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to reduce transmission of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. Methods: We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission with data from January - June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in Rt, levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. Results: There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced Rt. Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g., restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on <10 people gathering was). Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Conclusion: Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications taking into account these effects, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many although not all the actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission across 130 countries and territories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammatory processes play a key role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia owing to their effects on the balance between muscle protein breakdown and synthesis. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endocannabinoid-like molecule, has been well documented for its anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting its possible beneficial use to counteract sarcopenia. The promising therapeutic effects of PEA are, however, impaired by its poor bioavailability. In order to overcome this limitation, the present study focused on the encapsulation of PEA in solid lipid nanoparticles (PEA-SLNs) in a perspective of a systemic administration. PEA-SLNs were characterized for their physico-chemical properties as well as cytotoxicity and cell internalization capacity on C2C12 myoblast cells. Their size was approximately 250 nm and the encapsulation efficiency reached 90%. Differential scanning calorimetry analyses demonstrated the amorphous state of PEA in the inner SLN matrix, which improved PEA dissolution, as observed in the in vitro assays. Despite the high internalization capacity observed with the flow cytometer (values between 85 and 94% after 14 h of incubation), the Nile Red labeled PEA-SLNs showed practically no toxicity towards myoblasts. Confocal analysis showed the presence of SLNs in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus. These results suggest the potentiality provided by PEA-SLNs to obtain an innovative and side-effect-free tool in the medical treatment of sarcopenia.","output":"Design, Characterization, and In Vitro Assays on Muscle Cells of Endocannabinoid-like Molecule Loaded Lipid Nanoparticles for a Therapeutic Anti-Inflammatory Approach to Sarcopenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recently emerged coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has become a worldwide threat affecting millions of people, causing respiratory system related problems that can end up with extremely serious consequences. As the infection rate rises significantly and this is followed by a dramatic increase in mortality, the whole world is struggling to accommodate change and is trying to adapt to new conditions. While a significant amount of effort is focused on developing a vaccine in order to make a game-changing anti-COVID-19 breakthrough, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is also developing mutations rapidly as it transmits just like any other virus and there is always a substantial chance of the invented antibodies becoming ineffective as a function of time, thus failing to inhibit virus-to-cell binding efficiency as the spiked protein keeps evolving. Hence, controlling the transmission of the virus is crucial. Therefore, this review summarizes the viability of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces under different conditions while addressing the current state of known chemical disinfectants for deactivation of the coronaviruses.

Research in this field in Jordan is not available. The main objective of this study was to identify the most important needs as perceived by these family members in the light of this stressful event and compare them with the nurses' perceptions of the importance of these needs and also to determine the perception of the needs' importance with the sociodemographic characteristics of both family members and caring nurses. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the period between February and August 2020 among adult family members of patients admitted to the CCUs in hospitals of Jordan from all sectors (public, private, and teaching). The Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI) questionnaire was administered to 82 family members and 99 CCU nurses to determine the importance of the needs on the inventory. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The most important need identified by the family members was relevant to the need for proximity (3.64  0.45), followed by information (3.57  0.58), assurance (3.44  0.43), support (3.31  0.62), and comfort (3.21  0.56). Nurses identified the needs for assurance as the highest, followed by information, comfort, and support, whereas proximity was the least need perceived as very important. The top 10 important needs for both family members and nurses were identified. Family members and nurses were only common in 2 of the need statements on the scale. There was no significant association between the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample and the perception of the needs' importance (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: This study has shown that nurses and family members of patients admitted to CCUs have different perspectives relevant to needs' importance. This should warn nurses to set the needs viewed by family members as a priority. Implications. In the CCU settings, in the context of advancing health informatics, families of patients in the ICUs have different needs other than those viewed by nurses.

The COVID-19 virus symptoms can include coughing, fatigue, fever for those with mild cases. For more severe cases, it can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and eventually death. Due to its infectious nature, people started taking health precautions that were advised by the World Health Organization such as social distancing, washing hands, and sanitizing surfaces. Due to this pandemic, the aim of this project is to automate mundane tasks with the help of a service robot to reduce physical contact as well as reduce the workload on healthcare workers. Tasks such as delivering food, medication, water, and other necessities to patients with infectious diseases. In addition, this project specifically reduces physical contact between patients and the attending nurse. A service robot is a robot that is built to perform a repetitive or dangerous task in order to assist humans. A service robot executes repetitive tasks more efficiently compared to a person who is prone to lose focus and make mistakes during work hours. The service robot performs tasks that are requested by the patients and accepted by the nurse through the mobile application. The application shows both the nurse and the patients the position of the robot and the task it is performing. The project's design was based on a small robot car that receives a path from the server upon a request using a mobile app. On top of that, the project includes a functional mobile application, a RESTful API, a no-SQL database, and a python microservice that is responsible for path planning. The path planning algorithm used is the A? algorithm for finding the shortest path to the destination. The service robot avoids obstacles by first stopping after detecting the obstacle, label the coordinates of that location as obstacle, rotates 180 degrees, moves to the previous location, and then requests the path again. The constant communication between the robot and the server allows the server to track the robot's movement. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Service robots in hospitals to reduce spreading of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, has a large RNA genome that encodes numerous proteins that might be targets for antiviral drugs.

METHODS AND RESULTS: At five centres, after a run-in period, eligible individuals treated with TAVR were randomized 1:1 at their 1-month post-TAVR visit to an intervention group [activity monitor (AM) with personalized daily step goal and resistance exercises] or a control group for 6 weeks. Among 50 participants, average age was 76 years, 34% were female, average STS score was 2.91.8, and 40% had Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) 9. Daily compliance with wearing the AM and performing exercises averaged 8590%. In the intention to treat population, there was no evidence that the intervention improved the co-primary endpoints: daily steps +769 (95% CI 244 to +1783); SPPB +0.68 (0.27 to 1.53); and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 1.7 (9.1 to 7.1). The intervention did improve secondary physical activity parameters, including moderate-to-intense daily active minutes (P<0.05).

Papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS CoV-2 plays important roles in virus maturation, dysregulation of host inflammation, and antiviral immune responses, which is being regarded as a promising druggable target for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we carried out a combined screening approach to identify novel and highly potent PLpro inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: We used a combined screening approach of structure-based pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking to screen an in-house database containing 35,000 compounds. SARS CoV-2 PLpro inhibition assay was used to carry out the biological evaluation of hit compounds. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to check the stability of the PLpro-hit complexes predicted by molecular docking. Results: We found that four hit compounds showed excellent inhibitory activities against PLpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.6 to 2.4 M. Among them, the most promising compound, hit 2 is the best PLpro inhibitor and its inhibitory activity was about 4 times higher than that of the positive control (GRL0617). The study of MD simulations indicated that four hits could bind stably to the active site of PLpro. Further study of interaction analysis indicated that hit 2 could form hydrogen-bond interactions with the key amino acids such as Gln269 and Asp164 in the PLpro-active site.

Some patients with severe Covid-19 experience a cytokine storm and display evidence of inflammasome activation leading to increased levels of IL-1 and IL-18; however, other reports have suggested reduced inflammatory responses to Sars-Cov-2. In this study we have examined the effects of the Sars-Cov-2 envelope (E) protein, a virulence factor in coronaviruses, on inflammasome activation and pulmonary inflammation. In cultured macrophages the E protein suppressed inflammasome priming and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Similarly, in mice transfected with E protein and treated with poly(I:C) to simulate the effects of viral RNA, the E protein, in an NLRP3-dependent fashion, reduced expression of pro-IL-1, levels of IL-1 and IL-18 in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, and macrophage infiltration in the lung. To simulate the effects of more advanced infection, macrophages were treated with both LPS and poly(I:C). In this setting the E protein increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both murine and human macrophages. Thus, the Sars-Cov-2 E protein may initially suppress the host NLRP3 inflammasome response to viral RNA while potentially increasing NLRP3 inflammasome responses in the later stages of infection. Targeting the Sars-Cov-2 E protein especially in the early stages of infection may represent a novel approach to Covid-19 therapy.","output":"Modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by Sars-CoV-2 Envelope protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 affected business in Pakistan and micro-entrepreneurs started struggling.

By screening a library of natural products, we find that GSE, and PCC1 as one of its active components, have specific effects on senescent cells. At low concentrations, PCC1 appears to inhibit SASP formation, whereas it selectively kills senescent cells at higher concentrations, possibly by promoting production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction. In rodent models, PCC1 depletes senescent cells in a treatment-damaged tumour microenvironment and enhances therapeutic efficacy when co-administered with chemotherapy. Intermittent administration of PCC1 to either irradiated, senescent cell-implanted or naturally aged old mice alleviates physical dysfunction and prolongs survival.

Adolescent male Wistar rats were infused with lipopolysaccharide followed by transfusion of incompatible erythrocytes in the presence or absence of RLS-0071. Blood was collected at various time points to assess complement C5a levels, free DNA and cytokines in isolated plasma. Four hours following erythrocyte transfusion, lung tissue was recovered and assayed for ALI by histology. Compared to animals not receiving RLS-0071, lungs of animals treated with a single dose of RLS-0071 showed significant reduction in ALI as well as reduced levels of C5a, free DNA and inflammatory cytokines in the blood. These results demonstrate that RLS-0071 can modulate neutrophil-mediated ALI in this novel rat model.","output":"Peptide inhibition of acute lung injury in a novel two-hit rat model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Social distancing requirements during COVID-19 pose a challenge to conducting traditional academic detailing, which typically involves in-person peer education visits to improve patient outcomes. The main alternative is to conduct virtual academic detailing delivered through web-based technology, but this approach is fraught with many challenges. This study aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a virtual academic detailing program implemented among health care providers. METHODS: The academic detailing program focused on appropriate opioid prescribing and chronic non-cancer pain management among a sample of providers. An initial in-person visit was followed by a virtual visit up to 8 weeks later. Videoconferencing was used to conduct the virtual visit with telephone as a backup. Feasibility was assessed whether the virtual visits could happen, and acceptability was assessed by provider satisfaction. Validated measures of Provider Satisfaction with Academic Detailing (PSAD) and Detailer Assessment of Visit Effectiveness (DAVE) with a 5-point Likert-type scale were used. Higher scores corresponded to higher satisfaction and greater perceived effectiveness. Non-parametric and parametric statistical tests were used to compare instrument summary scores across visits and between groups. Pairwise analyses across visits only included instrument responses for providers who participated in both visits and completed both surveys in their entirety. RESULTS: There were 127 (90 %) initial in-person visits completed out of 141 visits scheduled, with a survey response rate of 96 %. Out of 120 virtual follow-up visits scheduled, 92 (77 %) were conducted, and 56 surveys (61 %) were collected. There was a high level of satisfaction with the initial and follow up virtual academic detailing visits, though, among providers who participated in both visits and had completed surveys (n = 50), initial visits had slightly higher scores (mean difference = -2.94 [95 % Confidence intervals: -4.38, -1.50], p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in detailer perception across the two visits as seen in the scale summary score (0.05 [-0.56, 0.66], p = 0.86) and two individually reported items related to feasibility (0.07 [-0.29, 0.42], p = 0.72) and conversation (-0.05 [-0.28, 0.17], p = 0.63). Forty-one (44.6 %) virtual visits were conducted using WebEx, where video and screen sharing of visit content was possible, while the remaining 51 (55.4 %) were conducted using a telephone. There was no significant difference in provider satisfaction between WebEx vs. telephone visits (-1.47 [-4.99, 2.05], p = 0.82). Provider satisfaction was also not impacted by any technical difficulties as reported by the detailer (-0.04 [-3.30, 3.38], p = 0.98). CONCLUSION: The results slightly favor in-person visits and suggest that virtual detailing visits need to incorporate strategies that minimize technical difficulties and prevent participants from defaulting to less favorable technology. Future research opportunities include evaluating the effectiveness of a virtual versus in-person delivery of AD program on outcomes such as providers' opioid prescribing behavior.","output":"Feasibility and acceptability of virtual academic detailing on opioid prescribing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims COVID-19 can spread rapidly in psychiatric inpatient settings. Previous studies have found that patients have a higher risk of hospitalisation and death than adults in the community. The aim of this project was to improve the care of patients with COVID-19 in psychiatric inpatient settings. Method A baseline audit was conducted of care COVID-19 patients received in wards that experienced outbreaks in January 2021 in a London Mental Health Trust. Clinical notes were reviewed for management plans, including clear documentation of risk of serious illness, frequency of vitals monitoring, and thresholds for escalation to medical teams. A new protocol was subsequently developed and implemented at one inpatient unit: COVID-19: Early Identification of Risk and Management. This included an adjusted 4C mortality score to determine risk of deterioration, and schedules for observation monitoring based on this outcome. Each schedule specified separate frequencies of monitoring of critical observations (oxygen saturations, respiratory rate) and routine observations, thus minimising unnecessary staff exposure. It prompted venous thromboembolism (VTE) assessment and documentation of escalation criteria. Result 44 patients were identified across three working age (WAA, n = 29) and two older age (OA, n = 15) adult wards. 7.5% of WAA and 33.3% of OA patients were hospitalised. 20% of OA patients died following a positive test. 58% of patients had a documented management plan for COVID-19, but only 56% mentioned observation frequency, 19% escalation criteria, and 9% risk of serious disease. No patient received a repeat VTE assessment following diagnosis. The audit identified inconsistent approaches to COVID-19 management between wards, and found no relationship between risk of deterioration and frequency of observation monitoring. Following implementation of this protocol, 100% (n = 4) of patients had a robust plan for COVID-19 management, and 100% received a VTE assessment. Conclusion The audit supported previous findings that psychiatric inpatients are at risk of serious COVID-19 infection. This highlights an urgent clinical and ethical need to optimise COVID-19 care in psychiatric inpatient settings. The results of this audit suggest that risk factors for severe infection and elements of routine care are not widely understood or implemented by clinical staff. Introducing evidence-based protocols to support clinicians in managing the physical healthcare of these patients may be one way of promoting best practice. The improvement in care observed in the pilot study has resulted in this protocol being rolled out across the Trust in an ongoing quality improvement project.","output":"Improving the physical healthcare of COVID-19 patients in inpatient psychiatric settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had a huge impact on health services with a high mortality associated with complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Historical evidence suggests that Lupus patients have a higher incidence of several viral infections. This is likely due to a combination of immune dysfunction, immunosuppressive therapy and excess co-morbidities. In this context there has been concern that Lupus patients may be at a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and suffering a severe disease course. As a result, many Lupus patients have been advised to 'shield' by isolating from social contact in the hope that this will reduce the likelihood of infection. Early clinical data does not appear to show that the incidence of COVID-19 is higher in Lupus patients. Reassuringly, the clinical course of COVID-19 in Lupus does not generally seem to be more severe than in the general population. There has been huge interest in repurposing existing drugs as potential treatments, including several used to treat Lupus. Of these, corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine are the most well researched so far. The current evidence suggests that the corticosteroid dexamethasone improves outcome for the sickest COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory support. Initial reports suggested that hydroxychloroquine could have a positive impact on the course of COVID-19, however larger prospective studies have not supported this. Janus kinase inhibitors, currently being investigated for efficacy in lupus, have been shown to have anti-viral effects in vitro and inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway may dampen down the host hyper-inflammatory response. Several trials are ongoing to assess the outcome of the use of JAK inhibitors in COVID-19 positive patients.

The literature on diaphragm function assessment during the weaning process in the intriguing subpopulation of critically ill neuromuscular disease patients is lacking. METHODS: Patients with neuromuscular diseases, on mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days, and who were ready for weaning were studied. During multiple T-piece trials over days, diaphragm function using ultrasound and diaphragm electrical activity (Edi peaks using NAVA catheter) was measured every 30 min till a successful 2 h weaning. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients were screened for eligibility over 5-month period and eight patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Sixty-three data points in these 8 subjects were available for analysis. A successful breathing trial was predicted by Edi reduction (1.22 V for every 30 min increase in weaning duration; 0.69 V for every day of weaning) and increase in diaphragm excursion (2.81 mm for every 30 min increase in weaning duration; 2.18 mm for every day of weaning). CONCLUSION: The Edi and diaphragm excursion changes can be used as additional objective tools in the decision-making of the weaning trials in neuromuscular disease.

Although many studies have examined events' impact on features or behaviors, few studies have examined how events impact aggregate emotions and how these effects may unfold over time. Applying a state-of-the-art deep learning technique (i.e., the fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT] algorithm), the current study extracted the public's daily emotion associated with working from home (WFH) at the U.S. state level over four months (March 01, 2020-July 01, 2020) from 1.56 million tweets. We then applied discontinuous growth modeling (DGM) to investigate how COVID-19 and resultant stay-at-home orders changed the trajectories of the public's emotions associated with WFH. Our results indicated that stay-at-home orders demonstrated both immediate (i.e., intercept change) and longitudinal (i.e., slope change) effects on the public's emotion trajectories.

METHODS: We draw upon current events, academic literature, and numerous data sources to illustrate how biopsychosocial factors place older adults at higher risk for COVID-19 relative to younger adults, and how structural racism magnifies these risks for older Black and Latinx adults. RESULTS: We identify three proximate mechanisms through which structural racism operates as a fundamental cause of racial/ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 burden among older adults: (1) Risk of exposure; (2) Weathering processes; and (3) Health care access and quality. DISCUSSION: While the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis, the racial/ethnic health inequalities among older adults it has exposed are long-standing and deeply rooted in structural racism within American society. This knowledge presents both challenges and opportunities for researchers and policymakers as they seek to address the needs of older adults. It is imperative that federal, state, and local governments collect and release comprehensive data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths by race/ethnicity and age to better gauge the impact of outbreak across minority communities.

These complications include loss of sense of taste and smell, stroke, delirium, and neuromuscular signs and symptoms. The etiological agent of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), an RNA virus with a glycoprotein-studded viral envelope that uses ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) as a functional receptor for infecting the host cells. Thus, the interaction of the envelope spike proteins with ACE2 on host cells determines the tropism and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. Loss of sense of taste and smell is an initial symptom of COVID-19 because the virus enters the nasal and oral cavities first and the epithelial cells are the receptors for these senses. Stroke in COVID-19 patients is likely a consequence of coagulopathy and injury to cerebral vascular endothelial cells that cause thrombo-embolism and stroke. Delirium and encephalopathy in acute and post COVID-19 patients are likely multifactorial and secondary to hypoxia, metabolic abnormalities, and immunological abnormalities.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is high; as a result, countries worldwide have imposed rigorous public health measures, such as quarantine. This has involved the suspension of medical school classes globally. Medical school attachments are vital to aid the progression of students' confidence and competencies as future physicians. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, medical schools have sought ways to replace medical placements with virtual clinical teaching. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the advantages and disadvantages of virtual medical teaching for medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the current emerging literature. METHODS: A brief qualitative review based on the application and effectiveness of virtual teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted by referencing keywords, including medical student virtual teaching COVID-19, virtual undergraduate medical education, and virtual medical education COVID-19, in the electronic databases of PubMed and Google Scholar. A total of 201 articles were found, of which 34 were included in the study. Manual searches of the reference lists of the included articles yielded 5 additional articles. The findings were tabulated and assessed under the following headings: summary of virtual teaching offered, strengths of virtual teaching, and weaknesses of virtual teaching. RESULTS: The strengths of virtual teaching included the variety of web-based resources available. New interactive forms of virtual teaching are being developed to enable students to interact with patients from their homes. Open-access teaching with medical experts has enabled students to remain abreast of the latest medical advancements and to reclaim knowledge lost by the suspension of university classes and clinical attachments. Peer mentoring has been proven to be a valuable tool for medical students with aims of increasing knowledge and providing psychological support. Weaknesses of virtual teaching included technical challenges, confidentiality issues, reduced student engagement, and loss of assessments. The mental well-being of students was found to be negatively affected during the pandemic. Inequalities of virtual teaching services worldwide were also noted to cause differences in medical education. CONCLUSIONS: In the unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical schools have a duty to provide ongoing education to medical students. The continuation of teaching is crucial to enable the graduation of future physicians into society. The evidence suggests that virtual teaching is effective, and institutions are working to further develop these resources to improve student engagement and interactivity. Moving forward, medical faculties must adopt a more holistic approach to student education and consider the mental impact of COVID-19 on students as well as improve the security and technology of virtual platforms.","output":"Effectiveness of Virtual Medical Teaching During the COVID-19 Crisis: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The multisystem effects of SARS-CoV-2 encompass the thyroid gland as well.

This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services, which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients' symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution. OBJECTIVE: In order to establish a contactless method of recommending the appropriate medical specialty, this study aimed to construct a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and to develop an AI chatbot that can be used on a smartphone. METHODS: We collected 118,008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty), conducted data cleansing, and finally constructed a pipeline of 51,134 sentences for this study. Several deep learning models, including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer, as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP, were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called \\"Alpha\\" to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones. RESULTS: The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F1-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F1-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones. CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning-based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner, based on their symptoms, thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers.","output":"Medical Specialty Recommendations by an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot on a Smartphone: Development and Deployment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chimeric infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genomes with cross-over sites in the S1 gene were generated by co-infection with two distinct IBV strains.

While pulmonary TB (PTB) is the most common manifestation, the proportion of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) is increasing in low-burden countries. EPTB is a heterogeneous disease entity posing diagnostic and management challenges due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. In this study, we prospectively evaluated clinical data and treatment response which were correlated with different biomarkers. METHODS: The study was conducted at the University Hospital of Cologne. 20 patients with EPTB were enrolled. We analyzed plasma interferon--inducible protein 10 (IP-10) levels in plasma by ELISA for up to 12 months of treatment. In addition, the QuantiFERON(?)-TB Gold Plus (QFT(?) Plus) test was performed during the course of treatment. Clinical data were assessed prospectively and correlated with QFT(?) Plus and IP-10 levels. RESULTS: Plasma IP-10 levels were found to be significantly increased (p < 0.001) in patients with extensive disease compared to patients with limited disease (cervical lymph node TB) or healthy controls. In patients with clinically confirmed paradoxical reaction (PR), a further increase of IP-10 was noted. IFN- measured by the QFT(?) Plus test did not decrease significantly during the course of treatment. Of note, in four EPTB patients (20%) without radiographic pulmonary involvement, sputum culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that IP-10 may be a valuable biomarker for estimation of disease severity in EPTB and monitoring of the disease course in extensive forms. However, IP-10 may be less suitable for diagnosis and monitoring of EPTB patients with limited disease. The QFT(?) Plus test does not appear to be a suitable marker for therapy monitoring. Sputum should be examined in EPTB patients even in case of normal diagnostic imaging of the chest.

COVID-19 infection control measures necessitated that students remained in 'social bubbles' for placement duration. This facilitated an apprenticeship-style teaching approach, integrating students into the clinical team for placement duration. Team-based learning was adopted to develop and deliver content. Teaching comprised weekly seminars, experiential ward-based attachments and participation in quality improvement and research projects. The taught content was evaluated through qualitative feedback, reflective practice, and pre-apprenticeship and post-apprenticeship confidence questionnaires across 17 domains. Students' confidence improved in 14 of 17 domains (p<0.05). Reflective practice indicated that students valued the apprenticeship model, preferring the longer clinical attachment to existent shorter, fragmented clinical placements.

CASE REPORT A 52-year-old man presented with right flank pain, fever, vomiting, and loss of appetite for 2 weeks. He had signs of dehydration and elevated blood glucose level. Ultrasonography revealed a right adrenal mass. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed lobulated and necrotic mass replacing the right suprarenal gland and encasing the right renal vein, adjacent inferior vena cava, psoas, and diaphragm. There was loss of fat planes with liver and upper pole of the right kidney. Biochemical evaluation indicated increased serum and urine cortisol levels. As a sequel to hypercortisolism-induced hyperglycemia, he developed spontaneous chest wall abscess and bilateral sudden vision loss due to vitreous hemorrhages. Pus and blood culture grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Adrenal suppressant ketoconazole was administered for better glycemic control. With a diagnosis of locally advanced adrenocortical malignancy, right radical adreno-nephrectomy was performed, and cut section revealed a pus collection of around 100 mL. Histopathology examination showed xanthogranulomatous inflammation involving adrenal gland, Gerota's fascia, psoas, and lymph nodes.

Although many policies and regulations on air quality have been promulgated worldwide over the past decades, airborne pollution still negatively affects health and therefore the life-style of human beings. One of the strategies to challenge this problem might be reducing the amount of airborne pollutant by mineralising them via photoinduced reactions. Photocatalytic oxidation of gaseous pollutants via titanium dioxide is one of the most promising solar photochemical reactions. In this research work, by means of a green sol-gel procedure, we have coupled titania to graphene (0.5 and 1.0 wt%) aiming to increase the solar photocatalytic activity of the produced hybrid materials. Transient paramagnetic species formed upon UV-A irradiation were detected by means of EPR spectroscopy. The photocatalytic reactions were assessed by monitoring the removal of nitrogen oxides and two different volatile organic compounds (benzene and isopropanol), which has never been assessed before. Our results highlight the exceptional characteristics of the TiO2/graphene hybrid material synthesised with 1.0 wt% graphene, and its excellent suitability for multi-purpose applications in the field of environmental remediation. Compared to unmodified titania, it shows a clear enhancement in the photocatalytic removal of those hazardous pollutants, having a photocatalytic degradation rate twice higher. In addition, the same material is highly stable and shows fully recyclability over repeated tests. Hybrid titania-graphene materials could thus be exploited to grant safer outdoor and indoor environments, having thus a beneficial impact on public health and on the quality of our lives.","output":"Graphene-TiO2 hybrids for photocatalytic aided removal of VOCs and nitrogen oxides from outdoor environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to investigate incidence and predictors of wound healing, relapse, major amputation, and/or death among patients with chronic leg wounds who were referred to specialist treatment at hospital for their condition.

METHODS: Retrospective review of strain segmental analysis within 4 weeks of presentation of symptoms among children diagnosed with PIMS-TS between April and June 2020 and a historic cohort of typical KD from the Royal Brompton Hospital, London. RESULTS: We included 33 PIMS-TS patients (23 males, 69.7%) at a mean age of 8  4,9 years old and 45 KD patients (31 males, 68,9%) at a mean age of 5,8  4,5 years old. PIMS-TS patients were older at presentation (p = 0.038). Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) was normal in both groups (63,3% vs 63,5%; p= 0,89), 4/33 PIMS-TS children (12,1%) had coronary arteries abnormalities (CAA), whereas 100% of KD cohort had CAA. Both groups had a normal global longitudinal strain (GLS),but in PIMS-TS it was significantly reduced compared to the KD group (-20% vs -22%; p = 0,008). Basal segments were the most affected in PIMS-TS with significant difference in the basal anterior and anterolateral strain compared to KD (respectively -18,2% vs -23,4%; p < 0,001 and - 16,7% vs -22,7%; p < 0,001). PIMS-TS had a greater anterior, anterolateral and posterior segments involvement with a significant reduction in the anterolateral mid-wall longitudinal strain (-18,3% vs -22%; p = 0,002). Apical segments were less involved, with significant difference only in the septal and inferior apical strain (respectively p = 0.001 and p = 0,032). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data showed that after 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms, all PIMS-TS patients had a normal LVEF but they had a significant reduction in GLS and different segmental involvement compared to KD cohort.

Among the many alternative food networks, the Community Supported Agriculture model is particularly significant and interesting. By redefining meanings and social norms around food practices, this model actualizes significant processes of food re-socialization and re-territorialization. Focusing on Italy, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of the potential of this model. It does so through two investigations carried out in 2019 and 2020, aimed at analyzing, respectively, structural and organizational aspects of CSAs and the features of resilience shown by these initiatives during the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. On the whole, the two surveys give us the image of a radically innovative experience, potentially capable of deeply redefining production and consumption practices, being rooted in socially-shared knowledge, motivations, willingness, commitment and sense of community. In addition to being characterized by a determination to pursue sustainability and equity goals, the model shows a remarkable character of resilience thanks to the original arrangements that the common value basis and the strong sense of interdependence and solidarity of its members can provide.","output":"A Socially-Based Redesign of Sustainable Food Practices: Community Supported Agriculture in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Out of the many pathogenic bacterial species that are known, only a fraction are readily identifiable directly from a complex microbial community using standard next generation DNA sequencing. Long-read sequencing offers the potential to identify a wider range of species and to differentiate between strains within a species, but attaining sufficient accuracy in complex metagenomes remains a challenge. METHODS: Here, we describe and analytically validate LoopSeq, a commercially available synthetic long-read (SLR) sequencing technology that generates highly accurate long reads from standard short reads. RESULTS: LoopSeq reads are sufficiently long and accurate to identify microbial genes and species directly from complex samples. LoopSeq perfectly recovered the full diversity of 16S rRNA genes from known strains in a synthetic microbial community. Full-length LoopSeq reads had a per-base error rate of 0.005%, which exceeds the accuracy reported for other long-read sequencing technologies. 18S-ITS and genomic sequencing of fungal and bacterial isolates confirmed that LoopSeq sequencing maintains that accuracy for reads up to 6 kb in length. LoopSeq full-length 16S rRNA reads could accurately classify organisms down to the species level in rinsate from retail meat samples, and could differentiate strains within species identified by the CDC as potential foodborne pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The order-of-magnitude improvement in length and accuracy over standard Illumina amplicon sequencing achieved with LoopSeq enables accurate species-level and strain identification from complex- to low-biomass microbiome samples. The ability to generate accurate and long microbiome sequencing reads using standard short read sequencers will accelerate the building of quality microbial sequence databases and removes a significant hurdle on the path to precision microbial genomics.

Thus far, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MSC (iMSC) seems to provide the unique opportunity to solve most obstacles that currently exist to prevent the broad application of MSC as an advanced medicinal product. The features of iMSC include their single cell clone origins, and defined and controllable cultural conditions for their derivation and proliferation. Still, comprehensive research of the molecular and functional heterogeneity of iMSC, just like MSC from any other tissue types, would be required. Furthered on previous efforts on iMSC differentiation and expansion platform and transcriptomic studies, advantages of single cell multi-omics analysis and other up-to-dated technologies would be taken in order to elucidate the molecular origin and regulation of heterogeneity and to obtain iMSC subgroups homogeneous enough for particular clinical conditions.

Our findings show a curvilinear effect of pandemic duration on working women's exhaustion. The data also show that the introduction and the easing of lockdown measures affect exhaustion, and that women with children who work from home while childcare is unavailable are especially exhausted. Job autonomy and partner support mitigated some of these effects. In sum, women's psychological health was more strongly affected by the pandemic than men's.

The contingent valuation experiment was conducted through online questionnaires administered in February to March 2018 to cross-sectional, representative samples in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and The Netherlands, yielding a total sample size of 3140. Mean willingness to pay for an early warning system was 21.80 (median 10.00) per household per month. Pooled regression results indicate that willingness to pay increased with household income and risk aversion, while they decreased with age. Overall, our results indicate that approximately 80C90% of people would be willing to pay for an increase in health safety in the form of an early warning system for infectious diseases and food-borne outbreaks.

The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions, feelings and unmet needs of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who experienced the 2-month lockdown in a \\"red zone\\" in the northern part of Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: The study had a descriptive design that used a cross-sectional online survey which included open-ended questions to elicit responses on the participant's feelings concerning their risk of contracting coronavirus, how their physical activity had changed, and their personal needs, dictated by their condition, which were not met in this pandemic period as compared to previous periods. Demographic data were analysed using descriptive frequencies, while the open-ended questions were analysed using thematic framework analysis. RESULTS: The study included 103 participants (63 men/40 women [61.17 vs. 38.83%]). Framework analysis led to the identification of four main themes: (i) fearing the risk of contracting coronavirus; (ii) reduction of physical activity; (iii) perception of the risk of not being able to access outpatient clinics or support services; and (iv) negative experiences of the important reduction in socialization. The perceptions of unmet needs appeared to be greater than the actual experience, particularly for the reduction in physical activity and the interruption of contacts with the neurologist and other specialists. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how perceptions and actual experience shape the meaning of living with PD during the pandemic.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This open-label, non-randomised, population-based trial enrolled eligible adults and children aged 1 year and above. Participants were offered the two-dose candidate EVD vaccine regimen VAC52150 (Ad26.ZEBOV, Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-BN-Filo), with the doses being given 56 days apart. After vaccination, serious adverse events (SAEs) were passively recorded until 1 month post dose 2. 1000 safety subset participants were telephoned at 1 month post dose 2 to collect SAEs. 500 pregnancy subset participants were contacted to collect SAEs at D7 and D21 post dose 1 and at D7, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post dose 2, unless delivery was before these time points. The first 100 infants born to these women were given a clinical examination 3 months post delivery. Due to COVID-19 and temporary suspension of dose 2 vaccinations, at least 50 paediatric and 50 adult participants were enrolled into an immunogenicity subset to examine immune responses following a delayed second dose.

In this regard, we used a refinement of the SIDARTHE (Susceptible, Infected, Diagnosed, Ailing, Recognized, Threatened, Healed, Extinct) model to develop a retrospective computational analysis focused on an Italian case study. Our work aimed at evaluating the efficacy of adopted countermeasures (inferred from the resulting model parameters), and additionally providing an estimate of the undetected viral circulation as well as the day zero of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, which are not directly inferable from the data. ABSTRACT: Late 2019 saw the outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which rapidly turned into a pandemic, killing more than 2.77 million people and infecting more than 126 million as of late March 2021. Daily collected data on infection cases and hospitalizations informed decision makers on the ongoing pandemic emergency, enabling the design of diversified countermeasures, from behavioral policies to full lockdowns, to curb the virus spread. In this context, mechanistic models could represent valuable tools to optimize the timing and stringency of interventions, and to reveal non-trivial properties of the pandemic dynamics that could improve the design of suitable guidelines for future epidemics. We performed a retrospective analysis of the Italian epidemic evolution up to mid-December 2020 to gain insight into the main characteristics of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, prior to the emergence of new mutations and the vaccination campaign. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to calibrate a refined version of the SIDARTHE (Susceptible, Infected, Diagnosed, Ailing, Recognized, Threatened, Healed, Extinct) model and hence accurately reconstruct the epidemic trajectory. We then derived additional features of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy not directly retrievable from reported data, such as the estimate of the day zero of infection in late November 2019 and the estimate of the spread of undetected infection. The present analysis contributes to a better understanding of the past pandemic waves, confirming the importance of epidemiological modeling to support an informed policy design against epidemics to come.","output":"A Retrospective Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic Evolution in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Establishing an accurate gestational age is essential for the optimum management of pregnancy, delivery and neonatal care, with improved estimates of gestational age considered a public health priority by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although ultrasound is considered the most precise method to achieve this, it is unavailable to many women in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), where the lack of trained practitioners is considered a major barrier. This systematic review explores what initiatives have previously been undertaken to train staff to date pregnancies using ultrasound, which were successful and what barriers and facilitators influenced training. Methods The systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines and the protocol registered (PROSPERO CRD42019154619). Searches were last performed in July 2021. Studies were screened independently by two assessors, with data extracted by one and verified by the other. Both reviewers graded the methodological quality using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool. Results were collated within prespecified domains, generating a narrative synthesis. Results 25/1,262 studies were eligible for inclusion, all of which were programme evaluations. Eighteen were undertaken in Africa, three in South-East Asia, one in South America, and three across multiple sites, including those in Africa, Asia, and South America. Five programs specified criteria to pass, and within these 96% of trainees did so. Trainee follow up was undertaken in 18 studies. Ten met recommendations for training outlined by the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) but only 1 met the current standards set by the WHO. Discussion This systematic review is the first to evaluate this topic and has uncovered major inconsistencies in the delivery and reporting of basic obstetric ultrasound training in LMICs, with the majority of programs not meeting minimum recommendations. By identifying these issues, we have highlighted key areas for improvement and made recommendations for reporting according to the RE-AIM framework. With an increasing focus on the importance of improving estimates of gestational age in LMICs, we believe these findings will be of significance to those seeking to develop and expand the provision of sustainable obstetric ultrasound in LMICs.

However, the extreme interconnectedness of southern African countries facilitates the constant movement of malaria parasites across country-borders, predominately from higher-burden \\"source\\" countries to lower-burden \\"sink\\" countries, reinforcing the notion that malaria elimination in any southern African country would not be possible without regional cooperation and collaboration. The Elimination 8 initiative (E8) was therefore, created by Health Ministers from eight countries (Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) to coordinate the implementation of a regional malaria elimination strategy. The E8 supported the implementation of five cross-border malaria control initiatives and the deployment of malaria health units at strategic points along shared borders. These units have contributed to a 30% and 46% reduction in malaria incidence and mortality, respectively, in the E8 border regions. The Situation Room, a novel data sharing platform developed and supported by the E8, has allowed for the early detection of and prompt response to malaria outbreaks. This platform played a vital role in identifying resources gaps due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite advancing the elimination agenda, the E8 region faces challenges which include, significant increases in malaria in certain member states, limited domestic funding and health system bottlenecks. These must be urgently addressed if the gains made through the E8 are to be sustained and malaria elimination is to be achieved across southern Africa.","output":"Eliminating malaria from the margins of transmission in southern Africa through the elimination 8 initiative.

As there is a lack of targeted therapeutics, there is certain opportunity for the scientific community to develop new drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 and so many synthetic bioactive compounds are undergoing clinical trials. In most of the countries, due to the broad therapeutic spectrum and minimal side effects, medicinal plants have been used widely throughout history as traditional healing remedy. Because of the unavailability of synthetic bioactive antiviral drugs, hence all possible efforts have been focused on the search for new drugs and alternative medicines from different herbal formulations. In recent times, it has been assured that the M(pro), also called 3CL(pro), is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme responsible for viral reproduction and thereby impeding the hosts immune response. As such, M(pro) represents a highly specified target for drugs capable of inhibitory action against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

There is evidence of the anti-coronavirus activities of this compound, including against the target SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The ability to inhibit coronavirus and its inflammatory processes is strongly desired in a new drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, in this review, the dual effect of quercetin is discussed from a mechanistic perspective in relation to AKI kidney injury and its nephroprotective potential to SARS-CoV-2 patients.","output":"Mechanistic Aspects and Therapeutic Potential of Quercetin against COVID-19-Associated Acute Kidney Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a new reachability indicator to analyze the effectiveness of remote learning policies adopted by ministries of education in response to school closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prolonged or excessive parenting stress may be a response to infant behavioral differences antecedent to developmental disorders such as ADHD, and therefore represents a potentially valuable inclusion in routine early-life assessment. To investigate the feasibility of using routinely-collected self-reported maternal parenting stress as a risk marker for child ADHD, this study investigated the longitudinal association between maternal parenting stress from 1 to 36 months after childbirth and child ADHD in early adolescence. Methods: The sample comprised 2,638 children (1,253 girls) from the Tokyo Teen Cohort population-based birth cohort study. Mothers recorded parenting stress five times from 1 to 36 months following childbirth in the Maternal and Child Health Handbook, a tool used for routine early-life assessment in Japan. Nine years later, mothers evaluated their child's ADHD symptoms at 12 y using the hyperactivity/inattention subscale from the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: Approximately 7.5% of parents reported that they had parenting stress at 36 m after childbirth. 6.2% of children were evaluated as above the cut-off for ADHD symptoms at 12 y. Parenting stress at 1 and 3-4 m was not associated with child ADHD symptoms at 12 y. However, child ADHD symptoms at 12 y was significantly associated with parenting stress at 9-10 m (unadjusted OR = 1.42, p =.047, 95% CI [1.00, 2/00]), 18 m (unadjusted OR = 1.57, p =.007, 95% CI [1.13, 2.19]) and 36 m (unadjusted OR = 1.67, p =.002, 95% CI [1.20, 2.31]). These associations remained after adjustment for child's sex, age in months and family income. Conclusions: We identified associations between parenting stress at 9-10, 18 and 36 m after childbirth and child ADHD symptoms at 12 years old. Self-reported parenting stress data may have utility as an early indicator for ADHD risk. Participation in early-life health checks, assessment of parenting stress, and tailoring support to family needs should be promoted for early identification and intervention for ADHD.","output":"Self-Reported Maternal Parenting Stress From 9 m Is Longitudinally Associated With Child ADHD Symptoms at Age 12: Findings From a Population-Based Birth Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the coronavirus pandemic led to the implementation of several precautionary measures across the globe.

Social relations provide an independent source of information about users and can be exploited for improving recommendation performance. Most of existing recommendation methods exploit social influence by refining social relations into a scalar indicator to either directly recommend friends visited items to users or constrain that friends embeddings are similar. However, a scalar indicator cannot express the multifaceted interest correlations between users, since each users interest is distributed across multiple dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a new embedding-based framework, which exploits users multifaceted interest correlation for social recommendation. We design a dimension-wise attention mechanism to learn a correlation vector to characterize the interest correlation between a pair of friends, capturing the high variation of users interest correlation on multiple dimensions. Moreover, we use friends embeddings to smooth a users own embedding with the correlation vector as weights, building the elaborate unstructured social influence between users.

Further, heterogeneity in disease outcomes is influenced by race, though the relative contributions of structural/social and genetic factors remain unclear. Very recent unpublished work has identified two genetic risk loci that confer greater risk for respiratory failure in COVID-19: the ABO locus and the 3p21.31 locus. To understand how these loci might confer risk and whether this differs by race, we utilized proteomic profiling and genetic information from three cohorts including black and white participants to identify proteins influenced by these loci. We observed that variants in the ABO locus are associated with levels of CD209/DC-SIGN, a known binding protein for SARS-CoV and other viruses, as well as multiple inflammatory and thrombotic proteins, while the 3p21.31 locus is associated with levels of CXCL16, a known inflammatory chemokine.

We aimed to develop and validate a nomogram to predict severe COVID-19 cases that would need ICU follow-up based on available and accessible patient values. METHODS: Patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 15, 2020, and June 15, 2020, were enrolled in this retrospective study with 35 variables obtained upon admission considered. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to select potential predictive parameters using 1000 bootstrap samples. Afterward, a nomogram was developed with 5 variables selected from multivariable analysis. The nomogram model was evaluated by Area Under the Curve (AUC) and bias-corrected Harrell's C-index with 95% confidence interval, HosmerCLemeshow Goodness-of-fit test, and calibration curve analysis. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1022 patients, 686 cases without missing data were used to construct the nomogram. Of the 686, 104 needed ICU follow-up. The final model includes oxygen saturation, CRP, PCT, LDH, troponin as independent factors for the prediction of need for ICU admission. The model has good predictive power with an AUC of 0.93 (0.902C0.950) and a bias-corrected Harrell's C-index of 0.91 (0.899C0.947).

This systematic review evaluates perioperative complications of hybrid incisional hernia repair (HIHR). METHODS EMBASE, Medline via OvidSP, Web of Science, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases were searched. Studies providing data on intra- and postoperative complications in patients who underwent HIHR were included. Data on intra- and postoperative complications were extracted and meta-analyses were performed. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle Ottowa Scale, ROBINS-I tool, and Cochrane risk of bias. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020175053. RESULTS Eleven studies (n = 1681 patients) were included. Five studies compared intra-operative complications between HIHR and laparoscopic incisional hernia repair (LIHR) with a pooled incidence of 1.8% in HIHR group and 2.8% in LIHR group (p = 0.13). Comparison of postoperative prevalence of surgical site occurrences (SSOs) (23% versus 26%, p = 0.02) and surgical site occurrences requiring interventions (SSOPIs) (1.5% versus 4.1%, p < 0.01) were in favour of the HIHR group. Overall postoperative complications seemed to occur less frequent in the HIHR group, though no hard statements could be made due to the vast heterogeneity in reporting between studies. CONCLUSION Although the majority of studies were retrospective and included a small number of patients, HIHR seemingly led to less SSOs and SSOPIs.

As of June 2021, N3C contains data on 6,193,738 patients (2,090,138 with COVID-19, 33.7%) from 55 participating sites (Figure 1). We describe the characteristics of patients with PNTMI based on COVID-19 infection status. Figure 1 [Image: see text] N3C Basic Demographic Data METHODS: COVID-19 is defined by positive lab result (PCR, antigen, or antibody) or COVID-19 coding diagnosis, as defined by N3C. PNTMI phenotype was built with N3C Data Enclave concept set tool, and ATLAS (https://atlas.ohdsi.org/). We limited analysis to adults (18 years-old or older). We used de-identified data sets stripped of protected health information (PHI). We used N3C Data Enclave analytical tools for exploratory data analysis, and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We identified five hundred and eighty six individuals from 19 sites fulfilling the PNTMI phenotype (9.46 cases per 100,000 people). After our age limit, 555 individuals were included for analysis (Figure 2). 340 were females (61.3%), 447 of white race (80.5%), and 30 were Hispanic (5.4%). Additional descriptive statistics and statistical significance testing are provided (Table 1). The most common concept were \\"Non-tuberculous mycobacterial pneumonia\\", and \\"Pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection\\". Four sites accounted for more than 50% of identified patients (Figure 2). We identified 24 individuals with COVID-19 (4.32%), and 44 deaths in this cohort (7.9%).

Patterns of infection are dictated by the cell type infected, but cell type-specific factors and how they impact tropism for specific cell types is poorly understood. Previous studies in primary endothelial cells showed that HCMV infection induces large multivesicular-like bodies that incorporate viral products including dense bodies and virions. Here we define the nature of these large vesicles using a recombinant virus where UL32, encoding the pp150 tegument protein, is fused in frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP, TB40/E-UL32-GFP). Cells were fixed and labeled with antibodies against subcellular compartment markers and imaged using confocal and super-resolution microscopy. In fibroblasts, UL32-GFP-positive vesicles were marked with classical markers of MVBs, including CD63 and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), both classical MVB markers, as well as the clathrin and LAMP1. Unexpectedly, UL32-GFP-positive vesicles in endothelial cells were not labeled by CD63, and LBPA was completely lost from infected cells. We defined these UL32-positive vesicles in endothelial cells using markers for the cis-Golgi (GM130), lysosome (LAMP1), and autophagy (LC3B). These findings suggest that virus-containing MVBs in fibroblasts are derived from the canonical endocytic pathway and takeover classical exosomal release pathway. Virus containing MVBs in HMVECs are derived from the early biosynthetic pathway and exploit a less characterized early Golgi-LAMP1-associated non-canonical secretory autophagy pathway. These results reveal striking cell-type specific membrane trafficking differences in host pathways that are exploited by HCMV. Importance Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that, like all herpesvirus, that establishes a life long infection. HCMV remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised and HCMV seropositivity is associated with increased risk vascular disease. HCMV infects many cells in the human and the biology underlying the different patterns of infection in different cell types is poorly understood. Endothelial cells are important target of infection that contribute to hematogenous spread of the virus to tissues. Here we define striking differences in the biogenesis of large vesicles that incorporate virions in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In fibroblasts, HCMV is incorporated into canonical MVBs derived from an endocytic pathway, whereas HCMV matures through vesicles derived from the biosynthetic pathway in endothelial cells. This work defines basic biological differences between these cell types that may impact the outcome of infection.","output":"Cell type-specific biogenesis of novel vesicles containing viral products in human cytomegalovirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate whether the classic bystander effect is unique to humans, the effect of bystanders on rat helping was studied.

We made the following findings: 1) LPC increases nuclear localization of procaspase-1 in HAECs. 2) Nuclear pro-caspase-1 exports back to the cytosol, which is facilitated by a leptomycin B-inhibited mechanism. 3) Increased nuclear localization of pro-caspase-1 by a new NES peptide inhibitor upregulates inflammatory genes in oxidative stress and Th17 pathways; and SUMO activator N106 enhances nuclear localization of pro-caspase-1 and caspase-1 activation (p20) in the nucleus. 4) LPC plus caspase-1 enzymatic inhibitor upregulates inflammatory genes with hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia and interferon pathways, suggesting a novel capsase-1 enzyme-independent inflammatory mechanism. 5) LPC in combination with NES inhibitor and caspase-1 inhibitor upregulate inflammatory gene expression that regulate Th17 activation, endotheli-1 signaling, p38-, and ERK- MAPK pathways. To examine two hallmarks of endothelial activation such as secretomes and membrane protein signaling, LPC plus NES inhibitor upregulate 57 canonical secretomic genes and 76 exosome secretomic genes, respectively, promoting four pathways including Th17, IL-17 promoted cytokines, interferon signaling and cholesterol biosynthesis.

Triage was required to assess severity of illness and need for intervention, particularly affecting the volume of elective procedures to treat BPH. We examined trends in BPH procedures in the office and hospital during surges in the pandemic. METHODS: We compiled monthly volumes for BPH procedures using CPT codes from March 2020 to January 2021 by full time faculty at a single 2541 bed hospital system. Prostatic transurethral resection, laser vaporization, laser enucleation, aquablation, and robotic assisted simple prostatectomy were performed in the hospital and categorized together as BPH surgery. In-office prostatic urethral lift (PUL) and convective water vapor energy (WAVE) were categorized as MIST. Percent change in case volume was calculated based on the previous 12-month average. Ureteroscopy and stent cases (URS/ stent) were used as a control as they were more likely to be urgent. Surges during the pandemic were defined by county-specific metrics including hospitalization and COVID-19 positivity rates. RESULTS: During the pandemic, there was a modest decrease in BPH procedures with 582 cases, compared to 665 cases in the prior year. During the surges in 3/2020-4/2020, 7/2020, and 1/2021, the BPH surgery volume changed by -82.1%, -16.5%, and -47.5%, respectively. The MIST volume changed by -83.7%, =30.2%, and -7.7%, respectively. URS/stent cases decreased to a lesser degree than BPH procedures during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a slight decrease in the ability to perform surgery for BPH relative to stone cases. The trend was an adaptive response with pause in BPH surgeries during surges and an ensuing rebound.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provides added impetus to realise these benefits, given the increased risk of secondary infection and nosocomial transmission of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens linked with the expansion of critical care capacity. METHODS: CMg using nanopore sequencing was evaluated in a proof-of-concept study on 43 respiratory samples from 34 intubated patients across seven intensive care units (ICUs) over a 9-week period during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. RESULTS: An 8-h CMg workflow was 92% sensitive (95% CI, 75C99%) and 82% specific (95% CI, 57C96%) for bacterial identification based on culture-positive and culture-negative samples, respectively. CMg sequencing reported the presence or absence of -lactam-resistant genes carried by Enterobacterales that would modify the initial guideline-recommended antibiotics in every case. CMg was also 100% concordant with quantitative PCR for detecting Aspergillus fumigatus from 4 positive and 39 negative samples. Molecular typing using 24-h sequencing data identified an MDR-K. pneumoniae ST307 outbreak involving 4 patients and an MDR-C. striatum outbreak involving 14 patients across three ICUs. CONCLUSION: CMg testing provides accurate pathogen detection and antibiotic resistance prediction in a same-day laboratory workflow, with assembled genomes available the next day for genomic surveillance. The provision of this technology in a service setting could fundamentally change the multi-disciplinary team approach to managing ICU infections. The potential to improve the initial targeted treatment and rapidly detect unsuspected outbreaks of MDR-pathogens justifies further expedited clinical assessment of CMg.

Among the 101 patients with a history of hypertension and taking at least one anti-hypertensive medication, 40 patients were receiving ACEI/ARB as part of their regimen, and 61 patients were on antihypertensive medication other than ACEI/ARB. We observed no statistically significant differences in percentages of in-hospital mortality (28% vs. 34%, P = 0.46), ICU admission (20% vs. 28%, P = 0.37) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18% vs. 26%, P = 0.31) between patients with or without ACEI/ARB treatment. Further multivariable adjustment of age and gender did not provide evidence for a significant association between ACEI/ARB treatment and severe COVID-19 outcomes. Our findings confirm the lack of an association between chronic receipt of renin-angiotensin system antagonists and severe outcomes of COVID-19. Patients should continue previous anti-hypertensive therapy until further evidence is available.","output":"Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in context of COVID-19 outbreak: a retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Encouraged by the public policy, citizens in Taiwan have traditionally enjoyed a high percentage of home ownership. Therefore, it has been perplexing and enigmatic to witness the growing homeless population sleeping outside in public areas in recent years. Public actions have been called for to deal with the problem. However, the approach of these public actions has depended on how the problem of homelessness has been defined. This paper presents a historical context of how homelessness has been presented in policy discourses. Further, on the basis of a survey conducted in 2004, this paper describes the profile of the homeless and discusses why the homeless began sleeping on the streets. Finally, an outreach worker narrates his story about working with the homeless in Taipei City, the capital of Taiwan. The paper also includes policy implications in terms of appropriate public actions to be taken in response to the homelessness problem in Taiwan.","output":"Homeless problems in Taiwan: Looking beyond legality toward social issues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of heart failure (HF) morbidity and mortality. Despite well-characterized abnormalities in cardiac structure in CKD, it remains unclear how to optimally leverage echocardiography to risk stratify CKD patients. METHODS: We evaluated associations between echocardiographic parameters and risk of HF hospitalization and death using Cox proportional hazard models and forward selection with integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). RESULTS: The study included 3,505 participants enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC). Mean age was 5911 years, HF prevalence was 10%, and mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) was 549%. During mean 11 (interquartile range: 8 to 12) years of follow-up, event rates per 100-person years for HF hospitalizations and death, respectively, were 9.4 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 7.9-11.3) and 8.9 (95% CI: 7.6-10.5) for participants with LVEF <40%, 3.5 (95% CI: 3.0-4.2) and 4.6 (95% CI: 4.0-5.2) for patients with LVEF 40-49%, and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.7-2.1) and 3.1 (95% CI: 2.9-3.3) for patients with LVEF >50%. The rate of HF hospitalizations and deaths increased with lower eGFR across all LVEF categories. LV mass index, LVEF, and LV geometry had the strongest association with outcomes but provided modest incremental prognostic value to a baseline clinical model (IDI =0.14 and AUC=0.017 for HF hospitalization, IDI =0.12 and AUC=0.008 for death). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline echocardiographic parameters are independently associated with increased risk of subsequent HF morbidity and mortality but provide only marginal incremental prognostic utility beyond clinical characteristics in the setting of CKD.","output":"Prognostic Value of Echocardiography for Heart Failure and Death in Adults with Chronic Kidney Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an evolving entity with a myriad of clinical presentations and complications. Most cases of COVID-19 associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) have been reported in children with little data in adults. Here we present a case of MIS in a 19-year-old African American adult. Case Presentation: The patient is a previously healthy 19-year-old African American female who presented with 5 days of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, headache, and malaise. She was diagnosed with COVID- 19 24 days before presentation and remained asymptomatic since testing positive. On presentation, the patient's vitals were significant for a fever of 102.2 F, blood pressure of 97/56, and heart rate of 123. Laboratory workup showed elevated creatinine, and inflammatory markers including procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, Creactive protein, and, D-dimer. A multidisciplinary approach comprising of critical care, cardiology, rheumatology, and infectious disease was undertaken. The initial hospital course was complicated by hypotension requiring pressor support, and an episode of supraventricular tachycardia which resolved with adenosine. Additionally, the patient had a brief episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which self resolved. Initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with left wall hypokinesis. The patient was successfully treated with 1 dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and Solu-Medrol 1 g daily for three days. The patient was monitored with serial troponins, B-natriuretic peptide, and inflammatory markers. Acute kidney injury present on admission resolved within two days. A follow-up TTE obtained three days later showed a significant improvement in EF to 45%. The patient's symptoms resolved within three days of treatment. Discussion: MIS should be considered in adults presenting with atypical gastrointestinal, cardiac, and musculoskeletal symptoms with elevated inflammatory markers in the setting of a recent diagnosis of COVID-19. Cardiac manifestations such as arrhythmias and wall motion abnormalities should be expected. Unlike MIS in children who display features of Kawasaki disease, adults often lack these overlapping features. Inflammatory markers including procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and ferritin can be used to monitor treatment response as they trend down with appropriate management. Intravenous steroids and IVIG can be effective in managing this clinical entity by improving cardiac parameters such as EF, although long term prognosis remains to be analyzed. Despite limited data, it is reasonable to postulate that MIS may be caused by Covid-19 associated cytokine storm and severe inflammatory response that entails multisystem dysfunction even in individuals without underlying medical conditions.","output":"A young adult with COVID-19 associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"North Korea slogged through 2020 in an effort to maintain public health and state power.

The classical solution takes (mN) time for matching m patterns over N sized text database. The quantum search mechanism is a core for pattern matching, as this reduces time complexity and achieves computational speedup. Few quantum methods are available for multiple pattern matching, which executes search oracle for each pattern in successive iterations. Such solutions are likely acceptable because of classical equivalent quantum designs. However, these methods are constrained with the inclusion of multiplicative factor m in their complexities. An optimal quantum design is to execute multiple search oracle in parallel on the quantum processing unit with a single-core that completely removes the multiplicative factor m, however, this method is impractical to design. We have no effective quantum solutions to process multiple patterns at present. Therefore, we propose quantum algorithms using quantum processing unit with C quantum cores working on shared quantum memory. This quantum parallel design would be effective for searching all t exact occurrences of each pattern. To our knowledge, no attempts have been made to design multiple pattern matching algorithms on quantum multicore processor. Thus, some quantum remarkable exact single pattern matching algorithms are enhanced here with their equivalent versions, namely enhanced quantum memory processing based exact algorithm and enhanced quantum-based combined exact algorithm for multiple pattern matching.

At present, there are few studies about the lasting mental health effects of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental health of the Chinese public during the long-term COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A total of 1172 online questionnaires were collected, covering demographical information and 8 common psychological states: depression, anxiety, somatization, stress, psychological resilience, suicidal ideation and behavior, insomnia, and stress disorder. In addition, the geographical and temporal distributions of different mental states were plotted. RESULTS: Overall, 30.1% of smokers increased smoking, while 11.3% of drinkers increased alcohol consumption. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, mental health problems, high risk of suicidal and behavior, clinical insomnia, clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, moderate-to-high levels of perceived stress were 18.8%, 13.3%, 7.6%, 2.8%, 7.2%, 7.0%, and 67.9%, respectively. Further, the geographical distribution showed that the mental status in some provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities was relatively more serious. The temporal distribution showed that the psychological state of the participants was relatively poorer on February 20, 24 to 26 and March 25, especially on March 25.

The primary end point of the study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the following lockdown measures on our hub-and-spoke network; the secondary end point was to evaluate if the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was different in hub-and-spoke centers. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter observational study conducted at the Stroke Units of Policlinico Gemelli, Ospedale San Filippo Neri, Ospedale di Belcolle, and Ospedale San Camillo de Lellis. We collected clinical reports of all consecutive patients admitted with diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) during the phase 1 of the lockdown period (11 March 2020-4 May 2020). As controls, we used all consecutive patients admitted for acute ischemic stroke or TIA in the same period of the previous year. RESULTS: A total of 156 and 142 clinical reports were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a reduction of number of thrombolysis, a reduction of the length of hospitalization, and an increase of pneumonia. Regarding performance indicators, we observed an increase in onset-to-door time and in door-to-groin time. We did not observe any statistically significant interaction between year (2019 vs 2020) and facility of admission (hub vs spoke) on all variables analyzed.

NE stimulates epithelial toll like receptors (TLR) resulting in cytokine upregulation and release, upregulates MUC5AC, a major airway mucin, degrades both phagocytic receptors and opsonins resulting in both neutrophil and macrophage phagocytic failure, generates oxidative stress via extracellular generation and uptake of heme free iron, and activates other proteases. Altogether, these mechanisms create a significant inflammatory challenge that impairs innate immune function and results in airway remodeling. Currently, a major gap in our therapeutic approach to CF lung disease is the lack of an effective therapeutic strategy targeting active NE and its downstream pro-inflammatory sequelae. Polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are potent anti-elastase drugs that have additional anti-inflammatory properties. Heparin is a prototype of a glycosaminoglycan with both anti-elastase and anti-inflammatory properties. Heparin inhibits NE in an allosteric manner with high potency. Heparin also inhibits cathepsin G, blocks P-selectin and L-selectin, hinders ligand binding to the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts, and impedes histone acetyltransferase activity which dampens cytokine transcription and High Mobility Group Box 1 release. Furthermore, nebulized heparin treatment improves outcomes for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, acute lung injury and smoke inhalation. However, the anticoagulant activity of heparin is a potential contraindication for this therapy to be developed for CF lung disease. Therefore, modified heparins and other GAGs are being developed that retain the anti-elastase and anti-inflammatory qualities of heparin with minimal to no anticoagulant activity. The modified heparin, 2-O, 3-O desulfated heparin (ODSH), maintains anti-elastase and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and in vivo, and has little residual anticoagulant activity. Heparan sulfate with O-sulfate residues but not N-sulfate residues blocks allergic asthmatic inflammation in a murine model. Polysulfated hyaluronic acid abrogates allergen- triggered rhinosinusitis in a murine model. Finally, nonsaccharide glycosaminoglycan mimetics with specific sulfate modifications can be designed to inhibit NE activity. Altogether, these novel GAGs or GAG mimetics hold significant promise to address the unmet need for inhaled anti-elastase and anti-inflammatory therapy for patients with CF.","output":"Glycosaminoglycans as Multifunctional Anti-Elastase and Anti-Inflammatory Drugs in Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented many challenges to caregivers of children.

Here, we build and characterize the performance of a novel modular 3-axis TMS coil that can be utilized as a unit element in large-scale multichannel TMS arrays. METHODS: We determined the basic physical characteristics of the 3-axis TMS coil x-, y- and z-elements using a custom 2-channel programmable stimulator prototype. We mapped the temporal rate-of-change of the induced magnetic field (dB/dt) on a 2D plane parallel to the coil surface (including an extended line for full spatial coverage) and compared those values with predictions from magnetic field simulations. Temperature measurements were carried out to assess the incorporated air-cooling method. We measured the mutual and self-inductances of the x/y/z-elements to assess coupling between them. Additionally, we measured and calculated the coupling between z-elements in the array configuration. Finally, we performed electric field simulations to evaluate the stimulation intensity and focality of the coil and compared the results to conventional TMS coils as well as demonstrated suitability of the 3-axis coil for a multichannel array configuration. RESULTS: The experimentally obtained dB/dt values validated the computational model of the 3-axis coil and therefore confirmed that both the coil and stimulator system are operating as intended. The air-cooling system was effective for brief high-frequency pulse trains and extended single- and paired-pulse TMS protocols. The electromagnetic simulations suggested that an array of the 3-axis coils would have comparable stimulation intensity to conventional TMS coils, therefore enabling clearly suprathreshold stimulation of the human brain. The recorded coil coupling between the x/y/z-elements was < 1% and the maximal coupling between z-elements in the array configuration was 1.8% and 3.4% for the measured and calculated values, respectively. CONCLUSION: We presented a 3-axis coil intended for multichannel TMS arrays. The electromagnetic measurements and simulations verified that the coil fabrication met the desired specifications and that the inductive coupling between the elements was negligible.

However, epidemiological indicators must be harmonized and data pooled to better leverage and learn from routine data collection.Methods: This article describes a data harmonization and pooling Collaborative led by the organizations of the Community Health Impact Coalition, a network of health practitioners delivering community-based healthcare in dozens of countries across four WHO regions.Objectives: The goals of the Collaborative project are to; (i) enable new opportunities for cross-site learning; (ii) use positive and negative outlier analysis to identify, test, and (if helpful) propagate design practices that lead to quality care; and (iii) create a multi-country brain trust to reinforce data and health information systems across sites.Results: This article outlines the rationale and methods used to establish a data harmonization and pooling Collaborative, early findings, lessons learned, and directions for future research.","output":"Lessons from an eight-country community health data harmonization collaborative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this case is to spotlight the potential neurological andneuropsychiatric symptoms associated with COVID-19. METHOD: A 55-year-old African American male with a history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obesity, tobacco use, and hypertension voluntarily presented to the local hospital with auditoryhallucinations and delusions. During an inpatient stay, the patient developed symptomsconsistent with COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for the virus. Thirty-nine days after the initial positive COVID-19 test result, he remained in a coma with retained brainstem responses. An EEG demonstrated encephalopathy and MRI showed multiple, well-circumscribed white matter lesions consistent with acute demyelination (Figure 1). After three days of high-dose steroids and over a month in a coma, the patient began following simple commands. Unfortunately, on hospital day 66, the patient developed sudden hypotension and worsening respiratory status. RESULTS: While psychotic episodes in relation to COVID-19 are not widely reported, psychotic episodes are shown in three COVID-19 cases. Other reports have found significant changes in consciousness in COVID-19 patients with delayed awakening from a comatose state. Pre-existing inflammatory responses in those with psychiatric disease may be accelerated by the immune response due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Mental status changes in those with psychiatric illness who have COVID-19 are worth exploring. It is unclear whether a history of COVID-19 may accelerate a neuropsychiatric process or other central nervous system diseases. Future research may want to examine the possible interrelationship between pre-existing neurological vulnerabilities and COVID-19. The possibility of high-dose steroid treatment for COVID-19 neuroinflammatory complications should be considered.

Among these contaminants, deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin, is the most prevalent type B trichothecene mycotoxin worldwide. Pigs are very sensitive to the toxic effects of DON and are frequently exposed to naturally contaminated feed. Recently, DON naturally contaminated feed has been shown to decrease porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) specific antibody responses following experimental infection. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of DON naturally contaminated feed on the immune response generated following vaccination with PRRSV live attenuated vaccine. Eighteen pigs were randomly divided into three experimental groups of 6 animals based on DON content of the diets (0, 2.5 and 3.5 mg DON/kg). They were fed these rations one week prior to the vaccination and for all the duration of the immune response evaluation. All pigs were vaccinated intra-muscularly with one dose of Ingelvac(?) PRRSV modified live vaccine (MLV). Blood samples were collected at day ?1, 6, 13, 20, 27 and 35 post vaccination (pv) and tested for PRRSV RNA by RT-qPCR and for virus specific antibodies by ELISA. Results showed that ingestion of DON-contaminated diets significantly decreased PRRSV viremia. All pigs fed control diet were viremic while only 1 (17%) and 3 (50%) out of 6 pigs were viremic in the groups receiving 3.5 and 2.5 mg of DON/kg, respectively. Subsequently, all pigs fed control diet developed PRRSV specific antibodies while only viremic pigs that were fed contaminated diets have developed PRRSV specific antibodies. These results suggest that feeding pigs with DON-contaminated diet could inhibit vaccination efficiency of PRRSV MLV by severely impairing viral replication.","output":"Deoxynivalenol (DON) naturally contaminated feed impairs the immune response induced by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) live attenuated vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Curators of the history of medicine are now facing one of the greatest challenges of their careershow to collect and preserve objects that convey the impacts of COVID-19 on science, medicine and wider society, while that same pandemic rages around them.

The previously established, but distant, antigenic relationship between these viruses was strengthened by genetic findings (presence of cognate genes, amino acid identity between 55 and 88%, similar conserved terminal motifs, suspected read-through phenomenon in segment 9 of both viruses) and by indistinguishable ultramicroscopic morphologies. Moreover, putative constitutive modifying enzyme activities were suspected to be carried out by homologous viral proteins (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, methyl/guanylyl transferase, NTPase). These findings, together with the comparative analysis to genomes of south-east Asian isolates, support the recent classification of arboviruses with 12 segments of dsRNA within two distinct genera (genus Coltivirus and genus Seadornavirus) and raise interesting questions about the evolutionary origins of coltiviruses. The previously proposed hypothesis that EYA virus was derived from an ancestral virus introduced in Europe with the migration of lagomorphs from North-America, would imply a divergence date between American and European isolates of over 50 million years ago (MYA).

METHODS Six female veterinarians volunteered for the study. The participants wore a wrist device for a total of eight weeks in order to passively and semi-continuously record physiological responses throughout the day (i.e., heart rate, heart rate variability, number of steps, and sleep quality). Moreover, perceived sleep quality was assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS During and for one month after completion of the FL, most veterinarians presented an alteration of cardiovascular parameters and sleep quality. The heart rate circadian rhythm returned to pre-race values within about two weeks. CONCLUSIONS The long-lasting alteration of the veterinarians' cardiovascular parameters and sleep-wake patterns might have negative consequences for their health in the long-term, especially if similar experiences are repeated more times though the course of a year or season.

Since there is no effective vaccine and treatment for this virus, therefore, the only way to mitigate this infection is the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing, community lockdown, quarantine, hospitalization or self-isolation and contact-tracing. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to explore the transmission dynamics and possible control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, one of the Asian countries with a high burden of disease with more than 200,000 confirmed infected cases so far. Initially, a mathematical model without optimal control is formulated and some of the basic necessary analysis of the model, including stability results of the disease-free equilibrium is presented. It is found that the model is stable around the disease-free equilibrium both locally and globally when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. Despite the basic analysis of the model, we further consider the confirmed infected COVID-19 cases documented in Pakistan from March 1, till May 28, 2020 and estimate the model parameters using the least square fitting tools from statistics and probability theory. The results show that the model output is in good agreement with the reported COVID-19 infected cases. The approximate value of the basic reproductive number based on the estimated parameters is R 01.87. The effect of low (or mild), moderate, and comparatively strict control interventions like social-distancing, quarantine rate, (or contact-tracing of suspected people) and hospitalization (or self-isolation) of testing positive COVID-19 cases are shown graphically. It is observed that the most effective strategy to minimize the disease burden is the implementation of maintaining a strict social-distancing and contact-tracing to quarantine the exposed people. Furthermore, we carried out the global sensitivity analysis of the most crucial parameter known as the basic reproduction number using the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) techniques. The proposed model is then reformulated by adding the time-dependent control variables u 1(t) for quarantine and u 2(t) for the hospitalization interventions and present the necessary optimality conditions using the optimal control theory and Pontryagin's maximum principle. Finally, the impact of constant and optimal control interventions on infected individuals is compared graphically.","output":"Modeling the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the dynamics of novel coronavirus with optimal control analysis with a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early in the pandemic in Ontario, Canada, long-term care residents without contact with family or friends experienced disproportionate impacts of COVID-19, with 35% greater excess mortality than residents with personal contact with family or friends.","output":"Excess mortality in long-term care residents with and without personal contact with family or friends during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peripheral T cell lymphopenia (lyp) in the BioBreeding (BB) rat is linked to a frameshift mutation in Ian5, a member of the Immune Associated Nucleotide (Ian) gene family on rat chromosome 4.

In order, to better study the lymphopenia phenotype without possible confounding effects of diabetes or other autoimmune disease, we generated congenic F344.lyp rats by introgression of lyp on diabetes-resistant MHC RT1 lv1/lv1 F344 rats. Analysis of thymic CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes revealed no difference in the percentage of CD4(?)CD8(+)and CD4(+)CD8(?)subsets in lyp/lyp compared to +/+ F344 rats. The same subsets was however dramatically reduced in blood (P=0.005), spleen (P=0.019) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) (P<0.0001). Compared to F344 +/+ rats double positive CD4(+)CD8(+)T cells were increased only in lyp/lyp spleen (P=0.034) while double negative CD4(?)CD8(?)were increased in thymus (P=0.033), spleen (P=0.012), MLN (P<0.0001), and peripheral blood (P<0.0001).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: : A total of 31 patients presenting with persistent COVID-19 related OD and 97 patients with post-infectious OD were included. Olfactory bulb MRI, DTI and olfactory fMRI findings in both groups were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: : All COVID-19 related OD cases were anosmic, 18.6% of post-infectious OD patients were hyposmic and remaining 81.4% were anosmic. Mean interval between onset of OD and imaging was 1.5 months for COVID-19 related OD and 6 months for post-infectious OD. Olfactory bulb volumes were significantly higher in COVID-19 related OD than post-infectious OD. Deformed bulb morphology and increased olfactory bulb signal intensity was seen in 58.1% and 51.6% with COVID-19 related OD; and 63.9% and 46.4% with post-infectious OD; without significant difference. Significantly higher rate of olfactory nerve clumping and higher QA values at orbitofrontal and entorhinal regions were observed in COVID-19 related OD than post-infectious OD. Absence of orbitofrontal and entorhinal activity showed no statistically significant difference between COVID-19 related OD and post-infectious OD, however trigeminosensory activity was more robust in COVID-19 related OD cases. CONCLUSION: : Olfactory bulb damage may play a central role in persistent COVID-19 related anosmia. Though there is decreased olfactory bulb volume and decreased white matter tract integrity of olfactory regions in COVID-19 related anosmia, this is not as pronounced as in other post-infectious OD. Trigeminosensory activity was more robust in COVID-19 related OD.

Many studies analysed the mental health consequences of restrictive confinement, some of which focused their attention on specific populations. The general public's mental health also requires significant attention, however. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 quarantine on the general population's mental health in different European countries. Risk and protective factors associated with the psychological symptoms were analysed. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus and Google Scholar). Studies published up until 20th April 2021, and following eligibility criteria were selected for this review. One thousand three hundred thirty-five (1335) studies were screened, 105 of which were included. Via network analysis, the current study investigated the pathways that underlie possible risk factors for mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Anxiety, depression, distress and post-traumatic symptoms are frequently experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine and are often associated with changes in sleeping and eating habits. Some socio-demographic and COVID-19-related variables were found to be risk factors for an individual's wellbeing. In particular, being female, young, having a low income, being unemployed and having COVID-19-like symptoms or chronic disorders, were found to be the most common risk factors for mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic represented an unprecedented threat to mental health globally. In order to prevent psychological morbidity and offer support tailored to short-, medium- and long-term negative outcomes, it is essential to identify the direct and indirect psychosocial effects of the lockdown and quarantine measures, especially in certain vulnerable groups.

Bright-field images lack these downsides but also lack the clear contrast of the cellular components and hence are difficult to use for downstream analysis. Generating the fluorescence images directly from bright-field images using virtual staining (also known as label-free prediction and in-silico labeling) can get the best of both worlds, but can be very challenging to do for poorly visible cellular structures in the bright-field images. To tackle this problem deep learning models were explored to learn the mapping between bright-field and fluorescence images for adipocyte cell images. The models were tailored for each imaging channel, paying particular attention to the various challenges in each case, and those with the highest fidelity in extracted cell-level features were selected. The solutions included utilizing privileged information for the nuclear channel, and using image gradient information and adversarial training for the lipids channel.

Small case series have recently detected aPL in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL (anticardiolipin IgG/IgM/IgA, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I IgG/IgM/IgA, and anti- phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (PS/PT) IgG/IgM) in the sera of 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We detected anticardiolipin IgM antibodies in 23%, anti-PS/PT IgG in 24%, and anti-PS/PT IgM in 18%. Any aPL was present in 52% of patients using the manufacturer's threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff (>40 units). Higher levels of aPL were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity (including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps/NETs), higher platelet count, more severe respiratory disease, and lower glomerular filtration rates. Similar to patients with known and longstanding APS, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from control neutrophils. Furthermore, injection of these COVID-19 IgG fractions into mice accelerated venous thrombosis.

Another twenty, day-old layer pullets were fed the same control feed without SCFP and blank inoculated on Day 28 with 1 ml of sterile PBS to serve as a negative control (NCON). Qualitative and quantitative analyses of cecal Salmonella contents were performed for all birds on Day 32. The prevalence of SE in the ceca of all directly challenged birds was 100%, however, the SE concentration in birds fed SCFP diet (3.35 Log 10 CFU/g) was significantly lower ( P <0.0001) than that of the PCON birds not fed SCFP (4.49 Log 10 CFU/g). Moreover, the proportion of SE colonized individuals with enumerable SE concentrations was lower in SCFP fed birds (57.9%) when compared to the PCON (95.0%). These data suggest that inclusion of SCFP in the diet may aid in the reduction of SE within the ceca of commercial laying hens and could serve as an additional, pre-harvest food safety hurdle.","output":"The effect of feeding a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation derived postbiotic as a pre-harvest food safety hurdle for reducing Salmonella Enteritidis in the ceca of layer pullets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

These disorders are characterized by deficits in fear extinction and dysfunction in underlying neural circuitry. Given the strong and pervasive link between childhood trauma and the development of psychopathology, fear extinction may be a key mechanism. The present study tests the impact of childhood trauma exposure on fear extinction and underlying neural circuitry. Children (N = 44, 45% trauma-exposed; 6-11 yrs) completed a novel two-day virtual reality fear extinction experiment. On day one, participants underwent fear conditioning and extinction. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed a test of extinction recall during fMRI. Conditioned fear was measured throughout the experiment using skin conductance and fear-related behavior, and activation in fear-related brain regions was estimated during recall. There were no group differences in conditioned fear during fear conditioning or extinction learning. During extinction recall, however, trauma-exposed children kept more distance from both the previously extinguished and the safety cue, suggesting poor differentiation between threat and safety cues. Trauma-exposed youth also failed to approach the previously extinguished cue over the course of extinction recall. The effects on fear-related behavior during extinction recall were accompanied by higher activation to the previously extinguished cue in fear-relevant brain regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, in trauma-exposed relative to control children. Alterations in fear-related brain regions and fear-related behavior may be a core mechanism through which childhood trauma confers heightened vulnerability to psychopathology.","output":"Alterations in Fear Extinction Neural Circuitry and Fear-Related Behavior Linked to Trauma Exposure in Children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We document the importance of loan covenants to observed hedging outcomes, by studying lending agreements and derivative positions of U.S. oil and gas producers.

People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-?3 (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of severe pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by fever and cough. Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and ground-glass opacity; and a cytokine storm was found in these patients, which appeared more serious in critically ill patients.","output":"Clinical features of severe pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan: a single center's observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pet ownership can provide important companionship and facilitate social connections, which may be particularly important to socially isolated older adults. Given the significant deleterious impact of loneliness on health and wellbeing in later life, many predicted that public safety measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic would greatly increase loneliness, particularly among vulnerable populations like older adults. We investigated whether dog walking buffers loneliness in the context of stressors imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Longitudinal survey data were obtained from a Florida community-based sample of adults (n = 466) aged 60+ years old in September 2018 and October 2020. Using OLS regression models, we tested: a) the association between the social consequences of COVID-19 and changes in loneliness, and b) the buffering effect of dog walking on this relationship. The high social consequences of COVID-19 were related to increases in loneliness. Walking a dog daily buffered the relationship. These results suggest potential therapeutic effects of dog walking for the promotion of mental health in older adults, particularly in the context of stressful situations that accentuate risks for loneliness. ? 2021 by the authors.

Decisions are made about which activities to keep open across a range of social settings and venues guided only by ad hoc heuristics regarding social distancing and personal hygiene. Hence, we propose the dual use of computational fluid dynamic simulations and surrogate aerosol measurements for location-specific assessment of risk of infection across different real-world settings. We propose a 3-tiered risk assessment scheme to facilitate classification of scenarios into risk levels based on simulations and experiments. Threshold values of <54 and >840 viral copies and <5% and >40% of original aerosol concentration are chosen to stratify low, medium, and high risk. This can help prioritize allowable activities and guide implementation of phased lockdowns or re-opening. Using a public bus in Singapore as a case study, we evaluate the relative risk of infection across scenarios such as different activities and passenger positions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk assessment methodology as a simple and easily interpretable framework. For example, this study revealed that the bus's air-conditioning greatly influences dispersion and increases the risk of certain seats and that talking can result in similar relative risk to coughing for passengers around an infected person. Both numerical and experimental approaches show similar relative risk levels with a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.74 despite differing observables, demonstrating applicability of this risk assessment methodology to other scenarios.","output":"Risk assessment of airborne COVID-19 exposure in social settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Transmission of a novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2) from China has caused a global pandemic, resulting in an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems worldwide Frontline healthcare workers face considerable risk due to the potential for repeated exposure to infected individuals, many of whom may be asymptomatic given the lengthy incubation period of 5-10 days With rising incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates, appropriate training and support is paramount in safeguarding the wellbeing of NHS staff and patients Foundation doctors are among frontline staff being redeployed to areas of need They are a vital resource within the NHS;and are uniquely positioned to support and staff medical teams Methods: A 24 question digital survey with a mix of open-ended, multiple- choice, and rating-scale questions was distributed to the 18 UK Foundation Schools Questions established trainee demographics and the quantity of COVID-19 training received;with focused questions relating to personal safety and support for vulnerable individuals Results: 714 doctors completed the survey;55% in FY2, 43% in FY1, and 2% above FY2 level 74% of respondents reported receiving no formal training on COVID-19 Mean confidence was 84% in diagnosing COVID-19, and 56% in managing it 75% did not receive formal training on the requisite safety precautions for suspected COVID-19 cases 67% had not been fit tested and 75% of those who failed their fit test were not provided with alternative equipment 30 doctors reported being pregnant and none had received additional support regarding protective measures 47 doctors reported being immunocompromised and 42 of them had received no additional support in view of their increased risk 93% of doctors had not received definitive guidance regarding the impact of this on their ARCP sign-off and progression of training Conclusion: Alarming proportions of Foundation trainees are not currently being provided with formal training or support for their personal safety during the COVID-19 outbreak This is remediable through the urgent implementation of formal COVID-19 training, standardised across NHS trusts to ensure a consistent standard of care for the protection of trainees and patients","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on UK foundation doctors: Education and safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is a long held belief that maximal joint range of motion (ROM) is restricted by muscle tension.

This study aimed to determine whether a static stretching aiming to load the sciatic nerve without stretch within plantar flexors is effective to: (i) alter nerve stiffness; and (ii) increase the ankle's maximal ROM. Passive maximal ankle ROM in dorsiflexion was assessed with the hip flexed at 90 (HIP-flexed) or neutral (HIP-neutral, 0). Sciatic nerve stiffness was estimated using shear wave elastography. Sciatic nerve stretching induced both a 13.3  7.9% (P < 0.001) decrease in the nerve stiffness and a 6.4  2.6 increase in the maximal dorsiflexion ROM assessed in HIP-flexed. In addition, the decrease in sciatic nerve stiffness was significantly correlated with the change in maximal ROM in dorsiflexion (r = -0.571, P = 0.026).

Therefore, a substantial portion of kidney transplant recipients, especially those with intermediate and high HLA-DR/DQ molecular mismatch scores, remain under-immunosuppressed, which in turn identifies the need for novel agents that can more effectively prevent or treat TCMR.","output":"The negative impact of T-cell mediated rejection on renal allograft survival in the modern era."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The International Neuromodulation Society (INS) has determined that there is a need for guidance regarding safety and risk reduction for implantable neurostimulation devices. The INS convened an international committee of experts in the field to explore the evidence and clinical experience regarding safety, risks, and steps to risk reduction to improve outcomes. METHODS The Neuromodulation Appropriateness Consensus Committee (NACC) reviewed the world literature in English by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar to evaluate the evidence for ways to reduce risks of neurostimulation therapies. This evidence, obtained from the relevant literature, and clinical experience obtained from the convened consensus panel were used to make final recommendations on improving safety and reducing risks. RESULTS The NACC determined that the ability to reduce risk associated with the use of neurostimulation devices is a valuable goal and possible with best practice. The NACC has recommended several practice modifications that will lead to improved care. The NACC also sets out the minimum training standards necessary to become an implanting physician. CONCLUSIONS The NACC has identified the possibility of improving patient care and safety through practice modification. We recommend that all implanting physicians review this guidance and consider adapting their practice accordingly.","output":"The appropriate use of neurostimulation: avoidance and treatment of complications of neurostimulation therapies for the treatment of chronic pain.

However, the longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here we serially analysed immune responses in 113 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages, with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. An early elevation in cytokine levels was associated with worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, patients with moderate COVID-19 displayed a progressive reduction in type 1 (antiviral) and type 3 (antifungal) responses. By contrast, patients with severe COVID-19 maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of the disease. Moreover, severe COVID-19 was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors, including interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-13, immunoglobulin E and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified four immune signatures, representing growth factors (A), type-2/3 cytokines (B), mixed type-1/2/3 cytokines (C), and chemokines (D) that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories. The immune profiles of patients who recovered from moderate COVID-19 were enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature A, whereas the profiles of those with who developed severe disease had elevated levels of all four signatures.

STUDY DESIGN Systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressures were continuously sampled at 0.5 Hz via umbilical artery catheter from birth through 72 h. The raw data were aligned by postnatal hour and underwent error correction. For each infant, the mean values of systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure were calculated for each postnatal hour. The slope and intercept of best-fit line for each of the three blood pressure parameters was then calculated. Infants that received inotropic medications, died in the first 14 days of life, or had IVH grade III or IV were excluded. RESULT Using 11.9 million valid data points from 35 infants (mean EGA=25.7  1.5 weeks, mean birth weight=865  201 g), we found independent associations of African-American race (P<0.01) and a complete course of antenatal steroids (P<0.01) with higher blood pressures at birth and a slower rate of increase. Acute chorioamnionitis was independently associated (P=0.02) with lower blood pressures at birth and a faster rate of increase. EGA and birth weight were not independently predictive of blood pressure parameters. CONCLUSION We found that (i) the estimated mean blood pressure at birth is ~33 mmHg in a cohort of very preterm infants, (ii) blood pressure gradually increases with postnatal age, (iii) systolic blood pressure increases at a faster rate than diastolic blood pressure, (iv) race, antenatal steroid exposure and chorioamnionitis are independent modulators of blood pressure whereas EGA and birth weight are not.","output":"Empirical estimation of the normative blood pressure in infants <28 weeks gestation using a massive data approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decades, researchers have been seeking attractive substrate materials to keep microfluidics improving to outbalance the drawbacks and issues.

However, few published case reports exist describing the surgical treatment of ectopic kidneys with TCC. Surgical removal of a pelvic kidney can be complicated by aberrant vasculature supply, a tortuous ureter and abutting anatomical structures. Thus, it is necessary to determine the most appropriate surgical technique for treatment of pelvic kidneys with suspected malignancy. CASE PRESENTATION A 65-year-old female who presented with hematuria and lower abdominal pain was found to have a right pelvic kidney with a heterogeneous mass on computed tomography (CT) urogram. A robot-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy of the right pelvic kidney was performed. Histopathological analysis revealed high-grade TCC with microscopic extension through the muscularis propria of the renal pelvis and superficially into the renal parenchyma. CONCLUSION This case demonstrates the successful use of robot-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy in the treatment of a pelvic kidney with TCC. Preoperative CT angiography is critical to define vascular anatomy and to prevent significant blood loss and damage to surrounding structures during surgery. This case was presented because TCC of a pelvic kidney is a rare occurrence and the use of robot-assisted nephroureterectomy for treatment of this disease is novel.","output":"Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Nephroureterectomy for Transitional Cell Carcinoma of a Right Pelvic Kidney."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Came across Asia financial crisis in 1997 and global financial crisis in 2007, Malaysian banks have learned valuable and memorable lesson, resulting the banks are becoming stronger nowadays.

METHODS: From January to June of each year from 2017 to 2020, a total of 3,229 patients who were first diagnosed with colorectal cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Those enrolled from 2017 to 2019 were classified as the pre-COVID group, and those enrolled in 2020 were classified as the COVID group. The primary outcome was the rate of stage IV disease at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of stage IV patients between the pre-COVID and COVID groups (P=0.19). The median preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level in the COVID group was higher than in the pre-COVID group in all stages (all P<0.05).

Among these cells, myeloid cells have to eliminate cancer cells to reduce tumor size, but they are also able, depending on the tumor stage, to favor tumor development. Therefore, different cellular interactions and soluble factors that are produced by all these cells can participate to maintain tumor cell survival and favor their proliferation, migration, and resistance to cytotoxic immune cells and therapies. This revue aims to detail the physiological function of myeloid cells, their pathological function, and how they shape tumor cells to be resistant to apoptotic, to immune effector cells, and to therapies. ABSTRACT: Interactions between malignant cells and neighboring stromal and immune cells profoundly shape cancer progression. New forms of therapies targeting these cells have revolutionized the treatment of cancer. However, in order to specifically address each population, it was essential to identify and understand their individual roles in interaction between malignant cells, and the formation of the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we focus on the myeloid cell compartment, a prominent, and heterogeneous group populating TME, which can initially exert an anti-tumoral effect, but with time actively participate in disease progression. Macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils act alone or in concert to shape tumor cells resistance through cellular interaction and/or release of soluble factors favoring survival, proliferation, and migration of tumor cells, but also immune-escape and therapy resistance.","output":"Cancer Cells Resistance Shaping by Tumor Infiltrating Myeloid Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many countries enforcing a lockdown, whereby people are instructed to stay at home. AIM: The aim of this study was to capture the experience of such a lockdown in Australians living alone, with and without a dog or a cat. METHOD: Three hundred and eighty-four participants completed an online survey evaluating their levels of loneliness, mindfulness and mood. For participants who owned a dog or a cat, a measure of dog/cat interactions was also administered as well as two open-ended questions about how being a pet owner affected their experience of COVID-19 and how COVID-19 affected their pet. RESULTS: Contrary to expectations, cat owners were found to be less mindful than non-owners and pet interactions did not account for levels of loneliness or levels of mindfulness. In line with our expectations, however, stress and depression positively predicted loneliness, while mindfulness and being a dog owner were protective against it. Insights from qualitative responses suggest that this might be due to the fact that dogs encourage a routine which involves getting out of the house and walking, which itself offers opportunities to socialise with other people doing the same thing.

In addition, we face the spread of novel variants. Until we overcome the pandemic, reasonable mitigation and opening strategies are crucial to balance public health and economic interests. METHODS: We model the spread of SARS-CoV-2 over the German counties by a graph-SIR-type, metapopulation model with particular focus on commuter testing. We account for political interventions by varying contact reduction values in private and public locations such as homes, schools, workplaces, and other. We consider different levels of lockdown strictness, commuter testing strategies, or the delay of intervention implementation. We conduct numerical simulations to assess the effectiveness of the different intervention strategies after one month. The virus dynamics in the regions (German counties) are initialized randomly with incidences between 75 and 150 weekly new cases per 100,000 inhabitants (red zones) or below (green zones) and consider 25 different initial scenarios of randomly distributed red zones (between 2 and 20% of all counties). To account for uncertainty, we consider an ensemble set of 500 Monte Carlo runs for each scenario. RESULTS: We find that the strength of the lockdown in regions with out of control virus dynamics is most important to avoid the spread into neighboring regions. With very strict lockdowns in red zones, commuter testing rates of twice a week can substantially contribute to the safety of adjacent regions. In contrast, the negative effect of less strict interventions can be overcome by high commuter testing rates. A further key contributor is the potential delay of the intervention implementation. In order to keep the spread of the virus under control, strict regional lockdowns with minimum delay and commuter testing of at least twice a week are advisable. If less strict interventions are in favor, substantially increased testing rates are needed to avoid overall higher infection dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that local containment of outbreaks and maintenance of low overall incidence is possible even in densely populated and highly connected regions such as Germany or Western Europe. While we demonstrate this on data from Germany, similar patterns of mobility likely exist in many countries and our results are, hence, generalizable to a certain extent.

Virtual classrooms enable the combination of computer-based learning with interactive expert instruction. They may optimise resources and increase accessibility, facilitating larger-scale training with a similar educational benefit. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of virtual BSS classroom training compared to both non-interactive video and face-to-face teaching. Method: 72 medical students will be randomly assigned to three equal intervention groups based on year group and surgical skill confidence. Interventions will be implemented following an instructional video. Group A will practice independently, Group B will receive face-to-face training, and Group C will attend a virtual classroom. Participants will be recorded placing three interrupted sutures with hand tied knots preand post-intervention, and Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) will be blind marked by two experts. Change in confidence, time to completion and a granular performance score will also be measured. Each intervention's feasibility and accessibility will be assessed. Results: Data collection will be completed in January 2021. Significant improvement in OSATS within groups will be indicative of intervention quality. Difference in improvement between groups will determine the relative performance of the interventions. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this will be the largest randomised control trial investigating virtual BSS classroom training. It will serve as a comprehensive appraisal of the virtual classroom's suitability as an alternative to face-to-face training.

UAS titrations are performed 3 months after activation of the device to optimize its effectiveness. In general, these titrations are performed during an in-laboratory overnight polysomnography (PSG). However, overnight titrations are expensive and can be logistically challenging because they are labor-intensive which causes shortage of sleep technicians available for night shifts. In addition, recently, overnight PSGs were postponed and canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a daytime PSG to perform titration of UAS therapy as an alternative for a conventional overnight PSG. METHODS: We performed a prospective single-center observational cohort study. Patients were included when planned for UAS titration; this was approximately 6 months after UAS activation. Data on sleep architecture, patient experience, and respiratory outcomes were collected to evaluate the feasibility. An overnight follow-up PSG 12 months after implantation was used to compare sleep architecture and therapy response. RESULTS: Of 23 patients, four were excluded from analysis because of technical issues during PSG. Even though patients slept significantly shorter during the daytime PSG, this was enough time to complete the titration successfully with 30-min sleep in final therapeutic settings in 84% of the patients. Patients (94%) had a positive experience with the daytime titration. Respiratory outcomes were significantly reduced during titration and were maintained at the 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Daytime titrations are a valuable alternative for conventional overnight titrations. Our findings suggest the implementation of daytime titrations as standard of care. This will contribute to easier logistics and better work circumstances for sleep technicians without jeopardizing titration quality.","output":"Daytime polysomnography to perform titration for upper airway stimulation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this article is to compare and discuss the preparation of civilian and military nurses in meeting the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We build on the financial clearing framework of Eisenberg and Noe that allows the incorporation of a bailout policy that is based on discrete bailouts motivated by the types of stimulus checks people receive around the world as part of COVID-19 economical relief plans. We show that optimally allocating such bailouts on a financial network in order to maximize a variety of social welfare objectives of this form is a computationally intractable problem. We develop approximation algorithms to optimize these objectives and establish guarantees for their approximation rations. Then, we incorporate multiple fairness constraints in the optimization problems and establish relative bounds on the solutions with versus without these constraints. Finally, we apply our methodology to a variety of data, both in the context of a system of large financial institutions with real-world data, as well as in a realistic societal context with financial interactions between people and businesses for which we use semi-artificial data derived from mobility patterns.

Various automated immunoassays for measuring PCT in patient plasma are available in medical laboratories. However, due to a lack of international reference material for PCT, the assays are not always comparable. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we compared a new turbidimetric immunoassay from DiaSys, measured on the Abbott Architect c16000 and Alinity c, with four BRAHMS-associated chemiluminescence immunoassays (Abbott Architect i2000SR, Alinity i, Roche Cobas e411 and DiaSorin Liaison XL) using 120 random patient plasma samples from the clinical laboratory routine at the University Medical Center Goettingen. RESULTS: The DiaSys assay showed clear differences as compared to the BRAHMS-associated assays when measured on Architect c: i.e. 58% positive mean bias vs. Architect i, 67% vs. Cobas and 23% vs. Liaison. As a result, additional 19% our patients would have a suspected bacterial infection, when using PCT values from the DiaSys assay and commonly accepted decision limits. A crosscheck of the DiaSys calibrator on the BRAHMS-associated systems showed a low recovery of the calibrator material (approx. 50%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study shows significant differences between the DiaSys and BRAHMS-associated assays. This could be attributed to a potential DiaSys calibrator problem.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to construct intraoperative nomograms using OSNA for the prediction of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis and four or more axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases. METHODS Of the 4736 breast cancer patients (T1-3, N0) who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and had SLNs examined intraoperatively with OSNA, 623 with SLN metastasis treated with completion ALN dissection (cALND) were retrospectively analyzed, and were randomly divided into training (n = 312) and validation (n = 311) sets. RESULTS Of the clinicopathological parameters available preoperatively and intraoperatively, the multivariate analysis of the training set revealed that clinical tumor size and total tumor load (TTL) determined by OSNA were significantly associated with NSLN metastasis, and that clinical tumor size, number of macrometastatic SLNs, and TTL were significantly associated with four or more ALN metastases. Nomograms for NSLN metastasis and four or more ALN metastases were constructed using these parameters, and their area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the validation set were both 0.70, with a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of previously reported postoperative nomograms. CONCLUSIONS We constructed intraoperative nomograms using OSNA for the prediction of NSLN metastasis and four or more ALN metastases.

Cross-species transmission of CPV occurs as a result of mutations on the viral capsid surface that alter the species-specific binding to the host receptor, transferrin receptor type-1 (TfR). The interaction between CPV and TfR has been extensively studied, and previous analyses have suggested that the CPV-TfR complex is asymmetric. To enhance the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, we determined the CPV-TfR interaction using cryo-electron microscopy to solve the icosahedral (3.0-? resolution) and asymmetric (5.0-? resolution) complex structures. Structural analyses revealed conformational variations of the TfR molecules relative to the binding site, which translated into dynamic molecular interactions between CPV and TfR. The precise footprint of the receptor on the virus capsid was identified, along with the identity of the amino acid residues in the virus-receptor interface.

Two evolutionary trends that contribute to the mechanical complexity of the avian foot are the variation in the relative lengths of the phalanges and the subdivision and variation of the digital flexor musculature observed among taxa. We modelled the grasping behaviour of a simplified bird foot in response to the downward and upward forces imparted by carrying and perching tasks, respectively. Specifically, we compared the performance of various foot geometries performing these tasks when actuated by distally inserted flexors only, versus by both distally inserted and proximally inserted flexors. Our analysis demonstrates that most species possess relative phalanx lengths that are conducive to grasps actuated only by a single distally inserted tendon per digit. Furthermore, proximally inserted flexors are often required during perching, but the distally inserted flexors are sufficient when grasping and carrying objects. These results are reflected in differences in the relative development of proximally and distally inserted digital flexor musculature among 'perching' and 'grasping' taxa.

However, there is a lack of data that describe the scope of practice of neurointensivists and epidemiological data on the types of patients and treatments used in neurocritical care units worldwide. To address these issues, we designed a multicenter, international, point-prevalence, cross-sectional, prospective, observational, non-interventional study in the setting of neurocritical care (PRINCE Study). METHODS: In this manuscript, we analyzed data from the initial phase of the study that included registration, hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU) organizations. We present here descriptive statistics to summarize data from the registration case report form. We performed the KruskalCWallis test followed by the Dunn procedure to test for differences in practices among world regions. RESULTS: We analyzed information submitted by 257 participating sites from 47 countries. The majority of those sites, 119 (46.3%), were in North America, 44 (17.2%) in Europe, 34 (13.3%) in Asia, 9 (3.5%) in the Middle East, 34 (13.3%) in Latin America, and 14 (5.5%) in Oceania. Most ICUs are from academic institutions (73.4%) located in large urban centers (44% > 1 million inhabitants). We found significant differences in hospital and ICU organization, resource allocation, and use of patient management protocols. The highest nursing/patient ratio was in Oceania (100% 1:1). Dedicated Advanced Practiced Providers are mostly present in North America (73.7%) and are uncommon in Oceania (7.7%) and the Middle East (0%).

Substrate transport with varying stoichiometry and specificity is achieved through an exchange mechanism and/or through coupling of the uptake of anionic substrates to typically co-transported Na(+). Recently solved outward-facing structures of two SLC4 members (human anion exchanger 1 [hAE1] and human electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 1 [hNBCe1]) with different transport modes (Cl(?)/HCO(3)(?) exchange versus Na(+)-CO(3)(2?) symport) revealed highly conserved three-dimensional organization of their transmembrane domains. However, the exact location of the ion binding sites and their proteinCion coordination motifs are still unclear. In the present work, we combined site identification by ligand competitive saturation mapping and extensive molecular dynamics sampling with functional mutagenesis studies which led to the identification of two substrate binding sites (entry and central) in the outward-facing states of hAE1 and hNBCe1. Mutation of residues in the identified binding sites led to impaired transport in both proteins. We also showed that R730 in hAE1 is crucial for anion binding in both entry and central sites, whereas in hNBCe1, a Na(+) acts as an anchor for CO(3)(2?) binding to the central site. Additionally, protonation of the central acidic residues (E681 in hAE1 and D754 in hNBCe1) alters the ion dynamics in the permeation cavity and may contribute to the transport mode differences in SLC4 proteins.

The paper microdevice is composed of two parts: sample and reaction chambers. A sealing film acted as a bottom layer to allow foldable motion for transferring DNA from sample chamber to reaction chamber in a seamless manner. An FTA card was employed in the sample chamber for DNA extraction and purification from bacterial milk-spiked samples. After LAMP reaction at 65 C for 30 min, a novel aggregation-based DNA detection was obtained by Safranin O polymerization in the reaction chamber. Specifically, Safranin O underwent polymerization by addition of oxidant to form Safranin O oligomers. The electrostatic interaction between the positively charged Safranin O oligomers and the negatively charged DNA comprising LAMP amplicons resulted in the aggregation with a dark red color. Meanwhile, in the absence of LAMP amplicons, Safranin O oligomers were well dispersed and displayed their original red color. By using Safranin O-based detection, SARS-CoV-2 and E. faecium were successfully identified by naked eye within 60 min, and the limits of detection were 10-4 ng/L and 102 CFU/mL, respectively.

In this study, we have exploited the structural information to identify the residues that are important for the catalytic activity of 2-O MTase of VP4 and their influence on BTV replication. The effect of these mutations on GMP binding, guanylyltransferase (GTase) and methylase activities were analysed by a series of in vitro biochemical assays using recombinant mutant proteins; subsequently their effects on virus replication were assessed by introducing the same mutations in replicating viral genome using a reverse genetics system. Our data showed that single substitution mutations in the catalytic tetrad K-D-K-E were sufficient to abolish 2-O MTase activity in vitro and to completely abrogate BTV replication in cells; although these mutants retained the upstream GMP binding, GTase and guanine-N7-methyltransferase activities. Mutations of the surrounding substrate-binding pocket (predicted to recruit cap0) had variable effects on in vitro VP4 capping activity. Only triple but not single substitution mutations of these residues in genome resulted in reduced virus replication kinetics.

For cancer patients, delays may significantly impair outcomes in some situations. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in breast and cervical cancer diagnosis and treatment compared to the same period prior to the pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected from patients attending their first visit to a Brazilian cancer centre from 1 September 2020 to 31 January 2021 and from 1 September 2019 to 31 January 2020. The pandemic started in February 2020 in Brazil and is still ongoing. We considered this period (September/20CJanuary/21) to be representative of the pandemic impact on cancer management. The primary endpoint was breast and cervical cancer stages at diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 268 breast cancer patients and 44 cervical cancer patients had their first consult in our cancer centre from September/20 to January/21; 457 and 60, respectively, occurred from September/19 to January/20. Patients who attended their first visit during the pandemic (September/20CJanuary/21) presented with more advanced-stage breast cancer (p < 0.001) and cervical cancer (p = 0.328) than those in the period prior to the pandemic (September/19CJanuary/20), although the difference was not statistically significant for cervical cancer. The proportion of cervical cancer patients diagnosed with locally advanced disease (stages IIICIVA) was 56.8% (N = 25) in September/20CJanuary/21 compared to 43.3% (N = 26) in September/19CJanuary/20. Similarly, 37.3% (N = 100) of breast cancer patients had stage III disease in September/20CJanuary/21 compared to 23.2% (N = 106) in September/19CJanuary/20.

While pooled testing offers substantial savings in cost and time, the size of the optimum pool that offers complete concordance with results of individualized testing remains elusive. To determine the optimum pool size, we first evaluated the utility of pool testing using simulated 5-sample pools with varying proportions of positive and negative samples. We observed that 5-sample pool testing resulted in false negativity rate of 5% when the pools contained one positive sample. We then examined the diagnostic performance of 4-sample pools in the operational setting of a diagnostic laboratory using 500 consecutive samples in 125 pools. With background prevalence of 2.4%, this 4-sample pool testing showed 100% concordance with individualized testing and resulted in 66% and 59% reduction in resource and turnaround time, respectively. Since the negative predictive value of a diagnostic test varies inversely with prevalence, we re-tested the 4-sample pooling strategy using a fresh batch of 500 samples in 125 pools when the prevalence rose to 12.7% and recorded 100% concordance and reduction in cost and turnaround time by 36% and 30%, respectively.

Social psychological factors such as institutional trust could be important in understanding the development of the epidemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine country variations of COVID-19 mortality in Europe by analyzing social risk factors explaining the spread of the disease, restrictions and control measures, and institutional trust. METHODS: The present study was based on a background analysis of European Social Survey data on 25 European countries (N=47,802). Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models focused on 84 days of the COVID-19 epidemic (January 22 to April 14, 2020) and modelled the daily COVID-19 mortality. Analysis focused on the impact of social relations, restrictions, and institutional trust within each country. RESULTS: The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere, but the findings revealed significant differences between countries in COVID-19 mortality. Perceived sociability predicted higher COVID-19 mortality. Major differences between the 25 countries were found in reaction times to the crisis. Late reaction to the crisis predicted later mortality figures. Institutional trust was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality.

Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) night-time light datasets can precisely detect the intensity and scope of human activities. Accurate and temporal monitoring of urban areas and urban sprawls is highly imperative to the detection and assessment of regional development of a region. This study quantitatively assessed and mapped the light extents and urban region in Kerala, one of the southwest Indian states from 2012 to 2020 with the help of low light imaging day/night band data collected from the VIIRS and utilised VIIRS night time Lights V.2 time series from the monthly averages with filtering to eliminate extraneous features such as aurora, biomass burning, and background. ISOCLUSTER based classification and the threshold methods are used for the light extent and urban region extraction respectively. The result indicated that the Kerala State experienced very high urbanization from 2012 to 2019. But in the case of 2020, there was a decrement in the radiance due to the lockdown and night curfews followed by the COVID-19 global pandemic.

The Asociacin Espa?ola de Gastroenterologa (AEG) and the Sociedad Espa?ola de Endoscopia Digestiva (SEED) have proposed the EPAGE guidelines for managing postponed colonoscopies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the EPAGE guidelines as a management tool compared to the immunologic faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) and compared to risk score (RS) that combines age, sex and the iFOBT for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and significant bowel disease (SBD). METHODS: A prospective, single-centre study enrolling 743 symptomatic patients referred for a diagnostic colonoscopy. Each order was classified according to the EPAGE guidelines as appropriate, indeterminate or inappropriate. Patients underwent an iFOBT and had their RS calculated. RESULTS: The iFOBT (p<0.001), but not the EPAGE guidelines (p = 0.742), was an independent predictive factor of risk of CRC. The ROC AUCs for the EPAGE guidelines, the iFOBT and the RS were 0.61 (95% CI 0.49-0.75), 0.95 (0.93-0.97) and 0.90 (0.87-0.93) for CRC, and 0.55 (0.49-0.61), 0.75 (0.69-0.813) and 0.78 (0.73-0.83) for SBD, respectively. The numbers of colonoscopies needed to detect a case of CRC and a case of SBD were 38 and seven for the EPAGE guidelines, seven and two for the iFOBT, and 19 and four for a RS 5 points, respectively. CONCLUSION: The EPAGE guidelines, unlike the iFOBT, is not suitable for screening candidate patients for a diagnostic colonoscopy to detect CRC. The iFOBT, in combination with age and sex, is the most suitable strategy for managing demand for endoscopy in a restricted-access situation.","output":"EPAGE no es una estrategia eficaz para la gestin de colonoscopias durante la pandemia por COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate burnout and resilience among emergency physicians (EPs) at university teaching hospitals during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In April to May 2021, a survey was administered to 331 and 309 emergency medicine specialists and residents, respectively, from 31 university teaching hospitals in Korea. Data on the respondents age, sex, designation, working area, experience with treating COVID-19 patients, and personal experience with COVID-19 were collected. Based on the participants characteristics, quality of life (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress), resilience, emotional content, and self-image were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 247 responses were analyzed. Compared to specialists, compassion satisfaction and resilience in residents were not good, burnout was severe, and emotional content and self-image were less positive. Experiences with treating COVID-19 patients did not cause any difference in quality of life, resilience, emotional content, and self-image among participant subgroups. Personal COVID-19 experiences were associated with poor compassion satisfaction, resilience, less positive emotional content and self-image, and severe burnout. Compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, and resilience can definitively affect burnout.

Molnupiravir is an oral, small-molecule antiviral prodrug that is active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with molnupiravir started within 5 days after the onset of signs or symptoms in nonhospitalized, unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19 illness. Participants in the trial were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of molnupiravir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy end point was the incidence hospitalization or death at day 29; the incidence of adverse events was the primary safety end point. A planned interim analysis was performed when 50% of 1550 participants (target enrollment) had been followed through day 29. RESULTS: A total of 1433 participants underwent randomization; 716 were assigned to receive molnupiravir and 717 to receive placebo. With the exception of an imbalance in sex, baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The superiority of molnupiravir was demonstrated at the interim analysis; the risk of hospitalization for any cause or death through day 29 was lower with molnupiravir (28 of 385 participants [7.3%]) than with placebo (53 of 377 [14.1%]) (difference, ?6.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, ?11.3 to ?2.4; P=0.001). In the analysis of all participants who had undergone randomization, the percentage of participants who were hospitalized or died through day 29 was lower in the molnupiravir group than in the placebo group (6.8% [48 of 709] vs. 9.7% [68 of 699]; difference, ?3.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, ?5.9 to ?0.1). Results of subgroup analyses were largely consistent with these overall results; in some subgroups, such as patients with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, those with low baseline viral load, and those with diabetes, the point estimate for the difference favored placebo. One death was reported in the molnupiravir group and 9 were reported in the placebo group through day 29. Adverse events were reported in 216 of 710 participants (30.4%) in the molnupiravir group and 231 of 701 (33.0%) in the placebo group.

RAW264.7 macrophages were used, and after macrophages exposing to 1 M CdTe QDs for 24 h, oxidative stress occurred. Further investigation found that CdTe QDs triggered ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells. And deferoxamine mesylate alleviated the excessive lipid hydroperoxide caused by QDs. Mechanistically, CdTe QDs-provoked decrease of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) elicited phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) and then activated ferritinophagy, which made ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) degraded in lysosome and proteasome to release free iron ions to initiate ferroptosis in macrophages. This paper updates the mechanism of macrophage activation by CdTe QDs with regard to ferritinophagy, and more importantly, identifies the key role of NRF2 and ERK1/2.

In some host species, for example cattle, pigs, rabbits and human beings, attaching-effacing Escherichia coli (AEEC) have an established role as enteropathogens. In other host species, AE bacteria are of less certain significance. With continuing advances in the detection and typing of AE strains, the importance of these bacteria for many hosts is likely to become clearer. The pathogenic effects of AE bacteria result from adhesion to the intestinal mucosa by a variety of mechanisms, culminating in the formation of the characteristic intimate adhesion of the AE lesion. The ability to induce AE lesions is mediated by the co-ordinated expression of some 40 bacterial genes organized within a so-called pathogenicity island, known as the Locus for Enterocyte Effacement. It is also believed that the production of bacterial toxins, principally Vero toxins, is a significant virulence factor for some AEEC strains. Recent areas of research into AE bacteria include: the use of Citrobacter rodentium to model human AEEC disease; quorum-sensing mechanisms used by AEEC to modulate virulence gene expression; and the potential role of adhesion in the persistent colonization of the intestine by AE bacteria. This review of AE bacteria covers their molecular biology, their occurrence in various animal species, and the diagnosis, pathology and clinical aspects of animal diseases with which they are associated.

We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged 20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 57% (95% CI 51C64) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 149% (132C169) by Jan 15, 2021. With 265% (234C298) of adult residents having been infected in ?le-de-France (Paris region) compared with 51% (45C58) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 050) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 074). The proportion infected was twice as high (204%, 156C263) in 20C49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (97%, 69C141). 402% (343C463) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 493% (429C559) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 089).

Our environment is changing at an unprecedented rate, and human-related factors, which are essential components of any epidemic prediction model, are difficult to foresee in our increasingly dynamic societies. Any epidemiological model is, by definition, an abstraction of the real world, and fundamental assumptions and simplifications are therefore required. Indicator-based surveillance methods and, more recently, Internet biosurveillance systems can detect and monitor outbreaks of infections more rapidly and accurately than ever before. As the interactions between microorganisms, humans and the environment are too numerous and unexpected to be accurately represented in a mathematical model, we argue that prediction and model-based management of epidemics in their early phase are quite unlikely to become the norm.","output":"Modelling in infectious diseases: between haphazard and hazard"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS To assess changes in glucose metrics and their association with psychological distress and lifestyle changes in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using flash glucose monitoring (FGM) during lockdown following SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS Single-center, observational, retrospective study enrolling T1D patients who attended a remote visit on April 2020 at the Endocrinology division of the University Hospital Policlinico Consorziale, Bari, Italy. Lockdown-related changes in physical activity level and dietary habits were assessed on a semi-quantitative basis. Changes in general well-being were assessed by the General Health Questionnaire-12 items (GHQ-12) with a binary scoring system. Glucose metrics were obtained from the Libreview platform for the first two weeks of February 2020 (T0) and the last two weeks before the phone visit (T1). RESULTS Out of 84 patients assessed for eligibility, 48 had sufficient FGM data to be included in the analysis. FGM data analysis revealed significant reductions in coefficient of variation (CV), number of hypoglycemic events and time below range (TBR), while no changes were found in time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR), mean sensor glucose (MSG) and glucose management indicator (GMI). Moreover, the frequency of sweets consumption was inversely related to the occurrence of hypoglycemic events during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS Lockdown-related lifestyle changes, albeit unhealthy, may lead to reduction in FGM-derived measures of hypoglycemia and glycemic variability in patients with T1D.

The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced in Taiwan in October 2005. There has been no comprehensive study of the etiology of childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), either in the pre- or postpneumococcal conjugate vaccine era, in Taiwan. METHODS From August 2001 to July 2002, consecutive children admitted to a teaching hospital with radiologically confirmed CAP were prospectively enrolled. The following were considered indicative of infection when positive: blood or pleural effusion bacterial culture or urinary Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen test (Binax NOW), direct immunofluorescent antigen test for Chlamydia species and viruses, virus isolation and identification and viral, mycoplasmal or chlamydial serologic tests. RESULTS A total of 209 children were included, and 102 children (48.8%) were male. Patients' ages ranged from 7 months to 16 years with a median of 4 years and 3 months. The combined tests identified at least 1 etiologic agent in 85.6% of all cases, including typical bacterial pathogens in 88 cases (42.1%; 86 S. pneumoniae, 1 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis), Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 77 cases (36.8%), Chlamydia species in 24 cases (11.5%), viral etiology in 86 cases (41.1%) and mixed viral-bacterial infections in 69 cases (33%). Children with S. pneumoniae infection were significantly younger than those with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (P = 0.0055) or unknown etiology (P = 0.0140). CONCLUSION S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and viruses were equally common etiologic agents of childhood CAP in Taiwan.

In many cases, workers cover respirators with available masks in an attempt to extend their effectiveness against the virus. Due to low mask supplies, many people instead are using face coverings improvised from common fabrics. Our goal was to determine what fabrics would be most effective in both practices. Under laboratory conditions, we examined the hydrophobicity of fabrics (cotton, polyester, silk), as measured by their resistance to the penetration of small and aerosolized water droplets, an important transmission avenue for the virus causing COVID-19. We also examined the breathability of these fabrics and their ability to maintain hydrophobicity despite undergoing repeated cleaning. Laboratory-based tests were conducted when fabrics were fashioned as an overlaying barrier for respirators and when constructed as face coverings. When used as material in these two situations, silk was more effective at impeding the penetration and absorption of droplets due to its greater hydrophobicity relative to other tested fabrics. We found that silk face coverings repelled droplets in spray tests as well as disposable single-use surgical masks, and silk face coverings have the added advantage over masks such that they can be sterilized for immediate reuse. We show that silk is a hydrophobic barrier to droplets, can be more breathable than other fabrics that trap humidity, and are re-useable via cleaning. We suggest that silk can serve as an effective material for making hydrophobic barriers that protect respirators, and silk can now be tested under clinical conditions to verify its efficacy for this function. Although respirators are still the most appropriate form of protection, silk face coverings possess properties that make them capable of repelling droplets.","output":"A laboratory-based study examining the properties of silk fabric to evaluate its potential as a protective barrier for personal protective equipment and as a functional material for face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The public health response to the current Coronavirus pandemic in long-term care communities, including assisted living, encompasses prohibiting visitors.

I argue that classifying family as visitors rather than essential care partners overlooks their critical contributions and stems from taken-for-granted assumption about gender, families, and care work, and I demonstrate why families are more than visitors. Policies that ban family visits also reflect a narrow understanding of health that focuses on mitigating infection risk, but neglects overall health and well-being. This policy further stems from a limited comprehension of care relations. Research shows that banning family visits has negative consequences for residents, but also families themselves, and direct care workers.

Given the current uncertainty of drug safety for NSAID use in patients with COVID-19, we performed a nationwide register-based study on the association of recent ibuprofen exposure and COVID-19 severity. Methods: : Using national administrative databases, we identified COVID-19 patients in Denmark between end of February 2020 and April 2, 2020. Patients <30 years of age and heart failure, for whom ibuprofen is not recommended, were excluded. Ibuprofen exposure was defined using the Danish National Prescription Registry, where we had information until January 31, 2020.

Besides its regulatory pathway involving ganglion cells in the retina, the neural connections between the eyes and the pineal gland include the master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei, and the central and peripheral nervous systems. Since pineal melatonin is released into the blood and into the cerebrospinal fluid, it has access to every cell in an organism and it mediates system-wide effects. Subsequently, melatonin was found in several extrapineal organs and, more recently, perhaps in every cell of every organ. In contrast to the pinealocytes, non-pineal cells do not discharge melatonin into the blood; rather it is used locally in an intracrine, autocrine, or paracrine manner. Melatonin levels in non-pineal cells do not exhibit a circadian rhythm and do not depend on circulating melatonin concentrations although when animals are treated with exogenous melatonin it is taken up by presumably all cells. Mitochondria are the presumed site of melatonin synthesis in all cells; the enzymatic machinery for melatonin synthesis has been identified in mitochondria. The association of melatonin with mitochondria, because of its ability to inhibit oxidative stress, is very fortuitous since these organelles are a major site of damaging reactive oxygen species generation.

The CO(2) concentration in over 99% of the functional spaces is below the threshold of 1000 ppm. However, the dissatisfaction rate of the air freshness is higher than 25%, owing to the characteristics of healthcare activities.

However, subcapsular or lesions close to adjacent viscera preclude a percutaneous approach. In this setting laparoscopic-RFA (LRFA) is a potential alternative. The aim of this study was to analyse the safety and feasibility of LRFA in patients with HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective study of patients with HCC meeting strict inclusion criteria who underwent LRFA at a single Institution from December 2000 to March 2013. RESULTS Forty-one patients underwent 42 LRFA of 51 nodules. The median size of the nodule was 2.5 (range 1.2-4.7) cm. Thirty-one tumours were subcapsular and 17 located near the gallbladder. Major complications occurred in 17 patients. The initial complete response (ICR) rate was 94% and was lower among tumours located adjacent to the gallbladder. At the end of the follow-up period, the sustained complete response (SCR) rate was 70% and was lower in tumours adjacent to the gallbladder while increased for subcapsular tumours.

Lockdowns for pandemic control have health, social and economic consequences. We consider access to healthcare before and during COVID-19 with those working and living in slum communities. METHODS: In seven slums in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, we explored stakeholder perspectives and experiences of healthcare access for non-COVID-19 conditions in two periods: pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 lockdowns. RESULTS: Between March 2018 and May 2020, we engaged with 860 community leaders, residents, health workers and local authority representatives. Perceived common illnesses in all sites included respiratory, gastric, waterborne and mosquitoborne illnesses and hypertension. Pre-COVID, stakeholders described various preventive, diagnostic and treatment services, including well-used antenatal and immunisation programmes and some screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, HIV and vectorborne disease. In all sites, pharmacists and patent medicine vendors were key providers of treatment and advice for minor illnesses. Mental health services and those addressing gender-based violence were perceived to be limited or unavailable. With COVID-19, a reduction in access to healthcare services was reported in all sites, including preventive services. Cost of healthcare increased while household income reduced. Residents had difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. Fear of being diagnosed with COVID-19 discouraged healthcare seeking. Alleviators included provision of healthcare by phone, pharmacists/drug vendors extending credit and residents receiving philanthropic or government support; these were inconsistent and inadequate. CONCLUSION: Slum residents ability to seek healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions has been reduced during lockdowns. To encourage healthcare seeking, clear communication is needed about what is available and whether infection control is in place. Policymakers need to ensure that costs do not escalate and unfairly disadvantage slum communities. Remote consulting to reduce face-to-face contact and provision of mental health and gender-based violence services should be considered.","output":"Impact of the societal response to COVID-19 on access to healthcare for non-COVID-19 health issues in slum communities of Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan: results of pre-COVID and COVID-19 lockdown stakeholder engagements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is an exploratory study of two epidemiological questions on a worldwide basis.

The observed role of androgens in transcription of transmembrane protease serine-2, which facilitates COVID-19 anchoring to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cell surface receptors, seems to suggest that higher testosterone levels might be detrimental for outcomes. On the other hand, men with type 2 diabetes mellitus and central obesity have an increased prevalence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, with inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion induced by inflammatory cytokines being one of the postulated mechanisms.

Subsequent immunostaining for galectin-3 (encoded by Lgals3), also referred to as MAC2, highlighted the high expression levels of MAC2 protein in infiltrating myeloid cells in JHMV-infected and bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice, in stark contrast to microglia, which expressed little to no staining in these models. Expression of MAC2 was found even 6-10 months following BM-derived cell infiltration into the CNS.

Comparison was made by means of multilevel logistic regression analysis. Possible complications of antibiotic use were also identified. RESULTS: Out of 13,932 patients, 3047 (21.6%) were prescribed no antibiotics, 6116 (43.9%) were appropriately prescribed antibiotics, and 4769 (34.2%) were inappropriately prescribed antibiotics. The following were independent factors of inappropriate prescription: February-March 2020 admission (OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.18C2.00), age (OR 0.98, 95%CI 0.97C0.99), absence of comorbidity (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.05C1.94), dry cough (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.94C3.26), fever (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.13C1.56), dyspnea (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.04C1.69), flu-like symptoms (OR 2.70, 95%CI 1.75C4.17), and elevated C-reactive protein levels (OR 1.01 for each mg/L increase, 95% CI 1.00C1.01). Adverse drug reactions were more frequent in patients who received ANTIBIOTIC (4.9% vs 2.7%, p < .001). CONCLUSION: The inappropriate use of antibiotics was very frequent in COVID-19 patients and entailed an increased risk of adverse reactions. It is crucial to define criteria for their use in these patients. Knowledge of the factors associated with inappropriate prescribing can be helpful.","output":"Inappropriate antibiotic use in the COVID-19 era: Factors associated with inappropriate prescribing and secondary complications.

Es wurden von 297 therapie-naiven PatientInnen unter anderem die bestkorrigierte Sehsch?rfe (BCVA) als Logarithmus des minimalen Aufl?sungswinkels (logMAR) und die anatomischen Ergebnisse bei Diagnosestellung und bei jeder Nachuntersuchung erfasst. Therapie-naive PatientInnen, bei denen mindestens 24 Monate vor dem ersten pandemiebedingten Lockdown eine Therapie begonnen und somit ausschlie?lich vor der Pandemie (n=123) behandelt wurden, wurden mit PatientInnen verglichen, die innerhalb von 12 Monaten vor dem ersten Lockdown die Therapie starteten und somit w?hrend der Pandemie (n=174) behandelt wurden. Es wurden beide Gruppen ber einen Zeitraum von zwei Jahren beobachtet. In der Gruppe, die vor der COVID-19 Pandemie behandelt wurde, blieb die Sehsch?rfe, verglichen zum Ausgangswert (0,580,41 logMAR) bis zum Ende des Beobachtungszeitraums (0,540,34 logMAR) stabil (p=0,228).

This study aimed to compare the quality of care of treatment-na?ve patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) receiving intravitreal aflibercept therapy before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with patients receiving the same therapy during the pandemic. We enrolled 297 treatment-na?ve patients who received intravitreal aflibercept and measured visual acuity (VA) as the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) and anatomical outcomes at each follow-up. These outcome criteria were compared between patients that started therapy within one year before the COVID-19 pandemic (n=174) and those that started therapy in 2017 (n=123, control group) with a two-year follow-up. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Patients treated before the COVID-19 pandemic did not lose vision during their follow up and at their 24-month visit (0.580.41 logMAR) compared to baseline (0.540.34 logMAR; p=0.228). VA in patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic dropped below the baseline (0.560.35 logMAR) within 24-month of follow-up (0.790.43 logMAR; p=0.010). Compared to the patients treated before the COVID-19 pandemic, the latter group showed a significantly worse VA at the 6-month (p=0.041), 12-month (p=0.040), 18-month (p=0.024), 21-month (p=0.035), and 24-month (p=0.004) follow-up. Additionally, the group treated during the COVID-19 pandemic received significantly fewer aflibercept injections (3,941,9 vs. 3,301,6; p=0,007) and less follow-up examinations (2,711,2 vs. 2,160,9; p<0,001) in the second year compared to the group that was treated before the COVID-19 pandemic. We confirmed significantly worse VA outcomes in the group treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Impeded access to care could be attributed to the restrictions imposed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Die Auswirkungen der COVID-19-Pandemie auf die Versorgungsqualit?t von therapie-naiven PatientInnen mit neovaskul?rer altersbedingter Makuladegeneration unter intravitrealer Aflibercept-Therapie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on time spent cooking and parental inclusion of children in cooking. A secondary aim was to investigate differences between those who frequently included their children in cooking activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and those that included their children less, on a number of factors such as working from home, parents' diet quality and cooking skills confidence. DESIGN: Cross-continental survey with Wilcoxon signed ranks, Independent t-tests, Mann Whitney-U, Chi2, and a binomial logistic regression used for assessment. SETTING: Online. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of parents over 18 years from the island of Ireland (N=180), Great Britain (N=312), United States of America (N=120), New Zealand (N=166). RESULTS: In three regions, parents' time spent cooking and inclusion of children in everyday cooking activities increased (p<0.001). Country (OR=3.6, 95% CI=1.7-7.6), education (OR=1.6, 95% CI =1.1-2.4), cooking skills confidence (OR=1.02, 95% CI=1.009-1.032) and a parental higher intake of vegetables (OR=1.3, 95% CI=1.1-1.5) were significant predictors of a more frequent inclusion of children in cooking activities. CONCLUSIONS: While there a number of key benefits to including children in cooking for the children such as providing life skills and increases in diet quality, this study highlighted a higher intake of vegetables by parents who included children more frequently in cooking activities. With continued lockdowns due to COVID-19 and perhaps more flexibility in working from home in the future, including children in cooking activities should be a key public health message for both children and parents.","output":"From the pandemic to the pan: The impact of COVID19 on parental inclusion of children in cooking activities - a cross-continental survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Curfew was declared for the people 65 years and older to protect from the COVID-19 pandemic by the government in Turkey on 21 March 2020.

METHODS We conducted a systematic review of 17 studies evaluating discontinuation of CPs for MRSA and VRE. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to determine the pooled risk ratios of pre incidence hospital-associated infection rate to post incidence rate. Subgroup analysis was used to assess sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS No significant difference between rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection before and after stopping the CPs was observed (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 - 1.01; p = 0.06). An inverse association was observed between discontinuation of CPs and rates of hospital-associated VRE infection (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 - 0.94; p =0.005). A subgroup analysis of six studies that used chlorhexidine, showed no difference between rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection with discontinuation of CPs (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 - 1.00; p = 0.05). In five studies that did not use chlorhexidine, there was no difference between rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection with discontinuation of CPs (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.55 - 1.88; p = 0.95).

The aim of this study was to investigate ACE2 gene expression in skin using a public database. METHODS A search of transcriptomic data sets from a public gene expression database to investigate ACE2 gene expression in human tissues. RESULTS Human skin keratinocytes and basal cells express more ACE2 than lung epithelial cells. In contrast, both fibroblasts and melanocytes from human skin express less ACE2 than human lung epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS The high expression of ACE2 in keratinocytes and basal cells of human skin indicates that they may be directly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection via the ACE2 receptor, especially in conditions of skin barrier dysfunction, and are therefore a potential target for the coronavirus.","output":"Gene Expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Receptor in Skin and the Implications for COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Virtual urgent care (VUC) provides real-time evaluation, triage, and treatment of low-acuity medical problems; however, VUC physicians have varying levels of telemedicine training.

METHODS: We simulated evaluation of an adult with upper respiratory symptoms. To replicate a real-life encounter, we developed a mock electronic medical entry with demographic and medical information and scheduled SPs into the clinic's actual patient queue. SPs provided seamless, realistic training within the real-world virtual clinic environment. Using an adapted assessment tool anchored to not done, partly done, or well done, SPs evaluated communication, disease-specific, and telemedicine skills by observing behaviors. We surveyed participants to evaluate the program. RESULTS: Twenty-one physicians participated. All performed well in core communication and disease management domains. Ninety-three percent of behaviors (SD = 11%) were rated well done within the information gathering domain, 90% (SD = 8%) within relationship development, and 95% (SD = 5%) within disease management.

Case Presentation A 12-year-old girl with a history of cold, dry cough, sore throat, fever, and left-sided abdominal pain was referred to the Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran, on March 7, 2020. The chest X-ray indicated air space opacification in the right lower lobe and faint ground-glass opacity in the left lower lung. A subsequent chest computed tomography (CT) scan indicated blialteral patchy lower lobe consolidations. The patient's oropharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19, based on the result of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. The patient's clinical status was improved, and she was discharged five days after admission (March 11, 2020).

METHODS: All the patients were followed up in the hospital with daily interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, complete blood count, and procalcitonin. Computerized thoracic tomography was obtained on admission, when oxygen support was necessary, and seven days after TCZ start. Disease course of the patients was grouped as severe or critical according to their clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evaluations. RESULTS: In total, 43 patients were included; 70% of the patients was male; the median age was 64 (min-max: 27-94), 6 (14%) patients were fatal. The median duration of oxygen support before the onset of TCZ was shorter among the severe patient group than the critical patient group (1 vs 4 days, p < 0.001). Only 3 cases out of 21 (14%) who received TCZ in the ward were transferred to ICU, and none of them died. The levels of IL-6, CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, and procalcitonin were significantly lower in severe cases group than the critical cases group (p = 0.025, p = 0.002, p = 0.008, p = 0.002, and p = 0.001, respectively).

This paper describes how the lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak in 2014 informed the emergency preparedness of the State ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak and guided response. DISCUSSION: Following the Ebola outbreak in 2014, the Lagos State government provided governance by developing a policy on emergency preparedness and biosecurity and provided oversight and coordination of emergency preparedness strategies. Capacities for emergency response were strengthened by training key staff, developing a robust surveillance system, and setting up a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory and biobank. Resource provision, in terms of finances and trained personnel for emergencies was prioritized by the government. With the onset of COVID-19, Lagos state was able to respond promptly to the outbreak using the centralized Incident Command Structure and the key activities of the Emergency Operations Centre. Contributory to effective response were partnerships with the private sectors, community engagement and political commitment. CONCLUSION: Using the lessons learned from the 2014 Ebola outbreak, Lagos State had gradually prepared its healthcare system for a pandemic such as COVID-19. The State needs to continue to expand its preparedness to be more resilient and future proof to respond to disease outbreaks.

Elevated ferritin has been observed in many patients with COVID\\\\19. Several retrospective studies have shown ferritin levels can be correlated and predictive of poor outcomes in COVID\\\\19, though a rigorous analysis has been lacking. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 942 adult COVID\\\\19 patients admitted in March 2020 at a large New York City health system with available ferritin levels. RESULTS: The primary outcome, all\\\\cause mortality, was observed in 265 (28.1%) patients. Patients who died had a significantly higher median admission and maximum ferritin levels than those who did not. However, death was poorly predicted by admission and maximum ferritin levels on receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis, with AUCs of 0.677 and 0.638, respectively. AUCs increased when the cohort was limited to progressively younger patients. Ferritin levels were minimally better at predicting our secondary outcomes. These included mechanical ventilation, observed in 280 (29.7%) patients with an ROC yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.769, and new renal replacement therapy, observed in 80 (8.5%) of patients with an ROC yielding an AUC of 0.787. We also performed a subset analysis on 22 patients with ferritins >20 000 ng/mL. None of the patients met HLH\\\\2004 diagnostic criteria. Fifteen (68.2%) of these patients had suspected or confirmed bacterial infections.

Several dietary interventions have been suggested to improve symptoms of FAPDs. This systematic review assessed the efficacy and safety of dietary interventions for pediatric FAPDs. DESIGN AND METHODS Electronic databases were searched from inception to October 2021. Systematic reviews or RCTs were included if children (4-18 years) with FAPDs were treated with dietary interventions and compared to placebo, no diet or any other diet. Data extraction and assessment of quality of evidence based on GRADE system was independently performed by two review authors. Outcomes were treatment success, pain intensity and frequency, and withdrawal due to adverse events. RESULTS Twelve articles were included, representing data of 819 pediatric FAPD patients. Trials investigating fibers, FODMAP diet, fructans, fructose restricted diet, prebiotic (inulin), serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin and vitamin D supplementation were included. We found very low-certainty evidence that the use of fibers leads to higher treatment success (NNT=5). CONCLUSION Based on the current evidence, the use of fibers can be discussed in daily practice.

We included published or in press peer-reviewed cross-sectional, case series, and case reports providing clinical signs, imaging findings, and/or laboratory results of pediatric patients who were positive for COVID-19. Risk of bias was appraised through the quality assessment tool published by the National Institutes of Health. PROSPERO registration # CRD42020182261. FINDINGS: We identified 131 studies across 26 countries comprising 7780 pediatric patients. Although fever (591%) and cough (559%) were the most frequent symptoms 193% of children were asymptomatic. Patchy lesions (210%) and ground-glass opacities (329%) depicted lung radiograph and computed tomography findings, respectively. Immunocompromised children or those with respiratory/cardiac disease comprised the largest subset of COVID-19 children with underlying medical conditions (152 of 233 individuals). Coinfections were observed in 5.6% of children and abnormal laboratory markers included serum D-dimer, procalcitonin, creatine kinase, and interleukin-6. Seven deaths were reported (009%) and 11 children (014%) met inclusion for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.

During a time of social distancing measures and increasing social isolation, green spaces may be a crucial factor to maintain a physically and socially active lifestyle while not increasing risk of infection. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether greenness was related to COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the US. METHODS: We downloaded data on COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US county up through June 7, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. We used April-May 2020 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, to represent the greenness exposure during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the US. We fitted negative binomial mixed models to evaluate associations of NDVI with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders such as county-level demographics, epidemic stage, and other environmental factors. We evaluated whether the associations were modified by population density, proportion of Black residents, median home value, and issuance of stay-at-home orders. RESULTS: An increase of 0.1 in NDVI was associated with a 6% (95% Confidence Interval: 3%, 10%) decrease in COVID-19 incidence rate after adjustment for potential confounders. Associations with COVID-19 incidence were stronger in counties with high population density and in counties with stay-at-home orders. Greenness was not associated with COVID-19 mortality in all counties; however, it was protective in counties with higher population density. DISCUSSION: Exposures to NDVI were associated with reduced county-level incidence of COVID-19 in the US as well as reduced county-level COVID-19 mortality rates in densely populated counties.","output":"County-level exposures to greenness and associations with COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital contact tracing is a relevant tool to control infectious disease outbreaks, including the COVID-19 epidemic. Early work evaluating digital contact tracing omitted important features and heterogeneities of real-world contact patterns influencing contagion dynamics.

We investigate how well contact tracing apps, coupled with the quarantine of identified contacts, can mitigate the spread in real environments. We find that restrictive policies are more effective in containing the epidemic but come at the cost of unnecessary large-scale quarantines. Policy evaluation through their efficiency and cost results in optimized solutions which only consider contacts longer than 15-20 minutes and closer than 2-3 meters to be at risk. Our results show that isolation and tracing can help control re-emerging outbreaks when some conditions are met: (i) a reduction of the reproductive number through masks and physical distance; (ii) a low-delay isolation of infected individuals; (iii) a high compliance.

In 2019, more than one thousand malaria cases were reported, with an unusual number of Plasmodium falciparum autochthonous cases. The present study aims to report this P. falciparum outbreak while describing the epidemiology of malaria and the risk factors associated in the native communities of Amazonas, Peru. METHODS: The DIRESA-Amazonas in collaboration with the Condorcanqui Health Network and the Institute of Tropical Diseases of the UNTRM carried out a malaria Active Case Detection (ACD III) between January 31st and February 10th of 2020. A total of 2718 (47.4%) individuals from 21 native communities grouped in eight sanitary districts, were screened for malaria infections. Each participant was screened for malaria using microscopy. Follow-up surveys were conducted for all malaria positive individuals to collect socio-demographic data. Spatial clustering of infection risk was calculated using a generalized linear model (GLM). Analysis of risk considered factors such as gender, age, type of infection, symptomatology, and parasitaemia. RESULTS: The study suggests that the P. falciparum index case was imported from Loreto and later spread to other communities of Rio Santiago during 2019. The ACD III reported 220 (8.1%) malaria cases, 46 P. falciparum, 168 P. vivax and 6 mixed infections. SaTScan analysis detected a cluster of high infection risk in Middle Rio Santiago and a particular high P. falciparum infection risk cluster in Upper Rio Santiago. Interestingly, the evaluation of different risk factors showed significant associations between low parasitaemia and P. falciparum asymptomatic cases.

However, inaccurate test results (for example, high false negative rate and some false positive rate) were reported in both China and US CDC using the RT-PCR method. Inaccurate results are caused by inadequate detection sensitivity of RT-PCR, low viral load in some patients, difficulty to collect samples from COVID-19 patients, insufficient sample loading during RT-PCR tests, and RNA degradation during sample handling process. False negative detection could subject patients to multiple tests before diagnosis can be made, which burdens health care system. Delayed diagnosis could cause infected patients to miss the best treatment time window. False negative detection could also lead to prematurely releasing infected patients who still carry residual SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this case, these patients could infect many others. A high sensitivity RNA detection method to resolve the existing issues of RT-PCR is in need for more accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: Digital PCR (dPCR) instrument DropX-2000 and assay kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 108 clinical specimens from 36 patients including pharyngeal swab, stool and blood from different days during hospitalization. Double-blinded experiment data of 108 clinical specimens by dPCR methods were compared with results from officially approved RT-PCR assay. A total of 109 samples including 108 clinical specimens and 1 negative control sample were tested in this study. All of 109 samples, 26 were from 21patients reported as positive by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection in local CDC and then hospitalized in Nantong Third Hospital. Among the 109 samples, dPCR detected 30 positive samples on ORFA1ab gene, 47 samples with N gene positive, and 30 samples with double positive on ORFA1ab and N genes. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimize dPCR is at least 10-fold lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of dPCR for clinical detection is 96.3%. 4 out 4 of (100 %) negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were positive judged by dPCR based on the follow-up investigation. 2 of 2 samples in the RT-PCR grey area (Ct value > 37) were confirmed by dPCR with positive results. 1 patient being tested positive by RT-PCR was confirmed to be negative by dPCR. The dPCR results show clear viral loading decrease in 12 patients as treatment proceed, which can be a useful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment. Conclusions: Digital PCR shows improved lower limit of detection, sensitivity and accuracy, enabling COVID-19 detection with less false negative and false positive results comparing with RT-PCR, especially for the tests with low viral load specimens. We showed evidences that dPCR is powerful in detecting asymptomatic patients and suspected patients. Digital PCR is capable of checking the negative results caused by insufficient sample loading by quantifying internal reference gene from human RNA in the PCR reactions.

The use of AZM was not associated with need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.49-1.87, p = 0.85) and length of stay (&#916; = 1.11, 95% CI -2.08 to 4.31, p = 0.49). The results show that using AZM as routine therapy in Covid-19 patients is not justified due to lack of efficacy and potential risk of bacterial resistance that is not met by an increased clinical benefit.","output":"Efficacy and safety of azithromycin in Covid-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Italy represents a unique threat in terms of psychological distress.

To establish biomarkers for clinical, radiological, and laboratory severity of COVID-19 infection and to identify their relationships. Materials and methods. A retrospective study was carried out which included 155 patients undergoing treatment at the Hospital for War Veterans No. 3 with a confirmed diagnosis of novel coronavirus infection caused by nCoV from April 6 to June 10, 2020. All patients underwent clinical and laboratory examination. An intergroup statistical analysis of clinical and laboratory parameters was carried out depending on the criteria of clinical severity and severity of radiological signs of chest organ pathology according to computed tomography (CT). Results. Patients with mild COVID-19 showed a lower level of leukocytes, urea, creatinine, bilirubin, and aspartate dehydrogenase (AsAT), as opposed to the corresponding levels in patients with extremely severe course of the disease. A lower level of calcium in the peripheral blood was found in patients with severe COVID-19, along with an increase in blood glucose. Patients from the CT1 group as well as patients with a clinically mild course of the novel coronavirus infection had significantly lower levels of neutrophils, urea, creatinine, AsAT, and blood glucose and a higher level of blood calcium in comparison with patients with various CT patterns. In the group of patients with a fatal outcome, cardiovascular diseases were significantly more often detected, as opposed to the discharged patients. Conclusion. A number of biomarkers characterizing the severity of the novel coronavirus infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been identified. However, the revealed differences in the laboratory markers of the clinical and radiological severity of the disease do not currently allow to give a clear answer about the nature of the relationship between the clinical severity of the disease, CT findings, and laboratory indicators of COVID-19 severity. ? 2021 Siberian State Medical University.

Thus, the current study aimed to track the short-term side effects of the vaccine. METHODS: The information in this study was gathered by a Google Form-questionnaire (online survey). The results included the responses of 455 individuals, all of whom are Saudi Arabia inhabitants. Adverse effects of the vaccine were reported after the first and the second doses. RESULTS: The most common symptoms were injection site pain, headaches, flu-like symptoms, fever, and tiredness. Less common side effects were a fast heartbeat, whole body aches, difficulty breathing, joint pain, chills, and drowsiness. Rare side effects include Bells palsy and lymph nodes swelling and tenderness. Flu-like symptoms were more common among those under 60 years of age, while injection site pain was more frequent among recipients who were 60 years and older. The study revealed a significant increase in the number of females who suffered from the vaccine side effects compared to males. Difficulty of breathing was more reported among recipients who had been previously infected with the coronavirus compared to those who had not been previously infected.

Altered retinal vessel fractal dimensions may act as a surrogate marker for diseased cerebral vessels. We used a cross-sectional study to investigate fractal properties of retinal vessels in lacunar stroke. METHODS We recruited patients presenting with lacunar stroke and patients with minor cortical stroke as controls. All patients were examined by a stroke expert and had MRI at presentation. Digital retinal photographs were taken of both eyes. Monofractal and multifractal analyses were performed with custom-written semiautomated software. RESULTS We recruited 183 patients. Seventeen were excluded owing to poor photographic quality, leaving 166 patients (86 with lacunar and 80 with cortical stroke). The mean age was 67.3 years (SD 11.5 years). The patients with lacunar stroke were younger but the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and white matter hyperintensities did not differ between the groups. The mean Dbox (monofractal dimension) was 1.42 (SD 0.02), the mean D0 (multifractal dimension) 1.67 (SD 0.03). With multivariate analysis, decreased Dbox and D0 (both representing decreased branching complexity) were associated with increasing age and lacunar stroke subtype after correcting for hypertension, diabetes, stroke severity, and white matter hyperintensity scores. CONCLUSIONS Lacunar stroke subtype and increasing age are associated with decreased fractal dimensions, suggesting a loss of branching complexity.

Enrolled adolescents and adults were contacted telephonically after 14 days of receiving the BBV152 vaccine. Primary outcome was vaccine safety assessed as rates of adverse events following immunization (AEFI). Severity grading of AEFIs was done using the FDA scale. Findings: A total of 698 adolescents and 326 adults were enrolled. AEFIs occurred in 36.3% adolescents after first and in 37.9% after second dose. Systemic involvement was seen in 15-17% adolescents. Injection site pain and fever were the common AEFIs. Majority of AEFIs were mild-moderate. Severe and atypical AEFIs were observed in 0.9% and 0.6% adolescents respectively. Majority of AEFIs recovered in 1-2 days. In >2% adolescents, AEFIs were persisting at 14-day follow-up since the second dose.

However, strong immunogenicity and short plasma half-life limit their clinical application. To solve this problem, the two proteins were modified with (mPEG)(2)-Lys-NHS (20 kDa). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, a novel purification strategy for the two main type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), -MMC and MAP30, was successfully developed for laboratory-scale preparation. Using this dramatic method, 200 mg of -MMC and about 120 mg of MAP30 was obtained in only one purification process from 200 g of Momordica charantia seeds. The homogeneity and some other properties of the two proteins were assessed by gradient SDS-PAGE, electrospray ionization quadruple mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequence analysis as well as Western blot. Two polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated proteins were synthesized and purified. Homogeneous mono-, di-, or tri-PEGylated proteins were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The analysis of antitumor and antivirus activities indicated that the serial PEGylated RIPs preserved moderate activities on JAR choriocarcinoma cells and herpes simplex virus-1. Furthermore, both PEGylated proteins showed about 60%C70% antitumor and antivirus activities, and at the same time decreased 50%C70% immunogenicity when compared with their unmodified counterparts. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: -MMC and MAP30 obtained from this novel purification strategy can meet the requirement of a large amount of samples for research. Their chemical modification can solve the problem of strong immunogenicity and meanwhile preserve moderate activities. All these findings suggest the potential application of PEGylated -MMC and PEGylated MAP30 as antitumor and antivirus agents. According to these results, PEGylated RIPs can be constructed with nanomaterials to be a targeting drug that can further decrease immunogenicity and side effects. Through nanotechnology we can make them low-release drugs, which can further prolong their half-life period in the human body.","output":"Preparation of an antitumor and antivirus agent: chemical modification of -MMC and MAP30 from Momordica Charantia L. with covalent conjugation of polyethyelene glycol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During pandemics, governments take drastic actions to prevent the spreading of the disease, as seen during the present COVID-19 crisis. Sanctions of lockdown, social distancing and quarantine urge people to exclusively work and teach at home and to restrict social contacts to a minimum; lonely people get into further isolation, while families\` nerves are strained to the extreme. Overall, this results in a dramatic and chronic increase in the level of psychosocial stress over several months mainly caused by i) social isolation and ii) psychosocial stress associated with overcrowding, social tension in families, and domestic violence. Moreover, pandemic-associated social restrictions are accompanied by loss of an essential stress buffer and important parameter for general mental and physical health: social support. Chronic psychosocial stress and, in particular, social isolation and lack of social support affect not only mental health, but also the brain oxytocin system and the immune system. Hence, pandemic-associated social restrictions are expected to increase the risk of developing psychopathologies, such as depression, anxiety-related and posttraumatic stress disorders, on the one hand, but also to induce a general inflammatory state and to impair the course of infectious disorders on the other. Due to its pro-social and stress-buffering effects, resulting in an anti-inflammatory state in case of disease, the role of the neuropeptide oxytocin will be discussed and critically considered as an emerging treatment option in cases of pandemic-induced psychosocial stress, viral infection and during recovery.

In an effort to minimize COVID-19 exposure and improve appointment efficiency with required pre-procedure testing, we permitted same day HRM prior to BAS. Our study aimed to evaluate the adequacy of barium mucosal coating with same day HRM prior to BAS compared to BAS alone. METHODS: We performed a retrospective pilot cohort study including 14 patients undergoing same day HRM prior to BAS and 20 patients undergoing BAS alone over an 8-month interval during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three abdominal imaging subspecialty-trained radiologists blindly reviewed the images and graded adequacy of esophageal coating on a 4-point scale with a score of 1 representing inadequate coating and 4 representing optimal coating. RESULTS: For the cohort studied thus far, the mean grade of the HRM and BAS group was 3.17 with a standard deviation of 0.66. The mean grade of the BAS alone group was 3.13 with a standard deviation of 0.79. There was no statistical difference in the adequacy of esophageal coating between the two groups (p-value 0.97). CONCLUSION: Same day HRM prior to BAS has no detrimental effect on barium mucosal coating compared to BAS alone.

GP is a class I fusion protein that forms trimeric spikes composed of heterodimers of the subunits GP1 and GP2. GP1 and GP2 are derived from the precursor pre-GP by furin cleavage during exocytosis. GP1 contains a receptor-binding core topped by a glycan cap and a heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain, while GP2 contains a fusion loop and a membrane anchor. After entering cells by macropinocytosis, the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain are removed from GP1 by endosomal cathepsins B and L exposing the binding site for the Niemann-Pick C1 receptor. It appears that there is no strict requirement for specific proteases involved in GP processing. Thus, furin is not indispensible for GP1-2 cleavage, and GP1 may be trimmed not only by cathepsins B and L but also by other endosomal proteases. Two soluble glycoproteins of Ebola virus are also processed by host proteases. A significant amount of GP1,2 is cleaved by the metalloprotease TACE and shed from the surface of infected cells (GP1,2 delta).

However, little is known regarding the norovirus life cycle, including cell binding and entry. In contrast to human noroviruses, the recently discovered murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) readily infects murine macrophages and dendritic cells in culture. Many viruses, including the related feline calicivirus, use terminal sialic acids (SA) as receptors for infection. Therefore, we tested whether SA moieties play a role during MNV-1 infection of murine macrophages. Competition with SA-binding lectins and neuraminidase treatment led to a reduction in MNV-1 binding and infection in cultured and primary murine macrophages, suggesting a role for SA during the initial steps of the MNV-1 life cycle. Because SA moieties can be attached to glycolipids (i.e., gangliosides), we next determined whether MNV-1 uses gangliosides during infection. The gangliosides GD1a, GM1, and asialo-GM1 (GA1) are natural components of murine macrophages. MNV-1 bound to ganglioside GD1a, which is characterized by an SA on the terminal galactose, but not to GM1 or asialo-GM1 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The depletion of gangliosides using an inhibitor of glycosylceramide synthase (d-threo-P4) led to a reduction of MNV-1 binding and infection in cultured and primary murine macrophages. This defect was specifically rescued by the addition of GD1a. A similar phenotype was observed for MNV field strains WU11 (GV/WU11/2005/USA) and S99 (GV/Berlin/2006/DE).

A large outbreak of diphtheria subsequently began in this population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were collected during mass vaccination campaigns (MVCs), contact tracing activities, and from 9 Diphtheria Treatment Centers (DTCs) operated by national and international organizations. These data were used to describe the epidemiological and clinical features and the control measures to prevent transmission, during the first 2 years of the outbreak. Between November 10, 2017 and November 9, 2019, 7,064 cases were reported: 285 (4.0%) laboratory-confirmed, 3,610 (51.1%) probable, and 3,169 (44.9%) suspected cases. The crude attack rate was 51.5 cases per 10,000 person-years, and epidemic doubling time was 4.4 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2-4.7) during the exponential growth phase. The median age was 10 years (range 0-85), and 3,126 (44.3%) were male. The typical symptoms were sore throat (93.5%), fever (86.0%), pseudomembrane (34.7%), and gross cervical lymphadenopathy (GCL; 30.6%). Diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) was administered to 1,062 (89.0%) out of 1,193 eligible patients, with adverse reactions following among 229 (21.6%). There were 45 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] 0.6%). Household contacts for 5,702 (80.7%) of 7,064 cases were successfully traced. A total of 41,452 contacts were identified, of whom 40,364 (97.4%) consented to begin chemoprophylaxis; adherence was 55.0% (N = 22,218) at 3-day follow-up. Unvaccinated household contacts were vaccinated with 3 doses (with 4-week interval), while a booster dose was administered if the primary vaccination schedule had been completed. The proportion of contacts vaccinated was 64.7% overall. Three MVC rounds were conducted, with administrative coverage varying between 88.5% and 110.4%. Pentavalent vaccine was administered to those aged 6 weeks to 6 years, while tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine was administered to those aged 7 years and older. Lack of adequate diagnostic capacity to confirm cases was the main limitation, with a majority of cases unconfirmed and the proportion of true diphtheria cases unknown. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest reported diphtheria outbreak in refugee settings. We observed that high population density, poor living conditions, and fast growth rate were associated with explosive expansion of the outbreak during the initial exponential growth phase. Three rounds of mass vaccinations targeting those aged 6 weeks to 14 years were associated with only modestly reduced transmission, and additional public health measures were necessary to end the outbreak. This outbreak has a long-lasting tail, with Rt oscillating at around 1 for an extended period. An adequate global DAT stockpile needs to be maintained. All populations must have access to health services and routine vaccination, and this access must be maintained during humanitarian crises.","output":"Epidemiological, clinical, and public health response characteristics of a large outbreak of diphtheria among the Rohingya population in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, 2017 to 2019: A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver injury is a common manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with most injuries manifesting as transient mild hepatocellular injury.

Methods: 50 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively compared to 50 patients with AH1N1 pneumonia diagnosed during the 2009 pandemic. Two radiologists reviewed chest CT scans independently and blindly, with discordance resolved by consensus. Dilated or tortuous vessels within hyperdense lesions were recorded. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia presented with bilateral (96%), peripheral areas of GGO (22%), consolidation (4%) or combined GGO-consolidation (74%). The vascular enlargement sign in COVID-19 pneumonia was much more commonly present in COVID-19 (45/50, 90%) versus AH1N1 pneumonia (12/50, 24%) (p<0.001). Vascular enlargement was more often present in lower lobes with a peripheral distribution. Conclusions: Vascular enlargement in consolidative / GGO areas may represent a reasonably common early CT marker in COVID-19 patients and is of uncertain etiology. Although speculative, theoretical mechanisms could potentially reflect acute inflammatory changes, pulmonary endothelial activation, or acute stasis.

The FAVoR intervention uses scripted audio messages, which are recorded by the patient's family and played at hourly intervals during daytime hours. This ongoing orientation to the ICU environment through recorded messages in a voice familiar to the patient may enable the patient to more accurately interpret the environment and thus reduce risk of delirium. The study's primary aim is to test the effect of the FAVoR intervention on delirium in critically ill MV adults in the ICU. The secondary aims are to explore: (1) if the effect of FAVoR on delirium is mediated by sleep, (2) if selected biobehavioral factors moderate the effects of FAVoR on delirium, and (3) the effects of FAVoR on short-term and long-term outcomes, including cognition and health status.

We examined marketing activities related to novel tobacco products (e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products) during this restriction. Using web scraping, we accessed data for 2661 e-cigarette liquids marketed online by South African vendors in June 2020. We also analyzed heated tobacco product volume sales (kits) using retail scanner data from Nielsen Company. The 2661 e-cigarette liquids assessed online comprised cannabidiol liquids, 28.8%[767/2661], nicotine salts, 10.4%[276/2661], e-cigarette juice concentrates, 14.1%[376/2661], nicotine-free e-liquid, 4.0%[107/2661], and nicotine-containing e-liquid, 42.6%[1135/2661]. Cannabidiol liquids had the highest percentage of fruit (78.4%[601/767]) and tobacco flavors (9.4%[72/767]). During the restriction, many online e-cigarette vendors actively promoted cannabidiol liquid in lieu of regular e-liquid. Nielsen retail scanner data showed that volume of heated tobacco product sales in February 2020, preceding the restriction (7.76 million kits), were higher than in February 2019 (4.52 million kits). The restriction saw decreased sales of heated tobacco products; mean weekly heated tobacco product sales in the 6 weeks following the restriction (772,585 kits/week) were dramatically lower versus the 6 weeks preceding the restriction (2.26 million kits/week).

Because children appear to be less severely affected than adults, their imaging appearances have not been extensively reported. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review available literature regarding imaging findings in paediatric cases of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched four databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google Scholar) for articles describing imaging findings in children with COVID-19. We included all modalities, age <18 years, and foreign language articles, using descriptive statistics to identify patterns and locations of imaging findings, and their association with outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were included, reporting chest imaging findings in 431 children, of whom 421 (97.7%) underwent CT. Criteria for imaging were lacking. At diagnosis, 143/421 (34.0%) had a normal CT. Abnormalities were more common in the lower lobes and were predominantly unilateral. The most common imaging pattern was ground-glass opacification (159/255, 62.4%). None of the studies described lymphadenopathy, while pleural effusions were rare (three cases). Improvement at follow-up CT imaging (3-15 days later) was seen in 29/100 (29%), remained normal in 25/100 (25%) and progressed in 9/100 (9%). CONCLUSION: CT chest findings in children with COVID-19 are frequently normal or mild. Lower lobes are predominantly affected by patchy ground-glass opacification. Appearances at follow-up remain normal or improve in the majority of children.

Our study also aimed to evaluate the clinical use of various methods in diagnosing respiratory infections under field conditions and to describe the antimicrobial resistance profile of the main bacterial pathogen(s) found during the study. METHODS: A total of 20 case herds having finishing pigs showing acute respiratory symptoms and eight control herds showing no clinical signs suggesting of respiratory problems were enrolled in the study. Researchers visited each herd twice, examining and bleeding 20 pigs per herd. In addition, nasal swab samples were taken from 20 pigs and three pigs per case herd were necropsied during the first visit. Serology was used to detect Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in serum and SIV in the nasal and lung samples. Pathology and bacteriology, including antimicrobial resistance determination, were performed on lung samples obtained from the field necropsies. RESULTS: According to the pathology and bacteriology of the lung samples, APP and Ascaris suum were the main causes of respiratory outbreaks in 14 and three herds respectively, while the clinical signs in three other herds had a miscellaneous etiology. SIV, APP and PCV2 caused concurrent infections in certain herds but they were detected serologically or with PCR also in control herds, suggesting possible subclinical infections. APP was isolated from 16 (80%) case herds. Marked resistance was observed against tetracycline for APP, some resistance was detected against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin and penicillin, and no resistance against florfenicol, enrofloxacin, tulathromycin or tiamulin was found. Serology, even from paired serum samples, gave inconclusive results for acute APP infection diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: APP was the most common cause for acute respiratory outbreaks in our study. SIV, A. suum, PCV2 and certain opportunistic bacteria were also detected during the outbreaks; however, viral pathogens appeared less important than bacteria.

To evaluate the exposure to sand fly bites in human populations from disease endemic areas, we tested the antibody reactions of volunteers' sera against recombinant P. orientalis salivary antigens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Recombinant proteins derived from sequence data on P. orientalis secreted salivary proteins, were produced using either bacterial (five proteins) or mammalian (four proteins) expression systems and tested as antigens applicable for detection of anti-P. orientalis IgG in human sera. Using these recombinant proteins, human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia, countries endemic for visceral leishmaniasis, were screened by ELISA and immunoblotting to identify the potential markers of exposure to P. orientalis bites. Two recombinant proteins; mAG5 and mYEL1, were identified as the most promising antigens showing high correlation coefficients as well as good specificity in comparison to the whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. Combination of both proteins led to a further increase of correlation coefficients as well as both positive and negative predictive values of P. orientalis exposure.

However, many of these techniques are not directly applicable if access to the network is constrained, in so-called black-box setups. These setups are prevalent when using third-party ML components. To address this constraint, we present an approach to detect learned shortcuts using an interpretable-by-design network as a proxy to the black-box model of interest. Leveraging the proxy's guarantees on introspection we automatically extract candidates for learned shortcuts. Their transferability to the black box is validated in a systematic fashion. Concretely, as proxy model we choose a BagNet, which bases its decisions purely on local image patches. We demonstrate on the autonomous driving dataset A2D2 that extracted patch shortcuts significantly influence the black box model. By efficiently identifying such patch-based vulnerabilities, we contribute to safer ML models.","output":"Patch Shortcuts: Interpretable Proxy Models Efficiently Find Black-Box Vulnerabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, early and honest conversations with patients about goals of care are vital. Advance care planning in its traditional manner may be difficult to achieve given the unpredictability of the disease trajectory. Despite this, it is crucial that patients' care wishes are explored as this will help prevent inappropriate admissions to hospital and to critical care, improve symptom control and advocate for patient choice. This article provides practical tips on how to translate decisions around treatment escalation plans into conversations, both face-to-face and over the phone, in a sensitive and compassionate manner. Care planning conversations for patients with COVID-19 should be individualised and actively involve the patient. Focusing on goals of care rather than ceilings of treatment can help to alleviate anxiety around these conversations and will remind patients that their care will never cease. Using a framework such as the 'SPIKES' mnemonic can help to structure this conversation. Verbally conveying empathy will be key, particularly when wearing personal protective equipment or speaking to relatives over the phone. It is also important to make time to recognise your own emotions during and/or after these conversations.","output":"Advance care planning for patients with COVID-19: a communication guide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One major bottleneck in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is the limited number of critical care beds. Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To derive future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth rates. We evaluate our model for public data from Berlin, Germany, by first estimating the model parameters (i.e., time lag and average stay in ICU) for March 2020 and then using an exponential model to predict the future ICU load for April and May 2020. Assuming an ICU rate of 5%, a time lag of 5 days and an average stay of 14 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data and is in accord with independent estimates. Our model is then used to predict future ICU load assuming a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%). For example, based on our parameters the model predicts that the number of ICU patients at the end of May would be 246 if the exponential growth were to continue at a rate of 3%, 1,056 if the growth rate were 5% and 3,758 if the growth rate were 7%. The model can be adjusted as estimates of parameters develop and can thus also help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our predictions are based on a small data set, disregard non-stationary dynamics, and have a number of assumptions, especially an exponential development of cases, our model is simple, robust, adaptable and can be up-dated when further data become available.","output":"Covid-19 -- A simple statistical model for predicting ICU load in exponential phases of the disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater surveillance for monitoring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an important epidemiologic tool for the assessment of population-wide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This tool can be successfully implemented only if SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can be accurately recovered and quantified. The lack of standardized procedure for wastewater virus analysis has resulted in varying SARS-CoV-2 concentrations for the same sample. This study reports the effect of 4 key factors-sample volume, percentage polyethylene glycol (PEG)-NaCl, incubation period, and storage duration at 4C-on the recovery of spiked noninfectious SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw sewage and sludge samples. N1 and N2 genes of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR) techniques. Results indicate that 1) for raw sewage, 50-ml sample volume, 30% PEG-NaCl addition, 6-h incubation, and sample analysis within 24 h of collection can result in much better RNA recovery (RT-qPCR: 72% for N1 and 82% for N2; RT-ddPCR: 55% for N1 and 85% for N2) when compared with commonly used PEG-based method; 2) for sludge, the sample analysis using raw sewage protocol and all other variations of each factor mostly resulted in false negatives for both N1 and N2. The absence of N1 and N2 suggests that sludge samples probably need a pretreatment step that releases RNA entrapped in sludge solids back into bulk solution. In conclusion, our modified PEG-based concentration method can cut down the analysis time at least by half, which in turn helps to implement early detection system for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.","output":"Factors influencing recovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw sewage and wastewater sludge using polyethylene glycol-based concentration method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has become an emerging prognostic biomarker of disease progression in patients with COVID-19. This study aims to determine the optimal cut-off value of PCT with regards to important clinical outcomes, especially for mechanical ventilation and all-cause mortality among moderate to severe COVID-19 patients in Malaysia. METHODS: A total of 319 moderate to severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the National Referral Hospital in December 2020 were included in the study retrospectively. Demographics, comorbidities, the severity of COVID-19 infection, laboratory and imaging findings, and treatment given were collected from the hospital information system for analysis. The optimal cut-point values for PCT were estimated in two levels. The first level involved 276 patients who had their PCT measured within 5 days following their admission. The second level involved 237 patients who had their PCT measured within 3 days following their admission. Further, a propensity score matching analysis was performed to determine the adjusted relative risk of patients with regards to various clinical outcomes according to the selected cut-point among 237 patients who had their PCT measured within 3 days. RESULTS: The results showed that a PCT level of 0.2 ng/mL was the optimal cut-point for prognosis especially for mortality outcome and the need for mechanical ventilation. Before matching, patients with PCT  0.2 ng/mL were associated with significantly higher odds in all investigated outcomes. After matching, patients with PCT > 0.2 ng/mL were associated with higher odds in all-cause mortality (OR: 4.629, 95% CI 1.387C15.449, p = 0.0127) and non-invasive ventilation (OR: 2.667, 95% CI 1.039C6.847, p = 0.0415). Furthermore, patients with higher PCT were associated with significantly longer days of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0213). There was however no association between higher PCT level and the need for mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.010, 95% CI 0.828C4.878, p = 0.1229). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that a rise in PCT above 0.2 ng/mL is associated with an elevated risk in all-cause mortality, the need for non-invasive ventilation, and a longer duration of mechanical ventilation.

However, the novel coronavirus outbreak has led to a broader dissemination of fake and misleading health information. While health professionals may be able to critically evaluate internet-based information, the skills at finding, appraising, and using COVID-19-related online information may be problematic for laypeople in low-income countries. The purpose of this study was to examine the digital literacy of lay consumers of online COVID-19-related information in Ghana. METHOD A cross-sectional survey was conducted among online health consumers across five regions in Ghana. Participants were conveniently recruited through social media, and the survey was based on the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHeals) and administered through Qualtricsxm software. We calculated the overall mean eHeals score to determine the literacy levels and performed descriptive statistics to describe the characteristics of the sample. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with respondents' digital literacy. RESULT Out of 700 respondents sent with a survey link, 325 responded (46.4 % response rate). The majority of the respondents were: younger than 31 years (M = 28.42, SD = 6.98), males (59.7 %), use the internet daily (94.4 %), engaged in social media activities (65 %), and frequently search the internet for information related to COVID-19. The overall eHealth literacy was quite high (M = 4.01, SD = 0.95), but respondents' scores on items 1 and 6 were relatively low. Sex, age, frequently searching the internet for COVID-19 information, using the internet for educational purposes, and having a little/adequate knowledge of COVID-19 was predictive of digital literacy. CONCLUSION The study revealed a high overall digital literacy as well as sex and age differences in literacy levels among online health consumers in Ghana. However, respondents' ability to locate COVID-19 related informaion and their skills in differentiating scientific from unscientific internet-based information remain relatively low. These findings offer useful insight that can inform the design of inclusive internet-based preventive resources that would be accessible and understandable to laypeople across all age groups and sexes in low-income countries.","output":"COVID-19 information-related digital literacy among online health consumers in a low-income country."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures were implemented with large impact on lifestyle behaviors and well-being of children (including adolescents). The impact on children with severe obesity, who plausibly are at even larger risk, has not yet been described. Aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on eating behaviors, physical activity, screen time and quality of life (QoL) of children with severe obesity. Methods: In this mixed-methods study, questionnaires and semi-structured telephone interviews were used to investigate impact of COVID-19 during the first wave in the Netherlands (April 2020) on children with severe obesity (adult BMI-equivalent 35kg/m(2)) treated at our obesity center. The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire - Child, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and Dutch Physical Activity Questionnaire were filled out by their families pre-pandemic and during lockdown. Changes over time in percentile scores, weekly physical activity and screen time were assessed. Qualitative analyses were performed according to the Grounded Theory. Results: We included 83 families, of which 75 participated in the interviews. Their childrens characteristics were mean age 11.5years (SD 4.6), 52% female, mean BMI SD score 3.8 (SD 1.0), indicating severe obesity. On group level, no changes in scores for emotional, restrained, external eating, and QoL nor in screen time were observed ( scores +9.2, +3.9, +0.3; and +3.0, respectively; -0.3 hr/wk; all p>0.05). Weekly physical activity decreased ( -1.9 hr/wk, p=0.02). Age, pre-existent psychosocial problems and pre-pandemic questionnaire scores were associated with improved or deteriorated questionnaire scores in specific subgroups. For example, children who did not fulfill WHO physical activity criteria pre-pandemic showed a further decline from 2.8 to 0.7 h/wk (p=0.001). Children with high emotional and external eating during lockdown had the lowest QoL scores (p-values <0.01). Qualitative data showed that an increased demand for food was frequently observed (n=21), mostly in children aged <10 years (19/21). This was attributed to loss of daily structure, increased stress, or emotional eating. Families who reported no changes (n=15) or improved eating behaviors (n=11) attributed this to already existing strict eating schemes that they kept adhering to. Conclusion: This study shows differential response profiles to COVID-19 lockdown in children with severe obesity. Although on group level lifestyle scores averaged out, a substantial part of families reported deterioration in physical activity and eating behaviors. Children with pre-existent psychosocial problems, high external or emotional eating scores were most at risk. Health care professionals should target these vulnerable children to minimize short- and long-term negative physical and mental health consequences.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 Lockdown Measures on Lifestyle Behavior in Children and Adolescents With Severe Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Retroviral vectors are attractive as vectors for gene therapy of cystic fibrosis because of their ability to integrate into the host cell genome, which may lead to long-term expression and, perhaps, a cure.

The finding of autoantibodies against ?2-adrenergic receptors (?2AdR) prompted us to hypothesize that ?2AdR dysfunction is of critical importance in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS. Our hypothesis published previously considers ME/CFS as a disease caused by a dysfunctional autonomic nervous system (ANS) system: sympathetic overactivity in the presence of vascular dysregulation by ?2AdR dysfunction causes predominance of vasoconstrictor influences in brain and skeletal muscles, which in the latter is opposed by the metabolically stimulated release of endogenous vasodilators (functional sympatholysis). An enigmatic bioenergetic disturbance in skeletal muscle strongly contributes to this release. Excessive generation of these vasodilators with algesic properties and spillover into the systemic circulation could explain hypovolemia, suppression of renin (paradoxon) and the enigmatic symptoms. In this hypothesis paper the mechanisms underlying the energetic disturbance in muscles will be explained and merged with the first hypothesis. The key information is that ?2AdR also stimulates the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in skeletal muscles. Appropriate muscular perfusion as well as function of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase determine muscle fatigability. We presume that dysfunction of the ?2AdR also leads to an insufficient stimulation of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase causing sodium overload which reverses the transport direction of the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) to import calcium instead of exporting it as is also known from the ischemiaCreperfusion paradigm. The ensuing calcium overload affects the mitochondria, cytoplasmatic metabolism and the endothelium which further worsens the energetic situation (vicious circle) to explain postexertional malaise, exercise intolerance and chronification. Reduced Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity is not the only cause for cellular sodium loading. In poor energetic situations increased proton production raises intracellular sodium via sodium-proton-exchanger subtype-1 (NHE1), the most important proton-extruder in skeletal muscle. Finally, sodium overload is due to diminished sodium outward transport and enhanced cellular sodium loading. As soon as this disturbance would have occurred in a severe manner the threshold for re-induction would be strongly lowered, mainly due to an upregulated NHE1, so that it could repeat at low levels of exercise, even by activities of everyday life, re-inducing mitochondrial, metabolic and vascular dysfunction to perpetuate the disease.","output":"Pathophysiology of skeletal muscle disturbances in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Introduction: Whether your community has been hit hard by COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] or has been relatively unscathed so far, one thing has remained constant Messages from government leaders and even public health officials have been all over the map, leaving in their wake much confusion and anxiety One reason for this: Principles of crisis communication have often been ignored by officials, experts, journalists, and other commentators during this early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic Key points like 'Don't over-reassure,' 'Proclaim uncertainty,' and 'Admit mistakes' make for good leadership during infectious disease outbreaks and help us all cope These principles are fairly well established Not that there is hard evidence to support them all Much like public health experts, crisis communication experts must often lean on intuition and experience, making claims that are plausible (and fervently espoused) despite lack of hard proof But it is safe to say that most crisis communication professionals would agree with the six principles detailed below, though some might disagree with our specific critiques of how so many COVID-19 communicators have flouted these principles COVID-19 (Disease);Communication in crisis management;Communication in public health","output":"COVID-19: The CIDRAP Viewpoint Part 2: Effective COVID-19 Crisis Communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 that belongs to the Corona groups.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Plinabulin vs Pegfilgrastim for the Prevention of Docetaxel-Induced Neutropenia in Patients With Solid Tumors (PROTECTIVE-1) double-blind phase 3 randomized clinical trial was performed in multiple centers in China, Russia, Ukraine, and the US. Participants included patients with breast, prostate, or nonCsmall cell lung cancer treated with single-agent docetaxel chemotherapy. Data were collected from June 1, 2018, to January 31, 2019. The database was locked on February 18, 2021. Data analysis was based on intention to treat and safety and performed from October 5, 2018, to February 23, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Plinabulin, 40 mg, plus placebo or pegfilgrastim, 6 mg, plus placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was day of severe neutropenia in cycle 1. Additional end points included clinical consequences of CIN (febrile neutropenia, hospitalizations, infections, antibiotic use, and modifications of chemotherapy dose), patient-reported outcomes for bone pain score, markers for immune suppression (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR] of >5), immature neutrophils (band, promyelocyte, and myelocyte counts >0), and safety. RESULTS: Among the 105 patients included in the analysis (65 [6.19%] women; median age, 59 [range, 31-81] years), the primary end point was met within a noninferiority margin of 0.65 days, with a mean difference of 0.52 days (98.52% CI, 0.40-0.65 days). Grade 4 neutropenia frequency in cycle 1 was not significantly different. Plinabulin had earlier onset of action with less grade 4 neutropenia in week 1 of cycle 1. Plinabulin had fewer adverse clinical consequences with rates of febrile neutropenia (0 of 52 vs 1 of 53 [1.9%]), infections (4 of 52 [7.7%] vs 8 of 53 [15.1%]), chemotherapy dose delay of more than 7 days (2 of 52 [3.8%] vs 3 of 53 [5.7%]), and permanent chemotherapy discontinuation (7 of 52 [13.5%] vs 14 of 53 [26.4%]). Patients receiving plinabulin had significantly less bone pain (difference, ?0.67 [95% CI, ?1.17 to ?0.16]; P = .01) and a better immunosuppressive profile (NLR >5 at day 8, 2 of 52 [3.8%] vs 24 of 51 [46.0%]; P < .001). Plinabulin was well tolerated, with comparable safety to pegfilgrastim.

This article aims to report and discuss the data of the first 8 weeks of COVID-19 epidemic in the emergency department (ED) of the University Hospital of Parma. METHODS. The ED visits were analyzed as follows: total ED visits, divided in COVID-19/ non-COVID-19 cases, and in trauma-related/non-trauma-related cases; outcome (i.e., discharged, admitted, dead in the ED) of patients, altogether or stratified according to triage class; age classes of the entire ED population. RESULTS. Total ED visits decreased starting from the first days of the outbreak, then exhibiting progressive growth afterwards. COVID suspected cases rapidly increased, whereas non-COVID suspected dropped and remained well below the standard. Trauma-related cases declined, both as ED visits and as hospital admissions. The percentage and absolute number of patients admitted to hospital wards progressively increased, rapidly overwhelming the number of cases that could be discharged. The admission rate in the lowest priority classes also displayed a marked increase. The youngest age classes dramatically declined, whilst the oldest progressively increased, remaining considerably over the standard rate of the local ED. CONCLUSIONS. The COVID-19 pandemic has obliged the health care systems to undergo a paradigm shift. Even triage criteria have partially lost their meaning, as shown by the dramatic increase of hospital admissions, even in the lowest priority classes. A deep re-organizational process of the ED was undertaken. Hospitals must be constantly resilient and prepared to these new emergencies in terms of equipment, medical and nurses staff, larger bed capacity in short time, availability of intensive and sub-intensive beds, and flexibility.

As per a 6-weeks baseline data collection, out of the 36 patients in Rumailah Hospital's LTCU-2, 40% were bedbound and only 60% of them were engaged in any kind of 'Out Of Bed Therapeutic Activities' (OOBTA) as of November 2020.The project aimed to increase patients' participation in OOBTA from 60% to 80% by December 2021. Methods: A Mobility Task Force (MTF) was formed from a Multi-disciplinary Team (MDT). The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Model of Improvement was utilized. A Cause and Effect Diagram with multi-disciplinary input identified potential causes limiting mobility and supported possible solutions for testing in a series of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles (Figure 1). Each specialty evaluated and provided appropriate OOBTA based on their level of care. Results: This project helped the unit to promote a culture3 of early and safe patient mobility as shown by increased participation in OOBTA and zero falls, no pressure injuries, etc. As a result, it helped the unit to attain more than 80% of patient participation in OOBTA during their hospital stay (Figure 2). The team observed good multidisciplinary collaboration and engagement in developing this mobility program. Conclusion: Promoting early mobility is a cultural change that improved patients' participation in OOBTA from 60% to 80% from July 2021, five months ahead of our target date and despite the COVID-19 pandemic situation.","output":"Integrating a multi-disciplinary mobility program into a long-term care practice: A quality initiative to improve value"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein serves multiple functions in viral replication, transcription, and assembly of the viral genome complex Coronaviruses specifically package genomic RNA into assembled virions, and in SARS-CoV, it is reported that this process is driven by an interaction between the N-protein and a packaging signal encoded within the viral RNA While recent studies have uncovered the sequence of this packaging signal, little is known about the specific interaction between the N-protein and the packaging signal sequence, and the mechanisms by which this interaction drives viral genome packaging In this study, we developed a novel in vivo cell-based assay for examining this interaction between the N-protein and packaging signal RNA for SARS-CoV, as well as other viruses within the coronaviridae family Our results demonstrate that the N-protein specifically recognizes the SARS-CoV packaging signal with greater affinity compared to signals from other coronaviruses or non-coronavirus species We also use deletion mapping to identify a 151-nt region within the packaging signal sequence that is critical for N-protein-RNA binding, and conversely, we show that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the N protein are necessary for recognizing the packaging RNA These results describe, for the first time, in vivo evidence for an interaction between the SARS-CoV N-protein and its packaging signal RNA, and demonstrate the feasibility of using this cell-based assay to further probe viral RNA-protein interactions in future studies ?

METHODS Forty patients (10 females, mean age 72 years), referred to CTA prior to endovascular treatment of PAD, were prospectively included and underwent peripheral CT angiography. A semiautomated toolbox was used to render mpCPRs. Twenty-one arterial segments were defined in each leg; for each segment, the presence of stenosis > 70% was assessed on mpCPRs and axial images by two readers, independently, with digital subtraction angiography as gold standard. RESULTS Both readers reached lower sensitivity (Reader 1: 91 vs. 94%, p = 0.08; Reader 2: 89 vs. 93%, p = 0.03) but significantly higher specificity (Reader 1: 94 vs. 89%, p < 0.01; Reader 2: 96 vs. 95%, p = 0.01) with mpCPRs than with axial images. Reader 1 achieved significantly higher accuracy with mpCPRs (93 vs. 91%, p = 0.02), and Reader 2 had similar overall accuracy in both evaluations (94 vs. 94%, p = 0.96). Both readers read mpCPRs significantly faster than axial images (Reader 1: 5'45 based on mpCPRs vs. 7'40 based on axial images; Reader 2: 4'41 based on mpCPRs vs. 6'57 based on axial images; p < 0.01).

Persistence in the LM-K cells was not accompanied by production of is mutants or of soluble anti-MHV factors. Infectious center assay demonstrated an approximately 500-fold lower level of infectibility by MHV of the LM-K cells as compared to L-2 cells. On an infected cell basis, production levels of infectious progeny and viral RNA were comparable between the two cell lines. The extent of virus-induced cell-cell fusion, however, was markedly reduced in the LM-K cells. Cell-mixing experiments showed that both infected L-2 and LM-K cells have the capacity of fusing with neighboring uninfected L-2 cells but not with uninfected LM-K cells. This suggests that the decreased level of fusion observed in the LM-K infection is due not to absence of viral fusion protein at the cell surface, but rather to an inherent resistance of the LM-K cell membrane to MHV-induced fusion. It is believed that such fusion resistance in LM-K cells moderates virus dissemination throughout the culture, thereby contributing to a state of virus persistence.","output":"Fusion resistance and decreased infectability as major host cell determinants of coronavirus persistence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human behavior is notoriously difficult to change, but a disruption of the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to bring about long-term behavioral changes.

METHODS: This is a post-hoc, ancillary and exploratory analysis from a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04449718. Patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 were recruited from two hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Of 240 randomized patients, 200 were assessed in this study and randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin D(3) (n = 101) or placebo (n = 99). The primary outcome was hospital length of stay, that has been published in our previous study. The prespecified secondary outcomes were serum levels of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The post-hoc exploratory secondary outcomes were interleukin-4, interleukin-12p70, interleukin-17A, interferon gamma (IFN-), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-8, interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), growth factor vascular endothelial (VEGF), and leukocytes count.

Existing surveillance systems are not based on population samples and are generally not longitudinal in design. MethodsFrom 26 April to 19 September2020, 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals were collected from individuals aged 2 years and over from a representative sample of private households from England. Participants completed a questionnaire and nose and throat swab were taken. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time using dynamic multilevel regression and post-stratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also evaluated using multilevel regression models. FindingsBetween 26 April and 19 September 2020, in total, results were available from 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals, of which 489 were positive overall from 398 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between end of April and June, followed by low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive in the first period but not (yet) in the second period of increased positivity rates, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms (53%-70%, dependent on calendar time).

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSUnprecedented control measures, such as national lockdowns, have been widely implemented to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Decisions regarding the continued need for social distancing measures in the overall population, specific subgroups and geographic areas heavily rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive. We searched PubMed and medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers up to 6 June 2020 for epidemiological studies using the terms \\"SARS-CoV-2\\" and \\"prevalence\\" or \\"incidence\\" without data or language restrictions. Most studies were small or had only information about current presence of the virus for a small subset of patients, or used data not representative of the community, such as hospital admissions, deaths or self-reported symptoms. Large population-based studies, such as the current study, are required to understand risk factors and the dynamics of the epidemic. Added value of this studyThis is the first longitudinal community survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection at national and regional levels in the UK. With more than 500,000 swabs from more than 120,000 individuals this study provides robust evidence that the percentage of individuals from the general community in England testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 clearly declined between end of April and June 2020,, followed by consistently low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, with having a patient-facing role and working outside your home being important risk factors in the first period but not (yet) in the second period, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported. Implications of all the available evidenceThe observed decline in the percentage of individuals testing positive adds to the increasing body of empirical evidence and theoretical models that suggest that the lockdown imposed on 23 March 2020 in England was associated, at least temporarily, with a decrease in infections. Important risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the epidemic moving forwards.","output":"Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England during April to September 2020: Results from the ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The formation of herd immunity through vaccination is a key point in overcoming the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The transport of mRNA vaccines is a challenging task, and to this end, each government is striving for safe distribution. In addition, each authority operates a surveillance system to monitor the safety of vaccines, and Korea needs to produce evidence for monitoring effects and side effects with expertise. Even after the acquisition of herd immunity, COVID-19 is highly likely to remain an endemic infectious disease, and a higher immunity level may be required because of variants of the virus.

We analyze the UPR signaling pathways involved in HCV infection, the various levels of UPR regulation by different viral proteins and finally, we propose several mechanisms by which the virus provokes the UPR.","output":"Unfolded protein response in hepatitis C virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: PATHFINDER is an interventional study that will examine how well a multi-cancer early detection test can be integrated into clinical practice. This test looks at DNA methylation patterns in patient blood samples to detect cancer and also predict cancer origin. The PATHFINDER study will include ~6200 study participants from 31 sites in the United States. The study will return tests results to participants and their health care providers and will evaluate how test results affect the clinical pathway to confirm or rule out a cancer diagnosis. Results of this study could help determine how a blood-based multi-cancer early detection test will fit into clinical practice. ABSTRACT: To examine the extent of the evaluation required to achieve diagnostic resolution and the test performance characteristics of a targeted methylation cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test, ~6200 participants 50 years with (cohort A) or without (cohort B) 1 of 3 additional specific cancer risk factors will be enrolled in PATHFINDER (NCT04241796), a prospective, longitudinal, interventional, multi-center study. Plasma cfDNA from blood samples will be analyzed to detect abnormally methylated DNA associated with cancer (i.e., cancer signal) and a cancer signal origin (i.e., tissue of origin). Participants with a signal detected will undergo further diagnostic evaluation per guiding physician discretion; those with a signal not detected will be advised to continue guideline-recommended screening. The primary objective will be to assess the number and types of subsequent diagnostic tests needed for diagnostic resolution. Based on microsimulations (using estimates of cancer incidence and dwell times) of the typical risk profiles of anticipated participants, the median (95% CI) number of participants with a signal detected result is expected to be 106 (87C128). Subsequent diagnostic evaluation is expected to detect 52 (39C67) cancers. The positive predictive value of the MCED test is expected to be 49% (39C58%). PATHFINDER will evaluate the integration of a cfDNA-based MCED test into existing clinical cancer diagnostic pathways. The study design of PATHFINDER is described here.","output":"The PATHFINDER Study: Assessment of the Implementation of an Investigational Multi-Cancer Early Detection Test into Clinical Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & Aims Over 404 million people worldwide have been infected with COVID-19, 145 million in the United States (77 million) and Europe (151 million) alone (as of Feb. 10th, 2022). This paper aims to analyze data from studies reporting Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and/or endoscopic findings in COVID-19 patients in Western countries. Methods We conducted a systematic review of articles on confirmed COVID-19 cases with GIB in Western countries published in PubMed and Google Scholar databases from June 20th, 2020, to July 10th, 2021. Results A total of 12 studies reporting GIB and/or endoscopic findings in 808 COVID-19 patients in Western countries were collected and analyzed. Outcomes and comorbidities were compared with 18,179 non-GIB COVID-19 patients from Italy and the United States. As per our study findings the overall incidence of GIB in COVID-19 patients was found to be 0.06%. When compared to non-GIB cohort, death rate was significantly high in COVID-19 patients with GIB (16.4% vs. 25.4%, p<0.001, respectively). Endoscopic treatment was rarely necessary, and blood transfusion was the most common GIB treatment. Most common presentation in GIB patients is melena (n=117, 47.5%). Peptic, esophageal, and rectal ulcers were the most common endoscopic findings in upper (48.4%) and lower endoscopies (36.4%), respectively. The GIB cohort had worse outcomes and higher incidence of hypertension (61.1%), liver disease (11.2%), and cancer (13.6%) when compared with non-GIB cohort. Death was strongly associated with hypertension (p<0.001, r=0.814), hematochezia (p<0.001, r=0.646) and EGD (p<0.001, r=0.591) in COVID-19 patients with GIB. Conclusion Overall, the incidence of GIB in COVID-19 patients is similar to that estimated in the overall population with melena being the most common presentation. The common endoscopic findings in GIB COVID-19 patients were ulcers, esophagitis, gastritis, and colitis. Patients with GIB were more prone to death than non-GIB COVID-19 patients.","output":"Clinical and Endoscopic Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients with Gastrointestinal Bleeding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: There is no specific antiviral treatment with proven efficacy and safety in the management of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) We aimed to compare the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HQ) monotherapy and HQ-lopinavir/ritonavir (Lpv/r) combined therapy in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and to determine the independent factors predicting mortality Materials and Methods: Retrospective observational multi-centered cohort study Results: In total, 151 patients (mean age 61 +/- 17 years, 66% male) with COVID-19 pneumonia were included: 68 patients received combination therapy, i e , Lpv/r in addition to HO, and 83 patients received only HQ The patients in both groups were similar regarding the majority of baseline variables except for white blood cell count, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase levels, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates, which were significantly higher, and decreased oxygen saturation in the combination group The mean duration of symptoms and hospital stay were 5 6 +/- 2 3 days and 12 7 +/- 9 4 days, respectively Nearly 43% (n=65) of patients were admitted to the ICU Patients in the HQ monotherapy group had a shorter stay in hospital than those in the combination group (10 vs 16 days, p&lt;0 005) The primary end points were 14- and 28-day mortality Neither treatment group revealed significant differences with respect to 14-day and 28-day survival before and after propensity score matching Age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and ICU stay length were variable predictors of 14-day mortality, while CCI [Hazard ratio (HR) 95% confidence interval (CI): 0 85 (0 43-0 9)] and ICU stay length [HR (95% CI): 1 5 (1 39-1 76)] were the independent predictors of 28-day mortality Conclusion: Combination therapy with Lpv/r and HQ did not provide any benefit compared with HQ monotherapy Charlson Comorbidity Index and ICU stay were independent predictors of 28-day mortality","output":"The Effectiveness of Hydroxychloroquine Versus Hydroxychloroquine Plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir Therapy in SARS- CoV-2 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In response to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vascular surgeons in the Veteran Affairs Health Care System have been undertaking only essential cases, such as advanced critical limb ischemia. Surgical risk assessment in these patients is often complex, considers all factors known to impact short- and long-term outcomes, and the additional risk that COVID-19 infection could convey in this patient population is unknown. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published risk factors (ECDC-RF) implicated in increased COVID-19 hospitalization and case-fatality which have been further evidenced by initial reports from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC reports additionally indicate that African American (AA) patients have incurred disparate infection outcomes in the United States. We set forth to survey the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) database over a nearly 20 year span to inform ongoing risk assessment with an estimation of the prevalence of ECDC-RF in our veteran critical limb ischemia population and investigate whether an increased COVID-19 comorbidity burden exists for AA veterans presenting for major non-traumatic amputation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The VASQIP database was queried for all above knee amputation (AKA) and below knee amputation (BKA) completed 1999-2018 after IRB approval (MIRB:#02507). Patient race and ECDC-RF including male gender, age > 60 years, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease were recorded from preoperative patient history. AKA and BKA cohorts were compared via &#967;2-test with Yates correction or unpaired t-test and a subgroup analysis was conducted between AA and all other race patients for COVID-19 comorbidities in each cohort. RESULTS: VASQIP query returned 50,083 total entries. Average age was 65.1  10.4 years and 68.2  10.5 years for BKA and AKA cohorts, respectively, (P < .0001) and nearly all patients were male (99%). At least one ECDC-RF comorbidity was present in 25,526 (88.7%) of BKA and 17,558 (82.4%) of AKA patients (P < .0001). AA BKA patients were significantly more likely than non-AA BKA patients to present with at least one ECDC-RF comorbidity (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: According to a large national Veterans Affairs database, there are high rates of ECDC-RF in veteran amputees. During the present crisis, management of these patients should incorporate telehealth, expedient discharge, and ongoing COVID-19 transmission precautions.","output":"Optimizing Peripandemic Care for Veteran Major Non-Traumatic Lower Extremity Amputees: A Proposal Informed by a National Retrospective Descriptive Analysis of COVID-19 Risk Factor Prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are a major health concern, and some previous studies have shown that wearing masks was effective in preventing RVIs, while others failed to show such effect. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of wearing masks. METHODS: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP database) were searched for studies evaluating the effectiveness of wearing masks. The risk ratio (RR) was used to measure the effectiveness of wearing masks in preventing RVIs for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies, and the odds ratio (OR) was used for case-control studies. Forest plots were used to visually assess pooled estimates and corresponding 95% CIs. The I(2) test was used to examine the heterogeneity, and subgroup analysis was used to explore the possible explanations for heterogeneity or compare the results between subgroups. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess robustness of the synthesized results. Begg's test and Egger's test were used to assess the publications bias. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies (13,329 participants) were eligible for meta-analyses. Overall, the results showed that wearing masks was effective in preventing RVIs. The sensitivity analysis showed that the results of those meta-analyses were robust and reliable. There was no significant publication bias in meta-analysis of case-control studies and most subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Wearing masks might be effective in preventing RVIs.

This study assessed the relationship between COVID-19-related knowledge and anxiety response among PE teachers during such practical lessons while moderating the effects of workplace safety perception and educational qualification within the relationship. The study conveniently recruited 160 PE teachers to solicit responses through both online and printed questionnaires. Using correlation and linear regression analyses, the study revealed a significant negative relationship between COVID-19-related knowledge and anxiety response among PE teachers. The educational qualification of PE teachers did not significantly moderate the association between COVID-19-related knowledge and anxiety response. Workplace safety perception significantly moderated the association between COVID-19-related knowledge and anxiety response among PE teachers. The findings remind educational authorities about the essence of creating a positive and safe working environment conducive to academic work.

Methods: Clinical information of 100 infants born to 98 mothers (COVID-19 n = 31, non-COVID-19 n = 67) were collected. Infants were follow-up up to 9 months post-partum. The placental tissues were examined for SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathological changes, cytokines, and mtDNA content. Results: Decreased placental oxygen and nutrient transport capacity were found in infected pregnant women. Increased IL-2, IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- were detected in trophoblast cells and maternal blood of COVID-19 placentas. Elevated early fine motor abnormal-ities and increased serum TNI (troponin I) levels at delivery were observed in infants born to mothers with COVID-19.

Objective: Here we describe the differences between rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 infection in normal and diluted samples, simulating the need for dilution due to the presence of amplification inhibitors. Material and method: Viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) from samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from 20 patients previously detected as \\"Negative\\" and 21 patients detected as \\"Positive\\" for SARS-CoV-2 was performed with the EasyExtract DNA-RNA kit (Interprise?). The rRT-PCR was performed with the OneStep/COVID-19 kit (IBMP), with normal and diluted (80 l of H2O RNAse free) samples, totaling 82 tests. Results: The results indicate that there is an average variation (a &lt; 0.05) delaying the Cq between the results of amplification of the internal control (IC), N gene (NG), and ORF1ab (OF), 1.811 Cq, 3.840 Cq, and 3.842 Cq, respectively. Discussion: The extraction kit does not completely purify the inhibitor compounds; therefore, no amplified product result may occur. In this study, we obtained a 19.04% false-negative diagnosis after sample dilution; this process reduces the efficiency of rRT-PCR to 29.8% in detecting SARS-CoV-2.

Prolonged dyspnea after mask removal in the morning, often referred to as deventilation syndrome, is a common side effect but has been poorly characterized yet. This study aimed to explore the pathomechanism, identify risk factors and possible treatment strategies for the deventilation syndrome. METHODS: A prospective, controlled, non-blinded study was conducted. After a night with established NIV therapy, the patients underwent spirometry, blood gas analyses and 6-min walking tests (6MWT) directly, at 2 and 4 h after mask removal. Dyspnea was measured by the modified Borg scale. Bodyplethysmography and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires were used. Patients suffering from deventilation syndrome (defined as dyspnea of at least three points on the Borg scale after mask removal) were treated with non-invasive pursed lip breathing ventilation (PLBV) during the second night of the study. RESULTS: Eleven of 31 patients included (35%) met the given criteria for a deventilation syndrome. They reported significantly more dyspnea on the Borg scale directly after mask removal (mean: 7.2  1.0) compared to measurement after 2 h (4.8  2.6; p = 0.003). Initially, mean inspiratory vital capacity was significantly reduced (VCmax: 46  16%) compared to 2 h later (54  15%; p = 0.002), while no changes in pulse oximetry or blood gas analysis were observed. Patients who suffered from a deventilation syndrome had a significantly higher mean airway resistance (Reff: 320  88.5%) than the patients in the control group (253  147%; p = 0.021). They also scored significantly lower on the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire (SRI; mean: 37.6  10.1 vs 50.6  16.7, p = 0.027). After one night of ventilation in PLBV mode, mean morning dyspnea decreased significantly to 5.6  2.0 compared to 7.2  1.0 after established treatment (p = 0.019) and mean inspiratory vital capacity increased from 44  16.0% to 48  16.3 (p = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: The deventilation syndrome is a serious side effect of NIV in COPD patients, characterized by increase of dyspnea. It is associated with decrease in vital capacity, exercise tolerance after mask removal and lower HRQoL. Patients with high airway resistance are at greater risk of suffering from morning dyspnea.

There is good evidence of safety and efficacy. Extension of pre-existing TAC during the COVID pandemic has proven successful. Rapid start-up models for establishing TACs are not well described in the literature. This study aimed to prove that a modified TAC has similar efficacy and can be initiated in rapid start-up manner with minimal cost. Methods A new electronic pathway of referral with a template was created between the Emergency Department (ED) and the Orthopaedic department. Results Following introduction of our modified TAC 32% of patients referred to the TAC did not require in-person review thereby avoiding any additional hospital visit. Average time to first in-person review appointment was 15 days. Combining these, the projected reduction in all fracture clinic attendance was 48%. Conclusion This paper describes the process of how a major teaching and tertiary referral orthopaedic unit developed an accelerated establishment process for a Trauma Assessment Clinic as an alternative to the traditional \\"Glasgow model\\". This can be instituted quickly, safely, and is scalable for use in a large hospital.

The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenged by many factors, including scientific uncertainties, scarcity of relevant research, proliferation of misinformation and fake news, poor access to actionable evidence, time constraints, and weak collaborations among relevant stakeholders. Knowledge translation (KT) platforms, composed of organisations, initiatives and networks supporting evidence-informed policy-making, can play an important role in providing relevant and timely evidence to inform pandemic responses and bridge the gap between science, policy, practice and politics. In this Commentary, we highlight the emerging roles of KT platforms in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also reflect on the lessons learned from the efforts of a KT platform in a middle-income country to inform decision-making and practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lessons learned can be integrated into strengthening the role, structures and mandates of KT platforms as hubs for trustworthy evidence that can inform policies and practice during public health crises and in promoting their integration and institutionalisation within the policy-making processes.","output":"Amplifying the role of knowledge translation platforms in the COVID-19 pandemic response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented shutdown of society. Nearly 1.725 billion children across the globe have been affected as over 95% of countries closed schools as the virus spread in April 2020. Much attention has been given to school closures as non-pharmaceutical mitigation tools to stem the spread of the disease through ensuring social distancing. Within education, focus has been given to keep students connected through remote learning and the immediate needs of schools upon reopening. This study takes a longer-term view. Using Demographic Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys from before and after the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea and Sierra Leone, this study examines changes in enrolment and dropout patterns, with targeted consideration given to traditionally marginalized groups. With schools closed for seven and nine months in the two countries, the length and intensity of the Ebola pandemic is the only health crises in the past century to come close to the school closures being experienced in 2020. Findings suggest that youth in the poorest households see the largest increase in dropout rates post-Ebola and that this impact can persist for years. Two years after being declared Ebola-free an additional 22,000 of the poorest secondary age youth remained out of school than would have been expected based on the pre-outbreak dropout rate. To halt the likely expansion in inequality post-pandemic, these results point to the need for longer term, sustainable planning that includes comprehensive financial support packages to groups most likely to be impacted.","output":"Potential long-term consequences of school closures: Lessons from the 2013-2016 Ebola pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Over-the-counter medication overdose is a difficult diagnostic challenge for many physicians as common drug screening assays cannot detect these substances.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old African American female with a past medical history of anxiety, childhood asthma, previous methamphetamine abuse, and coronavirus disease 2019 infection in August 2020 was brought to the emergency department by the local police department with altered mental status. Initial blood work, including extended drug screens, were unremarkable for a definitive diagnosis. This patient required critical-care-level support and high sedation because of her symptoms. Collateral history revealed the patient regularly consumed Triple-C daily for the 6 weeks prior to admission. A trial off sedation was attempted after 24 hours with no complications. The patient admitted to regular Triple-C consumption and auditory hallucinations since adolescence. She was discharged safely after 48 hours back into the community. She was lost to follow-up with psychiatry and internal medicine; however, she was evaluated in the emergency room 1 month later with a similar psychiatric presentation.

A model was used to estimate FMD risk as a function of the international trade in live animals, controlling for the biosecurity measures undertaken by importing and exporting countries, and for the presence of endemic FMD reservoirs. It was found that the indirect risks associated with exports may be as great as the direct risks associated with imports.

Despite intensive efforts, no effective vaccine has been developed against ALV because of mutations that lead to resistant forms. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop antiviral agents for the treatment of ALV infections and RNA interference (RNAi) is considered an effective antiviral strategy. RESULTS: In this study, the avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) proviral genome, including the gag genes, were treated as targets for RNAi. Four pairs of miRNA sequences were designed and synthesized that targeted different regions of the gag gene. The screened target (i.e., the gag genes) was shown to effectively suppress the replication of ALV-J by 19.0-77.3%. To avoid the generation of escape variants during virus infection, expression vectors of multi-target miRNAs were constructed using the multi-target serial strategy (against different regions of the gag, pol, and env genes). Multi-target miRNAs were shown to play a synergistic role in the inhibition of ALV-J replication, with an inhibition efficiency of viral replication ranging from 85.0-91.2%.

During the Chinese New Year Holiday (P2), NO x emission intensity in China declined by 44.7% compared to the preceding 3 weeks (P1). NO x emission intensity increased by 20.3% during the 4 weeks after P2 (P3), despite the unchanged NO2 column. It recovered to 2019 level at the end of March (P4).

Living strategies is a concept derived from the perspective of people living with HIV, defined as behaviors, attitudes and beliefs adopted by people living with HIV to help deal with disability associated with HIV and multi-morbidity. Our aim was to describe disability among adults living with HIV and self-care living strategies used during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Adults living with HIV in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, including some with pre-pandemic HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ) data, completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between June-August 2020. The survey included the HDQ and questions about self-care living strategy use during the pandemic. We compared disability (HDQ) scores prior to versus during the pandemic using paired t-tests. We reported the proportion of participants who engaged in various living strategies at least a few times a week or everyday during the pandemic. RESULTS: Of the 63 respondents, 84% were men, median age 57 years, and 62% lived alone. During the pandemic the greatest disability severity was in the uncertainty (median 30; Interquartile range (IQR): 16, 43) and mental-emotional (25; IQR: 14, 41) domains. Among the 51 participants with pre-pandemic data, HDQ severity scores were significantly greater (worse) during the pandemic (vs prior) in all domains. Greatest change from prior to during the pandemic was in the mental-emotional domain for presence (17.7; p<0.001), severity (11.4; p<0.001), and episodic nature (9.3; p<0.05) of disability. Most participants (>60%) reported engaging a few times a week or everyday in self-care strategies associated with maintaining sense of control and adopting positive attitudes and beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: People living with HIV reported high levels of uncertainty and mental-emotional health challenges during the pandemic. Disability increased across all HDQ dimensions, with the greatest worsening in the mental-emotional health domain.

Consequently, they likely spread the virus to other people as they continue their everyday life. This emphasizes the importance for targeting high-risk groups for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (with real-time PCR techniques). However, the availability of the necessary technology and resources may be limited in certain towns, cities or countries. Thus, the challenge is to determine a criterion in order to prioritize the suspected cases most in need of testing. The aim of the present study was to develop a method for evaluating the risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection based on geolocation data. The risk is expressed as a score that will be instrumental in optimally applying the COVID-19 test to suspected cases representing the highest probability of exposure. It can be easily and quickly implemented with easily accessible open source tools. A simulation was herein conducted with data from four people, assigning infection to one of them. The results show the feasibility of assessing the risk of exposure with the new methodology.

The current approach largely depends on RT-PCR/rapid antigen tests that require expert personnel resulting in higher costs and reduced testing frequency. Loss of smell is reported as a major symptom of Covid-19, however, a precise olfactory testing tool to identify Covid-19 patient is still lacking. Methods: To quantitatively check for the loss of smell, we developed an odor strip, COVID-Anosmia checker, spotted with gradients of coffee and lemon grass oil. We validated its efficiency in healthy and COVID-19 positive subjects. A trial screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected persons was also carried out to check the sensitivity and specificity of our screening tool. Results: It was observed that COVID positive participants were hyposmic instead of being anosmic when they were subjected to smelling higher odor concentration. Our tool identified 97% of symptomatic and 94% of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive subjects after excluding most confounding factors like concurrent chronic sinusitis.

Combining non-culture and culture-based diagnostics allows earlier identification of candidemia. Given higher reported incidence during COVID-19 surges, we investigated the use of (1-3)--D-glucan (BDG) assay at our institution in those who did and did not develop candidemia. METHODS: Retrospective study of adults admitted to The Mount Sinai Hospital between March 15-June 30 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with either 1 BDG assay or positive fungal blood culture. Data was collected with the electronic medical record and Vigilanz. A BDG value  80 was used as a positivity cutoff. Differences in mortality were assessed by univariate logistic regression using R (version 4.0.0). Statistical significance was measured by P value < .05. RESULTS: There were 75 patients with 1 BDG assay resulted and 28 patients with candidemia, with an overlap of 9 between the cohorts. Among the 75 who had BDG assay, 23 resulted positive and 52 negative. Nine of 75 patients developed candidemia. Of the 23 with a positive assay, 5 developed candidemia and 18 did not. Seventeen of the 18 had blood cultures drawn within 7 days +/- of BDG assay. Four patients with candidemia had persistently negative BDG; 2 had cultures collected within 7 days +/- of BDG assay. With a cut-off of >80, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.92. When the cut-off increased to >200, NPV was 0.97 and positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.42. Average antifungal days in patients with negative BDG was 2.6 vs. 4.2 in those with a positive. Mortality was 74% in those with 1 positive BDG vs. 50% in those with persistently negative BDGs. There was a trend towards higher odds of death in those with positive BDG (OR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.00-8.90, p < 0.06). CONCLUSION: There was substantial use of BDG to diagnose candidemia at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Blood cultures were often drawn at time of suspected candidemia but not routinely. When cultures and BDG were drawn together, BDG had a high NPV but low PPV. High NPV of BDG likely contributed to discontinuation of empiric antifungals. The candidemic COVID-19 patients had high mortality, so further investigation of algorithms for the timely diagnosis of candidemia are needed to optimize use of antifungals while improving mortality rates.

Recent works have focused on partial differential equation (PDE) models, particularly reaction-diffusion models, able to describe the progression of an epidemic in both space and time. These studies have shown generally promising results in describing and predicting COVID-19 progression. However, people often travel long distances in short periods of time, leading to nonlocal transmission of the disease. Such contagion dynamics are not well-represented by diffusion alone. In contrast, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models may easily account for this behavior by considering disparate regions as nodes in a network, with the edges defining nonlocal transmission. In this work, we attempt to combine these modeling paradigms via the introduction of a network structure within a reaction-diffusion PDE system. This is achieved through the definition of a population-transfer operator, which couples disjoint and potentially distant geographic regions, facilitating nonlocal population movement between them. We provide analytical results demonstrating that this operator does not disrupt the physical consistency or mathematical well-posedness of the system, and verify these results through numerical experiments. We then use this technique to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic in the Brazilian region of Rio de Janeiro, showcasing its ability to capture important nonlocal behaviors, while maintaining the advantages of a reaction-diffusion model for describing local dynamics.","output":"Modeling nonlocal behavior in epidemics via a reaction-diffusion system incorporating population movement along a network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 named COVID-19 poses a severe health hazard for the public.

Yet, the focus of much local policy and practice is on behaviour change. Research shows that whilst lifestyle approaches can improve population health, at best they fail to reduce health inequalities because they fail to address upstream structural determinants of behaviour and health outcomes. In health research, most efforts have been directed at three streams of work: understanding causal pathways; evaluating the equity impact of national policy; and developing and evaluating lifestyle/behavioural approaches to health improvement. As a result, there is a dearth of research on effective interventions to reduce health inequalities that can be developed and implemented at a local level. OBJECTIVE: To describe an initiative that aimed to mainstream a focus on health equity in a large-scale research collaboration in the United Kingdom and to assess the impact on organizational culture, research processes and individual research practice. METHODS: The study used multiple qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews, focus groups and workshops (n = 131 respondents including Public Advisers, university, National Health Service (NHS), and local and document review. RESULTS: utilizing Extended Normalization Process Theory (ENPT) and gender mainstreaming theory, the evaluation illuminated (i) the processes developed by Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care North West Coast to integrate ways of thinking and acting to tackle the upstream social determinants of health inequities (i.e. to mainstream a health equity focus) and (ii) the factors that promoted or frustrated these efforts.

To introduce the representative troublesome cases related to the manipulation of donor (DAs) and recipient (RAs) arteries during low-flow extracranial-intracranial bypass. METHODS For the past 5 years, a total of 507 low-flow bypass surgeries were performed in patients with cerebral aneurysms, moyamoya diseases and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis diseases. Perioperative frustrating situations were retrospectively reviewed and 6 representative cases were finally described. RESULTS The first case was about the repeat microanastomosis due to the occlusion of the anastomotic segment by thrombus formation. The second case was about the repair of the DA injured by the thermal energy. The third case was about the direct repair of the DA damaged by a sharp knife. The fourth case was about the repeat microanastomosis due to the avulsion of the anastomotic segment. The fifth case was about lengthening the short DA with a nearby interposition graft. The sixth case was about the use of retrograde flow via the distal segment of DA due to the injury of the proximal segment of DA. In all patients, rescue procedures were successful and bypass flow was patent with no relevant complications.

METHODSSix national, matched, test-negative case-control studies were conducted to estimate effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, natural immunity due to prior infection with pre-Omicron variants, and hybrid immunity from prior infection and vaccination. RESULTSEffectiveness of only prior infection against symptomatic BA.2 infection was 46.1% (95% CI: 39.5-51.9%). Effectiveness of only two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was negligible at -1.1% (95% CI: -7.1-4.6), but nearly all individuals had received their second dose several months earlier. Effectiveness of only three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 52.2% (95% CI: 48.1-55.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 55.1% (95% CI: 50.9-58.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 77.3% (95% CI: 72.4-81.4%).

Co-immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays were used to elucidate the physiological and functional relevance of p57/FHL2 interaction. We found in cancer cells that endogenous p57 and FHL2 are in a complex. We observed a substantial induction of established FHL2-regulated gene promoters by p57 in reporter gene experiments and detected strong induction of the intrinsic transactivation activity of FHL2. Treatment of cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and binding of exogenous FHL2 to HDACs indicated repression of FHL2 transcription activity by HDACs. In the presence of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate activation of FHL2 by p57 is abrogated suggesting that p57 shares a common pathway with HDAC inhibitors. p57 competes with HDACs for FHL2 binding which might partly explain the mechanism of FHL2 activation by p57.

However, the actual effects of this pathogen on pregnancy and on placental morphology are still unclear. Objective: To describe histopathologic findings in the placentas of women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and their correlation with clinical signs and perinatal outcome. Methods: Placental tissues from pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection delivering between March 2020 and February 2021 were analyzed. Results: One hundred six placentas from women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy who delivered in Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli were examined. Most of them were asymptomatic. All neonates had available test results for SARS-CoV-2 and only one resulted positive. Placental tissues mainly showed signs of maternal vascular malperfusion and of placenta injury in terms of syncytial node increase (96.2%), villar agglutination (77.3%), neointimal hyperplasia (76.4%), excessive fibrin deposition (43.3%), and chorangiosis (35.8%). No significant differences in the frequency of the histopathological lesions were observed according to maternal symptoms. Conclusion: Looking to placental tissues from SARS-CoV-2 positive women at the screening performed close to delivery, placental injuries could be detected without any correlation with fetal and neonatal outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Work engagement and sense of coherence can help professionals to cope with work-related psychological distress due to the harsh conditions of the COVID-19 working environment. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of 1,459 health care professionals. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale and Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire were distributed and analysed with descriptive and multiple linear regression methods. RESULTS: High levels of work engagement, especially in the dedication dimension, of sense of coherence, in particular in the meaningfulness dimension, and psychological distress were obtained. Significant correlations (p < .001) were identified between all the variables. CONCLUSIONS: Work engagement and sense of coherence correlated positively with each other and both negatively with psychological distress.

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study of SNF patients using 100% Medicare inpatient claims and Minimum Data Set resident assessment data. Linear probability models were used to estimate the probability of successful discharge based on patient and staff beliefs about the patient's ability to improve in function and patients and staff beliefs together. Estimates were adjusted for demographic, health status, functional characteristics, and SNF fixed effects. PARTICIPANTS Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 years who were discharged to a SNF following hospitalization for stroke, hip fracture or TBI. INTERVENTIONS Not Applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Successful community discharge (discharged alive within 90 days of SNF admission and remaining in the community for  30 days without dying or health care facility readmission). RESULTS Patients with positive beliefs about their capability to increase independence with ADLs had a higher adjusted probability of successful discharge than patients with negative beliefs (positive: 63.8%, negative: 57.8%, difference: 6.0%, 95%CI=5.4, 6.6%). This remained true regardless of staff beliefs, but the difference in successful discharge probability between patients with positive and negative beliefs was larger when staff had positive beliefs. Conversely, the association between staff beliefs and successful discharge varied based on patient beliefs: if patients had positive beliefs, the difference in the probability of successful discharge between positive and negative staff beliefs was 2.5% (95%CI=1.0, 4.0). If patients had negative beliefs, the difference between positive and negative staff beliefs was -4.6% (95%CI=-6.0, -3.2). CONCLUSIONS Patients' beliefs have a significant association with the probability of successful discharge. Understanding patients' beliefs is critical to appropriate goal-setting, discharge planning and quality SNF care.","output":"Positive Beliefs the Likelihood of Successful Community Discharge from Skilled Nursing Facilities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) core symptoms that impair executive function (EF), emotional state, learning motivation, and the family and parenting environment of children and adolescents with ADHD, both with and without severe difficulties. This will be explored within an online learning environment during the period of COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 183 ADHD children diagnosed using DSM-V criteria were selected and divided into 2 groups high difficulties during online learning (HDOL) and low difficulties during online learning (LDOL) according to the answer of Home Quarantine Investigation of the Pandemic (HQIP). The participants filled out a set of questionnaires to assess their emotional state and learning motivation, and their parents also filled out the questionnaires about ADHD core symptoms, EF, and family and parenting environment. Compared with ADHD children in the LDOL group, the children in the HDOL group had significant symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, oppositional defiant, behavioral and emotional problems according to the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale (SNAP). They also had more severely impaired EF according to the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), more difficulties and disturbances in the family by the Chinese version of Family Environment Scale (FES-CV), and lower parenting efficacy and satisfaction by Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC). With regard to the self-rating questionnaires of children and adolescents, the HDOL group reported lower learning motivation according to the Students Learning Motivation Scale (SLMS). By Screening for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders and Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRSC), those in HDOL presented more negative emotions. The HDOL group spent significantly more time on both video games and social software per day and significantly less time on multiple activities per week, when compared to those in the LDOL group. This study demonstrated that ADHD children and adolescents with HDOL had more inattention-related behaviors, more severe emotional problems and EF impairment, weaker learning motivation, and poorer family and parenting environment.

We sought to determine if N95s and snorkel masks with attached high-efficiency filters provide consistent protection levels in healthcare workers and if the addition of positive pressure via an inexpensive powered-air purifying respirator to the snorkel mask would provide enhanced protection. Fifty-one healthcare workers who were qualitatively fitted with N95 masks underwent quantitative mask fit testing according to a simulated workplace exercise protocol. N95, snorkel masks with high-efficiency filters and snorkel masks with powered-air purifying respirators were tested. Respiratory filtration ratios were collected for each step and averaged to obtain an overall workplace protocol fit factor.

Highest concentration of bacterial aerosols observed to be associated with PM10 size fraction in urban site (2136  285 CFU/m3) whereas maximum fungal concentration has been measured in rural houses (1521  302 CFU/m3). Predominantly found bacterial species were Bacillus sp., S. aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungal species were Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., and Penicillium sp. in both urban and rural residential premises. Concentration of endotoxin measured using the kinetic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay exhibited that the level of endotoxin in both urban and rural sites are associated with household characteristics and the activities performed in indoor as well as outdoor. Cell free DTT assay confirmed the ability of these airborne microbes to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) varying along with the types of microorganisms. On exposure of A549 cells to airborne microbes, a significant decrease in cell viability was observed in terms of both necrosis and apoptosis pathway. Elevated production of nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines in epithelial cells and macrophages clearly suggest the inflammatory nature of these airborne microbes.

DESIGN: Rapid systematic review. PARTICIPANTS: Humans with viral respiratory infections, exposed to systemic NSAIDs. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Acute severe adverse outcomes, healthcare utilisation, quality of life and long-term survival. RESULTS: We screened 10 999 titles and abstracts and 738 full texts, including 87 studies. No studies addressed COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; none examined inpatient healthcare utilisation, quality of life or long-term survival. Effects of NSAIDs on mortality and cardiovascular events in adults with viral respiratory infections are unclear (three observational studies; very low certainty). Children with empyema and gastrointestinal bleeding may be more likely to have taken NSAIDs than children without these conditions (two observational studies; very low certainty). In patients aged 3 years and older with acute respiratory infections, ibuprofen is associated with a higher rate of reconsultations with general practitioners than paracetamol (one randomised controlled trial (RCT); low certainty). The difference in death from all causes and hospitalisation for renal failure and anaphylaxis between children with fever receiving ibuprofen versus paracetamol is likely to be less than 1 per 10 000 (1 RCT; moderate/high certainty). Twenty-eight studies in adults and 42 studies in children report adverse event counts. Most report that no severe adverse events occurred. Due to methodological limitations of adverse event counts, this evidence should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: It is unclear whether the use of NSAIDs increases the risk of severe adverse outcomes in patients with viral respiratory infections. This absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence for the absence of such risk. This is a rapid review with a number of limitations.

Among healthcare workers vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a survey was conducted to analyze the relationship between the incidence and severity of adverse reactions after vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a prospective self-reported survey of adverse reactions among healthcare workers vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty?) in Japan. After the first and second dose of vaccine, local and systemic reactions for 8 days after vaccination were reported by volunteer participants using a website. After receiving vaccination, 374 respondents participated in this matched-pair study. RESULTS: Both the incidence and severity of adverse reactions tended to be higher after the second vaccine dose than after the first dose. However, the incidence and numeric rating scale (NRS) score of muscle and skin pain were nearly the same after the first and second doses. In a comparison by sex, women had significantly higher incidence and NRS scores for adverse reactions such as headache, skin pain, erythema, and itching. The results also showed that younger age groups had higher incidence rates and NRS scores for all adverse reactions investigated, except for muscle pain, compared with older age groups. CONCLUSION: Some adverse reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty? COVID-19 vaccine showed gender and age differences. However, generally speaking, all side reactions disappear within a week.

Focusing on these features and the role of epidemic management, we obtain differential equations for the total number of detected cases of Covid-19, which describe the actual curves in many countries almost with the accuracy of physics laws. The two-phase solution we propose worked very well almost for the whole periods of the spread practically in all countries we analyzed that reached the saturation during the first waves.

Due to a very small number of parameters, namely, the initial transmission rate and the intensity of the hard and soft measures, we obtain a convincing explanation of the surprising uniformity of the curves of the total numbers of detected infections in many different areas. This theory can serve as a tool for forecasting the epidemic spread and evaluating the efficiency of the protective measures, which is very much needed for epidemics.

METHODS We assessed the effect of deploying SARS-Cov-2 vaccines on cold storage capacity and immunization workload in a simulated WHO African Region country using region-specific data on immunization, population, healthcare workers (HCWs), cold storage capacity (quartile values for national and subnational levels), and characteristics of an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We calculated monthly increases in vaccine doses, doses per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for four-month SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. RESULTS Administering SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to risk groups would increase total monthly doses by 27.0% for  65 years, 91.7% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.1% for HCWs. Assuming median nurse density estimates adjusted for absenteeism and proportion providing immunization services, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase total monthly doses per vaccinator by 29.3% for  65 years, 99.6% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.2% for HCWs. When we applied quartiles of actual African Region country vaccine storage capacity, routine immunization vaccine volumes exceeded national-level storage capacity for at least 75% of countries, but subnational levels had sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for at least 75% of countries. CONCLUSIONS In the WHO African Region, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold storage capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines.

Methods A total of 35 old rats (aged 40-50 weeks) were randomly divided into 5 groups including control, saline (S), exercise training (ET), garlic (G) and exercise training+ garlic (ET.G) groups. Exercise was started for 5 min/day and then gradually extended to 60 min/day and the G and E+G groups received 1 mL/kg of this mixture by gavage. Twenty-four hours after completion of 8 weeks training, liver, kidney and blood samples were collected for histopathological examinations, liver and kidney functions, oxidative stress and apoptosis biomarkers. Results The tissue sections of the SW exercise, control and saline groups showed some mild histopathological changes in liver and kidney, while SW supplemented with garlic prevented these damages. The SW alone or supplemented with garlic significantly increased the Bcl-2 value and declined the BAX level in both liver and kidney (p<0.05).

The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from direct invasion of pathogens. However, the cells share their content with other cells in small nanovesicles called exosomes that can travel long distances and cross biological barriers. Therefore, virus-infected cell extracellular vesicles (EVs) might transmit inflammatory signals or even viral particles to other cells. If they would carry such signals or particles to the central nervous system, it might cause neuroinflammation. However, the migration and impact of virus-primed airway cell EVs on the brain have not been studied yet. Therefore, the study aimed to track airway EVs from the respiratory tract to the brain and determine how infection-primed particles affect microgliathe cells responsible for immune response in the brain. The study revealed that airway cell EVs enter the brain within an hour and gather in microglia. Interestingly, many airway EVs were found in the hippocampus, the region most affected by Alzheimers disease. Moreover, EVs from virus-infected airway cells stimulated reactive oxygen species in microglia and induced other inflammation mediators in the brain. Thus, airway cells indeed might communicate inflammatory information to the brain during viral infection. ABSTRACT: Viral infections induce extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing viral material and inflammatory factors. Exosomes can easily cross the blood-brain barrier during respiratory tract infection and transmit the inflammatory signal to the brain; however, such a hypothesis has no experimental evidence. The study investigated whether exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) from virus mimetic poly (I:C)-primed airway cells enter the brain and interact with brain immune cells microglia. Airway cells were isolated from Wistar rats and BALB/c mice; microglial cell culturesfrom Wistar rats. ELVs from poly (I:C)-stimulated airway cell culture medium were isolated by precipitation, visualised by transmission electron microscopy, and evaluated by nanoparticle analyser; exosomal markers CD81 and CD9 were determined by ELISA. For in vitro and in vivo tracking, particles were loaded with Alexa Fluor 555-labelled RNA. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by DCFDA fluorescence and mitochondrial superoxideby MitoSOX. ELVs from poly (I:C)-primed airway cells entered the brain within an hour after intranasal introduction, were internalised by microglia and induced intracellular and intramitochondrial ROS production. There was no ROS increase in microglial cells was after treatment with ELVs from airway cells untreated with poly (I:C). In addition, poly (I:C)-primed airway cells induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the brain. The data indicate that ELVs secreted by virus-primed airway cells might enter the brain, cause the activation of microglial cells and neuroinflammation.","output":"Virus Mimetic Poly (I:C)-Primed Airway Exosome-like Particles Enter Brain and Induce Inflammatory Cytokines and Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species in Microglia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cybersecurity is increasingly becoming a prominent concern among healthcare providers in adopting digital technologies for improving the quality of care delivered to patients. The recent reports on cyber attacks, such as ransomware and WannaCry, have brought to life the destructive nature of such attacks upon healthcare. In complement to cyberattacks, which have been targeted against the vulnerabilities of information technology (IT) infrastructures, a new form of cyber attack aims to exploit human vulnerabilities; such attacks are categorised as social engineering attacks. Following an increase in the frequency and ingenuity of attacks launched against hospitals and clinical environments with the intention of causing service disruption, there is a strong need to study the level of awareness programmes and training activities offered to the staff by healthcare organisations. Objective: The objective of this systematic review is to identify commonly encountered factors that cybersecurity postures of a healthcare organisation, resulting from the ignorance of cyber threat to healthcare. The systematic review aims to consolidate the current literature being reported upon human behaviour resulting in security gaps that mitigate the cyber defence strategy adopted by healthcare organisations. Additionally, the paper also reviews the organisational risk assessment methodology implemented and the policies being adopted to strengthen cybersecurity. Methods: The topic of cybersecurity within healthcare and the clinical environment has attracted the interest of several researchers, resulting in a broad range of literature. The inclusion criteria for the articles in the review stem from the scope of the five research questions identified. To this end, we conducted seven search queries across three repositories, namely (i) PubMed(?)/MED-LINE; (ii) Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and (iii) Web of Science (WoS), using key words related to cybersecurity awareness, training, organisation risk assessment methodologies, policies and recommendations adopted as counter measures within health care. These were restricted to around the last 12 years. Results: A total of 70 articles were selected to be included in the review, which addresses the complexity of cybersecurity measures adopted within the healthcare and clinical environments. The articles included in the review highlight the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats stemming from exploiting IT infrastructures to more advanced attacks launched with the intent of exploiting human vulnerability. A steady increase in the literature on the threat of phishing attacks evidences the growing threat of social engineering attacks. As a countermeasure, through the review, we identified articles that provide methodologies resulting from case studies to promote cybersecurity awareness among stakeholders. The articles included highlight the need to adopt cyber hygiene practices among healthcare professionals while accessing social media platforms, which forms an ideal test bed for the attackers to gain insight into the life of healthcare professionals. Additionally, the review also includes articles that present strategies adopted by healthcare organisations in countering the impact of social engineering attacks. The evaluation of the cybersecurity risk assessment of an organisation is another key area of study reported in the literature that recommends the organisation of European and international standards in countering social engineering attacks. Lastly, the review includes articles reporting on national case studies with an overview of the economic and societal impact of service disruptions encountered due to cyberattacks. Discussion: One of the limitations of the review is the subjective ranking of the authors associated to the relevance of literature to each of the research questions identified. We also acknowledge the limited amount of literature that focuses on human factors of cybersecurity in health care in general; therefore, the search queries were formulated using well-established cybersecurity related topics categorised according to the threats, risk assessment and organisational strategies reported in the literature.","output":"Influence of Human Factors on Cyber Security within Healthcare Organisations: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent global outbreak and spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) makes it an imperative to develop accurate and efficient diagnostic tools for the disease as medical resources are getting increasingly constrained. Artificial intelligence (AI)-aided tools have exhibited desirable potential; for example, chest computed tomography (CT) has been demonstrated to play a major role in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19. However, developing a CT-based AI diagnostic system for the disease detection has faced considerable challenges, which is mainly due to the lack of adequate manually-delineated samples for training, as well as the requirement of sufficient sensitivity to subtle lesions in the early infection stages. In this study, we developed a dual-branch combination network (DCN) for COVID-19 diagnosis that can simultaneously achieve individual-level classification and lesion segmentation. To focus the classification branch more intensively on the lesion areas, a novel lesion attention module was developed to integrate the intermediate segmentation results. Furthermore, to manage the potential influence of different imaging parameters from individual facilities, a slice probability mapping method was proposed to learn the transformation from slice-level to individual-level classification. We conducted experiments on a large dataset of 1202 subjects from ten institutes in China. The results demonstrated that 1) the proposed DCN attained a classification accuracy of 96.74% on the internal dataset and 92.87% on the external validation dataset, thereby outperforming other models; 2) DCN obtained comparable performance with fewer samples and exhibited higher sensitivity, especially in subtle lesion detection; and 3) DCN provided good interpretability on the loci of infection compared to other deep models due to its classification guided by high-level semantic information.

Although vaccines are becoming available, treatment options remain limited. Repurposing of compounds could reduce the time, cost, and risks associated with the development of new drugs and has been the focus of many clinical studies. Here, we summarise available evidence on 29 FDA-approved compounds, from in vitro results to clinical trials, focussing on remdesivir, galidesivir and favipiravir, and test 29 antiviral compounds activity in vitro. Methods A comprehensive search strategy was used to retrieve trials and publications related to antiviral compounds with potential efficacy to treat coronaviruses. These data were used to prioritise testing of a panel of antiviral drugs in vitro against patient isolates of SARS-CoV-2. An in vitro screen was carried out to determine the activity of 29 FDA-approved compounds. Results 625 clinical trials investigated 16 repurposed antiviral candidate compounds for the treatment of COVID-19. In vitro studies identified ten drug candidates with demonstrable anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, including favipiravir, remdesivir, and galidesivir. To validate these findings, a drug screen was conducted using two cell lines and wildtype isolates of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients in the UK. While eight drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity were identified in vitro, activity in clinical trials has, as yet failed to demonstrate a strong effect on mortality. Conclusions So far, no repurposed antiviral has shown a strong effect on mortality in clinical studies. The urgent need for novel antivirals in this pandemic is clear, despite the costs and time associated with their development.

We determined if repurposed antivirals are suitable for clinical trials based on previously published data, and conducted an additional in vitro screen using locally circulating strains in the UK (PHE2 and GLA1). We report the difference in IC50 from published data using Wuhan1/Wash1 strains with PHE2 and GLA1, including IC50 values below 100M for galidesivir in wild-type virus. Given the limited success of repurposed compounds in the treatment of COVID-19, we comment on the urgent need for new antivirals specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2. Implications of all the available evidence Our data show that most prospective compounds for repurposing show no anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and antiviral activity in vitro does not always translate to clinical benefit. So far, no repurposed compound has shown a strong effect on mortality in clinical studies. Drugs, including monoclonal antibody therapies, that have been developed to target SARS-CoV-2 virus itself have shown most promise.","output":"COVID-19: A need for new rather than repurposed antiviral drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the COVID-19's entry into France, in order to protect the residents, the doors of the accommodation facilities for dependent elderly have been closed and a complete reorganization has been necessary.

Understanding how to best provide these services is essential for COVID-19 mitigation. The goal of this study was to ascertain challenges and successes for caring for people who inject drugs in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted focus group discussions and one-on-one key informant interviews with healthcare providers who work with people who inject drugs in Kenya. Interviews explored how COVID-19 and social distancing measures impacted service provision, as well as what strategies were used to overcome these barriers. We used thematic analysis to analyze transcribed interviews. RESULTS: Participants included 29 service providers from 11 healthcare professions at three medication assisted treatment (MAT) and four drop-in center (DIC) sites (N=15 males and N=14 females, with an average age of 35 years). Four overarching themes emerged in our thematic analysis in which providers described both barriers to providing care and solutions to overcome them: (1) COVID-19-related misconceptions; (2) Limited COVID-19 testing and screening; (3) Structural changes related to service provision; and (4) Access to material resources such as meals, needle and syringe program kits, and personal protective equipment.

South Africa (SA) has embarked on a process to implement universal health coverage (UHC) funded by National Health Insurance (NHI). The 2019 NHI Bill proposes creation of a health technology assessment (HTA) body to inform decisions about which interventions NHI funds will cover under UHC. In practice, HTA often relies mainly on economic evaluations of cost-effectiveness and budget impact, with less attention to the systematic, specific consideration of important social, organisational and ethical impacts of the health technology in question. In this context, the South African Values and Ethics for Universal Health Coverage (SAVE-UHC) research project recognised an opportunity to help shape the health priority-setting process by providing a way to take account of multiple, ethically relevant considerations that reflect SA values. The SAVE-UHC Research Team developed and tested an SA-specific Ethics Framework for HTA assessment and analysis. Objectives. To develop and test an Ethics Framework for use in the SA context for health priority-setting. Methods. The Framework was developed iteratively by the authors and a multidisciplinary panel (18 participants) over a period of 18 months, using the principles outlined in the 2015 NHI White Paper as a starting point. The provisional Ethics Framework was then tested with multi-stakeholder simulated appraisal committees (SACs) in three provinces. The membership of each SAC roughly reflected the composition of a potential SA HTA committee. The deliberations and dedicated focus group discussions after each SAC meeting were recorded, analysed and used to refine the Framework, which was presented to the Working Group for review, comment and final approval. Results. This article describes the 12 domains of the Framework. The first four (Burden of the Health Condition, Expected Health Benefits and Harms, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, and Budget Impact) are commonly used in HTA assessments, and a further eight cover the other ethical domains. These are Equity, Respect and Dignity, Impacts on Personal Financial Situation, Forming and Maintaining Important Personal Relationships, Ease of Suffering, Impact on Safety and Security, Solidarity and Social Cohesion, and Systems Factors and Constraints. In each domain are questions and prompts to enable use of the Framework by both analysts and assessors. Issues that arose, such as weighting of the domains and the availability of SA evidence, were discussed by the SACs. Conclusions. The Ethics Framework is intended for use in priority-setting within an HTA process. The Framework was well accepted by a diverse group of stakeholders. The final version will be a useful tool not only for HTA and other priority-setting processes in SA, but also for future efforts to create HTA methods in SA and elsewhere.","output":"Introducing an Ethics Framework for health priority-setting in South Africa on the path to universal health coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In response to the promotion of sex and gender integration in health-related research, we conducted a scoping review evaluating to what extent sex and gender were considered in the transplantation literature. METHODS We searched Medline and Embase for manuscripts published between January 1946 and October 2016. Two reviewers independently selected manuscripts describing clinical research on stem cells, tissues, or solid organ transplantation with 20 participants, which mentioned \\"sex\\" and/or \\"gender\\" in the title or abstract. For each eligible manuscript, 2 of 5 reviewers extracted data on study design, population (transplant candidates, recipients, donors), transplant type, and study outcomes. We evaluated whether the terms \\"sex\\" and \\"gender\\" were applied according to their correct definitions and how these variables were handled at the level of study design and analysis. RESULTS Of 7565 search results, 2107 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria. Sex and gender were applied interchangeably in more than half of the studies (57.5%). Rarely were sex or gender, when applied correctly, considered in the primary study question (13.3% and 25.0%, respectively). The majority of the studies considered these variables as confounders (74.6% for sex and 68.2% for gender), and a minority considered them as effect measure modifiers (2.8% for sex and 5.0% for gender).

Structural and social determinants of health feed vaccine hesitancy and worsen health disparities. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to explore vaccine attitudes and intentions among program participants, understand the role of an African American faith-based wellness program in COVID-19 awareness and vaccine uptake, and solicit potential solutions for this deep-rooted public health problem. METHODS: Data were collected through 21 in-depth interviews among individuals involved within a community-based wellness program. Sixteen phone and five in-person interviews were conducted with church leaders, lifestyle coaches, and program participants. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and inductively and thematically analyzed by three researchers. FINDINGS: Live Well by Faith (LWBF) acted as a trusted information source for COVID-19 resources for the AA community. Services provided by Live Well by Faith included enrolling community members for vaccines, negotiating vaccine provision to and facilitating the establishment of vaccine clinics at AA churches, and connecting community members to healthcare providers. Despite the role Live Well by Faith played, VH was a significant concern due, in part, to historical mistrust of government and pharmaceutical companies conducting unethical healthcare research among Black populations. Other factors included uncertainty about vaccination (vaccines safety, efficacy, and necessity), social media misinformation, and political affiliation. Participants expressed the need for government to commit resources towards addressing historical factors and building trust with minority populations. CONCLUSION: Resource targeting programs such as Live Well by Faith that engage faith and community leaders in co-designed shared and culturally grounded interventions can help restore and strengthen trust in vaccines and governments and reduce vaccine hesitancy.","output":"The Past Is so Present: Understanding COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among African American Adults Using Qualitative Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biological systems use complex information processing cores composed of molecular networks to coordinate their external environment and internal states.

Common barriers to the implementation of telemedicine included a lack of technological literacy, concerns with reimbursement, and resistance to changes in the workplace. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020, the delivery of urological services globally has quickly shifted to telemedicine to account for the mass clinical, procedural, and operative cancellations, inadequate personal protective equipment, and shortage of personnel. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate current telemedicine usage by urologists, urologists' perceptions on the necessity of in-person clinic appointments, the usability of telemedicine, and the current barriers to its implementation. METHODS: We conducted a global, cross-sectional, web-based survey to investigate the use of telemedicine before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists' perceived usability of telemedicine was assessed using a modified Delphi approach to create questions based on a modified version of the validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). For the purposes of this study, telemedicine was defined as video calls only. RESULTS: A total of 620 urologists from 58 different countries and 6 continents participated in the survey. Prior to COVID-19, 15.8% (n=98) of urologists surveyed were using telemedicine in their clinical practices; during the pandemic, that proportion increased to 46.1% (n=283). Of the urologists without telemedicine experience, interest in telemedicine usage increased from 43.7% (n=139) to 80.8% (n=257) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among urologists that used telemedicine during the pandemic, 80.9% (n=244) were interested in continuing to use it in their practice. The three most commonly used platforms were Zoom, Doxy.me, and Epic, and the top three barriers to implementing telemedicine were patients' lack of technological comprehension, patients' lack of access to the required technology, and reimbursement concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to quantify the use, usability, and pervading interest in telemedicine among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of this pandemic, urologists' usage of telemedicine nearly tripled, demonstrating their ability to adopt and adapt telemedicine into their practices, but barriers involving the technology itself are still preventing many from utilizing it despite increasing interest.","output":"Telemedicine Usage Among Urologists During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)is triggered by vaccination against COVID-19 with adenovirus vectorvaccines (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; Ad26.COV2-S).

There is limited understanding of how the time in the future over which individuals make a behavioral decision, their planning horizon, affects epidemic dynamics. We developed an agent-based model (along with an ODE analog) to explore the decision-making of self-interested individuals on adopting prophylactic behavior. The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence with individuals' payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of prophylactic behavior reduces the peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially generates secondary waves of infection. These effects can be made stronger by increasing the behavioral decision frequency or distorting an individuals perceived risk of infection.","output":"Planning horizon affects prophylactic decision-making and epidemic dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Caribbean region remains susceptible to an increasing frequency of natural disasters, rising international debt, out-migration, rapid urbanization, and high imports to meet basic needs.

Policy adjustments required to address the targets subsumed by the second sustainable development goal (SDG2 or Zero Hunger) are still at an infant stage. This research offers rigorous and up-to-date analyzes of the current status of Caribbean food policies and practices through a scoping review and expert interviews to answer the question, What constraints and enablers impact the ability of small island states to achieve the Zero Hunger goal?. A scoping review is performed following the relevant population, concept, and context (PCC) methodology by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).

To address these challenges, synergistic linkages and restrictive connections have been recognized for SDG2 localization. It was concluded that three dimensions of food security (utilization, agency, and sustainability) are mainly overlooked, necessitating special attention and action. By identifying bridging institutions and engaging various actors in supporting shared rulemaking, power, conflict management, and knowledge-sharing among local, national, and regional policy actors, a polycentric governance system is recommended as a suitable mechanism to help islands move towards food security.

In response to the pandemic threat of the coronavirus epidemic, several countries, including China, adopted lockdown and quarantine policies, which may cause psychological distress. This study aimed to explore the psychological impact of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in China as well as the corresponding risk factors and protective factors. METHODS: We examined the immediate (2-week) and delayed (2-month) impact of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine on psychological distress in a national sample of 1390 Chinese residents. RESULTS: No immediate impact of province-wide lockdown on psychological distress was observed, whereas personal quarantine increased individuals' anxiety, fear, and anger. Despite the lack of initial association, psychological distress increased among those in province-wide lockdown. Self-stigma and personal control both significantly moderated the association between lockdown and psychological distress, but in different directions. Those with higher self-stigma and lower personal control were more impacted by the lockdown. Government support moderated the impact of quarantine on psychological distress, but not that of lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The delayed effects of lockdown and quarantine on psychological distress were observed, and self-stigma, social support, and perceived control moderate the relationships. This study is the first to demonstrate the psychological costs of province-wide lockdowns on individuals' mental health, providing evidence of the need for mitigation strategies and timely public mental health preparedness in countries with recent outbreaks of COVID-19.","output":"Immediate and delayed psychological effects of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant, opportunistic pathogen that frequently causes ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units and chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. The rising prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria demands the exploration of new therapeutic avenues for treating P. aeruginosa infections. Perhaps the most thoroughly explored alternative is to use novel treatments to target pathogen virulence factors, like biofilm or toxin production. Gallium(III) nitrate is one such agent. It has been recognized for its ability to inhibit pathogen growth and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa by disrupting bacterial iron homeostasis. However, irreversible sequestration by pyoverdine substantially limits its effectiveness. In this report, we show that disrupting pyoverdine production (genetically or chemically) potentiates the efficacy of gallium nitrate. Interestingly, we report that the pyoverdine inhibitor 5-fluorocytosine primarily functions as an antivirulent, even when it indirectly affects bacterial growth in the presence of gallium, and that low selective pressure for resistance occurs. We also demonstrate that the antibiotic tetracycline inhibits pyoverdine at concentrations below those required to prevent bacterial growth, and this activity allows it to synergize with gallium to inhibit bacterial growth and rescue Caenorhabditis elegans during P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE P. aeruginosa is one of the most common causative agents for ventilator-associated pneumonia and nosocomial bacteremia and is a leading cause of death in patients with cystic fibrosis. Pandrug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa are increasingly identified in clinical samples and show resistance to virtually all major classes of antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. Gallium(III) nitrate has received considerable attention as an antipseudomonal agent that inhibits P. aeruginosa growth and biofilm formation by disrupting bacterial iron homeostasis. This report demonstrates that biosynthetic inhibitors of pyoverdine, such as 5-fluorocytosine and tetracycline, synergize with gallium nitrate to inhibit P. aeruginosa growth and biofilm formation, rescuing C. elegans hosts during pathogenesis.","output":"Pyoverdine Inhibitors and Gallium Nitrate Synergistically Affect Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A hallmark of muscle development is that myoblasts fuse to form myofibers. However, smooth muscles and cardiomyocytes do not generally fuse. In C. elegans, the body wall muscles (BWMs), the physiological equivalents of skeletal muscles, are mononuclear. Here, to determine what would be the consequences of fusing BWMs, we express the cell-cell fusogen EFF-1 in these cells. We find that EFF-1 induces paralysis and dumpy phenotypes. To determine whether EFF-1-induced muscle fusion results in these pathologies we injected viruses pseudotyped with AFF-1, a paralog of EFF-1, into the pseudocoelom of C. elegans. When these engineered viruses encounter cells expressing EFF-1 or AFF-1 they are able to infect them as revealed by GFP expression from the viral genome. We find that AFF-1 viruses can fuse to EFF-1-expressing muscles revealing multinucleated fibers that cause paralysis and abnormal muscle morphogenesis. Thus, aberrant fusion of otherwise non-syncytial muscle cells may lead to pathological conditions. Graphical abstract Significance statement Most cells are individual units that do not mix their cytoplasms. However, some cells fuse to become multinucleated in placenta, bones and muscles. In most animals, muscles are formed by myofibers that originate by cell-cell fusion. In contrast, in C. elegans the body wall muscles are mononucleated cells that mediate worm-like movement. EFF-1 and AFF-1 fusogens mediate physiological cell fusion in C. elegans. By ectopically expressing EFF-1 in body wall muscles we induce their fusion resulting in behavioral and morphological deleterious effects, revealing possible causes of congenital myopathies in humans. Using AFF-1-coated pseudoviruses we infect EFF-1-expressing muscle cells retargeting viral infection into these cells. We suggest that virus retargeting can be utilized to study myogenesis, neuronal regeneration, gamete fusion and screens for new fusogens in different organisms. In addition, our virus retargeting system can be used in gene-therapy, viral-based oncolysis and to study viral-host interactions.","output":"EFF-1 promotes muscle fusion, paralysis and retargets infection by AFF-1-coated viruses in C. elegans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID\\\\19 patients caused by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in Wuhan, China.

Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane collaboration RoB-2 tool. Meta-analyses are reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-seven RCTs reporting on 9100 participants (4581 intervention and 4519 usual care) were included. Components of the remote management interventions tested were identified as patient education, risk factor monitoring, coaching on monitoring, consultations, and pharmacological management. Comparator groups were typically face-to-face usual patient care. Remote management significantly reduced HbA1c (SMD -0.25, 95%CI -0.33 to -0.17, p<0.001), TC (SMD -0.17, 95%CI -0.29 to -0.04, p<0.0001), LDL-c (SMD -0.11, 95%CI -0.19 to -0.03, p=0.006), SBP (SMD -0.11, 95%CI -0.18 to -0.04, p=0.001) and DBP (SMD -0.09, 95%CI -0.16 to -0.02, p=0.02), with low to moderate heterogeneity (I2= 0 to 75). Twelve trials had high risk of bias, 12 had some risk and three were at low risk of bias. LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity and potential publication bias may limit applicability of findings. CONCLUSIONS: Remote management significantly improves control of modifiable risk factors.

Physicians managing immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) must complete special authorization (SA) and prescription renewal (Rx) forms for patients on biologic therapy. This adds significant administrative burden potentially leading to delays in therapy initiation and care continuity. Historically, document completion has largely been paper-based, with forms faxed between patient support programs (PSPs) and physician offices. Disruption of normal office processes during the pandemic necessitated the movement of existing paper-based workflows online. The use of secure electronic document signing (SEDS) platforms has allowed physicians to receive and complete documents digitally. AIMS: To evaluate the impact of SEDS-based biologic documentation on clinical practice. Objectives were 1) to determine if the use of SEDS platforms increased timeliness of document returns compared to traditional workflows 2) assess whether SEDS usage is acceptable and sustainable and 3) assess MD satisfaction with SEDS platforms. METHODS: This was a retrospective audit of SEDS and paper-based biologic document workflows from a single PSP (Abbvie Care). Outcomes of interest were the number of documents completed monthly using SEDS, new monthly users, and the number of active monthly users between April 1, 2020-March 31, 2021. Time (days) to SEDS completion (vs. paper process) was determined by reviewing timepoint data for SA and Rx documents from May 2019-January 2020 (pre- SEDS) and for SEDS documents from May 2020-January 2021(SEDS). The return time (RT) was defined as the time between date sent to a physicians office by the PSP to the date returned to the PSP. Documents in the pre-SEDS cohort with a RT exceeding 30 days were excluded RESULTS: In totality, 5573 SA and Rx documents were completed by 383 physicians using the SEDS platform from April 2020-March 2021. A mean of 14.6 (sd 21.8) documents were signed per physician. The number of monthly electronic documents processed increased from 104 in April 2020 to 800 in March 2021. Active monthly users increased from 24 in April 2020 to 213 in March 2021 (31 new users monthly). A total of 19,387 paper documents were processed during the pre-SEDS period and 3,317 electronic documents processed in the SEDS period. The mean RT in the pre-SEDS period was 8.03 days (Sd 8.2) and the SEDS period was 1.11 days (sd 2.6). CONCLUSIONS: This data demonstrates acceptability, appropriateness, and improved processing efficiency of a SEDS platform improving timeliness of patient care. Next steps in this research include surveying physicians to understand the work-flow impact of SEDS, functionality, long-term sustainability, satisfaction and impacts on disease related outcomes.

Returnees who came back to Ethiopia during the early stages of COVID-19 went through difficult experiences of unplanned return and unfamiliar quarantine. Despite burgeoning studies on the coping strategies of the general population on stresses associated with the pandemic, there is lack of research on how returnees cope with challenges related to migration and quarantine experiences. The aim of this study was to examine the coping strategies used by returnees who were in mandatory quarantine in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A center-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 405 migrant returnees who were in mandatory quarantine in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We developed a structured questionnaire to collect data about the socio-demographic, migration related, quarantine related and COVID-19 related characteristics of participants. We used the Brief COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) scale to measure returnees coping strategies. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses were used to determine extent of use of coping strategies and identify factors associated with them. RESULTS: Emotion-focused coping mainly religious coping was the most frequently used coping strategy in the study group. Dysfunctional coping, however, was the least frequently employed coping strategy. Higher scores on emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies were associated with absence of perceived support from family and relatives after the quarantine and with no history of contact with COVID-19 suspected or infected person. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that emotion-focused coping, particularly religious coping, was the most commonly used coping strategy among returnees who were in quarantine centers in the context of COVID-19. Returnees who perceived that they will not have support from family and relatives and those who were not exposed to the virus were more likely to use either emotion- or problem-focused coping strategies. Psychosocial reintegration efforts need to focus on enhancing returnees capacity to use adaptive coping strategies. We suggest in-depth qualitative studies for better understanding of returnees coping strategies and to facilitate reintegration activities.

In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly predominant in seizure prediction for its outstanding performance. With the aim of predicting unseen seizures, it is essential to guarantee the generalization ability of the model, especially considering the non-stationary nature of EEG and the scarcity of seizure events in EEG recordings. Stability training against extra perturbations is an intuitive and effective way to improve the model's ability to generalize. Though a great number of deep learning methods have been developed for seizure prediction, their strategies to increase generalization performance focus on improving the model's architecture itself, and few of them pay attention to the stability of the model against small perturbations. NEW METHOD: In this study, we propose a novel consistency-based training strategy to address this issue. The proposed strategy underlines that a robust model should maintain consistent results for the same input under extra perturbations. Specifically, during training, we use stochastic augmentations to make the input vary from iteration to iteration and consider the output as a stochastic variable. Then a consistency constraint is constructed to penalize the difference between the current output and previous outputs. In this way, the generalization ability of the model will be fully enhanced. RESULTS: To better verify the effectiveness of our proposed strategy, we implement it in two state-of-the-art models with public-available codes, including STFT CNN and Multi-view CNN. Notably, we compare with the first baseline on a scalp EEG dataset and the other on an intracranial EEG dataset. The results show that our strategy could improve the performance significantly for both of them. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Our strategy has increased the sensitivity by 7.1% and reduced the false prediction rate by 0.12/h on the first baseline while improving the AUC by 0.020 on the second baseline.

We developed a new 3D-printed sampling cage and assessed four commercially-available materials (cotton gauze, cotton cheesecloth, cellulose sponges, and electronegative filters) for RNA adsorption in the cage. We determined that cheesecloth and electronegative filters provided an effective approach for collecting and measuring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. We also compared the performance of three elution mixtures (a commercially-available lysis buffer, a Tween (R) 20-based buffer, and a 1:1 acetonitrile:water mixture) for detection of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 reference material (HI-SCV-2) spiked into municipal wastewater at 1.0 x 10(3) genomic units per millilitre (GU mL(-1)). The highest mean RNA concentrations were achieved using the cheesecloth (7.0 x 10(4) +/- 3.7 x 10(4) GU per eluate) and electronegative filters (2.3 x 10(4) +/- 2.5 x 10(4) GU per eluate) in combination with the Tween (R) 20-based buffer with positive detections in all three biological replicates for both material types. We deployed passive samplers at two sewer catchments (locations A and B) to compare the performance of each passive sampler material type in the field. Over 15 sampling events at each site, we demonstrated that both cheesecloth (location A) and electronegative filters (location B) coupled with a Tween (R) 20-based elution technique could be utilized for the reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2. These results have demonstrated a quick and effective passive sampling approach for SARS-CoV-2 detection in targeted locations in wastewater collection systems, which may have long-term applicability as global vaccination programs evolve.","output":"A novel passive sampling approach for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in a Canadian province with low prevalence of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The author focuses on the implication of health inequality in midwifery highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study aims to assess the changes in intercity railway passenger transport on the early spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Examining the role of railway transport properties in disease transmission could help quantify the spatial spillover effects of large-scale travel restriction interventions. This study used daily high-speed railway schedule data to compare the differences in city-level network properties (destination arrival and transfer service) before and after the Wuhan city lockdown in the early stages of the spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Bayesian multivariate regression was used to examine the association between structural changes in the railway origin-destination network and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. Our results show that the provinces with rising transfer activities after the Wuhan city lockdown had more confirmed COVID-19 cases, but changes in destination arrival did not have significant effects. The regions with increasing transfer activities were located in provinces neighboring Hubei in the widthwise and longitudinal directions. These results indicate that transfer activities enhance interpersonal transmission probability and could be a crucial risk factor for increasing epidemic severity after the Wuhan city lockdown. The destinations of railway passengers might not be affected by the Wuhan city lockdown, but their itinerary routes could be changed due to the replacement of an important transfer hub (Wuhan city) in the Chinese railway transportation network. As a result, transfer services in the high-speed rail network could explain why the provinces surrounded by Hubei had a higher number of confirmed COVID-19 cases than other provinces.","output":"Revisiting the Effects of High-Speed Railway Transfers in the Early COVID-19 Cross-Province Transmission in Mainland China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID pandemic challenged the importance of Work engagement (WE) or employee engagement (EE) for creativity and innovation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from microarray data repository of SARS-CoV patient blood. The repurposed drugs for COVID-19 were selected from available literature. Using DEGs and drugs, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) and chemo-protein interaction (CPI) networks were constructed and combined to develop an interactome model of PPI-CPI network. The top-ranked sub-network with its hub-bottleneck nodes were evaluated with their functional annotations. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 120 DEGs and 65 drugs were identified.

Two drugs interacted directly with the hub-bottleneck node i.e. matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), a host protein corresponding to its upregulated gene. MMP9 showed functional annotations associated with neutrophil mediated immunoinflammation. Moreover, literature survey revealed that angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a membrane receptor of SARS-CoV-2 virus, might have functional cooperativity with MMP9 and a possible interaction with both drugs.

We would like to report a 43-year-old male patient living in central Anatolia and dealing with farming who presented to the hospital with a complaint of severe back pain. The patient who was given oral treatment with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and myorelaxant agents was readmitted with increased complaints. His nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19 without pneumonia on chest computed tomography (CT). He spent the quarantine and treatment period at home but was admitted to our outpatient clinic with a wheelchair with increased complaints and right leg pain preventing daily activities. The control nasopharyngeal swab was negative for COVID-19 but further increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) (152,8 mg/L) and creatine kinase (CK) level (549 IU/L) were revealed. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed SD in the L3-L4 level along with right-sided prevertebral inflammatory soft tissue and a large right psoas muscle abscess. Pyogenic lumbar SD complicated with the right psoas abscess in the setting of COVID-19 was considered and antibacterial treatment was started following hospitalization. On the same day, percutaneous aspiration from the psoas abscess under CT guidance was performed and revealed no growth in the culture. After 3 weeks, follow-up MRI showed worsening of all the bone, soft tissue and disc findings. Myalgia is a common manifestation in viral infections, which was also demonstrated in COVID-19 patients, with possible increase in muscle enzymes. Secondary spinal infections and its soft-tissue complications should be considered in the management of COVID-19 patients with neuromuscular symptoms, and detailed neurological and neurosurgical evaluation should be performed in order to avoid progression and permanent damage.","output":"COVID-19 Infection Manifesting with Lumbar Spondylodiscitis Complicating With Psoas Abscess without Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Das Nervensystem steht im Mittelpunkt jeder Narkose.

It was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on January 31, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The primary route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from human to human is through inhalation of respiratory droplets. Devising protective technologies for stopping the spread of the droplets of aerosol containing the viral particles is a vital requirement to curb the ongoing outbreak. However, the current generations of protective respirator masks in use are noted for their imperfect design and there is a need to develop their more advanced analogues, with higher blockage efficiency and the ability to deactivate the trapped bacteria and viruses. It is likely that one such design will be inspired by nanotechnologies. Here we describe a new design from Egypt, utilizing a reusable, recyclable, customizable, antimicrobial and antiviral respirator facial mask feasible for mass production. The novel design is based on the filtration system composed of a nanofibrous matrix of polylactic acid and cellulose acetate containing copper oxide nanoparticles and graphene oxide nanosheets and produced using the electrospinning technique. Simultaneously, the flat pattern fabricated from a thermoplastic composite material is used to provide a solid fit with the facial anatomy.

DESIGN Living systematic review with network meta-analysis (NMA). DATA SOURCES Sensitive search in seven databases, three grey literature resources and four trial registers. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials evaluating any treatment for PFP with outcomes 'any improvement', and pain intensity. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias with Risk of Bias Tool V.2. We used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise the strength of the evidence. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE 'Any improvement' measured with a Global Rating of Change Scale. RESULTS Twenty-two trials (with forty-eight treatment arms) were included, of which approximately 10 (45%) were at high risk of bias for the primary outcome. Most comparisons had a low to very low strength of the evidence. All treatments were better than wait and see for any improvement at 3 months (education (OR 9.6, 95% credible interval (CrI): 2.2 to 48.8); exercise (OR 13.0, 95% CrI: 2.4 to 83.5); education+orthosis (OR 16.5, 95% CrI: 4.9 to 65.8); education+exercise+patellar taping/mobilisations (OR 25.2, 95% CrI: 5.7 to 130.3) and education+exercise+patellar taping/mobilisations+orthosis (OR 38.8, 95% CrI: 7.3 to 236.9)). Education+exercise+patellar taping/mobilisations, with (OR 4.0, 95% CrI: 1.5 to 11.8) or without orthosis (OR 2.6, 95% CrI: 1.7 to 4.2), were superior to education alone. At 12 months, education or education+any combination yielded similar improvement rates. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION Education combined with a physical treatment (exercise, orthoses or patellar taping/mobilisation) is most likely to be effective at 3 months. At 12 months, education appears comparable to education with a physical treatment. There was insufficient evidence to recommend a specific type of physical treatment over another. All treatments in our NMA were superior to wait and see at 3 months, and we recommend avoiding a wait-and-see approach.

Originally conceived to help aerospace engineers plan tests to determine how material changes impact system integrity, the concept was gradually introduced into software engineering. Today, the test pyramid is typically used to illustrate that the majority of tests should be performed at the lowest (unit test) level, with fewer integration tests, and even fewer acceptance tests (which are the most expensive to produce, and the slowest to execute). Although the value of acceptance tests and integration tests increasingly depends on the integrity of the underlying data, models, and pipelines, software development and data management organizations have traditionally been siloed and quality assurance practice is not as mature in data operations as it is for software.

The number of active business owners in the United States plummeted by 3.3 million or 22 percent over the crucial two-month window from February to April 2020. The drop in active business owners was the largest on record, and losses to business activity were felt across nearly all industries. African-American businesses were hit especially hard experiencing a 41 percent drop in business activity. Latinx business owner activity fell by 32 percent, and Asian business owner activity dropped by 26 percent. Simulations indicate that industry compositions partly placed these groups at a higher risk of business activity losses. Immigrant business owners experienced substantial losses in business activity of 36 percent. Female business owners were also disproportionately affected (25 percent drop in business activity). Continuing the analysis in May and June, the number of active business owners remained low C down by 15 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The continued losses in May and June, and partial rebounds from April were felt across all demographic groups and most industries.

Considering that glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is involved in cellular detoxification, it may play an important role in susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or its outcome. In the present study, the association between the Ile105Val GSTP1 polymorphism (rs1695) and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its outcome was investigated. Data on the prevalence (per 10 6people), case-fatality (per 100 infected cases), and mortality (per 10 6people) of COVID-19 and various potential confounders (the life expectancy at birth, density of medical doctors, density of nursing and midwifery personnel, and the gross national income per capita) were used. The latest data available for 45 countries were used for the study. Results: In multivariate linear regression analyses, the Val105 allelic frequency showed positive association with the log-prevalence (partial r = 0.308, p = 0.042) and log-mortality of COVID-19 (partial r = 0.316, p = 0.037).

Remdesivir and Dexamethasone are two treatments that have shown to be effective against the Sars-Cov-2 associated disease. However, a cost-effectiveness analysis of the two treatments is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: The cost-utility of Remdesivir, Dexamethasone and a simultaneous use of the two drugs with respect to standard of care for treatment Covid-19 hospitalized patients is evaluated, together with the effect of Remdesivir compared to the base model but based on alernative assumptions. METHODS: A decision tree for an hypothetical cohort of Covid-19 hospitalized patients, from an health care perspective and a one year horizon is specified. Efficacy data are retrieved from a literature review of clinical trials, whilst costs and utility are obtained from other published studies. RESULTS: Remdesivir, if health care costs are related to the days of hospitalization, is a cost saving strategy. Dexamethasone is cost effective with an ICER of <DOLLAR/>5208/QALY, and the concurrent use of Remdesivir and Dexamethasone is the most favorable strategy for higher level of willingness to pay thresholds. Moreover, if Remdesivir has a positive effect on mortality the utility is three times higher respect to base case. Whereas, if health care costs are not related to the length of patient hospitalization Remdesivir has an ICER respect to standard of care of <DOLLAR/>384412.8/QALY gained, which is not cost effective. We also find that Dexaamethasone is cost effective respect to standard care if we compute the cost for live saved with an ICER of <DOLLAR/>313.79 for life saved. The uncertainty of the model parameters is also tested through both a one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been used in these patients with conflicting results. We describe our experience with rFVIIa for refractory bleeding in this setting and review the cases reported in the literature. METHODS: Clinical characteristics, demographics, bleeding, thrombotic complications, mortality, and rFVIIa administration were retrospectively collected for analysis from the electronic charts of the 15 patients in our intensive care unit who received rFVIIa while being given ECMO from January 2006 to March 2011. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received rFVIIa for persistent bleeding under venoarterial (n = 11) or venovenous (n = 4) ECMO. Bleeding dramatically decreased in 14 patients, without a major thrombotic event, except in one patient in whom a major stroke could not be ruled out. Two circuits were changed within the 48 hours after rFVIIa administration for clots in the membrane and decreased oxygenation but without massive clotting. The mortality rate was 60%. CONCLUSIONS: rFVIIa use for intractable hemorrhaging in patients receiving ECMO controlled bleeding, without major thrombotic events, and with 60% dying. Hence, its use warrants discussion, and clinicians should be aware of the possibility of potentially life-threatening systemic thrombosis, emboli, or circuit clotting. Whether rFVIIa can save the lives of such patients remains to be determined.","output":"Recombinant factor VIIa for uncontrollable bleeding in patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: report on 15 cases and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a multisystemic disease associated with micro- and macrovascular thrombo-embolic complications, including intracardiac thrombosis, which has not been previously reported in the literature. Case summary: We report a case of a 68-year-old woman with COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit with acute respiratory distress, undifferentiated shock, hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. She received crystalloid infusion, broad-spectrum antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, insulin-dextrose, calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and i.v. vasopressors. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started for refractory hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis. Transthoracic echocardiogram obtained for concern of pulmonary embolism found bi-atrial thrombosis with normal bi-ventricular dimensions and function. Systemic anticoagulation was provided, but this was stopped soon afterwards due to worsening coagulopathy and bleeding. Despite intensive measures and supportive therapy, the patient developed worsening hypoxia, refractory shock, and multiorgan failure. After discussion of goals of care with her family, a decision was made to initiate hospice care. The patient died within 72 h of hospital admission. Discussion: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a multisystemic disease that primarily affects the lungs, but also predisposes to rare thrombo-embolic phenomena such as intracardiac thrombosis. ? 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

It is a novel strain from the Coronaviridae family, named Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); the 7th known member of the coronavirus family to cause disease in humans, notably following the Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS). The most characteristic feature of this single-stranded RNA molecule includes the spike glycoprotein on its surface. Most patients with COVID-19, of which the elderly and immunocompromised are most at risk, complain of flu-like symptoms, including dry cough and headache. The most common complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and cardiovascular manifestations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via respiratory droplets, either directly from the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, or in the form of fomites on surfaces. Maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and personal protective equipment (i.e., masks) remain the most effective precautions. Patient management includes supportive care and anticoagulative measures, with a focus on maintaining respiratory function. Therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab appear to be most promising to date, with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferons falling out of favour. Additionally, accelerated vaccination efforts have taken place internationally, with several promising vaccinations being mass deployed. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries and stakeholders have taken varying precautions to combat and contain the spread of the virus and dampen its collateral economic damage.

This study aims to investigate the frequency, treatment, and complications of external ear canal injury in association with mandibular and temporal bone trauma. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review. METHODS Computed tomography images with mandibular or temporal bone trauma were reviewed for EAC fractures. Patient data were collected from initial presentation and subsequent follow-up clinic visits. RESULTS Thirty-nine percent of temporal bone fractures and 3.3% of mandible trauma involved the EAC. In particular, 10% of condylar or subcondylar trauma included an EAC fracture (P = 0.0006). One patient sustained bilateral EAC fractures despite an isolated, unilateral condylar fracture. The most common presenting sign was blood in the external auditory canal. Two patients underwent exam under anesthesia and removal of debris and stenting as treatment, whereas 42% of the patients were placed on otic drops and 5% received packing or a stent. Follow-up data were only available for 16% of the patients. Hearing loss from otic capsule involvement or ossicular chain disruption were follow-up complaints, and one patient had persistent canal stenosis. CONCLUSIONS External auditory canal trauma is present in a significant proportion of mandibular and temporal bone trauma, including both condylar and noncondylar fractures with a higher incidence of condylar fractures. One case was seen with bilateral EAC fractures despite a unilateral mandibular fracture. Complications of these fractures can include hearing loss and canal stenosis; however, additional outpatient follow-up is needed to further elucidate long-term complications and shape treatment recommendations.","output":"Trauma patterns, symptoms, and complications associated with external auditory canal fractures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has rapidly become a global public health concern.

The most potent neutralizing VHH (LT109) was N-glycosylated, resulting in a large increase in molecular mass. This suggests that N-glycosylation of LT109 improves its neutralizing capacity. Indeed, deglycosylation of LT109 decreased its neutralizing capacity three- to fivefold. We also studied the effect of glycosylation of two previously isolated VHHs on their ability to neutralize foot-and-mouth disease virus. For this purpose, these VHHs that lacked potential N-glycosylation sites were genetically fused to another VHH that was known to be glycosylated. The resulting fusion proteins were also N-glycosylated. They neutralized the virus at at least fourfold-lower VHH concentrations as compared to the single, non-glycosylated VHHs and at at least 50-fold-lower VHH concentrations as compared to their deglycosylated counterparts.

METHODS: The CO-MY-COVID registry was a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in neuromuscular referral centers and general hospitals of the FILNEMUS (Filire Neuromusculaire) network (between March 1, 2020, and June 8, 2020), including patients with MG with a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. COVID-19 was diagnosed based on a PCR test from a nasopharyngeal swab or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serology, thoracic CT scan, or typical symptoms. The main outcome was COVID-19 severity based on location of treatment/management (home, hospitalized in a medical unit, or in an intensive care unit). We collected information on demographic variables, general history, and risk factors for severe COVID-19. Multivariate ordinal regression models were used to identify factors associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Among 3,558 patients with MG registered in the French database for rare disorders, 34 (0.96%) had COVID-19. The mean age at COVID-19 onset was 55.0  19.9 years (mean MG duration: 8.5  8.5 years). By the end of the study period, 28 patients recovered from COVID-19, 1 remained affected, and 5 died.

The type of MG treatment had no independent effect on COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: This registry-based cohort study shows that COVID-19 had a limited effect on most patients, and immunosuppressive medications and corticosteroids used for MG management are not risk factors for poorer outcomes. However, the risk of severe COVID-19 is elevated in patients with high MGFA classes (odds ratio, 102.6 [4.4-2,371.9]).

We report a case of DNM with a challenging presentation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male on chronic hemodialysis recovering from COVID pneumonia, presented to the emergency department with 2 days of shortness of breath. He was hypertensive, tachycardic and hypoxic, in respiratory distress, requiring immediate initiation of noninvasive ventilation. Shortly after arrival, he went into cardiac arrest. Resuscitation efforts were successful. Intensive management included mechanical ventilation, broad spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors and continuous renal replacement therapy for suspected septic shock. Chest x-ray showed mediastinal widening, confirmed by CT, to be due to a 7.5 cm lobulated, soft tissue density in the mediastinum impinging on the trachea. Bronchoscopy via endotracheal tube showed no obstruction except for some dynamic airway collapse. Trans-bronchial needle aspiration of the mediastinal mass was non-diagnostic. In 2 days, he improved, was extubated but then emergently re-intubated due to acute upper airway obstruction. Repeat imaging revealed a large retropharyngeal abscess extending from C1 level to the thyroid gland. It wrapped around anteriorly and communicated with a large collection in the superior mediastinum surrounding the trachea. Also noted was an enlarging pleural effusion. Urgent surgical drainage of the retropharyngeal space, superior mediastinum and pleural fluid was performed. Cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Mediastinal exploration and tracheostomy followed. He steadily improved and was discharged. DISCUSSION: DNM is a life-threatening infection that originates in the neck;retropharyngeal abscess in this case. It spreads caudally through cervical fascial planes facilitated by gravity and negative intrathoracic pressures (1). Oral flora are the usual pathogens (2). Diagnosis needs a high index of suspicion to obtain necessary imaging. Favorable outcomes are seen with early diagnosis, airway protection, antibiotics and timely surgical drainage (3).Our patient had narrowing of the proximal trachea due to compression from the fluid collection requiring emergent re-intubation. His initial chest CT reported a soft tissue density concerning for malignancy. It was the second CT that suggested an abscess. Looking back, prior chest x-rays showed progressive mediastinal widening over 10 days, making malignancy less likely. Review of old imaging remains invaluable.

Senior training year (P < .01), shorter commute time (P = .04), fewer duty hours (P = .02), fewer residents (P < .01), and more fellows (P < .01) were associated with significantly greater job satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to gather cross-sectional data on job satisfaction from a national sample of plastic surgery residents. The results from this study can inform programs in making tangible changes tailored to their trainees needs. Moreover, our findings may be used to inform a prospectively studied targeted intervention to increase job satisfaction and resident wellness to address North American accreditation standards.","output":"Job Satisfaction Among Plastic Surgery Residents in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has adversely affected the world and is treated as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization Assessment of the basic reproduction number with the help of mathematical modeling can evaluate the dynamics of virus spread and facilitate critical information for effective medical interventions In India, the disease control strategies and interventions have been applied at the district level by categorizing the districts as per the infected cases In this study, an attempt has been made to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 based on publically available data at the district level in India The susceptible-exposed-infected-critically infected-hospitalization-recovered (SEICHR) compartmental model is constructed to understand the COVID-19 transmission among different districts The model relies on the twelve kinematic parameters fitted on the data for the outbreak in India up to May 15, 2020 The expression of basic reproduction number R0 using the next-generating matrix is derived and estimated The study also employs three time-dependent control strategies to control and minimize the infection transmission from one district to another The results suggest an unstable situation of the pandemic that can be minimized with the suggested control strategies ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Controlling the Transmission of COVID-19 Infection in Indian Districts: A Compartmental Modelling Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A growing body of evidence suggests that bilingual exposure does not negatively impact children on the autism spectrum.

Cytokine storm is an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that occurs at phase 3 of viral infection. Such emergence led to the development of many clinical trials to discover efficient drugs and therapeutic protocols to fight with this single-stranded RNA virus. Corticosteroids suppress inflammation of the lungs during the cytokine storm, weaken immune responses, and inhibit the elimination of pathogen. For this reason, in COVID-19 corticosteroid therapy, systemic inhibition of inflammation is observed with a wide range of side effects. The present review discusses the effectiveness of the corticosteroid application in COVID-19 infection and the related side effects of these agents.

To characterize T cell immunity, but also for the development of vaccines, identification of exact viral T cell epitopes is fundamental.

SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides enabled detection of post-infectious T cell immunity, even in seronegative convalescent individuals. Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 peptides revealed pre-existing T cell responses in 81% of unexposed individuals and validated similarity with common cold coronaviruses, providing a functional basis for heterologous immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses was associated with mild symptoms of COVID-19, providing evidence that immunity requires recognition of multiple epitopes. Together, the proposed SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes enable identification of heterologous and post-infectious T cell immunity and facilitate development of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures for COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides define heterologous and COVID-19-induced T cell recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has called for the increased use of disinfectants worldwide in public facilities, transportation, hospitals, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities, and even common households to mitigate virus burden. Active ingredients in common disinfectants recommended for use against COVID-19 viruses include chemicals such as quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), hydrogen peroxide, bleach (sodium hypochlorite), and alcohols. These disinfecting chemicals differ in their structures, properties, modes of action, environmental behaviors, and effects on human health upon exposure. Humans can be exposed to disinfecting chemicals mainly through dermal absorption, inhalation, and ingestion. The total exposure and relative contribution of each exposure route vary considerably among the disinfectants. QACs have been linked to occupational illnesses such as asthma and an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas excess use of bleach, hydrogen peroxide, or alcohol-based disinfectants can cause respiratory damage and has been linked to an increased risk of developing and controlling asthma. Recent studies showed that the presence of QACs in human blood has been associated with changes in health biomarkers such as an increase in inflammatory cytokines, decreased mitochondrial function, and disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, repeated human exposure to disinfectants during the pandemic has raised questions on exposure-related long-term health risks and occupational safety. Furthermore, in lieu of a lack of adequate knowledge and public awareness, these chemicals have been frequently used on porous surfaces, including fabrics/textiles and consumer plastics and even for disinfecting cloth facemasks, on which disinfectant chemical residues may persist for longer duration, causing potential degradation of plastic materials, releasing additives, and shedding microplastics. In addition, the increased use of these disinfectant chemicals and the subsequent discharge into wastewater may cause adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems, accumulation on vegetables, and contamination of the food chain via wastewater irrigation and sludge application. This article provides a well-rounded understanding of the most common disinfectants and reviews modes of action of those disinfectants, their interactions with aquatic and terrestrial environments, the exposure to humans, and potential impacts to human health and safety.","output":"Increased Use of Disinfectants During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Potential Impacts on Health and Safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Proactive prediction of the epidemiologic dynamics of viral diseases and outbreaks of the likes of COVID-19 has remained a difficult pursuit for scientists, public health researchers, and policymakers. It is unclear whether RT-PCR Cycle Threshold (Ct) values of COVID-19 (or any other virus) as indicator of viral load, could represent a possible predictor for underlying epidemiological changes on a population level. Objectives: To investigate whether population-wide changes in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct values over time are associated with the daily fraction of positive COVID-19 tests. In addition, this study analyses the factors that could influence the RT-PCR Ct values. Method: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 63,879 patients from May 4, 2020 to September 30, 2020, in all COVID-19 facilities in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Data collected included number of tests and newly diagnosed cases, as well as Ct values, age, gender nationality, and symptomatic status. Results: Ct values were found to be negatively and very weakly correlated with the fraction of daily positive cases in the population r = -0.06 (CI95%: -0.06; -0.05; p=0.001). The R-squared for the regression model (adjusting for age and number of daily tests) showed an accuracy of 45.3%. Ct Values showed an association with nationality (p=0.012). After the stratification, the association between Ct values and the fraction of daily positive cases was only maintained for the female gender and Bahraini-nationality. Symptomatic presentation was significantly associated with lower Ct values (higher viral loads). Ct values do not show any correlation with age (p=0.333) or gender (p=0.522). Conclusion: We report one of the first and largest studies to investigate the epidemiological associations of Ct values with COVID-19. Ct values offer a potentially simple and widely accessible tool to predict and model epidemiological dynamics on a population level.

Alveolar macrophage-derived cytokines contribute to the inflammation underlying pulmonary disease in COVID-19. We sought to determine if basal macrophage activation, as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, was present in PCOS and, if so, was further enhanced by vitamin D deficiency. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 99 PCOS and 68 control women who presented sequentially. Plasma levels of a macrophage-derived cytokine panel were determined by Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement. Vitamin D was measured by tandem mass spectroscopy. Results: Vitamin D was lower in PCOS women (p<0.0001) and correlated negatively with body mass index (BMI) in PCOS (r=0.28, p=0.0046). Basal macrophage activation markers CXCL5, CD163 and MMP9 were elevated, whilst protective CD200 was decreased (p<0.05); changes in these variables were related to, and fully accounted for, by BMI. PCOS and control women were then stratified according to vitamin D concentration. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with decreased CD80 and IFN-?3 in PCOS and IL-12 in both groups (p<0.05). These factors, important in initiating and maintaining the immune response, were again accounted for by BMI. Conclusion: Basal macrophage activation was higher in PCOS with macrophage changes related with increased infection risk associating with vitamin D; all changes were BMI dependent, suggesting that obese PCOS with vitamin D deficiency may be at greater risk of more severe COVID-19 infection, but that it is obesity-related rather than an independent PCOS factor.","output":"Vitamin D Association With Macrophage-Derived Cytokines in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: An Enhanced Risk of COVID-19 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an enormous strain on global health.

Medical scribes may help mitigate this burden. Our objective was to determine how scribes affect provider workflow efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic controls. Materials/Methods Providers completed a survey in February 2020 (S1, pre-pandemic) and one year into the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2021 (S2, during-pandemic). Standardized surveys administered during S1 evaluated perceived impact of scribes on clerical work, medical documentation, and efficiency during office visits using the Likert Scale. Surveys administered during S2 also addressed scribe use during telemedicine visits, in addition to office visits. Provider perception of time spent on documentation with or without a scribe was evaluated using a 5-level ordinal scale. Provider response was assessed using descriptive frequency statistics. Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables. Analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). All tests were two-sided with an alpha level of 0.05. Results Fifty-eight providers responded to the surveys: 36 (62%) for S1, 22 (38%) for S2. Scribe use decreased perceived clerical work, facilitated chart review, recording of physical exam findings, note documentation and improved efficiency, both before and during the pandemic (P = 0.5, P = 0.7, P = 0.8, P = 0.8, P = 0.9 respectively). Scribe use significantly decreased perceived time to complete documentation pre-pandemic (P = 0.002) and during the pandemic for both in person (P = < 0.0001) and telemedicine visits (P = 0.0004). More providers took over 60 minutes to complete medical documentation without the use of a scribe pre-pandemic (72% versus 30% with a scribe, P = 0.006) and during the pandemic, for both in person (40% versus 0% with a scribe, P = 0.002) and telemedicine visits (35% versus 0% with a scribe, P = 0.002). Even with increased telemedicine visits during the pandemic, 17 (77%) providers strongly agreed that scribe use decreased their daily clerical work and improved efficiency and 18 (82%) strongly agreed scribes were just as helpful during telemedicine visits as during in person visits. Conclusion Scribe use decreases provider time spent on medical documentation and improves overall efficiency. This improvement in clinical efficiency was similar before and during the COVID-19 pandemic for both in person and telemedicine clinic visits. Integration of scribes into radiation oncology clinics may improve provider satisfaction by reducing burden of documentation and may improve provider well-being.","output":"Medical Scribe Impact on Provider Efficiency in Outpatient Radiation Oncology Clinics Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A central component of the public health strategy to control the COVID-19 pandemic involves encouraging mask wearing and social distancing to protect individuals from acquiring and transmitting the virus. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the psychological factors that drive adoption or rejection of these protective behaviors, which can inform public health interventions to control the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults and assessed three novel potential predictors of COVID-19 behaviors: trait reactance, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and COVID-19 apocalypse beliefs. Key outcomes (dependent variables) included an index of COVID-19 protective behaviors, the number of trips taken from the home, and COVID-19 knowledge. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, all three predictors were significantly correlated in the hypothesized direction with the three COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, each predictor was negatively (P<.01) correlated with the COVID-19 protective behaviors index and COVID-19 knowledge score, and positively correlated with trips taken from home per week (more of which was considered higher risk). COVID-19 protective behaviors and COVID-19 knowledge were significantly lower in the top median compared to the bottom median for all three predictors. In general, these findings remained significant after adjusting for all novel predictors plus age, gender, income, education, race, political party, and religiosity. Self-identified Republicans (vs other political affiliations) reported the highest values for each of the novel predictors. CONCLUSIONS: This study can inform the development of health communication interventions to encourage the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviors. Interestingly, we found that higher scores of all three novel predictors were associated with lower COVID-19 knowledge, suggesting that lack of an accurate understanding of the virus may be driving some of these attitudes; although, it is also possible that these attributes may interfere with one's willingness or ability to seek and absorb accurate health information. These individuals may be particularly immune to accepting new information and yielding their beliefs. Health communication professionals may apply lessons learned from countering similar beliefs around climate change and vaccine hesitancy. Messages designed for individuals prone to reactance may be more effective if they minimize controlling language and emphasize the individual's independence in adopting these behavioral recommendations. Messaging for those who possess conspiracy beliefs should similarly not assume that providing evidence contrary to these beliefs will alone alter behavior. Other communication techniques such as rolling with resistance, a strategy used in motivational interviewing, may be helpful. Messaging for those with apocalyptic beliefs may require using religious leaders as the message source and using scripture that would support the adoption of COVID-19 protection behaviors.","output":"Novel Predictors of COVID-19 Protective Behaviors Among US Adults: Cross-sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: It seems that 2020 would be always remembered by the name of novel coronavirus (designated as SARS-CoV-2), which exerted its deteriorating effects on the health care, economy, education, and political relationships. In August 2020 more than eight hundred thousand patients lost their lives due to acute respiratory syndrome. In the limited list of therapeutic approaches, the effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) for curing inflammatory-related diseases have sparkled a light that probably this approach would bring promising advantages for COVID-19 patients. LD-RT owns its reputation from its ability to modulate the host inflammatory responses by blocking the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hampering the activity of leukocytes. Moreover, the cost-effective and availability of this method allow it to be applied to a large number of patients, especially those who could not receive anti-IL-6 treatments in low-income countries. But enthusiasm for applying LD-RT for the treatment of COVID-19 patients has been muted yet. CONCLUSION: In this review, we take a look at LD-RT mechanisms of action in the treatment of nonmalignant diseases, and then through studying both the dark and bright sides of this approach, we provide a thorough discussion if LD-RT might be a promising therapeutic approach in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Low-dose radiotherapy (LD-RT) for COVID-19-induced pneumopathy: a worth considering approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chinas real estate has been a key engine of its sustained economic expansion.

We make use of newly available and updated data sources to analyze supply-demand conditions in the fast-moving Chinese economy. The imbalances are then compared to benchmarks from other economies. We conclude that the sector is quite vulnerable to a sustained aggregate growth shock, such as Covid-19 might pose. In our baseline calibration, using input-output tables and taking account of the very large footprint of housing construction and real-estate related sectors, the adjustment to a decline in housing activity can easily trim a cumulative 5-10 percent from the level of output (over a period of years).","output":"Peak China Housing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patient age is one of the most salient clinical indicators of risk from COVID-19. Age-specific distributions of known SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related deaths are available for many regions. Less attention has been given to the age distributions of serious medical interventions administered to COVID-19 patients, which could reveal sources of potential pressure on the healthcare system should SARS-CoV-2 prevalence increase, and could inform mass vaccination strategies. The aim of this study is to quantify the relationship between COVID-19 patient age and serious outcomes of the disease, beyond fatalities alone. METHODS: We analysed 277,555 known SARS-CoV-2 infection records for Ontario, Canada, from 23 January 2020 to 16 February 2021 and estimated the age distributions of hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, intubations, and ventilations. We quantified the probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization. RESULTS: The distribution of hospitalizations peaks with a wide plateau covering ages 60C90, whereas deaths are concentrated in ages 80+. The estimated probability of hospitalization given known infection reaches a maximum of 27.8% at age 80 (95% CI 26.0%C29.7%). The probability of survival given hospitalization is nearly 100% for adults younger than 40, but declines substantially after this age; for example, a hospitalized 54-year-old patient has a 91.7% chance of surviving COVID-19 (95% CI 88.3%C94.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a significant need for hospitalization in middle-aged individuals and young seniors. This need is not captured by the distribution of deaths, which is heavily concentrated in very old ages. The probability of survival given hospitalization for COVID-19 is lower than is generally perceived for patients over 40. If acute care capacity is exceeded due to an increase in COVID-19 prevalence, the distribution of deaths could expand toward younger ages. These results suggest that vaccine programs should aim to prevent infection not only in old seniors, but also in young seniors and middle-aged individuals, to protect them from serious illness and to limit stress on the healthcare system.","output":"Age-dependence of healthcare interventions for COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 disease, as a dangerous global pandemic, has led to high morbidity and mortality in all countries. There is a lot of evidence for the possible role of oxidative stress in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). In the current study, we aimed to measure the levels of glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS) in the serum of patients with Covid-19. A total of 96 individuals with and without Covid-19 were enrolled and divided into four groups, including hospitalized group in non-intensive care units (non-ICU) (n=35), hospitalized group in intensive care units with endotracheal intubation (EI) (ICU with EI) (n=19), hospitalized group in intensive care units without endotracheal intubation (ICU without EI) (n=24), and healthy people without Covid-19 disease as our control group (n=18).The present study revealed that the TOS level was significantly lower in the group of control (P = 0.001), and level of (GSH) remarkably increased in the patients' groups (P < 0.001). TAC activity in non-ICU group of patients had no significant difference in comparison with control group. However, in hospitalized patients' groups in ICU with and without EI this activity was significantly different from control group (P<0.001). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between the levels of TOS, GSH, and TAC with blood Oxygen saturation (SpO2), fever, duration of hospitalization, and the prognosis of this disease (P<0.001). Area under the curve (AUC) (CI, 95%) of TOS, TAC and GSH-C to predict death among patients were respectively 0.907 (0.841, 0.973), 0.735 (0.626, 0.843) and 0.820 (0.725, 0.914). ROC curve analysis showed that TOS, TAC and GSH-C have the potential specificity and sensitivity to distinguish between alive and dead patients. We found that elevated levels of oxidative stress and reduction of antioxidant indices can aggravate disease's severity in hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Therefore, it can be suggested to apply antioxidant agents as one of the effective therapeutic strategies in these groups.","output":"Evaluation of oxidative stress level: total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant status and glutathione activity in patients with Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Most biomedical research has focused on sampling COVID-19 patients presenting to hospital with advanced disease, with less focus on the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic We established a bioresource with serial sampling of health care workers (HCWs) designed to obtain samples before and during mainly mild disease, with follow-up sampling to evaluate the quality and duration of immune memory Methods: We conducted a prospective study on HCWs from three hospital sites in London, initially at a single centre (recruited just prior to first peak community transmission in London), but then extended to multiple sites 3 weeks later (recruitment still ongoing, target n=1,000) Asymptomatic participants attending work complete a health questionnaire, and provide a nasal swab (for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR tests) and blood samples (mononuclear cells, serum, plasma, RNA and DNA are biobanked) at 16 weekly study visits, and at 6 and 12 months Results: Preliminary baseline results for the first 731 HCWs (400 single-centre, 331 multicentre extension) are presented Mean age was 38+/-11 years;67% are female, 31% nurses, 20% doctors, and 19% work in intensive care units COVID-19-associated risk factors were: 37% black, Asian or minority ethnicities;18% smokers;13% obesity;11% asthma;7% hypertension and 2% diabetes mellitus At baseline, 41% reported symptoms in the preceding 2 weeks Preliminary test results from the initial cohort (n=400) are available: PCR at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 28 of 396 (7 1%, 95% CI 4 9-10 0%) and 15 of 385 (3 9%, 2 4-6 3%) had circulating IgG antibodies Conclusions: This COVID-19 bioresource established just before the peak of infections in the UK will provide longitudinal assessments of incident infection and immune responses in HCWs through the natural time course of disease and convalescence The samples and data from this bioresource are available to academic collaborators by application https://covid-consortium com/application-for-samples/","output":"Healthcare Workers Bioresource: Study outline and baseline characteristics of a prospective healthcare worker cohort to study immune protection and pathogenesis in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health studies warn of the vulnerability of people with mental disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Between the SDGS and the adjusted infection rates, we found no significant correlation;however, between the SDGS and the adjusted death rates, the correlation was negative and statistically significant. These results provide a nuanced contrast to the hasty conclusions some of us might be tempted to draw from apparent positive correlations between SDGS and the cases and the deaths. The SDGs represent the fruit of painstaking global efforts to encourage and coordinate international action to enhance sustainability.

Summary. The risk of developing severe COVID-19 is higher in patients with autoimmune diseases, and SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to progression and exacerbation of the underlying chronic disease. The safest and most cost-effective way to avoid COVID-19 is to be vaccinated, to follow the hygiene rules and to wear an appropriate mask. Contrary to belief, autoimmune disease alone is not a contraindication to vaccination and, in fact, patients should be among the first to be vaccinated because of the risk. The only clear contraindication to the use of COVID-19 vaccine is a history of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any of the components of the vaccine. Indication of vaccination migh be influenced by, among other things, the current disease activity and the treatment applied. The timing of immunization can be the most safely planned by the attending physician. The incidence of vaccination reactions and complications during immunization in autoimmune patients is similar to that seen in the healthy population.

Under low energy demand, the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) is particularly sensitive to added energy supply (i.e., reductive stress) which exponentially increases the rate of H2O2 (JH2O2) production. H2O2 is reduced to H2O by electrons supplied by NADPH. NADP+ is reduced back to NADPH by activation of mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT). The coupling of reductive stress-induced JH2O2 production to NNT-linked redox buffering circuits provides a potential means of integrating energy balance with energy expenditure. To test this hypothesis, energy supply was manipulated by varying flux rate through ?-oxidation in muscle mitochondria minus/plus pharmacological or genetic inhibition of redox buffering circuits. Here we show during both non-ADP and low-ADP stimulated respiration that accelerating flux through ?-oxidation generates a corresponding increase in mitochondrial JH2O2 production, that the majority (a70-80%) of H2O2 produced is reduced to H2O by electrons drawn from redox buffering circuits supplied by NADPH, and that the rate of electron flux through redox buffering circuits is directly linked to changes in oxygen consumption mediated by NNT. These findings provide evidence that redox reactions within ?-oxidation and the ETS serve as a barometer of substrate flux relative to demand, continuously adjusting JH2O2 production and, in turn, the rate at which energy is expended via NNT-mediated proton conductance. This variable flux through redox circuits provides a potential compensatory mechanism for fine-tuning energy expenditure to energy balance in real-time.","output":"Flux through mitochondrial redox circuits linked to nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase generates counterbalance changes in energy expenditure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Many reports have stated that patients admitted for COVID-19 may also suffer from cardiovascular diseases, suggesting cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19.

METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Ovid, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for COVID-19 and ECG using all their equivalents and similar terms as search words. Afterwards, the records were limited to English articles and irrelevant documents, as well as articles that reported drug-induced cardiac dysfunction or patients with previous history of cardiovascular complications were excluded. RESULTS: Overall, 31 articles with 2379 patients were found and used for qualitative data extraction. Findings showed that there is a significant association between COVID-19 infection and ECG findings. Also, ST-segment changes, T wave inversions, QT prolongation, and atrial fibrillation were found to be early indicators of cardiac involvement of COVID-19, which were associated with worse outcomes.

The researchers, working with dermatologists across Spain, reviewed 375 patients with suspected, or confirmed, COVID-19, with the aim of developing a detailed classification of the different types of skin symptoms associated with COVID-19 with corresponding images. An initial 120 images were reviewed by four dermatologists, without knowing any other clinical information, and they identified patterns of symptoms associated with COVID-19. These patterns were then applied to the rest of the images and further refined. Five common skin symptoms were identified this way. These symptoms are chilblain-like lesions, outbreaks of small blisters, wheals, rashes comprised of small flat and raised red bumps, and livedo and necrosis. Livedo is a skin condition where circulation is impaired within the blood vessels of the skin, necrosis refers to the premature death of skin tissue. These symptoms are associated with different severity of COVID-19 infection, from less severe disease in the chilblain-like lesions, to most severe in patients with livedo.

Both countries were heavily affected by the first wave of infections in Spring 2020, but their governmental responses were very different. As such, the dataset offers unique opportunities to investigate the role of governmental responses in shaping public risk perception. In addition to epidemics, the survey considered indirect effects of COVID-19 (domestic violence, economic crises), as well as global (climate change) and local (wildfires, floods, droughts, earthquakes, terror attacks) threats. The survey examines perceived likelihoods and impacts, individual and authorities' preparedness and knowledge, and socio-demographic indicators.

By examining the effects of virus infection on gene expression, and interactions between virus and vector, new targets for prevention of infection and novel treatments may be identified in mosquitoes. We previously performed a microarray analysis of the Ae. aegypti transcriptome during infection with DENV and found that mosquito ubiquitin protein Ub3881 (AAEL003881) was specifically and highly down-regulated. Ubiquitin proteins have multiple functions in insects, including marking proteins for proteasomal degradation, regulating apoptosis and mediating innate immune signaling. METHODS: We used qRT-PCR to quantify gene expression and infection, and RNAi to reduce Ub3881 expression. Mosquitoes were infected with DENV through blood feeding. We transfected DENV protein expression constructs to examine the effect of Ub3881 on protein degradation. We used site-directed mutagenesis and transfection to determine what amino acids are involved in Ub3881-mediated protein degradation. Immunofluorescence, Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were used to examine protein interactions and co-localization. RESULTS: The overexpression of Ub3881, but not related ubiquitin proteins, decreased DENV infection in mosquito cells and live Ae. aegypti. The Ub3881 protein was demonstrated to be involved in DENV envelope protein degradation and reduce the number of infectious virions released. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Ub3881 has several antiviral functions in the mosquito, including specific viral protein degradation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our data highlights Ub3881 as a target for future DENV prevention strategies in the mosquito transmission vector.","output":"A novel mosquito ubiquitin targets viral envelope protein for degradation and reduces virion production during dengue virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate warming has changed vegetation phenology, and the phenology-associated impacts on terrestrial water fluxes remain largely unquantified. The impacts are linked to plant adjustments and responses to climate change and can be different in different hydroclimatic regions. Based on remote sensing data and observed river runoff of hydrological station from six river basins across a hydroclimatic gradient from northeast to southwest in China, the relative contributions of the vegetation (including spring and autumn phenology, growing season length (GSL), and gross primary productivity) and climatic factors affecting the river runoffs over 1982-2015 were investigated by applying gray relational analysis (GRA). We found that the average GSLs in humid regions (190-241 days) were longer than that in semi-humid regions (186-192 days), and the average GSLs were consistently extended by 4.8-13.9 days in 1982-2015 period in six river basins. The extensions were mainly linked to the delayed autumn phenology in the humid regions and to advanced spring phenology in the semi-humid regions. Across all river basins, the GRA results showed that precipitation (r = 0.74) and soil moisture (r = 0.73) determine the river runoffs, and the vegetation factors (VFs) especially the vegetation phenology also affected the river runoffs (spring phenology: r = 0.66; GSL: r = 0.61; autumn phenology: r = 0.59), even larger than the contribution from temperature (r = 0.57), but its relative importance is climatic region-dependent. Interestingly, the spring phenology is the main VF in the humid region for runoffs reduction, while both spring and autumn growth phenology are the main VFs in the semi-humid region, because large autumn phenology delay and less water supply capacity in spring amplify the effect of advanced spring phenology. This article reveals diverse linkages between climatic and VFs, and runoff in different hydroclimatic regions, and provides insights that vegetation phenology influences the ecohydrology process largely depending on the local hydroclimatic conditions, which improve our understanding of terrestrial hydrological responses to climate change.","output":"Influences of Shifted Vegetation Phenology on Runoff Across a Hydroclimatic Gradient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This paper aimed to describe the airway practices of intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia and New Zealand specific to patients presenting with COVID-19 and to inform whether consistent clinical practice was achieved. Specific clinical airway guidelines were endorsed in March 2020 by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) and College of Intensive Care Medicine (CICM). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Prospective, structured questionnaire for all ICU directors in Australia and New Zealand was completed by 69 ICU directors after email invitation from ANZICS. The online questionnaire was accessible for three weeks during September 2020 and analysed by cloud-based software. Basic ICU demographics (private or public, metropolitan or rural) and location, purchasing, airway management practices, guideline uptake, checklist and cognitive aid use and staff training relevant to airway management during the COVID-19 pandemic were the main outcome measures. The 69 ICU directors reported significant simulation-based inter-professional airway training of staff (97%), and use of video laryngoscopy (94%), intubation checklists (94%), cognitive aids (83%) and PPE \\"spotters\\" (89%) during the airway management of patients with COVID-19. Tracheal intubation was almost always performed by a Specialist (97% of ICUs), who was more likely to be an intensivist than an anaesthetist (61% vs 36%). There was a more frequent adoption of specific airway guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients in public ICUs (94% vs 71%) and reliance on specialist intensivists to perform intubations in private ICUs (92% vs 53%).

This population appears to be at higher risk for critical illness due to comorbidities and chronic immunosuppressive state Methods This was a single-center, retrospective study of 7 lung-transplant recipients who were symptomatic and tested positive for COVID-19 between Feb 2020 and Oct 2020. Demographics, including single vs double lung transplantation, time from transplant were included. Laboratory data on admission, immunosuppressive regimen and adjustment during hospitalization, oxygen requirements and outcomes were also collected Results To date, 7 out of 227 post-lung transplant patients followed at our center became symptomatic with COVID-19 infection. The average age was 60.5 years and 70% were female. All patients had double lung transplantation performed between Apr 2010 and Nov 2019. The average body mass index was 27.0 kg/m2. 85% required hospitalization, three had to be admitted to the intensive care unit, two required invasive mechanical ventilation. Two patients died (one due to acute kidney injury and refractory shock and one refused intubation). One patient on mechanical ventilation required VV ECMO 3 days after admission as a bridge to recovery. All patients were on standard triple immunosuppressive regimen [tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone]. Mycophenolate was stopped for all patients at the time of the infection, and those who required oxygen supplementation (n=5) received dexamethasone and convalescent plasma. Two of them were not eligible for Remdesivir. Elevated d-dimer (0.78 - 5.57 mg/L), LDH (253 - 985 U/L) and the degree of hypoxemia on admission correlated to worse outcomes Conclusion COVID-19 infection in lung transplant patients has a variable course. In our study, d-dimer, LDH and the degree of hypoxemia on admission had a linear correlation with unfavorable outcome, similar to what has been reported for non lung-transplant patients with COVID-19.

This study aimed to investigate what technology O&M professionals in Australia and Malaysia have, use, like, and want to support their client work, to inform the development of O&M technologies and build capacity in the international O&M profession. MATERIALS AND METHODS A technology survey was completed by professionals (n = 36) attending O&M workshops in Malaysia. A revised survey was completed online by O&M specialists (n = 31) primarily in Australia. Qualitative data about technology use came from conferences, workshops and interviews with O&M professionals. Descriptive statistics were analysed together with free-text data. RESULTS Limited awareness of apps used by clients, unaffordability of devices, and inadequate technology training discouraged many O&M professionals from employing existing technologies in client programmes or for broader professional purposes. Professionals needed to learn smartphone accessibility features and travel-related apps, and ways to use technology during O&M client programmes, initial professional training, ongoing professional development and research. CONCLUSIONS Smartphones are now integral to travel with low vision or blindness and early-adopter O&M clients are the travel tech-experts. O&M professionals need better initial training and then regular upskilling in mainstream O&M technologies to expand clients' travel choices. COVID-19 has created an imperative for technology laggards to upskill for O&M tele-practice. O&M technology could support comprehensive O&M specialist training and practice in Malaysia, to better serve O&M clients with complex needs. Implications for rehabilitation Most orientation and mobility (O&M) clients are travelling with a smartphone, so O&M specialists need to be abreast of mainstream technologies, accessibility features and apps used by clients for orientation, mobility, visual efficiency and social engagement. O&M specialists who are technology laggards need human-guided support to develop confidence in using travel technologies, and O&M clients are the experts. COVID-19 has created an imperative to learn skills for O&M tele-practice. Affordability is a significant barrier to O&M professionals and clients accessing specialist travel technologies in Malaysia, and to O&M professionals upgrading technology in Australia. Comprehensive training for O&M specialists is needed in Malaysia to meet the travel needs of clients with low vision or blindness who also have physical, cognitive, sensory or mental health complications.","output":"Use of technology by orientation and mobility professionals in Australia and Malaysia before COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental lockdown measures disproportionally impact older adults. This study presents the results from a psychiatric helpline for older adults in Mannheim, Germany, during the lockdown, set up to provide information and psychosocial support. We aim to elucidate the needs of older adults, their reported changes, and the psychological impact during the initial stages of the health crisis. METHODS: A total of 55 older adults called the psychiatric helpline between April and June 2020. Information on demographics, medical and psychiatric history. as well as changes in daily life due to the pandemic was collected anonymously. Mental health status was assessed using the 7-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-7) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). RESULTS: Most callers were women, older adults (M = 74.69 years), single, and retired. In total, 69% of callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety and depressive symptoms being the most common ones. Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of a psychiatric disease reported significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without a diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In older adults, the perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis appears to ameliorate with age. Individuals with a history of psychiatric disease are most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes. Rapid response in the form of a geriatric helpline is a useful initiative to support the psychosocial needs of older adults during a health crisis.","output":"Rapid Support for Older Adults during the Initial Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from a Geriatric Psychiatry Helpline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been an enormous public health challenge.

To date, the virus has infected tens of millions of people worldwide, compelling governments to implement strict policies to counteract community spread. Federal, provincial, and municipal governments have employed various public health policies, including social distancing, mandatory mask wearing, and the closure of schools and businesses. However, the implementation of these policies can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand their potential benefits and the risks of non-compliance. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the impact of social behaviour on the course of the pandemic in the province of Ontario. The approach is based upon a standard SEIRD model with a variable transmission rate that depends on the behaviour of the population. The model parameters, which characterize the disease dynamics, are estimated from Ontario COVID-19 epidemiological data using machine learning techniques. A key result of the model, following from the variable transmission rate, is the prediction of the occurrence of a second wave using the most current infection data and disease-specific traits. The qualitative behaviour of different future transmission-reduction strategies is examined, and the time-varying reproduction number is analyzed using existing epidemiological data and future projections. Importantly, the effective reproduction number, and thus the course of the pandemic, is found to be sensitive to the adherence to public health policies, illustrating the need for vigilance as the economy continues to reopen.","output":"Modeling the impact of public response on the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entire world has been experiencing the outbreak of a novel infectious agent known as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)1 .

Following review of submissions from the open call, 18 finalists and eight facilitators with expertise in sexual health research, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), were invited to a 3-day hackathon to harmonise a survey instrument. Consensus was achieved through an iterative, modified Delphi process that included three rounds of online surveys. The entire process resulted in a 19-item consensus statement and a brief sexual health survey instrument. This is the first global consensus on a sexual and reproductive health survey instrument that can be used to generate cross-national comparative data in both high-income and LMICs.

The dependence of viruses on cellular factors provides a weak-spot in the viral multiplication strategy and a means to interfere with viral multiplication. RESULTS: Using a motif-based search strategy for antiviral targets we identified caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as a putative cellular interaction partner of human influenza A viruses, including the pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) strains of swine origin circulating from spring 2009 on. The influence of Cav-1 on human influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus replication was determined in inhibition and competition experiments. RNAi-mediated Cav-1 knock-down as well as transfection of a dominant-negative Cav-1 mutant results in a decrease in virus titre in infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), a cell line commonly used in basic influenza research as well as in virus vaccine production. To understand the molecular basis of the phenomenon we focussed on the putative caveolin-1 binding domain (CBD) located in the lumenal, juxtamembranal portion of the M2 matrix protein which has been identified in the motif-based search. Pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that caveolin-1 binds to M2. The data suggest, that Cav-1 modulates influenza virus A replication presumably based on M2/Cav-1 interaction. CONCLUSION: As Cav-1 is involved in the human influenza A virus life cycle, the multifunctional protein and its interaction with M2 protein of human influenza A viruses represent a promising starting point for the search for antiviral agents.","output":"Caveolin-1 influences human influenza A virus (H1N1) multiplication in cell culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide since December 2019. Neurological symptoms have been reported as part of the clinical spectrum of the disease. We aim to determine whether neurological manifestations are common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to describe their main characteristics. METHODS We systematically review all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to hospital in a Spanish population during March 2020. Demographic characteristics, systemic and neurological clinical manifestations, and complementary tests were analyzed. RESULTS Of 841 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean age 66.4 years, 56.2% men) 57.4% developed some form of neurological symptom. Nonspecific symptoms such as myalgias (17.2%), headache (14.1%), and dizziness (6.1%) were present mostly in the early stages of infection. Anosmia (4.9%) and dysgeusia (6.2%) tended to occur early (60% as the first clinical manifestation) and were more frequent in less severe cases. Disorders of consciousness occurred commonly (19.6%), mostly in older patients and in severe and advanced COVID-19 stages. Myopathy (3.1%), dysautonomia (2.5%), cerebrovascular diseases (1.7%), seizures (0.7%), movement disorders (0.7%), encephalitis (n=1), Guillain-Barr syndrome (n=1), and optic neuritis (n=1) were also reported, but less frequent.

The situation is further compounded by human beings who are leading increasingly resource-intensive lifestyles. Climate change is a major threat to public health. Our health systems are already under pressure, and they are being further crippled by a rise in the incidence of heat waves, floods, droughts, and other vagaries of nature. It is the poor and developing countries that are bearing the highest brunt of climate change. According to some estimates, 22 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India. The health consequences of this are already proving to be lethal, with the State of Global Air Report, 2019 highlighting that over 1.2 million deaths took place in India in 2017 due to air pollution on account of conditions such as stroke, heart disease, and lung cancer. In fact, the Global Burden of Disease Study, 2017, shows that India accounts for a higher proportion of global health loss owing to air pollution as compared to the countrys proportion of the worldwide population. In the recent past, the severity of the situation and therefore the need for urgent measures have gained traction within the political and policy spheres in the country. In this chapter, we review the global best practices along with their applicability to the Indian context, as well as initiatives that have been taken in India with respect to mitigating climate change and air pollution. Based on this, we also make recommendations for tackling this growing public health emergency and protecting the well-being of the current and future generations. Of course, government alone cannot achieve this; hence, we also suggest steps that need to be taken by the private sector and citizens.","output":"Climate Change, Air Pollution, and Sustainable Development Goal 3: An Indian Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has placed the entire world, including Malaysia in a state of fear. The rising burden on healthcare facilities has put healthcare workers consistently at risk of healthcare-associated infection. We sought to identify determinants of preventive practice against COVID-19 at work among primary healthcare professionals in Sabah, Malaysia. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study involving healthcare workers of the Penampang and Putatan districts of Sabah, Malaysia. A total of 167 health professionals from primary healthcare settings took part in this study via a self-administered questionnaire from November 2020 until January 2021. Independent t-test and Analysis of Variance were used to determine differences in preventive practice for categorical independent variables. Pearson product-moment correlation was applied to assess the relationship between Job Satisfaction, burnout, and preventive practice. Subsequently, predictors of preventive practice at work among healthcare workers in Sabah were identified through Binomial Logistic Regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of good preventive practice among health professionals at work was 71.3%. There was no difference in preventive practice between professions. Almost all participants reported having good personal protective equipment compliance and hand hygiene practice at work. Marital status (AOR = 4.170, 95% CI = 1.787, 9.733; p = 0.001), average sleep hours (AOR = 1.775, 95% CI = 1.144, 2.754; p = 0.01), and pandemic-related burnout (AOR = 0.905, 95% CI = 0.847, 0.967; p = 0.003) were identified as significant predictors of preventive practice at primary healthcare facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of this study is beneficial to the healthcare organization. It can serve as a useful guide to tackle issues related to poor preventive practice against COVID-19 at work for health professionals.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic: determinants of workplace preventive practice among primary healthcare workers in Sabah, Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air quality in indoor environments can have significant impacts on people's health, comfort, and productivity.

The virus is highly contagious and spread rapidly and the number of infections increases exponentially. The high excessive number of patients and presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in human excreta and urine even after the infected persons respiratory tests were negative, results in heavy load of viral in various water bodies. Numerous studies reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples. The risk of contaminating water bodies in the regions which suffer from the lack of proper sanitation system and wastewater treatment plants (mostly in developing countries) is higher. Since solar water disinfection (SODIS) is usually used by people in developing countries, there is a concern about using this method during the pandemic. Because the SARS-CoV-2 can be eliminated by high temperature (>56C) and UVC wavelength (100-280 nm) while SODIS systems mainly work at lower temperature (<45C) and use the available UVA (315-400 nm). Thus, during a situation like the ongoing pandemic using SODIS method for wastewater treatment (or providing drinking water) is not a reliable method. It should be reminded that the main aim of the present study is not just to give insights about the possibilities and risks of using SODIS during the ongoing pandemic but it has broader prospect for any future outbreak/pandemic that results in biological contamination of water bodies.

BACKGROUND: Caregiver burnout is a concern that needs to be addressed at the organizational level so that professionals can reduce their risk of psychological injury while providing high-quality care. The COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic has exacerbated symptoms of burnout among nurses nationally. METHODS: Ten sessions of daylong resilience retreats were delivered to independent groups of nurses, nurse practitioners, and other healthcare professionals. Preretreat and postretreat assessments were completed using a 19-item survey developed by the research team to assess state anxiety, intention to engage in mindfulness practices, and self-efficacy around mindfulness. RESULTS: One hundred six healthcare professionals completed the resilience retreats. There was a statistically significant decrease in state anxiety scores following the retreat. The majority of the participants reported high intentions to engage in mindfulness practices and felt confident about incorporating mindfulness in their lives.

We present a case of COVID-19 re-infection in a chronically immunocompromised liver transplant patient. A 53-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgias. She was found to test positive for COVID-19. Her relevant medical history included liver transplantation on chronic immunosuppression. More recently, she had tested positive for COVID-19 approximately three months prior to this and was hospitalized at that time for encephalopathy and treated with remdesivir and convalescent plasma. She had subsequently recovered with negative COVID-19 testing in the interim.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: India, multiple regions representing combined population >150 million. PARTICIPANTS: Aggregate infection counts were drawn from four large population-representative prevalence/seroprevalence surveys. Data on corresponding number of deaths were drawn from official government reports of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was age-specific and sex-specific infection fatality rate (IFR), estimated as the number of confirmed deaths per infection. The secondary outcome was the slope of the IFR-by-age function, representing increased risk associated with age. RESULTS: Among males aged 50C89, measured IFR was 0.12% in Karnataka (95% CI 0.09% to 0.15%), 0.42% in Tamil Nadu (95% CI 0.39% to 0.45%), 0.53% in Mumbai (95% CI 0.52% to 0.54%) and an imprecise 5.64% (95% CI 0% to 11.16%) among migrants returning to Bihar. Estimated IFR was approximately twice as high for males as for females, heterogeneous across contexts and rose less dramatically at older ages compared with similar studies in high-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Estimated age-specific IFRs during the first wave varied substantially across India. While estimated IFRs in Mumbai, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were considerably lower than comparable estimates from high-income countries, adjustment for under-reporting based on crude estimates of excess mortality puts them almost exactly equal with higher-income country benchmarks. In a marginalised migrant population, estimated IFRs were much higher than in other contexts around the world. Estimated IFRs suggest that the elderly in India are at an advantage relative to peers in high-income countries. Our findings suggest that the standard estimation approach may substantially underestimate IFR in low-income settings due to under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths, and that COVID-19 IFRs may be similar in low-income and high-income settings.","output":"Representative estimates of COVID-19 infection fatality rates from four locations in India: cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to identify explanatory factors to increase the agricultural performance of Brazilian and Australian sugarcane mills.

Potatoes are susceptible to numerous pathogens that reduce yield, including Potato virus Y (PVY). Genetic resistance to PVY is a sustainable way to limit yield and quality losses due to PVY infection. Potato cultivars vary in their susceptibility to PVY and include susceptible varieties such as Russet Burbank, and resistant varieties such as Payette Russet. Although the loci and genes associated with PVY-resistance have been identified, the genes and mechanisms involved in limiting PVY during the development of systemic infections have yet to be fully elucidated. To increase our understanding of PVY infection, potato antiviral responses, and resistance, we utilized RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptomes of two potato cultivars. Since transcriptional responses associated with the extreme resistance response occur soon after PVY contact, we analyzed the transcriptome and small RNA profile of both the PVY-resistant Payette Russet cultivar and PVY-susceptible Russet Burbank cultivar 24 hours post-inoculation. While hundreds of genes, including terpene synthase and protein kinase encoding genes, exhibited increased expression, the majority, including numerous genes involved in plant pathogen interactions, were downregulated. To gain greater understanding of the transcriptional changes that occur during the development of systemic PVY-infection, we analyzed Russet Burbank leaf samples one week and four weeks post-inoculation and identified similarities and differences, including higher expression of genes involved in chloroplast function, photosynthesis, and secondary metabolite production, and lower expression of defense response genes at those time points. Small RNA sequencing identified different populations of 21- and 24-nucleotide RNAs and revealed that the miRNA profiles in PVY-infected Russet Burbank plants were similar to those observed in other PVY-tolerant cultivars and that during systemic infection ~32% of the NLR-type disease resistance genes were targeted by 21-nt small RNAs. Analysis of alternative splicing in PVY-infected potato plants identified splice variants of several hundred genes, including isoforms that were more dominant in PVY-infected plants. The description of the PVYN-Wi-associated transcriptome and small RNA profiles of two potato cultivars described herein adds to the body of knowledge regarding differential outcomes of infection for specific PVY strain and host cultivar pairs, which will help further understanding of the mechanisms governing genetic resistance and/or virus-limiting responses in potato plants.","output":"Transcriptome and Small RNA Profiling of Potato Virus Y Infected Potato Cultivars, Including Systemically Infected Russet Burbank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The majority of coronavirus disease 2019 mortality and morbidity is attributable to respiratory failure from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection The pathogenesis underpinning coronavirus disease 2019-induced respiratory failure may be attributable to a dysregulated host immune response Our objective was to investigate the pathophysiological relationship between proinflammatory cytokines and respiratory failure in severe coronavirus disease 2019 DESIGN: Multicenter prospective observational study SETTING: ICU PATIENTS: Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and noncoronavirus disease 2019 critically ill patients with respiratory failure (ICU control group) INTERVENTIONS: Daily measurement of serum inflammatory cytokines MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographics, comorbidities, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory data were collected daily Daily serum samples were drawn for measurements of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor- Pulmonary outcomes were the ratio of Pao(2)/Fio(2) and static lung compliance Twenty-six patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and 22 ICU controls were enrolled Of the patients with coronavirus disease 2019, 58% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 62% required mechanical ventilation, 12% underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 23% died A negative correlation between interleukin-6 and Pao(2)/Fio(2) (rho, -0 531;p = 0 0052) and static lung compliance (rho, -0 579;p = 0 033) was found selectively in the coronavirus disease 2019 group Diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with significantly elevated serum interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 on the day of diagnosis CONCLUSIONS: The inverse relationship between serum interleukin-6 and Pao(2)/Fio(2) and static lung compliance is specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in critically ill patients with respiratory failure Similar observations were not found with interleukin- or tumor necrosis factor-","output":"The Association of Inflammatory Cytokines in the Pulmonary Pathophysiology of Respiratory Failure in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has prevailed over a year, and log and register data on coronavirus have been utilized to establish models for detecting the pandemic. However, many sources contain unreliable health information on COVID-19 and its symptoms, and platforms cannot characterize the users performing searches.

Little is known about how modeling log data on smell/taste disorders and coronavirus from the dedicated internet databases used by citizens and health care professionals (HCPs) could enhance disease surveillance. Our material and method provide a novel approach to analyze web-based information seeking to detect infectious disease outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was (1) to assess whether citizens and professionals searches for smell/taste disorders and coronavirus relate to epidemiological data on COVID-19 cases, and (2) to test our negative binomial regression modeling (ie, whether the inclusion of the case count could improve the model). METHODS: We collected weekly log data on searches related to COVID-19 (smell/taste disorders, coronavirus) between December 30, 2019, and November 30, 2020 (49 weeks). Two major medical internet databases in Finland were used: Health Library (HL), a free portal aimed at citizens, and Physicians Database (PD), a database widely used among HCPs. Log data from databases were combined with register data on the numbers of COVID-19 cases reported in the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. We used negative binomial regression modeling to assess whether the case numbers could explain some of the dynamics of searches when plotting database logs. RESULTS: We found that coronavirus searches drastically increased in HL (0 to 744,113) and PD (4 to 5375) prior to the first wave of COVID-19 cases between December 2019 and March 2020. Searches for smell disorders in HL doubled from the end of December 2019 to the end of March 2020 (2148 to 4195), and searches for taste disorders in HL increased from mid-May to the end of November (0 to 1980). Case numbers were significantly associated with smell disorders (P<.001) and taste disorders (P<.001) in HL, and with coronavirus searches (P<.001) in PD. We could not identify any other associations between case numbers and searches in either database. CONCLUSIONS: Novel infodemiological approaches could be used in analyzing database logs. Modeling log data from web-based sources was seen to improve the model only occasionally. However, search behaviors among citizens and professionals could be used as a supplementary source of information for infectious disease surveillance.

By enabling definition of lineages it facilitates tracking of the global spread of the virus. The evolution of new variants can be monitored and knowledge of specific mutations provides insights into the mechanisms through which the virus increases transmissibility or evades immunity. To date almost one million SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced by members of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium. To achieve similar feats in a more cost-effective and sustainable manner in future, improved high throughput virus sequencing protocols are required. We have therefore developed a miniaturized library preparation protocol with drastically reduced consumable use and costs. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was amplified using the ARTIC nCov-2019 multiplex RT-PCR protocol and purified using a conventional liquid handling system. Acoustic liquid transfer (Echo 525) was employed to reduce reaction volumes and the number of tips required for a Nextera XT library preparation. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq. Results: We present the 'Mini-XT' miniaturized tagmentation-based library preparation protocol available on protocols.io (https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bvntn5en). The final version of Mini-XT has been used to sequence 4,384 SARS-CoV-2 samples from N. Ireland with a COG-UK QC pass rate of 97.4%. Sequencing quality was comparable and lineage calling consistent for replicate samples processed with full volume Nextera DNA Flex (333 samples) or using nanopore technology (20 samples). SNP calling between Mini-XT and these technologies was consistent and sequences from replicate samples paired together in maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. Conclusion: The Mini-XT protocol maintains sequence quality while reducing library preparation reagent volumes 8-fold and halving overall tip usage from sample to sequence to provide concomitant cost savings relative to standard protocols.

Nanoparticle delivery systems offer an unmatched ability of not only conveying a diverse array of diagnostic and therapeutic agents across complex biological barriers, but also possess the ability to transport payloads to targeted cell types over a sustained period. In substance use disorder (SUD), many therapeutic targets have been identified in preclinical studies, yet few of these findings have been translated to effective clinical treatments. The lack of success is, in part, due to the significant challenge of delivering novel therapies to the brain and specific brain cells. In this review, we evaluate the potential approaches and limitations of nanotherapeutic brain delivery systems.

CAstV was also recently associated with an unusual condition in chicks called white chicks. Some hatcheries in certain states of Brazil have reported several incubation problems, mortality, and the presence of chicks with white plumages over the past several months. These chicks were termed locally as white chicks. The present work investigated 30 chicks with this unusual condition using a multidisciplinary approach. Postmortem examination of each chick showed enlarged livers and intestines that were full of liquid and gas (30/30). The pancreas, kidneys, and spleen were pale (30/30). The other organs did not show any macroscopic alterations. CAstV, chicken parvovirus (ChPV), avian nephritis virus (ANV), avian rotavirus (ARtV), avian reovirus (AReoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and fowl adenovirus group I (FAdV-1) were tested in the intestines, pancreas, proventriculus, gizzard, liver, spleen, bursa, kidneys, thymus, lung, heart, brain, and yolk sac in each chick. All organs and yolk sacs were positive for CAstV in different titres and negative for the other tested viruses. The partial molecular characterization of the ORF 1b gene of CAstV using 28 sequences revealed a high similarity of the nucleotides and amino acids with sequences of CAstV from North America, Europe, and Asia, and our CAstV sequences clustered into a unique group that was separate from the other sequences. These results demonstrated that CAstV was associated with the white chick condition in Brazil. The virus was distributed in most organs, including the brain and yolk sac. These results suggest that the virus could be transmitted vertically. The molecular characterization also revealed that the CAstV associated with white chick condition was molecularly related to other CAstV sequences found worldwide.","output":"Detection and molecular characterization of chicken astrovirus associated with chicks that have an unusual condition known as white chicks in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Age is the major risk factor for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection and older people have received priority consideration for COVID-19 vaccination. However vaccine responses are often suboptimal in this age group and few people over the age of 80 years were included in vaccine registration trials.Methods: We determined the serological and cellular response to spike protein in 100 people aged 80-96 years at 2 weeks after second vaccination with the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.Findings: Antibody responses were seen in every donor with high titres in 98%. Spike-specific cellular immune responses were detectable in only 63% and correlated with humoral response. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased antibody responses after one vaccine and antibody and cellular responses remained 28-fold and 3-fold higher respectively after dual vaccination.

Particularly, how would China foster its image in Asia and, as a result, earn a favorable voice and even all-out support from Asian countries, countries economically underdeveloped and politically volatile? This paper sets out to answer this question by critiquing whether or not popular perceptions of China's political system impact how Asians perceive China's influence in general. Conducting statistical analysis using the fourth wave of Asian Barometer Survey (2016) to assess the above argument, we find that Asians who lend their support for China are more keen to the economic opportunities that China's growing economy offers their country than they are of China's political system.

Implementing evidence-informed actions is most challenging during a public health emergency as in an epidemic, when time is limited, scientific uncertainties and political pressures tend to be high, and irrefutable evidence may be lacking.

In such a situation, following a common line and having a shared tool that would allow to include evidence in public health decision-making, would be strategic to strengthen the impact of interventions, enabling stakeholders and decision makers taking actions based on the best available evidence through a process which is systematic and transparent. The objective of this presentation is to use the example of the COVID-19 outbreak, in order to explore how HTA can improve preparedness and response in emergencies with a high degree of uncertainty, representing the mechanisms through which interdisciplinary evidence feeds into decision-making processes during public health emergencies, addressing the link between scientific evidence and decision-making in public health emergencies, overcoming the key challenges faced by public health experts when advising decision makers, including strengthening and accelerating knowledge transfer through rapid HTA, improving networking between actors and disciplines.","output":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: can HTA improve preparedness and response in emergencies with a high degree of uncertainty?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Post-hoc, we hypothesized that over the recruitment period of the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial (CREST), increasing experience and improved patient selection with carotid stenting, and to a lesser extent, carotid endarterectomy would contribute to lower periprocedural event rates. METHODS Three study periods with approximately the same number of patients were defined to span recruitment. Composite and individual rates of periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction, and death rate were calculated separately by treatment assignment (carotid stenting/carotid endarterectomy). Temporal changes in unadjusted event rates, and rates after adjustment for temporal changes in patient characteristics, were assessed. RESULTS For patients randomized to carotid stenting, there was no significant temporal change in the unadjusted composite rates that declined from 6.2% in the first period, to 4.9% in the second, and 4.6% in the third (P=0.28). Adjustment for patient characteristics attenuated the rates to 6.0%, 5.9%, and 5.6% (P=0.85). For carotid endarterectomy-randomized patients, both the composite and the combined stroke and death outcome decreased between periods 1 and 2 and then increased in period 3. CONCLUSIONS The hypothesized temporal reduction of stroke+death events for carotid stenting-treated patients was not observed. Further adjustment for changes in patient characteristics between periods, including the addition of asymptomatic patients and a >50% decrease in proportion of octogenarians enrolled, resulted in practically identical rates.

It is unclear what effect this will have on outcomes and admission rates for heart failure (HF). We describe our approach and outcomes in managing HF in a Veteran's Affairs population with previously implanted CardioMEMS? during this time.Methods: Starting February 15th 2020, virtual visits were utilized in patients with CardioMEMS? during which their symptoms were discussed and medications adjusted. Patients also received weekly phone calls to ensure that they had medications and to adjust diuretics based on pulmonary artery (PA) pressure readings. They received text message reminders if a reading was missed. A nurse was also tasked to follow up on lab results. Data was collected by reviewing the charts of CardioMEMS? patients followed in our clinic by cardiology fellows and divided into pre pandemic period of July 1st 2018 to February 14th 2020 and a post pandemic period of February 15th 2020 to May 15th 2020. Data collected included baseline demographics, number of in-office and virtual visits, hospital admissions for HF, PA pressures, and compliance with CardioMEMS? readings. Phone calls to adjust diuretics or review labs were not counted as virtual visits.Results: In the pre-pandemic period we identified 49 patients with prior CardioMEMS?;baseline demographics are shown in Table 1A. Table 1B shows our results comparing the pre pandemic and post pandemic periods when our telemedicine program was started. Although in the post pandemic period our encounter rate was lower, our virtual program was able to maintain stable PA pressures and a lower overall hospital admission rate. Compliance with CardioMEMS? also increased though this was not statistically significant.Conclusion: Both CardioMEMS? and virtual visits may be used effectively to maintain low PA pressures and reduce hospital admissions for in patients with chronic HF.","output":"Management of Advanced Heart Failure Patients with the Combined Use of CardioMEMS? and Telehealth: A Single Center Experience in a Veteran's Affairs Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed a considerable burden on hospitals and healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide, increasing the risk of outbreaks and nosocomial transmission to 'non-COVID-19' patients, who represent the highest-risk population in terms of mortality, and HCWs.

The metabolites of fats known as fatty acids provide most of the energy for cardiac tissue, serve as building blocks for membranes and regulate important signaling cascades. Despite their importance, excess fat intake can cause cardiac dysfunction. The detrimental effects of high-fat diet (HFD) on cardiac health are widely investigated in long-term studies but the short-term effects of fats have not been thoroughly studied. To elucidate the near-term effects of a HFD on the growth and maturation of late adolescent heart we subjected 11-week-old mice to an 8-week long HFD (42% of calories from fat, 42% from carbohydrate, n = 8) or chow diet (12% of calories from fat, 66% from carbohydrate, n = 7) and assessed their effects on the heart in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that excessive fat feeding interferes with normal maturation of the heart indicated by the lack of increase in dimensions, volume, and stroke volume of the left ventricles of mice on high fat diet that were evident in mice on chow diet. In addition, differences in regional strain during the contraction cycle between mice on HFD and chow diet were seen. These changes were associated with reduced activity of the growth promoting PI3K-Akt1 signaling cascade and moderate changes in glucose metabolism without changes in calcium signaling. This study suggests that even a short period of HFD during late adolescence hinders cardiac maturation and causes physiological changes that may have an impact on the cardiac health in adulthood.","output":"Short high-fat diet interferes with the physiological maturation of the late adolescent mouse heart."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Almost a century after the devastating pandemic of the Spanish flu, humankind is facing the relatively comparable global outbreak of COVID\\\\19.

METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis on linked primary and secondary care data from people aged 16 or older with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 01/02/2020 and 30/06/2020 determined odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P-values for the association between demographic, deprivation and clinical factors with COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission and mortality. RESULTS: Over the study period, 1781 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 1195 (67%) were hospitalised, 152 (9%) admitted to ICU and 400 (23%) died. Results confirm previously identified risk factors: being male, or of Black or Asian ethnicity, or aged over 50. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased the risk of hospitalisation. Obesity increased the risk of being admitted to ICU. Underlying CKD, stroke and dementia increased the risk of death. Having learning disabilities was strongly associated with increased risk of death (OR = 4.75, 95% CI = [1.91, 11.84], P = .001). Having three or four co-morbidities increased the risk of hospitalisation (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = [1.55, 3.54], P < .001; OR = 2.40, 95% CI = [1.55, 3.73], P < .001 respectively) and death (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = [1.59, 4.28], P < .001; OR = 4.07, 95% CI = [2.48, 6.69], P < .001 respectively).

The main 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLPro ) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, which operates its replication, could be used as a medication discovery point. We therefore theoretically studied and docked the effects of 19 hydrolysable tannins on SARS-CoV-2 by assembling with the catalytic dyad residues of its 3CLpro using molecular operating environment (MOE 09). Results discovered that pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin intensely interacted with the receptor binding site and catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses estimated that the top three hits might serve as potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 leading molecules for additional optimization and drug development process to combat COVID-19. This study unleashed that tannins with specific structure could be utilized as natural inhibitors against COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The 3CLPro controls SARS-CoV-2 copying and manages its life series, which was targeted in case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronavirus. About 19 hydrolysable tannins were computed against 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin interacted with Cys145 and His41 of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro .

Religious activities such as the Hajj pilgrimage have a major impact on patients with diabetes mellitus, including increasing the risk of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. This increased risk is due to dietary changes and intense physical activity during pilgrimage while being on antidiabetic medications. Approximately 20% of the pilgrims with underlying illnesses who visit Mecca are diabetic, and complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperosmolar state, and fatigue/unconsciousness due to hypoglycaemia, have been observed among these patients. Diabetic patients are also at a high risk for foot complications and infections. To avoid any aggravation of the diabetes, a complete biochemical evaluation of the patient must be conducted before Hajj, and the patients must be provided contextualized educational guidance to avert these potential health challenges. This counselling should include the importance of carrying with them at all time their relevant medical history, summaries of the current treatment regimen and emergency snacks. In addition, to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, the dosage of insulin should be reduced in selected patients by 20% and that of sulfonylurea should be reduced as needed. Basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists are associated with fewer complications and can be preferentially prescribed. Those patients with type 1 diabetes can continue with the use of insulin pump with suitable education prior to Hajj. For the prevention of foot problems, the use of padded socks and well-fitting shoes is recommended along with an insistence on not walking barefoot. After Hajj, the patient must be followed up, and necessary investigations must be made along with readjustment of insulin dosage in those patients for whom it was reduced. Until the pandemic situation abates, all diabetic patients should avoid making the Hajj journey.","output":"Diabetes Care During Hajj"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Facing COVID-19, most of health care system first responded with the confinement of the population and an increase of intensive care resources.

There are many pathways to infection spread, and among the most significant from the epidemiological point of view is airborne transport. Microorganisms can become airborne when droplets are generated during speech, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, or atomization of feces during sewage removal. The fate of the droplets is governed by the physical principles of transport, with droplet size being the most important factor affecting their dispersion, deposition on surfaces and determining the survival of microorganisms within the droplets. In addition, physical characteristics of the indoor environment as well as the design and operation of building ventilation systems are of critical importance. Do we understand the mechanisms of infection spread and can we quantify the droplet dynamics under various indoor conditions? Unfortunately no, as this aspect of infection spread has attracted surprisingly little scientific interest. However, investigations of numerous cases in which a large number of people were infected show how critical the physics of microorganism spread can be. This paper reviews the state of knowledge regarding mechanisms of droplet spread and solutions available to minimize the spread and prevent infections. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Every day tens of millions of people worldwide suffer from viral infections of different severity at immense economic cost. There is, however, only minimal understanding of the dynamics of virus-laden aerosols, and so the ability to control and prevent virus spread is severely reduced, as was clearly demonstrated during the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. This paper proposes the direction to significantly advance fundamental and applied knowledge of the pathways of viral infection spread in indoor atmospheric systems, through a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach and application of state-of-the-art scientific methods. Knowledge gained will have the potential to bring unprecedented economical gains worldwide by minimizing/reducing the spread of disease.","output":"Droplet fate in indoor environments, or can we prevent the spread of infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aviation industry has become one of the top ten greenhouse gas emission industries in the world. China's aviation carbon emissions continue to increase, but the analysis of its influencing factors at the provincial level is still incomplete. This paper firstly uses Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology model (STIRPAT) model to analyze the time series evolution of China's aviation carbon emissions from 2000 to 2019. Secondly, it uses the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LDMI) model to analyze the influencing characteristics and degree of four factors on China's aviation carbon emissions, which are air transportation revenue, aviation route structure, air transportation intensity and aviation energy intensity. Thirdly, it determines the various factors' influencing direction and evolution trend of 31 provinces' aviation carbon emissions in China (not including Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan of China due to incomplete data). Finally, it derives the decoupling effort model and analyzes the decoupling relationship and decoupling effort degree between air carbon emissions and air transportation revenue in different provinces. The study found that from 2000 to 2019, China's total aviation carbon emissions continued to grow, while the growth rate of aviation carbon emissions showed a fluctuating downward trend. Air transportation revenue and aviation route structure promote the growth of total aviation carbon emissions, and air transportation intensity and aviation energy intensity have a restraining effect on the growth of total aviation carbon emissions. The scope of negative driving effect of air transportation revenue and air transportation intensity on total aviation carbon emissions in various provinces has increased. While the scope of positive driving influence of aviation route structure on total aviation carbon emissions of various provinces has increased, aviation energy intensity mainly has negative driving influence on total aviation carbon emissions of each province. Overall, the emission reduction trend in the areas to the west and north of the Qinling-Huaihe River Line is obvious. The decoupling mode between air carbon emissions and air transportation revenue in 31 provinces is mainly expansion negative decoupling. The air transportation intensity effect shows strong decoupling efforts in most provinces, the decoupling effort of aviation route structure effect and aviation energy intensity effect is not prominent.

We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes and to analyze the risk factors for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This two-center retrospective study was performed at two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. Confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes (N = 153) who were discharged or died from 1 January 2020 to 8 March 2020 were identified. One sex- and age-matched COVID-19 patient without diabetes was randomly selected for each patient with diabetes. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were abstracted. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with the mortality in these patients. RESULTS: Of 1,561 COVID-19 patients, 153 (9.8%) had diabetes, with a median age of 64.0 (interquartile range 56.0-72.0) years. A higher proportion of intensive care unit admission (17.6% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.01) and more fatal cases (20.3% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.017) were identified in COVID-19 patients with diabetes than in the matched patients. Multivariable Cox regression analyses of these 306 patients showed that hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 2.50, 95% CI 1.30-4.78), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.19-4.23), and chronic pulmonary disease (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.07-5.90) were independently associated with in-hospital death. Diabetes (HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.84-2.99) was not statistically significantly associated with in-hospital death after adjustment. Among patients with diabetes, nonsurvivors were older (76.0 vs. 63.0 years), most were male (71.0% vs. 29.0%), and they were more likely to have underlying hypertension (83.9% vs. 50.0%) and cardiovascular disease (45.2% vs. 14.8%) (all P values <0.05).

As a result, each species has its own distinct pattern of steroids, steroidogenic enzymes, receptors, and transporters to support its individual physiological requirements. Although the circulating steroid profile is well characterized during equine pregnancy, there is much yet to be explored regarding the factors that support steroidogenesis and steroid signaling. To obtain a holistic view of steroid-related transcripts, we sequenced chorioallantois (45 days, 4 months, 6 months, 10 months, 11 months, and post-partum) and endometrium (4 months, 6 months, 10 months, 11 months, and diestrus) throughout gestation, then looked in-depth at transcripts related to steroid synthesis, conjugation, transportation, and signaling. Key findings include: 1) differential expression of HSD17B isoforms among tissues (HSD17B1 high in the chorioallantois, while HSD17B2 is the dominant form in the endometrium) 2) a novel isoform with homology to SULT1A1 is the predominant sulfotransferase transcript in the chorioallantois; and 3) nuclear estrogen (ESR1, ESR2) and progesterone (PGR) expression is minimal to nonexistant in the chorioallantois and pregnant endometrium. Additionally, several hypotheses have been formed, including the possibility that the 45-day chorioallantois is able to synthesize steroids de novo from acetate and that horses utilize glucuronidation to clear estrogens from the endometrium during estrous, but not during pregnancy.

APPROACH: Physiological responses of 21 male Royal Marines recruits (age 212 y, height 1.790.05 m, weight 80.57.2 kg) were collected during a physically-demanding criterion road march (14.5 km in 90 min with a 9.6 kg load; air temperature 16C, relative humidity &#8805; 84%). Measured Tcr (thermometer pill) and estimated Tcr (ECTempTM Tcr-est) were compared. MAIN RESULTS: Measured Tcr either increased to an asymptote Tcr < 39.5C (WARM; n=11), or progressively increased to Tcr > 40.0C (HOT; n=10). In the HOT group, Tcr-est reflected measured Tcr up to Tcr = 40.0C (Bias = -0.10  0.37C, root mean square error = 0.37  0.13C). In the WARM group, Tcr-est overestimated Tcr (Bias = 0.34  0.40C) and was higher from mid-point to end. A logistic regression (Skin temperature approximate entropy and mean heart rate) was able to predict group membership (95% accuracy) at 20 minutes, allowing a WARM group ECTemp(TM) correction factor (corrected Bias=0.00  0.29C).

The neutralising ability of different vaccines alone or with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection against omicron is not well-known. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we tested the ability of vaccine and natural infection induced antibodies to neutralise omicron variant in a live virus neutralisation assay in four groups of individuals: (i) ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, (ii) ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, (iii) vaccination with inactivated virus vaccine (BBV152), and (iv) BBV152 vaccination plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary outcome was fold-change in virus neutralisation titre against omicron compared with ancestral virus. FINDINGS: We included 80 subjects. The geometric mean titre (GMT) of the 50% focus reduction neutralisation test (FRNT50) was 3804 (95% CI: 2211, 6547) against the ancestral virus with BBV152 vaccination and 3793 (95% CI: 1856, 7752) with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination alone. GMT for vaccination plus infection groups were 8061 (95% CI: 4785, 13578) and 15262 (95% CI: 8532, 27300), respectively. Against omicron variant, only 5 out of 20 in both BBV152 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine only groups, 6 out of 20 in BBV152 plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection group, and 9 out of 20 in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection group exhibited neutralisation titres above the lower limit of quantification (1:20) suggesting better neutralisation with prior infection. A reduction of 266 and 257 fold in FRNT50 titres against Omicron compared to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain was observed for individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection vaccinated with BBV152 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, respectively. The corresponding reduction was 571 and 581 fold, respectively, for vaccinated individuals with prior infection.

There have been efforts to identify digital competencies for different health care worker groups; however, an overview of these efforts has yet to be consolidated and analyzed. OBJECTIVE: The review aims to identify and study existing digital health competency frameworks for health care workers and provide recommendations for future digital health training initiatives and framework development. METHODS: A literature search was performed to collate digital health competency frameworks published from 2000. A total of 6 databases including gray literature sources such as OpenGrey, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Google, and websites of relevant associations were searched in November 2019. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by the reviewers. The included evidence is narratively described in terms of characteristics, evolution, and structural composition of frameworks. A thematic analysis was also performed to identify common themes across the included frameworks. RESULTS: In total, 30 frameworks were included in this review, a majority of which aimed at nurses, originated from high-income countries, were published since 2016, and were developed via literature reviews, followed by expert consultations. The thematic analysis uncovered 28 digital health competency domains across the included frameworks. The most prevalent domains pertained to basic information technology literacy, health information management, digital communication, ethical, legal, or regulatory requirements, and data privacy and security. The Health Information Technology Competencies framework was found to be the most comprehensive framework, as it presented 21 out of the 28 identified domains, had the highest number of competencies, and targeted a wide variety of health care workers. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health training initiatives should focus on competencies relevant to a particular health care worker group, role, level of seniority, and setting. The findings from this review can inform and guide digital health training initiatives. The most prevalent competency domains identified represent essential interprofessional competencies to be incorporated into health care workers' training. Digital health frameworks should be regularly updated with novel digital health technologies, be applicable to low- and middle-income countries, and include overlooked health care worker groups such as allied health professionals.","output":"A Digitally Competent Health Workforce: Scoping Review of Educational Frameworks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bilateral knee dislocations are exceedingly rare in orthopaedics Managing these injuries presents a difficult task given their high complication rate and guarded prognosis We report the case of a 21-year-old male who presented to our institution with bilateral knee dislocations sustained in a motor vehicle collision The patient subsequently underwent multiligament knee reconstruction surgeries for each knee at one and three weeks following the initial injury At one-year follow-up, the patient has achieved a successful outcome and has returned to regular activities which include hiking and exercising at the gym","output":"Bilateral Knee Dislocations Treated with Acute, Single-Stage Multiligament Reconstructions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) POP is defined as the protrusion of pelvic organs from the vaginal canal.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, countries have implemented diverse policies regarding Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) measures. This is because in the first stage countries had limited knowledge about the virus and its contagiousness. Also, there was no effective medication or vaccines. This paper studies the effectiveness of the implemented policies and measures against the deaths attributed to the virus between January and May 2020. METHODS: Data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control regarding the identified cases and deaths of COVID-19 from 48 countries have been used. Additionally, data concerning the NPI measures related policies implemented by the 48 countries and the capacity of their health care systems was collected manually from their national gazettes and official institutes. Data mining, time series analysis, pattern detection, machine learning, clustering methods and visual analytics techniques have been applied to analyze the collected data and discover possible relationships between the implemented NPIs and COVID-19 spread and mortality. Further, we recorded and analyzed the responses of the countries against COVID-19 pandemic, mainly in urban areas which are over-populated and accordingly COVID-19 has the potential to spread easier among humans. RESULTS: The data mining and clustering analysis of the collected data showed that the implementation of the NPI measures before the first death case seems to be very effective in controlling the spread of the disease. In other words, delaying the implementation of the NPI measures to after the first death case has practically little effect on limiting the spread of the disease. The success of implementing the NPI measures further depends on the way each government monitored their application. Countries with stricter policing of the measures seems to be more effective in controlling the transmission of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The conducted comparative data mining study provides insights regarding the correlation between the early implementation of the NPI measures and controlling COVID-19 contagiousness and mortality. We reported a number of useful observations that could be very helpful to the decision makers or epidemiologists regarding the rapid implementation and monitoring of the NPI measures in case of a future wave of COVID-19 or to deal with other unknown infectious pandemics. Regardless, after the first wave of COVID-19, most countries have decided to lift the restrictions and return to normal. This has resulted in a severe second wave in some countries, a situation which requires re-evaluating the whole process and inspiring lessons for the future.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: : This prospective, cross-sectional study included 30 eyes from 30 patients with severe COVID-19 and 30 eyes of 30 sex-matched healthy controls. Central macular thickness (CMT), subfoveal choroidal thickness (CT) and retinal vascular changes of patients were measured after positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (where the patient had COVID-19-related symptoms) and then three months after two negative PCRs. Laboratory parameters, including C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels, were also recorded. RESULTS: : The mean age of the patients was 47.90  9.06 years in patients group, 49.07  8.41 years in control goups (p=0.467). In terms of choroidal thicknesses subfoveal, nasal and temporal region were significantly higher in the active disease period than control group (p=0.019, p=0.036, p=0.003, respectively). When the after recovery period was compared with the control group in terms of choroidal thickness, although the choroidal thickness was higher in all regions, this difference was not found statistically significant. There was no statistically significant difference in CMT between groups (p=0.506).The mean venous and arterial wall thicknesses were significantly higher in the active period than after recovery (p=0.023, p=0.013, respectively) but there were no differences between after recovery and control groups in the pairwise comparison (p=0.851, p=0.715, respectively). CONCLUSION: : In patients with severe COVID-19, there are changes in thickness of the choroid and retinal vessel walls.

Years of inadequate funding of the nation's federal, state, and local public health agencies, together with mismanagement by the Trump administration, hampered the early response to the epidemic. Meanwhile, barriers to care faced by uninsured and underinsured individuals in the United States could deter COVID-19 care and hamper containment efforts, and lead to adverse medical and financial outcomes for infected individuals and their families, particularly those from disadvantaged groups. While the United States has a relatively generous supply of Intensive Care Unit beds and most other health care infrastructure, such medical resources are often unevenly distributed or deployed, leaving some areas ill-prepared for a severe respiratory epidemic. These deficiencies and shortfalls have stimulated a debate about policy solutions. Recent legislation, for instance, expanded coverage for testing for COVID-19 for the uninsured and underinsured, and additional reforms have been proposed.

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the rapid scoring system on admission of these patients. METHODS: A total of 138 medical records of critically ill patients with COVID\\\\19 were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission used for calculating Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for analysis. All patients were divided into two age subgroups (<65 years and 65 years). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed for overall patients and both subgroups. RESULTS: The median [25th quartile, 75th quartile] of MEWS of survivors versus nonsurvivors were 1 [1, 2] and 2 [1, 3] and those of REMS were 5 [2, 6] and 7 [6, 10], respectively. In overall analysis, the area under the ROC curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.833 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.737 to 0.928), higher than that of MEWS (0.677, 95% CI = 0.541 to 0.813). An optimal cutoff of REMS (6) had a sensitivity of 89.5%, a specificity of 69.8%, a positive predictive value of 39.5%, and a negative predictive value of 96.8%. In the analysis of subgroup of patients aged <65 years, the area under the ROC curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.863 (95% CI = 0.743 to 0.941), higher than that of MEWS (0.603, 95% CI = 0.462 to 0.732). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study was the first exploration on rapid scoring systems for critically ill patients with COVID\\\\19. The REMS could provide emergency clinicians with an effective adjunct risk stratification tool for critically ill patients with COVID\\\\19, especially for the patients aged <65 years. The effectiveness of REMS for screening these patients is attributed to its high negative predictive value.","output":"Comparing Rapid Scoring Systems in Mortality Prediction of Critically Ill Patients With Novel Coronavirus Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacterial resistance to conventional antibiotics is of major concern. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered excellent alternatives. Among them, D-cateslytin (D-Ctl, derivative of a host defense peptide) has shown high efficiency against a broad spectrum of bacteria. The first target of AMPs is the outer membrane of the bacterium. However, the role of bacterial cell-wall structures on D-Ctl's mechanism of action has not yet been understood. In this study, we investigated the activity of D-Ctl on two isogenic strains of E. coli: one is devoid of any parietal structures; the other constitutively overexpresses only type 1 fimbriae. We studied the damage caused by D-Ctl at several initial concentrations of bacteria and D-Ctl, and exposure times to D-Ctl were examined using a combination of epifluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode (ATR-FTIR). The analysis of nanomechanical and spectrochemical properties related to the antibacterial mechanism showed a concentration dependent activity. Whereas the membrane permeabilization was evidenced for all concentrations of D-Ctl and both mutants, no pore formation was observed. The bacterial stiffness is modified dramatically concomitantly to major membrane damage and changes in the spectral fingerprints of the bacteria. In the case of the occurrence of type 1 fimbriae only, an intracellular activity was additionally detected.

However, heterogeneity in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing may introduce biased estimates depending on analytic design. Objective: Characterizing individual, environmental, and social determinants of SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 diagnosis. Design: We conducted cross-sectional analyses among 14.7 million people comparing individual, environmental, and social determinants among individuals who were tested versus not yet tested. Among those diagnosed, we used three analytic designs to compare predictors of: 1) individuals testing positive versus negative; 2) symptomatic individuals testing positive versus negative; and 3) individuals testing positive versus individuals not testing positive (i.e. testing negative or not being tested). Analyses included tests conducted between March 1 and June 20, 2020. Setting: Ontario, Canada. Participants: All individuals with []1 healthcare system contact since March 2012, excluding individuals deceased before, or born after, March 1, 2020, or residing in a long-term care facility. Exposures: Individual-level characteristics (age, sex, underlying health conditions, prior healthcare use), area-based environmental (air pollution) exposures, and area-based social determinants of health (income, education, housing, marital status, race/ethnicity, and recent immigration). Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds of SARS-CoV-2 test, and of COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: Of a total of 14,695,579 individuals, 758,691 had been tested, of whom 25,030 (3.3%) tested positive. The further the odds of testing from the null, the more variability observed in the odds of diagnosis across analytic design, particularly among individual factors. There was less variability in testing by social determinants across analytic design. Residing in areas with highest household density (adjusted odds ratio: 2.08; 95%CI: 1.95-1.21), lowest educational attainment (adjusted odds ratio: 1.52; 95%CI: 1.44-1.60), and highest proportion of recent immigrants (adjusted odds ratio: 1.12; 95%CI: 1.07-1.16) were consistently related to increased odds of COVID-19 across analytic designs. Conclusions and Relevance: Where testing is limited, risk factors may be better estimated using population comparators rather than test-negative comparators. Optimizing COVID-19 responses necessitates investment and sufficient coverage of structural interventions tailored to heterogeneity in social determinants of risk, including household crowding and systemic racism.","output":"The Individual and Social Determinants of COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada: A Population-Wide Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Psychotherapy interventions increasingly utilize digital technologies to improve access to therapy and its acceptability. Opportunities that digital technology potentially creates for art therapy reach beyond increased access to include new possibilities of adaptation and extension of therapy tool box. Given growing interest in practice and research in this area, it is important to investigate how art therapists engage with digital technology or how (and whether) practice might be safely adapted to include new potential modes of delivery and new arts media. METHODS: An integrative review of peer-reviewed literature on the use of digital technology in art therapy was conducted. The methodology used is particularly well suited for early stage exploratory inquiries, allowing for close examination of papers from a variety of methodological paradigms. Only studies that presented empirical outcomes were included in the formal analysis. FINDINGS: Over 400 records were screened and 12 studies were included in the synthesis, pertaining to both the use of digital technology for remote delivery and as a medium for art making. Included studies, adopting predominantly qualitative and mixed methods, are grouped according to their focus on: art therapists views and experiences, online/distance art therapy, and the use of digital arts media. Recurring themes are discussed, including potential benefits and risks of incorporating digital technology in sessions with clients, concerns relating to ethics, resistance toward digital arts media, technological limitations and implications for therapeutic relationship and therapy process. Propositions for best practice and technological innovations that could make some of the challenges redundant are also reviewed. Future directions in research are indicated and cautious openness is recommended in both research and practice. CONCLUSION: The review documents growing research illustrating increased use of digital technology by art therapists for both online delivery and digital art making. Potentially immense opportunities that technology brings for art therapy should be considered alongside limitations and challenges of clinical, pragmatic and ethical nature.

The prevalence of CKD in cancer patients is close to 20-30% however there has been limited data about cancer patients with CKD and COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of this patient population at a tertiary cancer center. Methods: All patient data - demographics, labs, comorbidities and outcomes - were aggregated and analyzed in the Syntropy platform, Palantir Foundry ('Foundry'), as part of the Data-Driven Determinants of COVID-19 Oncology Discovery Effort (D3CODE) protocol at MD Anderson. The cohort was defined by the following: (1) positive COVID-19 test;(2) baseline eGFR 15-59 ml/min/1.73m2 calculated by chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration equation. The baseline GFR and creatinine values used the most temporally proximal lab results within 30 days prior to the patient's infection. AKI was defined as an absolute change of creatinine 0.3 mg/dl above the baseline after the positive COVID-19 test. Results: Out of 790 patients with COVID19,19.6% had underlying CKD. Among these, 86.5% and 46.5% had history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, respectively. 77.3% had a solid malignancy and 87.3% of them had metastatic disease. 67.7% were asymptomatic, 14.2% required ICU admission, 10.3% required invasive ventilation support, and 11.6% died within 90 days of the COVID-19 test. AKI developed within the first 30 days in 61.3% and 8.4% required renal replacement therapy. AKI was more prevalent in patients who were hospitalized (84.2% vs. 31.7%, p&lt; 0.001), had concurrent pneumonia (63.3% vs. 36.8%, p&lt; 0.002), required critical care (68.3% vs. 15.8% , p&lt; 0.001), and were on ventilation support (16.8% vs. 0%, p=0.002). There was no significant statistical difference in rates of diabetes (52.6% vs. 36.7%, P of 0.076), tumor staging (metastasis;95.1% vs. non metastatic 82.6%, p&lt; 0.2) , readmission rate (52.6% vs. 43.3%, p=0.336), and death rate at 30 days (9.5% vs. 3.3%, p=0.205) between the two groups. Conclusions: The overall mortality rate of cancer patients with CKD and positive COVID-19 test was relatively high and close to 1.7 times the rate of patients with no CKD at our tertiary cancer center. AKI is a common complication in CKD patients with concurrent pneumonia and requiring ventilation support, and was associated with increased morality at 90 days.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients with chronic kidney disease and coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covaxin/BBV152 is a whole virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

AIM: The aim is to assess the impact of the social distancing measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function and quality of life of noninfected reproductive-age women, living with their sexual partner. METHODS: Observational analysis on sexually active women, living with their partner, and without COVID-19 infection was performed. The population previously answered FSFI, FSDS, and SF-36 questionnaires. 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail for an evaluation during the COVID-19 outbreak. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the assessment of the women's sex function change during the social restriction period, by analyzing the FSFI and FSDS questionnaires. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the impact on the quality of life calculated by the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: 89 patients were considered. The median age was 39 (28C50) years. Mean sexual intercourses/month decreased from 6.3  1.9 to 2.3  1.8, mean difference: ?3.9  1.2. FSFI decreased significantly (29.2  4.2 vs 19.2  3.3, mean difference: ?9.7  2.6) and FSDS increased significantly (9.3  5.5 vs 20.1  5.2, mean difference: 10.8  3.4). The SF-36 showed a significant change from 82.2  10.2 to 64.2  11.8 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures; mean difference: ?17.8  6.7. The univariable analysis identified working outside the home, university educational level, and parity 1 as predictive factors of lower FSFI. In multivariable analysis, working outside the home and combination of working outside the home + university educational level + parity 1 were the independent factors of a lower FSFI. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic period on sexual function and quality of life in women shows how acute stress might affect the psychological state. Thus, psychological or sexual support could be useful. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first that analyzes the change in sexual activity in women during the COVID-19 outbreak period. The limitations were the low number of the analyzed participants, psychological tests were not included, and no data were collected on masturbation, self-heroism, solitary, and nonpenetrative sex. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic and the restrictive social distancing measures have negatively influenced the sexual function and quality of life in not-infected reproductive-age women who live with their sexual partners.

By studying infection of human biopsies in vitro and in a hamster model in vivo, we demonstrated a transition in tropism from olfactory to respiratory epithelium as the virus evolved. Analyzing each variants revealed that SARS-CoV-2 WA1 or Delta infects a proportion of olfactory neurons in addition to the primary target sustentacular cells. The Delta variant possesses broader cellular invasion capacity into the submucosa, while Omicron displays longer retention in the sinonasal epithelium. The olfactory neuronal infection by WA1 and the subsequent olfactory bulb transport via axon is more pronounced in younger hosts. In addition, the observed viral clearance delay and phagocytic dysfunction in aged olfactory mucosa is accompanied by a decline of phagocytosis related genes. Furthermore, robust basal stem cell activation contributes to neuroepithelial regeneration and restores ACE2 expression post-infection. Together, our study characterized the nasal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 strains, immune clearance, and regeneration post infection. The shifting characteristics of viral infection at the airway portal provides insight into the variability of COVID-19 clinical features and may suggest differing strategies for early local intervention.","output":"Evolution of nasal and olfactory infection characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate human coronaviruses (HCoVs) infection in children with acute lower respiratory tract infection(ALRTI)and to explore the clinical features of ALRTI caused by HCoVs in children. METHOD Totally 4 371 children with clinical diagnosis of ALRTI during the period from March 2007 to February 2015 seen in Beijing Children's Hospital were recruited into this study. Patients were divided into 4 groups by age, including 1 890 cases in < 1 year group, 788 cases in 1-3 years group, 553 cases in 3-6 years group, 1140 cases in 6 years group. One nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen was collected from each patient. RT-PCR methods were applied to detect 9 common respiratory viruses including HCoVs (including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and so on. Clinical features of ALRTI with single HCoVs infection were analyzed and compared with hospitalized ALRTI cases with single RSV infection in the same period. RESULT (1) Totally 2 895 cases were positive for at least one virus in this study in 4 371 ALRTI patients (positive rate 66.23%), in which 147 cases were positive for HCoVs infection (positive rate 3.36%). (2) Positive rates of HCoVs in each year from 2007 to 2014 were 6.11%, 3.79%, 4.69%, 4.31%, 2.38% 2.10%, 0.77% and 2.65%, respectively. The mean positive rates of HCoVs for each month from January to December were 2.53%, 2.12%, 3.63%, 6.68%, 1.53%, 3.77%, 3.92%, 3.00%, 2.15%, 5.26%, 3.01% and 2.80%. (3) Detection results of each subtypes of HCoVs in total 4 371 pediatric ALRTI patients were: 48 cases positive for HCoV-OC43(1.10%), 32 cases positive for HCoV-229E(0.73%), 25 cases positive for HCoV-NL63 (0.57%), 27 cases positive for HCoV-HKU1 (0.62%). (4) Positive rates of HCoVs infection in <1 year group, 1-3 years group, 3-6 years group and  6 years group were 4.13%, 5.08%, 2.71% and 1.23%, respectively. There were significant differences in positive rates of HCoV among groups (2 = 27.218, P<0.01). (5) There were 16 hospitalized cases with single infection of HCoVs in this study, of which 12 cases were diagnosed as bronchopneumonia, 3 cases developed acute laryngeal obstruction, 2 cases had acute bronchial asthma attack. Common clinical manifestations included cough (14 cases), gasping (13 cases), dyspnea (9 cases), fever (6 cases), hoarseness (4 cases), laryngeal stridor (4 cases) and abnormality on chest X-ray (including fuzzy lung texture, patchy shadow and consolidation) (12 cases). (6) There were no significant differences in the incidence of clinical manifestations (including cough, gasping, dyspnea, fever and abnormality on chest X-ray), complications (including respiratory failure, myocardial damage, and acute bronchial asthma attack) and mechanical ventilation between hospitalized ALRTI patients with single HCoV infection and 193 patients with single RSV infection in the same period. CONCLUSION HCoVs are pathogens of ALRTI in children, The overall positive rate of HCoVs was 3.36% in this study. The clinical manifestations and severity of ALRTI caused by single HCoVs was comparable to that of ALRTI with single RSV infection in children.","output":"[Detection and clinical analysis of acute lower respiratory tract infection with human coronaviruses in children in Beijing area 2007-2015]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Day-to-day observations reveal numerous medical and social situations where maintaining physical distancing is either not feasible or not practiced during the time of a viral pandemic, such as, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During these close-up, face-to-face interactions, a common belief is that a susceptible person wearing a face mask is safe, at least to a large extent, from foreign airborne sneeze and cough droplets. This study, for the first time, quantitatively verifies this notion. Droplet flow visualization experiments of a simulated face-to-face interaction with a mask in place were conducted using the particle image velocimetry setup. Five masks were tested in a snug-fit configuration (i.e., with no leakage around the edges): N-95, surgical, cloth PM 2.5, cloth, and wetted cloth PM 2.5. Except for the N-95 mask, the findings showed leakage of airborne droplets through all the face masks in both the configurations of (1) a susceptible person wearing a mask for protection and (2) a virus carrier wearing a mask to prevent the spreading of the virus. When the leakage percentages of these airborne droplets were expressed in terms of the number of virus particles, it was found that masks would not offer complete protection to a susceptible person from a viral infection in close (e.g., <6 ft) face-to-face or frontal human interactions. Therefore, consideration must be given to minimize or avoid such interactions, if possible.

A common dynamics has been observed, but its propagation has not been homogeneous over each continent. We aimed at characterizing the non-viral parameters that were most associated with death rate. Methods: We tested major indices from five domains (demography, public health, economy, politics, environment) and their potential associations with Covid-19 mortality during the first 8 months of 2020, through a Principal Component Analysis and a correlation matrix with a Pearson correlation test. Data of all countries, or states in federal countries, showing at least 10 fatality cases, were retrieved from official public sites. For countries that have not yet finished the first epidemic phase, a prospective model has been computed to provide options of death rates evolution. Results: Higher Covid death rates are observed in the [25/65] latitude and in the [-35/-125] longitude ranges. The national criteria most associated with death rate are life expectancy and its slowdown, public health context (metabolic and non-communicable diseases (NCD) burden vs. infectious diseases prevalence), economy (growth national product, financial support), and environment (temperature, ultra-violet index). Stringency of the measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did not appear to be linked with death rate. Conclusion: Countries that already experienced a stagnation or regression of life expectancy, with high income and NCD rates, had the highest price to pay. This burden was not alleviated by more stringent public decisions.

Modern advances in population-level disease surveillance are necessary and may inform novel opportunities for precision public health approaches to disease prevention. Electronic data sources, such as social media and consumer rewards points systems, have expanded dramatically in recent decades. These non-traditional datasets may enhance traditional clinical and public health datasets and inform cardiometabolic disease surveillance and population health interventions. However, the scope of non-traditional electronic datasets and their use for cardiometabolic disease surveillance and population health interventions has not been previously reviewed. The primary objective of this review is to describe the scope of non-traditional electronic datasets, and how they are being used for cardiometabolic disease surveillance and to inform interventions. The secondary objective is to describe the methods, such as machine learning and natural language processing, that have been applied to leverage these datasets. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a scoping review following recommended methodology. Search terms will be based on the three central concepts of non-traditional electronic datasets, cardiometabolic diseases and population health. We will search EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library peer-reviewed databases and will also conduct a grey literature search. Articles published from 2000 to present will be independently screened by two reviewers for inclusion at abstract and full-text stages, and conflicts will be resolved by a separate reviewer.

DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. SETTING: Populations resident in predominantly urban and rural areas in England (2015-2017). PARTICIPANTS: N=33 336 respondents to the UK Household Longitudinal Survey in urban and rural settings in England; N=4913 general practices in England reporting to the National Diabetes Audit and providing workforce data to NHS Digital. OUTCOMES: Diabetes prevalence; administrative records of diagnoses of diabetes; provision of (all eight) recommended diabetes care processes; diabetes treatment targets. RESULTS: Diabetes prevalence was higher in urban areas in England (7.80% (95% CI 7.30% to 8.31%)) relative to rural areas (7.24% (95% CI 6.32% to 8.16%)). For practices in urban areas, relatively fewer cases of diabetes were recorded in administrative medical records (69.55% vs 71.86%), and a smaller percentage of those registered received the appropriate care (45.85% vs 49.32%). Among estimated prevalent cases of diabetes, urban areas have a 24.84% achieving these targets compared with 25.16% in rural areas.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that ultrasound findings in these patients would (1) be associated with their disease severity and (2) change over time in alignment with clinical outcome. METHODS: The study was made in the emergency department (ED) in a tertiary level pediatric hospital. All patients with swab-confirmed COVID-19 infection were subjected to a LUS within 6 h from admission and after 96 h.

Data were analyzed using an orthogonal-projections to latent structures (OPLS) method and used to construct an exceptionally strong (AUROC = 1) hybrid NMR-MS model that enabled detailed metabolic discrimination between the groups and their biochemical relationships. Key discriminant metabolites included markers of inflammation including elevated &#945;-1-acid glycoprotein and an increased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. There was also an abnormal lipoprotein, glucose, and amino acid signature consistent with diabetes and coronary artery disease (low total and HDL Apolipoprotein A1, low HDL triglycerides, high LDL and VLDL triglycerides), plus multiple highly significant amino acid markers of liver dysfunction (including the elevated glutamine/glutamate and Fischer's ratios) that present themselves as part of a distinct SARS-CoV-2 infection pattern. A multivariate training-test set model was validated using independent samples from additional SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and controls.

Here, in order to increase awareness in the research community, we discuss the merits of common algorithms and programs in a way that should be approachable to biologists with limited experience in bioinformatics. We will only in passing consider the effects of data cleanup, a precursor analysis to most alignment tools, and no consideration will be given to downstream processing of the aligned fragments. To compare aligners [Bowtie2, Burrows Wheeler Aligner (BWA), HISAT2, MUMmer4, STAR, and TopHat2], an RNA-seq dataset was used containing data from 48 geographically distinct samples of the grapevine powdery mildew fungus Erysiphe necator. Based on alignment rate and gene coverage, all aligners performed well with the exception of TopHat2, which HISAT2 superseded. BWA perhaps had the best performance in these metrics, except for longer transcripts (>500 bp) for which HISAT2 and STAR performed well. HISAT2 was ~3-fold faster than the next fastest aligner in runtime, which we consider a secondary factor in most alignments. At the end, this direct comparison of commonly used aligners illustrates key considerations when choosing which tool to use for the specific sequencing data and objectives.

The consequences on pathogen-specific immune responses are not well known. This study evaluated and compared the humoral responses specific to merozoite stage vaccine candidates of Plasmodium falciparum, in children differentially exposed to Anopheles bites in a natural setting. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was carried out in Bouak (C?te dIvoire) where entomological data and blood samples from children (0C14 years) were collected in two sites with similar malaria prevalence. Antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG3) responses to PfAMA1 and PfMSP1 were evaluated by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the immune responses to P. falciparum antigens and exposure to Anopheles bites in the total cohort and in each site, separately. The individual level of exposure to Anopheles bites was evaluated by quantifying specific IgG response to the Anopheles gSG6-P1 salivary peptide, which represents a proxy of Anopheles exposure. RESULTS: The anti-Plasmodium humoral responses were different according to the level of exposure of children, with those highly exposed to Anopheles presenting significantly lower antibody responses to PfMSP1 in total population (IgG and IgG3) and in Petessou village (IgG, IgG1, IgG3). No significant difference was seen for PfAMA1 antigen between children differently exposed to Anopheles. In Dar-es-Salam, a neighbourhood where a high Culex density was reported, children presented very low antibody levels specific to both antigens, and no difference according to the exposure to Anopheles bites was found. CONCLUSION: These findings may suggest that immunomodulatory components of Anopheles saliva, in addition to other factors, may participate to the modulation of the humoral response specific to Plasmodium merozoite stage antigens. This epidemiological observation may form a starting point for additional work to decipher the role of mosquito saliva on the modulation of the anti-Plasmodium acquired immunity and clinical protection in combining both field and ex vivo immunological studies.","output":"Pattern of antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum antigens in individuals differentially exposed to Anopheles bites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Myocardial injury is associated with excess mortality in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, but the mechanisms of injury are diverse.

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare differences in stigma experiences of COVID-19 survivors versus healthy controls after the COVID-19 outbreak peak in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 154 COVID-19 survivors and 194 healthy controls recruited through consecutive and convenience sampling methods, respectively. COVID-19 related stigma was measured by the Social Impact Scale (SIS). Stigma differences between the two groups were compared with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a generalized linear model (GLM) was used to identify independent correlates of COVID-19-related stigma in this study. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, COVID-19 survivors reported more overall stigma (F(1,347) = 60.82, p < 0.001), and stigma in domains of social rejection (F(1,347) = 56.54, p < 0.001), financial insecurity (F(1,347) = 19.96, p < 0.001), internalized shame (F(1,347) = 71.40, p < 0.001) and social isolation (F(1,347) = 34.73, p < 0.001).

Although cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been found in pets including dogs, cats, and ferrets, to date there is no strong evidence for pet-to-human transmission or sustained pet-to-pet transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Individual psychological pain is believed to be a contributing motivating factor. Therefore, establishing a psychometrically sound tool to adequately measure psychological pain is important. The Orbach and Mikulincer Mental Pain Scale (OMMP) has been proposed; however, previous psychometric analysis on the OMMP has not yielded a consistent scale structure, and the internal consistency of the subscales has not met recommended values. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the OMMP in a diverse sample. METHODS: A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the 9-factor, 44-item OMMP was conducted on the full sample (n = 1151). Because model fit indices were not met, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on a random subset of the data (n = 576) to identify a more parsimonious structure. The EFA structure was then tested in a covariance model in the remaining subset of participants (n = 575). Multigroup invariance testing was subsequently performed to examine psychometric properties of the refined scale. RESULTS: The CFA of the original 9-factor, 44-item OMMP did not meet recommended model fit recommendations. The EFA analysis results revealed a 3-factor, 9-item scale (i.e., OMMP-9). The covariance model of the OMMP-9 indicated further refinement was necessary.

RESULTS: Our results suggested that pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 can effectively activate dendritic cells (DCs) in the Peyers patches, up-regulate the expression of Bcl-6, and promote T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells differentiation, as well as enhance B lymphocyte proliferation and promote them differentiate into specific IgA-secreting plasma cells, secreting anti-E2 mucosal sIgA antibody with BVDV-neutralizing activity. Moreover, significant levels (p < 0.01) of BVDV-neutralizing antigen-specific serum antibodies were induced in the pPG-E2-ctxB/LC W56 group post-vaccination.

The Community Coalition Action Theory (CCAT) is a form of theories for the change across organizations. A community coalition is a structured arrangement where all members can work together on a common goal and objective. The current article focuses on applications of the CCAT to provide a framework for the development of activities and interventions related to confronting Covid-19. Forming a coalition is very significant and can increase the effectiveness of interventional programs. CCAT is one of the best practices that can be achieved through joint activities of multiple organizations that lead to improved health behaviors.","output":"Community Coalition Action Theory: Introducing an Interventional Application to Confronting Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Cancer and its treatment can lead to a variety of physical and emotional concerns impacting on those affected, including subclinical or clinical depression and anxiety, which in turn have a significant impact on wellbeing, quality of life and survival. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of yoga-based interventions on self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms in people with cancer in randomized controlled trials. METHOD Six databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Systematic review procedures were followed including a quality assessment. Meta-analysis of suitable studies was conducted. RESULTS 26 studies from our search criteria were eligible for inclusion for depressive and 16 for anxiety symptoms. Meta-analyses revealed evidence for significant medium effects of yoga on depression symptoms (N = 1,486, g = -0.419, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.558 to -0.281, p < 0.001) and anxiety (N = 977, g = -0.347, 95% CI = -0.473 to -0.221, p < 0.001) compared to controls. Subgroup analyses for depressive symptoms revealed significant effects for all analyses performed (type of cancer, type of control, treatment status, duration of intervention or frequency of yoga sessions), with effect sizes being comparable between subgroups. Similar findings were found for anxiety symptoms except for treatment status, where the only significant effect was found when yoga was delivered during active treatment. CONCLUSIONS This review provides evidence that in people with cancer, yoga-based interventions are associated with amelioration of depression and anxiety symptoms and therefore a promising therapeutic modality for their management. However, the potential for risk of bias together with control group design challenges means the results should be interpreted with caution.","output":"Yoga for depression and anxiety symptoms in people with cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Avian infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is an acute and highly contagious disease that is extremely harmful to the poultry industry throughout the world. The cross-using of different attenuated live vaccine strains has led to the occurrence of diverse IBV serotypes. In this study, we isolated an IBV strain from a chicken farm in southwest China and designated it CK/CH/SCMY/160315. Construction of a phylogenetic tree based on full S1 gene sequence analysis suggested that CK/CH/SCMY/160315 bears similarity to GI-28, and further comparison of S1 amino acid residues revealed that CK/CH/SCMY/160315 showed mutations and deletions in many key positions between LDT3-A and other GI-28 reference strains. Importantly, CK/CH/SCMY/160315 was identified as a novel recombinant virus derived from live attenuated vaccine strains H120 (GI-1), 4/91 (GI-13), LDT3-A (GI-28), and the field strain LJL/08-1 (GI-19), identifying at least 5 recombination sites in both structural and accessory genes. Pathogenicity analysis indicated that CK/CH/SCMY/160315 caused listlessness, sneezing, huddling, head shaking, and increased antibody levels in the inoculated chickens. To further describe pathogenicity of this novel strain, we assessed viral load in different tissues and conducted hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the trachea, lungs and kidneys. Our results provide evidence for the continuing evolution of IBV field strains via genetic recombination and mutation, leading to outbreaks in the vaccinated chicken populations in China.","output":"Genetic and pathogenic characterization of a novel recombinant avian infectious bronchitis virus derived from GI-1, GI-13, GI-28, and GI-19 strains in Southwestern China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk of acute respiratory tract infections is particularly pronounced in patients deficient in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). With respect to COVID-19, there are conflicting evidence on the association of 25(OH)D levels with disease severity. We undertook this study to evaluate the 25(OH)D status in COVID-19 patients admitted in Karachi, Pakistan, and associated vitamin D deficiency with primary outcomes of mortality, length of stay, intubation, and frequency of COVID-19 symptoms. A total of 91 patients were evaluated for 25(OH)D status during their COVID-19 disease course. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were classified as deficient (< 10 ng/mL), insufficient (10C30 ng/mL), or sufficient (> 30 ng/mL). The study population comprised 68.1% males (N = 62). The mean age was 52.6  15.7 years. Vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR: 3.20; P = 0.048), invasive ventilation (RR: 2.78; P = 0.043), persistent pulmonary infiltrates (RR: 7.58; P < 0.001), and death (RR: 2.98; P < 0.001) on univariate Cox regression. On multivariate Cox regression, only death (RR: 2.13; P = 0.046) and persistent pulmonary infiltrates (RR: 6.78; P = 0.009) remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors.

It often occurs in developing countries and its pathogenesis is not clearly understood. RHD can be controlled with prophylaxis that requires patients to visit healthcare facility regularly. However, the current pandemic condition is a challenge for patients to receive routine treatment and evaluation. CASE SUMMARY: A 17-years-old girl comes to emergency room with complaints of shortness of breath with mark limitation of physical activity 3 days prior to admission. The patient also complaint with joint pain and leg swelling. She was diagnosed Rheumatic Heart Disease and received prophylactic penicillin injections every month. However, since the pandemic, She do vice versa. In physical examination was found pansystolic murmur on aortic valve and bilateral lower extremity edema. Echocardiography showed moderate mitral regurgitation and mild aortic regurgitation. This patient was hospitalized and treated with benzathine penicillin G, prednisone, aspirin, furosemide and captopril. DISCUSSION: Management of ARF includes eradication cause of infection, treat complications, and secondary prevention. Administration of secondary prophylaxis is useful for reduce new bacterial strains that can cause recurrent acute or chronic attacks. First line of secondary prophylaxis for ARF is intramuscular benzathine penicillin G that given per month. In this current pandemic conditions, patients are expected to continue prophylaxis therapy and follow up the disease with using pandemic health protocols.","output":"C86.

Traditional medicines based mostly on plants are still the only therapeutic possibility in many developing countries, but even in the richest ones, herbal formulation currently receives increased attention. Plants are natural laboratories whose complex secondary metabolism produces a wealth of chemical compounds, leading to drug discovery C 25% of widespread use drugs are indeed of plant origin. Their therapeutic potential is even bigger: although many plant-based compounds show inhibitory effects against a myriad of pathogens, few reach the stage of clinical trials. Their mechanism of action is often unknown, yet traditional plant-based remedies have the advantage of a long-term experience in their use, usually of hundreds to thousands of years, and thus a precious experience on their safety and effects. Here I am providing a non-systematic historical-botanical review of some of the most devastating pandemics that humanity has faced, with a focus on plant therapeutic uses. I will revisit the Middle Ages black death, in which a plant-based lotion (the four thieves vinegar) showed some effectiveness; the smallpox, a viral disease that lead to the discovery of vaccination but for which the native Americans had a plant ally, an interesting carnivorous plant species; tuberculosis and the use of garlic; the Spanish flu and the widespread recommendation of eating onions, among other plant-based treatments; and malaria, whose first effective treatment, quinine, came from the bark of a Peruvian tree, properties already known by the Quechua people. Synthetic analogues of quinine such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are now being revisited for the treatment of COVID19 symptoms, as they are artemisinin and derivatives, other plant-based compounds effective against malaria. Finally, I will give some hints on another facet of plants to aid us in the prevention of infectious diseases: the production of biotechnological plant-based vaccines. Altogether, my aim is to stress the significant role of plants in global health (past, present and future) and the need of enhancing and protecting the botanical knowledge, from systematics to conservation, from ecology to ethnobotany.","output":"Pandemics and Traditional Plant-Based Remedies.

Drawing on extensive cross-national data and theoretical and empirical analysis, this book provides a timely and broad-ranging assessment of gender and judging in African judiciaries. Employing different theoretical approaches, the book investigates how women have fared within domestic African judiciaries as both actors and litigants. It explores how women negotiate multiple hierarchies to access the judiciary, and how gender-related issues are handled in courts. The chapters in the book provide policy, theoretical and practical prescriptions to the challenges identified, and offer recommendations for the future directions of gender and judging in the post-COVID-19 era, including the role of technology, artificial intelligence, social media, and institutional transformations that can help promote women's rights. Bringing together specific cases from Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia, Tanzania, and South Africa and regional bodies such as ECOWAS and the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, and covering a broad range of thematic reflections, this book will be of interest to scholars, students, and practitioners of African law, judicial politics, judicial training, and gender studies.

For the first problem increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity (left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve ODC) is of advantage, for the 2nd, however, the contrary is the case. Indeed a right shift of the ODC has been found in former studies for anemia caused by reduced cell production or hemolysis. This resulted from increased 2,3-biphosphglycerate (2,3-BPG) concentration. In 3 investigations in COVID-19, however, no change of hemoglobin affinity was detected in spite of probably high [2,3-BPG]. The most plausible cause for this finding is formation of methemoglobin, which increases the oxygen affinity and thus apparently compensates for the 2,3-BPG effect. But this \\"useful effect\\" is cancelled by the concomitant reduction of functional hemoglobin. In the largest study on COVID-19 even a clear left shift of the ODC was detected when calculated from measurements in fresh blood rather than after equilibration with gases outside the body. This additional \\"in vivo\\" left shift possibly results from various factors (e. g. concentration changes of Cl-, 2,3-BPG, ATP, lactate, nitrocompounds, glutathione, glutamate, because of time delay between blood sampling and end of equilibration, or enlarged distribution space including interstitial fluid and is useful for O2 uptake in the lungs.

This review aimed to identify HRH interventions to support lay and/or skilled personnel to improve SRMNH care quality along the continuum in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs). METHODS A structured search of CINAHL, Cochrane Library/trials, EMBASE, PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and HRH Global Resource Centre databases was undertaken, guided by the PRISMA framework. The inclusion criteria sought to identify papers with a focus on 1. HRH management, leadership, partnership, finance, education, and/or policy interventions; 2. HRH interventions' impact on two or more quality SRMNH care packages across the continuum from preconception to pregnancy, intrapartum and postnatal care; 3. Skilled and/or lay personnel; and 4. Reported primary research in English from LLMICs. A deductive qualitative content analysis was employed using the World Health Organization-HRH action framework. RESULTS Out of identified 2157 studies, 24 intervention studies were included in the review. Studies where  4 HRH interventions had been combined to target various healthcare system components, were more effective than those implementing  3 HRH interventions. In primary care, HRH interventions involving skilled and lay personnel were more productive than those involving either skilled or lay personnel alone. Results-based financing (RBF) and its policy improved the quality of targeted maternity services but had no impact on client satisfaction. Local budgeting, administration, and policy to deliver financial incentives to health workers and improve operational activities were more efficacious than donor-driven initiatives. Community-based recruitment, training, deployment, empowerment, supportive supervision, access to m-Health technology, and modest financial and non-financial incentives for community health workers (CHWs) improved the quality of care continuum. Skills-based, regular, short, focused, onsite, and clinical simulation, and/or mobile phone-assisted in-service training of skilled personnel were more productive than knowledge-based, irregular, and donor-funded training. Facility-based maternal and perinatal death reviews, coupled with training and certification of skilled personnel, positively affected SRMNH care quality across the continuum. Preconception care, an essential component of the SRMNH care continuum, lacks studies and services in LLMICs. CONCLUSIONS We recommend maternal and perinatal death audits in all health facilities; respectful, woman-centered care as a critical criterion of RBF initiatives; local administration of health worker allowances and incentives; and integration of CHWs into the healthcare system. There is an urgent need to include preconception care in the SRMNH care continuum and studies in LLMICs.","output":"How can human resources for health interventions contribute to sexual, reproductive, maternal, and newborn healthcare quality across the continuum in low- and lower-middle-income countries?

However, the higher granularity and resolution of individual-based epidemic models comes with the cost of increased computational complexities, which result in difficulty in formulating individual-based epidemic models with mathematics. Furthermore, it requires great effort to understand and reproduce existing individual-based epidemic models presented by previous researchers. We proposed a mathematical formulation of heterogeneous individual-based epidemic models using matrices. Matrices and vectors were applied to represent individual attributes and behaviors. We derived analytical results from the matrix-based formulations of individual epidemic models, and then designed algorithms to force the computation of matrix-based individual epidemic models.

In order to act appropriately in their environment, cells are dependent on the transduction of the incoming signal through tightly regulated and interconnected signaling pathways to the cell nucleus. In particular, cells implicated in the immune system greatly depend on such systems to respond in a flexible and dynamic manner to environmental challenges. One major group of intracellular proteins that are involved in these signaling pathways are adaptor proteins. Although adaptor proteins are essential for normal immune cell operation, the functional role of this group of signaling proteins remains to be fully appreciated. So far, research on adaptor proteins has revealed their unique potential in building transient complexes in a reversible, dynamic, and inducible manner. In this review, we explore the roles of adaptor proteins - in space and time of intracellular signaling - and their associations with human disease. Examples of adaptor proteins expressed in hematopoietic cells highlight their crucial role in the immune system.

Global drug discovery campaigns have successfully developed several vaccines to reduce the number of infections by the virus. However, finding a small molecule pharmaceutical that is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 remains a challenge. Natural products are the origin of many currently used pharmaceuticals and, for this reason, a library of in-house fungal extracts were screened to assess their potential to inhibit the main viral protease M(pro) in vitro. The extract of Penicillium citrinum, TDPEF34, showed potential inhibition and was further analysed to identify potential M(pro) inhibitors. Following bio-guided isolation, a series of benzodiazepine alkaloids cyclopenins with good-to-moderate activity against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) were identified. The mode of enzyme inhibition of these compounds was predicted by docking and molecular dynamic simulation. Compounds 1 (isolated as two conformers of S- and R-isomers), 2, and 4 were found to have promising in vitro inhibitory activity towards M(pro), with an IC(50) values range of 0.36C0.89 M comparable to the positive control GC376.

Poor mental health is the most common reason for NHS staff sickness absences, usually accounting for 25% of all reported sick leave. At a time when the NHS most needs an available and efficient workforce, government and NHS employers lack the necessary evidence to inform decisions about how best to support the mental health needs of its staff. In this report, we share our experience and the initial figures from a newly developed multidisciplinary assessment and treatment service for NHS staff. Method The Staff Mental Health Service (SMHS) at the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) launched in September 2020. The SMHS is commissioned by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough sustainability and transformation partnership and is accessible to the 25,513 staff based at five NHS trusts within the region. The service received 235 referrals within 5 months of the launch. All patients had a first clinical contact within three working days and more than 80% had their initial assessment within two weeks. The SMHS clinical team is comprised of consultant psychiatrists, senior clinical psychologists, specialist mental health nurses, and an occupational health nurse set to provide rapid access, confidential, evidence-based treatments for the NHS staff. As part of service evaluation within CPFT, we collected routine screening data (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Posttraumatic Symptom Check List C 6 (PCL-6)) from patients completing the initial assessment (n = 130). Result According to the initial figures (n = 130) from a diverse group of healthcare staff, on average the patients presented with moderate level of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9: 16.22  5.94). Anxiety levels were in moderate to severe range (GAD-7: 13.45  4.70). Average score of PCL-6 checklist for traumatic stress symptoms was higher than the established cut-off (>14): 19.43  5.65. Conclusion The Staff Mental Health Service offers an innovative, multi-disciplinary rapid assessment and treatment clinic for NHS staff. The demand for the service has been immense, reaching double the number of predicted referrals.

METHODS A Literature search was conducted using PubMed keywords relevant to corneal transplantation, graft rejection, and immunization to find relevant publications through July 2021. Nine studies were included in this review. Data including patient demographics, type of transplant, chronology of disease, type of immunization, treatment, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Twenty-three cases of corneal graft rejection associated temporally with immunizations have been described in the literature. Most of these patients were female, and most commonly had received the influenza vaccine before the rejection episode. Most episodes resulted in graft preservation with intensive corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS Immunization-associated corneal graft rejection is a rare but likely underreported phenomenon. Patients and surgeons should be aware of this possible risk, although the evidence is inconclusive. Conclusions are limited because of the small sample size and the retrospective nature of all existing literature on this subject. Surgeons should be encouraged to document and report these episodes.","output":"Immunization-Associated Corneal Transplantation Rejection: A Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a decade, Feeding America's Map the Meal Gap (MMG) has provided sub-state-level estimates of food insecurity for both the full-population and for children.

This paper reviews two nonlinear, non-Gaussian extensions of the Ensemble Kalman Filter: Gaussian anamorphosis (GA) methods and two-step updates, of which the rank histogram filter (RHF) is a prototypical example. GA-EnKF methods apply univariate transforms to the state and observation variables to make their distribution more Gaussian before applying an EnKF. The two-step methods use a scalar Bayesian update for the first step, followed by linear regression for the second step. The connection of the two-step framework to the full Bayesian problem is made, which opens the door to more advanced two-step methods in the full Bayesian setting. A new method for the first part of the two-step framework is proposed, with a similar form to the RHF but a different motivation, called the improved RHF (iRHF). A suite of experiments with the Lorenz-96 model demonstrate situations where the GA-EnKF methods are similar to EnKF, and where they outperform EnKF. The experiments also strongly support the accuracy of the RHF and iRHF filters for nonlinear and non-Gaussian observations; these methods uniformly beat the EnKF and GA-EnKF methods in the experiments reported here.

METHOD: We propose to characterize the neurobehavioral phenomenology associated with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in a large, multinational, longitudinal cohort of post COVID\\\\19 infection patients following three sampling strategies: 1) Opportunity sample of patients discharged after hospital admission for COVID\\\\19 related symptoms. 2) A stratified random sample from COVID\\\\19 testing registries (including asymptomatic and negative participants). 3) Ascertaining COVID\\\\19 exposure (antibody) status in ongoing longitudinal, community\\\\based cohort studies that are already collecting biosamples, cognitive, behavioral and neuroimaging data. We will obtain core data within 6 months of discharge or testing. Core characterization will include interviews with the Schedules of Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), neurological exams, emotional reactivity scales and a neurocognitive assessment. Wherever feasible, we will also collect neuroimaging, biosamples and genetic data. Longitudinal follow up will be conducted at 9 and 18 months of the initial evaluation. An mHealth keeping\\\\in\\\\touch process will be set up to minimize attrition rates. The population cohorts provide a large, unbiased, normative and validation sample, albeit with more heterogenous outcome ascertainment.

COVID-19 incidence in patients and health professionals working in the general surgery department during these periods was questioned. RESULTS: Demographic data were similar between the two time periods. The number of patients who underwent surgery in the pandemic group (n = 103) was lower than the control group (n = 252). There was a 59.1% reduction in emergency surgeries. The biggest decreases were the admissions of incarcerated hernia, uncomplicated appendicitis and acute cholecystitis (92%, 81.3%, 47.3%, respectively). During the pandemic, an increase was of patient rates who underwent surgery for complicated appendicitis and AMIO (p = 0.001, p = 0.019, respectively).

The currently most widely used device for MBM is the Duette device. Recently, the Captivator EMR device has come available which might have practical advantages over the Duette device. METHODS Phase I was a randomized pre-esophagectomy trial with a non-inferiority design aiming to compare EMR specimens obtained with the Captivator and the Duette device. PRIMARY OUTCOME max diameter of the EMR specimens, secondary outcomes: min diameter, max thickness of the EMR specimens and resected submucosal stroma. Phase II were clinical pilot cases aiming to evaluate the feasibility of EMR using the Captivator device. Primary outcome was the successful EMR rate and secondary outcomes included procedure time and adverse events. RESULTS Phase I: 24 EMR specimens (12 pairs) were obtained from six patients. The median max diameter of EMR specimens obtained with the Captivator device was 16 mm [IQR 12-21] versus 18 mm [IQR 13-23] for the Duette device. Non-inferiority of the max diameter of the Captivator specimens could not be demonstrated (median difference 1 mm, 95% CI - 3.26 to + 5.26). However, when using paired analysis, no significant difference was found (p 0.573). In addition, no statistically significant differences were found in the min diameter, max thickness of EMR specimens, and max thickness of resected submucosal stroma.

We argue that Quebec's immigration partisan space is organised by a liberal-restrictive immigration policy continuum and a jurisdictional axis. Mapping provincial political parties' positions, we document a stable clustering towards liberal policy positions but a clear cleavage on the jurisdictional axis. We show that the emergence in 2012 of a highly moderate centre right party-the Coalition Avenir Qubec-broke with these established positions and drove a politicisation of the issue.

During the study period, the country underwent phase 3 and phase 4 of the Movement Control Order (MCO), Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO), and Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO). Psychological distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a 14-item self-assessment scale for measuring distress (total HADS score; HADS-T) with two subscales, namely, anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Perceived threat of infection was measured based on the health belief model. RESULTS: From a total of 631 responses received, the proportion of participants with anxiety and depression symptoms (above threshold score of 8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) was 29.0 and 20.9%, respectively. Psychological distress (HADS-T > 16) was reported in 22.3% of the respondents. A total of 16.5% had combined anxiety and depression symptoms. The highest HADS-A (6.10; 95% CI 5.64-6.56), HADS-D (5.61; 95% CI 5.14-6.08), and HADS-T (11.71; 95% CI 10.84-12.58) scores were reported among respondents during phase 4 of the MCO.

Herein we tested the effects of an indoor exercise, Qigong, on neurocognitive functioning as well as its potential neuro-immune pathway. METHODS: We conducted a 12-week randomized active-controlled trial with two study arms in cognitively healthy older people. We applied Wu Xing Ping Heng Gong (Qigong), which was designed by an experienced Daoist Qigong master, to the experimental group, whereas we applied the physical stretching exercise to the control group. The Qigong exercise consisted of a range of movements involving the stretching of arms and legs, the turning of the torso, and relaxing, which would follow the fundamental principles of Daoism and traditional Chinese medicine (e.g., Qi). We measured aging-sensitive neurocognitive abilities, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and brain structural volumes in the experimental (Qigong, n = 22) and control groups (stretching, n = 26) before and after the 12-week training. RESULTS: We observed that Qigong caused significant improvement in processing speed (t (46) = 2.03, p = 0.048) and sustained attention (t (46) = -2.34, p = 0.023), increased hippocampal volume (t (41) = 3.94, p < 0.001), and reduced peripheral IL-6 levels (t (46) = -3.17, p = 0.003). Moreover, following Qigong training, greater reduction of peripheral IL-6 levels was associated with a greater increase of processing speed performance (bootstrapping CI: [0.16, 3.30]) and a more significant training-induced effect of hippocampal volume on the improvement in sustained attention (bootstrapping CI: [-0.35, -0.004]).

Source decontamination and remediation are often required after larger elemental mercury exposures, but the details of these processes are infrequently reported. In the case described herein, a 64-year-old woman and her husband were exposed to elemental mercury in their home after the husband purchased it online for the purpose of recreational barometer calibration. After the mercury reportedly spilled during the calibration process, a vacuum cleaner was used to decontaminate the affected surface; this led to extensive mercury contamination of the home. The couple was relocated from the home while remediation occurred over the course of several weeks. Vacuum cleaning of an elemental mercury spill can lead to extensive volatilization and recirculation of mercury vapor. For smaller mercury spills, careful removal of visible mercury beads by using an eyedropper, cardboard, and masking tape is recommended. Larger spills require professional decontamination and remediation and may necessitate involvement of governmental resources. Vacuum cleaning should not be used as an initial method of decontamination after elemental mercury exposure. Careful attention to source decontamination can reduce the emotional and financial costs associated with extensive remediation after elemental mercury exposure.","output":"Effective Decontamination and Remediation After Elemental Mercury Exposure: A Case Report in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the study was to investigate the opportunities and challenges of introducing blended learning in the education sector in South Africa post the COVID-19 disturbances. The research applied a literature review approach using unobtrusive research methods like conceptual and documentary analysis of authoritative documents. The study discovered that the COVID-19 pandemic created opportunities for the introduction of blended learning postCOVID-19 which can help to expand access to education in South Africa where access was limited by space, especially at the tertiary level. However, the study discovered that introducing blended learning is associated with challenges related to high levels of inequality, massive digital divide, resource constraints and skills shortages. Therefore, the study recommends that for blended learning to be successful it is important to ensure that there is a policy platform for addressing challenges related to inequality, skills deficit, and the massive digital divide. This means that policies that are geared towards addressing all the challenges above should be prioritized if blended learning is to be effective in South Africa.","output":"The Fourth Industrial Revolution and COVID-19 Pandemic in South Africa: The Opportunities and Challenges of Introducing Blended Learning in Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To explore the value, and influencing factors, of D-dimer on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. A total of 1,114 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to three designated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020, to March 24, 2020, were included in this study. We examined the relationship between peripheral blood levels of D-dimer, and clinical classification and prognosis, as well as its related influencing factors. D-dimer levels were found to be related to the clinical classification and the prognosis of clinical outcome. D-dimer levels were more likely to be abnormal in severely and critically ill patients compared with mild and ordinary cases, while D-dimer levels of patients who had died were significantly higher than those of surviving patients according to the results of the first and last lab tests. The results from ROC analyses for mortality risk showed that the AUCs of D-dimer were 0.909, YI was 0.765 at the last lab test, and a D-dimer value of 2.025 mg/L was regarded to be the optimal probability cutoff for a prognosis of death. In addition, we found that patients with advanced age, male gender, dyspnea symptoms, and some underlying diseases have a higher D-dimer value (p < 0.05). In short, D-dimer is related to the clinical classification and can be used to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

Evidence suggests that a rare population of cells within a tumor, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), exhibit stemness and phenotypic plasticity properties that are primarily responsible for resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, metastasis, cancer development, and tumor relapse. Different therapeutic approaches that target CSCs have been developed for tumor eradication. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In this review, we first provide an overview of different viewpoints about the origin of CSCs. Particular attention has been paid to views believe that CSCs are probably appeared through dysregulation of very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) which reside in various tissues as the main candidate for tissue-specific stem cells. The expression of pluripotency markers in these two types of cells can strengthen the validity of this theory. In this regard, we discuss the common properties of CSCs and PSCs, and highlight the potential of PSCs in cancer studies, therapeutic applications, as well as educating the immune system against CSCs. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the resemblance of CSCs to PSCs can provide an appropriate source of CSC-specific antigens through cultivation of PSCs which brings to light promising ideas for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine development.

We also examined other factors which might have had an influence on hypochondria and nosophobia attitudes among students. Methods: The study was conducted in two groups of students: 313 medical students at the Medical University of Silesia and 293 students at non-medical universities in Katowice, Poland. The study used the medical student syndrome self-explanatory questionnaire constructed for the study, taking into account the specificity of the group and the research problem.

The current mainstays of treatment are vitrectomy irrespective of the presenting vision, intravitreal antifungal agents, and systemic therapy; additionally, the patients could require prolonged treatment with repeat vitreous surgeries and intravitreal injections. Difficulty in clinical diagnosis, delay in microbiological culture, and limited options of antifungal drugs make the treatment more difficult and less rewarding. Three common fungi causing endophthalmitis are Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Candida. The former two are molds, often identified in exogenous endophthalmitis, postoperative and traumatic; the latter is yeast and is more often identified in endogenous endophthalmitis. A faster diagnosis with newer molecular microbiological technologies might help institute treatment earlier than it is currently possible.

We encountered a patient with COVID-19 who developed iliopsoas hematoma (IPH) that was likely caused by prophylactic anticoagulation against VTE; we report the case here because IPH is an important risk in rehabilitation treatment. CASE: The patient was a 73-year-old man with severe COVID-19 who received anticoagulation therapy from the time of admission (day 0). On day 22, decreased hemoglobin levels, muscle weakness in the left lower extremity, and pain on passive movement of the left hip joint were noted. On day 29, computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed a mass lesion suspicious of a hematoma in the left iliopsoas muscle. On day 36, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out to re-evaluate the mass lesion and revealed a multicystic lesion that could also have been an abscess. CT-guided puncture drainage was performed, but no pus-like material was collected; this finding led to a diagnosis of IPH. Subsequent exercise loads were gradually increased while the status of the hematoma was assessed. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of IPH in COVID-19 patients has been reported to be 7.6 cases per 1000 admissions, and the use of anticoagulation is likely to increase the risk of IPH. Because rehabilitative interventions can lead to the discovery or aggravation of IPH, the possibility of IPH should be kept in mind when providing rehabilitation treatment for COVID-19 patients.","output":"A Case of Iliopsoas Hematoma Caused by Prophylactic Anticoagulation against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air quality improvements pollution changes due to COVID-19 restrictions have been reported for many urban developments and large metropolitan areas, but the respective impacts at rural and remote zones are less frequently analysed.

Fatigue has been suggested to be primary, part of the neurological disease; it can also be secondary to other diseases outside the CNS or exist as a separate comorbidity. The only forms of measurement currently available are through subjective standardized questionnaires, which are not able to identify primary MS-related fatigue. Therefore, there is a need for objective biomarkers of fatigue in MS. This study explored the viability of 17 possible biomarkers of primary fatigue in MS. Our chosen biomarker panel represents the function and health of different parts of the CNS. METHODS: We evaluated 31 MS patients and 17 healthy controls using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). We assessed clinical parameters and collected CSF from all participants to analyze 17 biomarkers, some of which in multiple targeted sequences, reflecting structural and functional changes in the brain. Based on FSS scores, MS was divided into MS-Fatigue (MS-F, FSS  4) and MS-NoFatigue (MS-NoF, FSS < 4). RESULTS: MS-F had significantly lower levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) peptides than MS-NoF (p = 0.005, p = 0.011). The only biomarker correlating with FSS in any group was APP in MS (r = -0.47, -0.52; p = 0.007, 0.002). APP did not correlate with any clinical parameter in MS but correlated with multiple markers. In MS, FSS correlated with the ISI and months since diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although the mechanisms remain unknown, altered APP metabolism in MS seems to be associated with fatigue.

An online survey of the impact of the pandemic on clinical investigators was performed. During lock-down periods hospital sites closed to monitoring visits and remote visits were not always possible due to paper- based health information systems. Overall accrual to academic cancer clinical trials decreased by 49%. Results: In the 9 months after the pandemic was declared clinical trial accrual fell by 54%, radiotherapy trial accrual by 90% and translational studies by 36%. Staff reassignment occurred in 60% of units. Monitoring visits by Clinical Research Associates was reduced by 42% and remote monitoring rose from 5% to 20% of monitoring visits.

This report aimed to assess psychiatric comorbidities in COVID-19 patients by utilizing telepsychiatry. Methods: COVID-19 patients admitted in Fasa University Hospital and nonhospitalized outpatients of Fasa city were interviewed by a psychiatrist through video chat for a 1-month period (March-April, 2020). Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), and Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS 14) questionnaires were administered for all patients. Each patient's mental status was recorded, and if any psychiatric problem was diagnosed, supportive psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and follow-up visits based on the patient's condition were started. Result: From a total of 82 COVID-19 patients who entered the study, 32 (39.03%) and 50 (60.97%) subjects were inpatients and outpatients, respectively. Moreover, 32 (39.03%) subjects were male and 50 (60.97%) were female. Insomnia seen in 24 (29.3%) patients and adjustment disorder in 13 (15.9%) patients were the most common psychiatric disorders among a total of 33 (40.2%) patients suffering from mental illness. Female and hospitalized patients presented significantly more frequent comorbidities than males and outpatients. Conclusions: Psychiatric disorders were significantly more common in patients with hospital admission than those without and more frequent in female versus male subjects. There were no significant differences between male and female subjects with and without admission according to the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PSS-14 scores. It was concluded that telepsychiatry in the early stages of mental problems during a catastrophic event like the coronavirus pandemic, can be an efficient instrument for the screening of psychosomatic comorbidities, so that pharmacological treatment (considering possible drug interactions with COVID-19 medications) and psychotherapeutic intervention can be optimized by psychiatrists.","output":"A Report of the Telepsychiatric Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The green synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles is presented as an excellent sustainable alternative for achieving nanostructures, with potential applications.

However, the characteristics of their residential built environments differ in terms of regional, social, cultural, and technological aspects. These differences should impact the students' performance and satisfaction which needs to be measured and studied. The present study aims to identify the effect of the residential built environment on students' satisfaction and academic performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was conducted in two countries, Kazakhstan (KZ) and Norway (NO), using a comprehensive online survey to gather data. An empirical assessment based on the structural equation model was employed to identify links between health, safety, and comfort of students' facilities and academic performance and satisfaction. We conclude that the built environment affects both satisfaction for remote education and their learning performance. Significant differences in readiness for remote education have been observed between urban and non-urban living areas: (1) The role of health-and-safety convenience seems to increase with the urbanization level of the respondents living spaces;(2) in contrast, for non-urban residents, the provision of comfort facilities is dominant. In the meantime, an analysis by regions revealed that health-and-safety-related facilities in residences are more critical for remote education in Central Asia (KZ). In contrast, the comfort features of residences being more important for the students studying remotely in Northern Europe (NO).

METHODS: Review of the current state of knowledge regarding the viral etiology of COVID-19, mechanisms of injury by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effect of individual DMTs on the risk of infection and COVID-19 disease expression. RESULTS: Although data are limited, MS DMTs do not obviously increase the risk of acquiring symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The severe morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be largely the consequence of an overly robust immune response rather than the consequence of unchecked viral replication. The effects of specific MS DMTs on the immune response that may increase the risk of impaired viral clearance and their potential counterbalancing beneficial effects on the development of COVID-19Cassociated acute respiratory distress syndrome are reviewed. CONCLUSION: Although there is currently insufficient real-world experience to definitively answer the question of the effect of a specific MS DMT on COVID-19, registries presently in nascent form should provide these answers. This review provides an approach to addressing these concerns while the data are being accumulated.

In medical applications, curating such datasets is not a favourable option because acquiring a large number of annotated samples from experts is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, numerous methods have been proposed in the literature for learning with limited annotated examples. Unfortunately, the proposed approaches in the literature have not yet yielded significant gains over random data augmentation for image segmentation, where random augmentations themselves do not yield high accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel task-driven data augmentation method for learning with limited labeled data where the synthetic data generator, is optimized for the segmentation task. The generator of the proposed method models intensity and shape variations using two sets of transformations, as additive intensity transformations and deformation fields. Both transformations are optimized using labeled as well as unlabeled examples in a semi-supervised framework. Our experiments on three medical datasets, namely cardiac, prostate and pancreas, show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms standard augmentation and semi-supervised approaches for image segmentation in the limited annotation setting.

Some potentially important host factors for the antiviral response, whose functions remain largely unexplored, are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here we systematically inferred the regulatory functions of host lncRNAs in response to influenza A virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) based on their similarity in expression with genes of known function. We performed total RNA-Seq on viral-infected lungs from eight mouse strains, yielding a large data set of transcriptional responses. Overall 5,329 lncRNAs were differentially expressed after infection. Most of the lncRNAs were co-expressed with coding genes in modules enriched in genes associated with lung homeostasis pathways or immune response processes. Each lncRNA was further individually annotated using a rank-based method, enabling us to associate 5,295 lncRNAs to at least one gene set and to predict their potential cis effects. We validated the lncRNAs predicted to be interferon-stimulated by profiling mouse responses after interferon- treatment. Altogether, these results provide a broad categorization of potential lncRNA functions and identify subsets of lncRNAs with likely key roles in respiratory virus pathogenesis.

Households with a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed positive case and at least one child in the Netherlands were followed for 6 weeks. Naso (NP)- and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, oral fluid and feces specimens were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serum for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The dynamics of the presence of viral RNA and the serological response was modeled to determine the sampling time-frame and sample type with the highest sensitivity to confirm or reject a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between adults and children within a household was correlated with symptom severity of index cases. In children higher viral loads compared to adults were detected at symptom onset. Early in infection, higher viral loads were detected in NP and OP specimens, while RNA in especially feces were longer detectable. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies have a 90% probability of detection from 7 days (total Ig) and 18 days (IgG) since symptom onset. In conclusion this study has shown that on average, children carry higher loads of virus as compared to adults early after infection. For highest probability of detection in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics early in infection, RT-PCR on NP and OP specimens are more sensitive than on oral fluid and feces. For SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics late after infection, RT-PCR on feces specimens and serology are more valuable.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibody dynamics in a Dutch household study with dense sampling frame"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 and the pandemic that followed have given us a front-row seat to the debate over individual rights vs. public health.

One of the major challenges in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak is its asymptomatic infection and transmission, which are elusive and defenseless in most situations. The pathogenicity and virulence of asymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious. Based on the genotyping of 20656 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome isolates, we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to SARS-CoV-2 11083G>T mutation, i.e., leucine (L) to phenylalanine (F) substitution at the residue 37 (L37F) of nonstructure protein 6 (NSP6). By analyzing the distribution of 11083G>T in various countries, we unveil that 11083G>T may correlate with the hypotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we show a global decaying tendency of the 11083G>T mutation ratio indicating that 11083G>T hinders SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity. Sequence alignment found both NSP6 and residue 37 neighborhoods are relatively conservative over a few coronaviral species, indicating their importance in regulating host cell autophagy to undermine innate cellular defense against viral infection. Using machine learning and topological data analysis, we demonstrate that mutation L37F has made NSP6 energetically less stable. The rigidity and flexibility index and several network models suggest that mutation L37F may have compromised the NSP6 function, leading to a relatively weak SARS-CoV subtype. This assessment is a good agreement with our genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission across various countries and regions over the past few months.","output":"Decoding asymptomatic COVID-19 infection and transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coping theory shows that stressful life events are associated with individuals psychology/behaviors; meanwhile, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is known to have impacted individuals physical and mental health. Prior studies revealed that undergraduates have many sexual behavior and emotion disorders, which may be impacted during an isolation period, such as the one brought by COVID-19. However, few studies have explored the longitudinal associations between COVID-19-related stress and sexual compulsivity symptoms (SCS), and the mediating effect of emotions (i.e., depression and anxiety) on this relationship. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate these associations. METHODS: We employed a cross-lagged design (2020/2/12: Time 1, 3219 participants; 2020/6/6: Time 2, 2998 participants) and recruited Chinese undergraduates through an online system to respond to a survey. RESULTS: Our results showed that COVID-19-related stress at Time 1 directly influenced SCS at Time 1, and there was an indirect influence via depression and anxiety at Time 1. COVID-19-related stress at Time 1 positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and SCS at Time 2, and the first could directly and positively predict SCS at Time 2. Moreover, albeit depression at Time 2 was negatively linked to SCS at Time 2, anxiety at Time 2 enhanced the effect of COVID-19-related stress on SCS. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings extend the literature on SCS, showing that the higher the COVID-19-related stress, the higher the SCS, and the longer-lasting effect was associated with anxiety in undergraduates.

It is estimated that India would need to vaccinate over a billion people to achieve herd immunity. Even though the Indian Government focuses on improving and delivering its vaccination programme, significant challenges still exist. This paper aims to discuss current challenges to scale up India's vaccination campaign and addresses strategies for achieving this. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH The paper is based on a review of secondary sources, including journal articles from scholarly and grey literature and information available in the public domain. The search focused explicitly on the COVID-19 scenario, vaccination programme, public health management and systems leadership in the Indian health care system. FINDINGS The analysis revealed that various factors have disrupted India's vaccination campaign, including shortage of vaccine doses, mandatory prior online registration, lack of infrastructure, safety concerns for older people, untrained workforce and absence of a solid public health framework. Furthermore, India appears to have struggled to reduce tensions and instill trust in its ability to effectively manage the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination programme due to a lack of cooperation between union government, state governments and other stakeholders, namely, policymakers, hospitals, industry and community. ORIGINALITY/VALUE The findings indicate that scaling up India's anti-COVID vaccination programme would require system-level leadership strategies that work within the country's limited resources.

Eligible patients were 18 years old or older and had a histologically confirmed TGCT that was unresectable and symptomatic. Efficacy endpoints included the best overall response (complete or partial response) and the duration of response (DOR) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and the tumor volume score (TVS). The safety assessment included the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and hepatic laboratory abnormalities (aminotransferase elevations and mixed/cholestatic hepatotoxicity).

RESULTS One hundred thirty patients with TGCT received pexidartinib (median treatment duration, 19 months; range, 1 to 76+ months); 54 (42%) remained on treatment at the end of the analysis (26 months after initial data cut of March 2017). The RECIST overall response rate (ORR) was 60%; the TVS ORR was 65%. The median times to response were 3.4 (RECIST) and 2.8 months (TVS), with 48 of the responding patients (62%) achieving a RECIST partial response by 6 months and with 72 (92%) doing so by 18 months. The median DOR was reached for TVS (46.8 months). Reported TEAEs were mostly low-grade, with hair color changes being most frequent (75%). Most liver abnormalities (92%) were aminotransferase elevations; 4 patients (3%) experienced mixed/cholestatic hepatotoxicity (all within the first 2 months of treatment), which was reversible in all cases (recovery spanned 1-7 months).

Severe cases delay patient discharge, affect the patients quality of life after surgery, and are heavy burdens to society. In addition, as the population ages, surgery is increasingly used for older patients and those with higher prevalences of complications. This trend presents a huge challenge to the current healthcare system. Although studies on POCD are ongoing, the underlying pathogenesis is still unclear due to conflicting results and lack of evidence. According to existing studies, the occurrence and development of POCD are related to multiple factors. Among them, the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation in POCD has become a focus of research in recent years, and many clinical and preclinical studies have confirmed the correlation between neuroinflammation and POCD. In this article, we reviewed how central nervous system inflammation occurred, and how it could lead to POCD with changes in peripheral circulation and the pathological pathways between peripheral circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, we proposed some potential therapeutic targets, diagnosis and treatment strategies at the cellular and molecular levels, and clinical applications. The goal of this article was to provide a better perspective for understanding the occurrence of POCD, its development, and preventive strategies to help manage these vulnerable geriatric patients.","output":"Neuroinflammation as the Underlying Mechanism of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction and Therapeutic Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduccin.

Larvae of Aedes aegypti were screened with the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pandemic Response Box, an open-source compound library, using INVAPP, an invertebrate automated phenotyping platform suited to high-throughput chemical screening of larval motility.

We extended our investigation to adult mosquitoes and found that camptothecin increased lethality when delivered in a blood meal to A. aegypti adults at 100 M and 10 M, and completely blocked egg laying when fed at 100 M. Camptothecin and its derivatives are inhibitors of topoisomerase I, have known activity against several agricultural pests, and are also approved for the treatment of several cancers.

An estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was achieved by screening an unselected cohort of pregnant women. Of interest was the number of unreported cases. Methods Upon admission to hospital, patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 by a specific real-time PCR and antibodies determined by a specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum by ELISA. The SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was estimated using the ClopperCPearson exact method, the group comparison with Fischer?s exact test. Results From 6 April to 13 May 2020, 234 pregnant women were admitted to the Department of Obstetrics. A total of 225 (96.2%) SARS-CoV-2 PCRs were carried out and all remained negative. Specific IgG antibodies were detected in one (0.6%) of 180 (76.9%) antibody tests performed. The interval estimate of the period prevalence thus results in a 95% confidence interval between 0C1.7%. For 96 households with children, the period prevalence is 0C3.8%, which does not differ from the 0C4.8% for 76 households without children (p=1.00). Discussion This is the first report on the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence of an unselected sample of pregnant women in Germany. Antibody testing showed no evidence of the feared high number of unreported asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.

However, it has been hindered by limited access to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and testing infrastructure. In regions with limited testing capacity, routinely collected health data might be leveraged to identify geographical locales experiencing higher than expected rates of COVID-19-associated symptoms for more specific testing activities. METHODS: We developed syndromic surveillance tools to analyse aggregated health facility data on COVID-19-related indicators in seven low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Liberia. We used time series models to estimate the expected monthly counts and 95% prediction intervals based on 4 years of previous data. Here, we detail and provide resources for our data preparation procedures, modelling approach and data visualisation tools with application to Liberia. RESULTS: To demonstrate the utility of these methods, we present syndromic surveillance results for acute respiratory infections (ARI) at health facilities in Liberia during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (January through August 2020). For each month, we estimated the deviation between the expected and observed number of ARI cases for 325 health facilities and 15 counties to identify potential areas of SARS-CoV-2 circulation. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic surveillance can be used to monitor health facility catchment areas for spikes in specific symptoms which may indicate SARS-CoV-2 circulation. The developed methods coupled with the existing infrastructure for routine health data systems can be leveraged to monitor a variety of indicators and other infectious diseases with epidemic potential.","output":"Syndromic surveillance using monthly aggregate health systems information data: methods with application to COVID-19 in Liberia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that causes a highly contagious Corona Virus Disease (COVID19). Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S-protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently, COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences to explain these population-level differences. One of the key factors of entry of the virus in host cells presumably is because of differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that a higher expression of ACE2 is facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), with different frequencies in different populations. We suggest that high expression of ACE2 results in homo-dimerization, proving disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2; whereas, the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of the Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest that several key host genes, like SLC6A19, ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, might have a critical role. To conclude, understanding population specific differences in these genes may help in developing appropriate management strategies for COVID19 with better therapeutic interventions.","output":"ACE2 Homo-dimerization, Human Genomic variants and Interaction of Host Proteins Explain High Population Specific Differences in Outcomes of COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adaptation to acute hypoxia through cardiorespiratory responses is mediated by specialized cells in the carotid body and pulmonary vasculature to optimize systemic arterial oxygenation.

Secondary attack rates among household contacts are estimated to be five to ten times higher than among non-household contacts, but it is unclear which individuals are more prone to transmit infection within their households. METHODS: Using address matching, a cohort was assembled of all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 residing in private households in Ontario, Canada. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare characteristics of cases in households that experienced secondary transmission versus those that did not. Logistic regression models were fit to determine index case characteristics and neighbourhood characteristics associated with transmission. RESULTS: Between January and July, 2020, there were 26,714 cases of COVID-19 residing in 21,226 households. Longer testing delays (5 days versus 0 days OR=3.02, 95% CI: 2.53 - 3.60) and male gender (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.38) were associated with greater odds of household secondary transmission, while being a healthcare worker (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.62) was associated with lower odds of transmission. Neighbourhoods with larger average family size and a higher proportion of households with multiple persons per room were also associated with greater odds of transmission.

Severe illness requires intensive care facilities, which are limited in smaller, resource-constrained settings. CONTEXT: Maldives and Trinidad and Tobago are small island developing states with comparable climates. Similar to island nations in the Western Pacific Region, they are prone to natural disasters and so engage in planning and preparedness activities on an ongoing basis. This paper describes the initial measures taken by both countries during the first wave of COVID-19, from March to May 2020. ACTION: In both countries, multisectoral high-level leadership allowed for timely and decisive actions. Early school closures, early border closures and early lockdowns were enforced. Mandatory mask wearing and physical distancing were instituted. Cases and contacts were isolated in facilities away from public sector hospitals, and isolation was implemented at the governments expense. Volunteers were trained to manage dedicated hotlines. Additionally, the governments held daily press briefings. OUTCOME: During the first wave, Maldives contained its epidemic to one geographical cluster; Trinidad and Tobago successfully avoided community spread, thus averting an overwhelmed health system. DISCUSSION: Diligent contact tracing with quarantine implemented at the governments expense successfully minimized spread in both countries. Small countries need volunteers to help with activities such as contact tracing, and recruiting and training volunteers before a health emergency occurs is key. Lessons learned from the experience of Maldives and Trinidad and Tobago could serve as a model for other small island developing states, including those in the Western Pacific Region.","output":"Early COVID-19 response in two small island developing states: Maldives and Trinidad and Tobago"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global closure policy to limit the spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020 was based on public safety and health considerations.

In particular, we experiment with several models to identify (i) whether a tweet is traffic-related or not, and (ii) in the case that the tweet is traffic-related to identify more fine-grained information regarding the event (e.g., the type of the event, where the event happened). To do so, we frame (i) the problem of identifying whether a tweet is a traffic-related event or not as a text classification subtask, and (ii) the problem of identifying more fine-grained traffic-related information as a slot filling subtask, where fine-grained information (e.g., where an event has happened) is represented as a slot/entity of a particular type. We propose the use of several methods that process the two subtasks either separately or in a joint setting, and we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for solving the traffic event detection problem. Experimental results indicate that the proposed architectures achieve high performance scores (i.e., more than 95% in terms of F$_{1}$ score) on the constructed datasets for both of the subtasks (i.e., text classification and slot filling) even in a transfer learning scenario.

Aesthetic outcome is important and has long term implications for psychosocial wellbeing. The aesthetic goal of BCT is symmetry for which there is no gold-standard measure. Panel scoring is the most widely adopted assessment but has well-described limitations. This paper describes a model to objectively report aesthetic outcome using measures derived from 3-dimensional surface images (3D-SI). METHOD: Objective measures and panel assessment were undertaken independently for 3D-SI of women who underwent BCT 1C5 years previously. Univariate analysis was used to test for association between measures and panel score. A forward stepwise multiple linear regression model was fitted to identify 3D measurements that jointly predicted the mean panel score. The fitted model coefficients were used to predict mean panel scores for an independent validation set then compared to the mean observed panel score. RESULTS: Very good intra-panel reliability was observed for the training and validation sets (w = 0.87, w = 0.84). Six 3D-measures were used in the multivariate model. There was a good correlation between the predicted and mean observed panel score in the training (n = 190) and validation (n = 100) sets (r = 0.68, r = 0.65). The 3D model tended to predict scores towards the median. The model was calibrated which improved the distribution of predicted scores. CONCLUSION: A six-variable objective aesthetic outcome model for BCT has been described and validated.

The global COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique opportunity to characterize and compare health behaviors across multiple countries and to examine how these behaviors are shaped by the pandemic experience. Undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in universities in China, Ireland, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands and the United States (USA) were recruited into this cross-sectional study. Eligible students filled out an online survey comprised of validated tools for assessing sleep quality and duration, dietary risk, alcohol misuse and physical activity between late April and the end of May 2020. Health behaviors were fairly consistent across countries, and all countries reported poor sleep quality. However, during the survey period, the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the health behaviors of students in European countries and the USA more negatively than Asian countries, which could be attributed to the differences in pandemic time course and caseloads. Students who experienced a decline in sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic had higher dietary risk scores than students who did not experience a change in sleep quality (p = 0.001). Improved sleep quality was associated with less sitting time (p = 0.010). Addressing sleep issues among higher education students is a pressing concern, especially during stressful events.

Respondents were recruited by SurveyHealthcareGlobus. RESULTS: A total of 5953 adults across all 50 states completed the survey between May 8 and 20, 2020. Latent-class analysis supported a 4-class model. The largest class (36%) represented COVID-19 risk-minimizers, reluctant to accept any increases in COVID-19 risks. About 26% were waiters, strongly preferring to delay reopening nonessential businesses, independent of COVID-19 risk levels. Another 25% represented recovery-supporters, primarily concerned about time required for economic recovery. This group would accept COVID-19 risks as high as 16% (95% CI: 13%-19%) to shorten economic recovery from 3 to 2 years. The final openers class prioritized lifting social distancing restrictions, accepting of COVID-19 risks greater than 20% to open in May rather than July or October.

Hence we begin with pairwise alignment of multiple sequences and discuss the topological space induced by pairwise alignment of multiple sequences, since different optimization criteria may lead to different results. We discuss several optimization indices here: the sum of pairs (SP); Shannon entropy; similarity rate and the rate of virtual symbols. Based on this discussion, we present a new multiple sequence alignment based on SPA called super multiple sequence alignment (SMA).

We use a non-Markovian age-of-infection model that is capable of handling long and variable time delays without changing its model topology. Bayesian estimation of model parameters is carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This framework allows us to treat all available input information, including both the previously published parameters of the epidemic and available local data, in a uniform manner. To accurately model deaths as well as demand on the healthcare system, we calibrate our predictions to total and in-hospital deaths as well as hospital and ICU bed occupancy by COVID-19 patients. We apply this model not only to the state as a whole but also its sub-regions in order to account for the wide disparities in population size and density. Without prior information on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), the model independently reproduces a mitigation trend closely matching mobility data reported by Google and Unacast. Forward predictions of the model provide robust estimates of the peak position and severity and also enable forecasting the regional-dependent results of releasing Stay-at-Home orders.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. A total of 69 severely burned patients who met the inclusion criteria and were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University) from February to December, 2020 and their 69 family members were recruited into this study. According to the difference of visit model, 33 severely burned patients who were admitted into burn intensive care unit (BICU) from February to June, 2020 and received completely restricted visits according to the requirements for epidemic prevention and control and their corresponding 33 family members were included into conventional visit group; 36 severely burned patients who were admitted into BICU from July to December, 2020 and received the standard communication system-based continuous home remote visits and their 36 corresponding family members were recruited into remote visit group. The family members in conventional visit group could only communicate with the primary nurses by telephone, while the patients and family members in remote visit group could communicate with the primary nurses, responsible doctors, rehabilitation therapists, and nutrition therapists through WeChat video call. The survey results of general information questionnaire and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores of two groups of patients and their family members at BICU admission of patients, HAMA scores of the two groups of patients and their family members in the second week of BICU admission and at discharge from BICU of patients, the scores of the Visiting Effect Evaluation Scale of the two groups of patients and their family members and the scores of Chinese version of Critical Care Family Satisfaction Survey (C-CCFSS) of the two groups of family members at discharge from BICU, and the scores of Satisfaction Survey and Evaluation Scale During Hospitalization of patients within the first week after the discharge of patients from BICU were compared. Data were statistically analyzed with chi-square test, Fisher's exact probability test, and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: In remote visit group, there were 29 males and 7 females in patients, aged 48 (34, 53) years, and 15 males and 21 females in family members, aged 45 (30, 48) years. In conventional visit group, there were 24 males and 9 females in patients, aged 49 (38, 54) years, and 9 males and 24 females in family members, aged 44 (35, 48) years. At BICU admission of patients, the HAMA scores of the two groups of patients and family members were both similar (P>0.05). The total HAMA scores of patients and family members in remote visit group were significantly lower than those in conventional visit group in the second week when the patients were admitted to BICU (Z=-3.195, -3.018, P<0.01) and discharged from BICU (Z=-2.118, -2.380, P<0.05). At discharge from BICU of patients, the scores of each dimension in Visiting Effect Evaluation Scale of the patients in the two groups were similar (P>0.05); while scores of 3 dimensions including patient safety information, diagnosis and treatment quality information, and psychological support information in Visiting Effect Evaluation Scale of family members in remote visit group were significantly higher than those in conventional visit group (Z=-2.372, -2.209, -2.174, P<0.05), and only the scores of visit perception of family members were close to those in conventional visit group (P>0.05). At discharge from BICU of patients, the C-CCFSS scores of the family members in remote visit group was 99 (98, 108), which were significantly higher than 98 (97, 100) in conventional visit group (Z=-2.545, P<0.05).

Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors have become a mainstay of treatment for this disease. Currently, treatment options include three originator biologics with approvals for neovascular AMD (aflibercept, ranibizumab, and brolucizumab-dbll) and one biologic that is commonly used off-label for the condition (bevacizumab). In the USA, Medicare spending on these drugs consistently surpassed $4 billion per year between 2015 and 2019, driven by high prices and varying off-label use of bevacizumab, which is substantially cheaper than the other biologics used to treat neovascular AMD. In this article, we discuss how legal reform can improve market competition for biologic drugs, using AMD therapies as a case study. We chose this group of drugs for their significant contribution to Medicare spending, the price difference between approved therapies and intravitreal bevacizumab, and because there currently exists a large biosimilar pipeline with many drug candidates in the final stage of development. We propose mechanisms for anticipating and facilitating the market introduction of biosimilars, as well as changes to the pricing model in Medicare that can promote use of cost-effective therapies.

Little data exists on COVID-19 incidences and risk mitigation strategies in youth club sports. OBJECTIVE: To determine the reported incidence of COVID-19 cases among youth club sport athletes and the information sources used to develop COVID-19 risk mitigation procedures. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Online surveys. PATIENTS: Soccer and volleyball youth club directors. INTERVENTION: A survey was completed by directors of youth volleyball and soccer clubs across the country in October 2020. Surveys included self-reported date of re-initiation, number of players, player COVID-19 cases, sources of infection, COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and information sources for the development of COVID-19 mitigation strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total number of cases reported, number of players, and days since club re-initiation were used to calculate an incidence rate of cases per 100,000 player-days. To compare reported incidence rates between soccer and volleyball, a negative binomial model was developed to predict player cases with sport and state incidence as covariates and log(player-days) as an offset. Estimates were exponentiated to yield a reported incidence rate ratio (IRR) with Wald confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 205,136 athletes (soccer=165,580; volleyball=39,556) were represented by 437 clubs (soccer=159; volleyball=278). Club organizers reported 673 COVID-19 cases (soccer=322; volleyball=351), for a reported incidence rate of 2.8 cases per 100,000 player-days (soccer=1.7, volleyball=7.9). Volleyball had a significantly higher reported COVID-19 incidence rate compared to soccer (reported IRR = 3.06 [2.0-4.6], p<0.001). Out of 11 possible mitigation strategies, the median number of strategies used by all clubs was 7 with an interquartile range of 2.

This study was conducted to compare the outcome of these two treatments. METHODS Prospective study on consecutive cases of primary pterygium (February 2001 to March 2002) randomised into two adjuvant groups: (1) intraoperative 0.02% MMC for 5 minutes or (2) LCAU. Patients were followed for recurrence (defined as fibrovascular tissue invading the cornea >1.5mm) and complications for a period of one year. RESULTS 115 eyes in 114 patients who completed the study were randomised to receive MMC (n = 63) and LCAU (n = 52). There were 10 recurrences (15.9%) in the MMC group and only one recurrence (1.9%) in the LCAU group. There was a statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between the two groups (p = 0.04). There were a total of three conjunctival cysts, three symblephara, one granuloma, and one dellen. No other visually significant complications were encountered in either group. CONCLUSION Although LCAU resulted in better one year success rates, it is technically more difficult and inapplicable in cases with previous limbal disturbance. Simple excision followed by MMC or LCAU are both safe and acceptable adjuvants for pterygium excision.

SOURCE OF DATA: The PubMed, WHO COVID-19, and SciELO databases were searched on March 15, 2020, and on April 25, 2020, filtering for children (0C18 years) and humans. SYNTHESIS OF DATA: The tools used to mitigate the threat of a pandemic such as COVID-19 may very well threaten child growth and development. These tools  such as social restrictions, shutdowns, and school closures  contribute to stress in parents and children and can become risk factors that threaten child growth and development and may compromise the Sustainable Development Goals. The studies reviewed suggest that epidemics can lead to high levels of stress in parents and children, which begin with concerns about children becoming infected. These studies describe several potential mental and emotional consequences of epidemics such as COVID-19, H1N1, AIDS, and Ebola: severe anxiety or depression among parents and acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, and depression among children. These data can be related to adverse childhood experiences and elevated risk of toxic stress. The more adverse experiences, the greater the risk of developmental delays and health problems in adulthood, such as cognitive impairment, substance abuse, depression, and non-communicable diseases. CONCLUSION: Information about the impact of epidemics on parents and children is relevant to policy makers to aid them in developing strategies to help families cope with epidemic/pandemic-driven adversity and ensure their childrens healthy development.","output":"The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child growth and development: a systematic review()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization in 2016 recommended eight or more antenatal care (ANC) contacts for a positive pregnancy experience, however, it is unclear what impact the time spent during the first ANC contact and home visits can have on eight or more ANC contacts. OBJECTIVES: Our study investigated the relationship between time spent during the first ANC contact and eight or more ANC contacts, and between home visits and eight or more ANC contacts. We also assessed the prevalence of eight or more ANC contacts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 519 mothers with children 12 months old and below attending child welfare clinics in the Nabdam district in the Upper East Region, Ghana. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between time spent during the first ANC contact, home visits, and eight or more ANC contacts, while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: The proportion of mothers who attained eight or more ANC contacts during pregnancy was 31.2%. Spending 20 minutes or more during the first ANC contact was associated with 2.07 times the odds of having eight or more ANC contacts compared to spending less than 20 minutes [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.07, 95% CI: 1.18,3.63]. Mothers who received at least a home visit from skilled health professionals during pregnancy were 2.44 times more likely to have eight or more ANC contacts compared to mothers who were not visited (aOR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.51,3.94). CONCLUSION: Spending at least 20 minutes during the first ANC contact and home visits were positively associated with eight or more ANC contacts.

The tumor biomarkers of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), -fetoprotein (AFP), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were chosen as model targets. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with diameters of 70 nm were coated with the detection antibodies of the three targets. Quantum dot (QD) 525, QD 585, and QD 655 were modified with the capture antibodies of CEA, AFP, and PSA, respectively. Then, an immunocomplex containing one AuNP and one or several QDs was formed, whereas free and nonspecifically bound probes had either one AuNP or one QD. When observed with a transmission grating-based spectral microscope, the immunocomplexes had overlapping scattering and fluorescent spectral images and were therefore identified and quantified precisely. The biomarkers inside the immunocomplexes were recognized on the basis of the fluorescent first-order streaks of the QDs. Model biomarkers in buffer and in 12.6% blank plasma were quantified for validation. The limits of detection for CEA, PSA, and AFP in buffer were in dozens of femtomolar and were close to those in blank plasma.

This study examined the convergent validity of the electronic Frailty Index (eFI) with the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Method: The cross-sectional study recruited patients from three regional community nursing teams in the South East of England. The CFS was rated at recruitment, and the eFI was extracted from electronic health records (EHRs). A McNemar test of paired data was used to compare discordant pairs between the eFI and the CFS, and an exact McNemar Odds Ratio (OR) was calculated. Findings: Of 265 eligible patients consented, 150 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 85.6 years (SD = 7.8), and 78% were 80 years and older. Using the CFS, 68% were estimated to be moderate to severely frail, compared to 91% using the eFI. The eFI recorded a greater degree of frailty than the CFS (OR = 5.43, 95%CI 3.05 to 10.40; p < 0.001). This increased to 7.8 times more likely in men, and 9.5 times in those aged over 80 years.

Nanoluciferase (Nluc) insertion was used to compare the replication efficiencies of all constructs after electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA from the different clones. Deletion of C, E1, E2, or the complete structural protein genome region (C-ERNS-E1-E2) prevented the production of infectious progeny virus, whereas deletion of ERNS still allowed the generation of infectious particles. However, those &#916;ERNS viral particles were defective in virus assembly and/or egress and could not be further propagated for more than three additional passages in porcine SK-6 cells. These \\"defective-in-third-cycle\\" BuPV &#916;ERNS mutants were subsequently used to express the classical swine fever virus envelope protein E2, the N-terminal domain of the Schmallenberg virus Gc protein, and the receptor binding domain of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein. The constructs could be efficiently complemented and further passaged in SK-6 cells constitutively expressing the BuPV ERNS protein. Importantly, BuPVs are able to infect a wide variety of target cell lines, allowing expression in a very wide host spectrum. Therefore, we suggest that packaged BuPV &#916;ERNS replicon particles have potential as broad-spectrum viral vectors.IMPORTANCE The proteins NPRO and ERNS are unique for the genus Pestivirus, but only NPRO has been demonstrated to be nonessential for in vitro growth. While this was also speculated for ERNS, it has always been previously shown that pestivirus replicons with deletions of the structural proteins ERNS, E1, or E2 did not produce any infectious progeny virus in susceptible host cells. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that BuPV ERNS is dispensable for the generation of infectious virus particles but still important for efficient passaging. The ERNS-defective BuPV particles showed clearly limited growth in cell culture but were capable of several rounds of infection, expression of foreign genes, and highly efficient trans-complementation to rescue virus replicon particles (VRPs). The noncytopathic characteristics and the absence of preexisting immunity to BuPV in human populations and livestock also provide a significant benefit for a possible use, e.g., as a vector vaccine platform.","output":"Autonomously Replicating RNAs of Bungowannah Pestivirus: ERNS Is Not Essential for the Generation of Infectious Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of a novel LAMP device which is cheap, reusable, and can be produced in large amounts in a short period of time.

Traditional research has focused on singular dimensions of equity (e.g., wealth), and often lacks a comprehensive perspective. The goal of this study was to assess relationships among three domains of equity, health, wealth, and civic engagement, in a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents. METHODS: We developed a conceptual framework to guide our inquiry of equity across health, wealth, and civic engagement constructs to generate a broad but nuanced understanding of equity. Through Ipsos KnowledgePanel service, we conducted a cross-sectional, online survey between May 29CJune 20, 2020 designed to be representative of the adult U.S. population. Based on our conceptual framework, we assessed the population-weighted prevalence of health outcomes and behaviors, as well as measures of wealth and civic engagement. We linked individual-level data with population-level environmental and social context variables. Using structural equation modeling, we developed latent constructs for wealth and civic engagement, to assess associations with a measured health variable. RESULTS: We found that the distribution of sociodemographic, health, and wealth measures in our sample (n = 1267) were comparable to those from other national surveys. Our quantitative illustration of the relationships among the domains of health, wealth, and civic engagement provided support for the interrelationships of constructs within our conceptual model. Latent constructs for wealth and civic engagement were significantly correlated (p = 0.013), and both constructs were used to predict self-reported health. Beta coefficients for all indicators of health, wealth, and civic engagement had the expected direction (positive or negative associations). CONCLUSION: Through development and assessment of our comprehensive equity framework, we found significant associations among key equity domains.

Prohibition of mass event may be relaxed for social and economic benefits when virus transmission stops but could bear the risk of epidemic rebound. Against the background of the varied SARS-CoV-2 prevalence internationally, we modelled the potential impacts of pre-event interventions on epidemic risk of holding a mass event when COVID-19 is under control. METHODS We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Guangdong Province, China, where local virus transmission ceased to occur. A large-scale international trade fair was assumed to be held, with influx of people from overseas and rest of China over a short period of time, who participated for 2-week. Scenarios of pre-event intervention (none, quarantine arrangement and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for participants) were compared. The influence of contact pattern, SARS-CoV-2 prevalence outside the province and China, and testing coverage were examined in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS In basecase scenario (no event), the epidemic has been under control since March 2020. The event would lead to the detection of 1% more confirmed cases by 31 July when community contact rate increased to pre-epidemic level. In event scenario without additional interventions, there would be 599 (93%) more new infections comparing with basecase scenario. To avert new infections, quarantining all participants before the event would be the most effective strategy, followed by quarantining all overseas participants and testing all other participants, and testing all participants before the event and on day 7. However, testing strategy is likely to be affected by the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence outside the event province. CONCLUSIONS Pre-event interventions are effective for reducing the risk of epidemic rebound caused by an international large-scale event. Universal testing for participants is likely to be an effective and feasible intervention.","output":"Impact Of Pre-event Testing And Quarantine On Reducing The Risk Of COVID-19 Epidemic Rebound: A Modelling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Plasma fractionators have implemented many improvements over the past decade directed toward reducing the likelihood of pathogen transmission by purified blood products, yet little has been published attempting to assess the overall impact of these improvements on the probability of safety of the final product. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Safety margins for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), parvovirus B19, and variant form of Creutzfeldt\\\\Jakob disease (vCJD) were calculated for the two fibrin sealants licensed in the United States and for thrombin. These products were selected because their use in a clinical setting is, in most cases, optional, and both were relatively recently approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Moreover, thrombin and fibrinogen both undergo two dedicated virus inactivation steps and/or removal steps in accord with the recommendations of regulatory agencies worldwide. Safety margins were determined by comparing the potential maximum viral loads in contaminated units to viral clearance factors, ultimately leading to the calculation of the residual risk per vial. RESULTS: The residual risk of pathogen transmission per vial was calculated to be less than 1 in 10(?15) for HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV for both fibrinogen and thrombin. Owing to the greater quantities that can be present and its greater thermal stability, the calculated risk for parvovirus transmission was 1 in 500,000 vials for fibrinogen and less than 1 in 10(7) per vial for thrombin. Assuming that vCJD is found to be present in plasma donations, its risk of transmission by these purified and processed plasma derivatives would appear to be very low. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogen safety initiatives implemented by plasma fractionators over the past 10 to 20 years have resulted in products with excellent pathogen safety profiles. Of the agents examined, parvovirus continues to have the lowest calculated margin of safety. Despite this, parvovirus transmissions should be rare. Manufacturers are encouraged to continue exploring processes to further enlarge parvovirus safety margins and to continue exploring ways of eliminating prions.","output":"Estimating the pathogen safety of manufactured human plasma products: application to fibrin sealants and to thrombin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of COVID-19 has fundamentally transformed our educational system. The need to protect both students and instructors from exposure to viral infection has required the implementation of remote instructional models. Although this alternative delivery approach can be successfully implemented to teach the theoretical foundations of multiple disciplines, teaching technical skills poses a major challenge, particularly in various biology fields, where observation of biological safety guidelines and the high cost of analytical equipment represent major impediments for remote instruction. To overcome this problem, we have developed a laboratory exercise to teach students how to use micropipettes that can be completed remotely using materials that can be purchased at a fraction of the cost of the instructional equipment normally reserved for in-person instruction. Our evaluation of the effectiveness of this remote lab indicated that the majority of students who participated in a survey believed they attained the learning objectives and felt confident in their lab technique after completing the exercises. The simplicity, relatively low cost, and effectiveness of this approach makes it highly adaptable for other classrooms and educational settings.","output":"Remote Laboratory Exercise to Develop Micropipetting Skills"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocardial injury in hospitalized patients is associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors for myocardial injury in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its prognostic value. We retrieved all consecutive patients who were hospitalized in internal medicine departments in a tertiary medical center from February 9th, 2020 to August 28th with a diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 559 adult patients were hospitalized in the Sheba Medical Center with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 320 (57.24%) of whom were tested for troponin levels within 24-hours of admission, and 91 (28.44%) had elevated levels. Predictors for elevated troponin levels were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.06), female sex (OR, 3.03; 95% CI 1.54-6.25), low systolic blood pressure (OR, 5.91; 95% CI 2.42-14.44) and increased creatinine level (OR, 2.88; 95% CI 1.44-5.73). The risk for death (hazard ratio [HR] 4.32, 95% CI 2.08-8.99) and a composite outcome of invasive ventilation support and death (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.15-3.37) was significantly higher among patients who had elevated troponin levels. In conclusion, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, elevated troponin levels are associated with poor prognosis. Hence, troponin levels may be used as an additional tool for risk stratification and a decision guide in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","output":"Myocardial injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection-Risk factors and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic has shone a bright light on structural racism in US society and on the inadequacies of a health care system that has significantly disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities while giving preference to white Americans.

The aim of the present study is to describe the prevalence of intracardiac extension in a consecutive population of WT patients observed in a large non-profit Ugandan hospital. A total of 16 patients with a histological diagnosis of 29 WT were screened in a 6-month period. Patient n2, a 3 y/o child, presented with a 3-week history of abdominal distension, difficulty in breathing, and swelling of the lower limbs. A cardiovascular system exam showed rhythmic heart sounds, a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, and a pansystolic murmur on the tricuspid area; the abdomen was grossly distended with a palpable mass in the right flank, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. An abdomen ultrasound showed an intra-abdominal tumor, involving the right kidney and the liver and extended to the IVC. An ultrasound guided biopsy showed a picture consistent with WT. Cardiac echo showed a huge, mobile, cardiac mass attached to the right side of the interatrial septum, involving the tricuspid valve annulus, causing a functional tricuspid stenosis.

Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is essential for its mitigation, as it helps to clarify the extent and impact of the pandemic and can aid decision making, planning and community action. Health geography highlights the interaction of public health officials, affected actors and first responders to improve estimations of disease propagation and likelihoods of new outbreaks. Attempts at interdisciplinary correlation examine health policy interventions for the siting of health/sanitary services and controls, mapping/tracking of human movement, formulation of appropriate scientific and political responses and projection of spatial diffusion and temporal trends.

With the COVID-19 pandemic entering its second year, there are fears that the toll on loneliness could have consequences long after the virus recedes. This study offers a comparative overview of the incidence and determinants of loneliness and social isolation in Europe in the pre-COVID-19 period. The empirical results indicate that 8.6% of the adult population in Europe suffer from frequent loneliness and 20.8% from social isolation, with eastern Europe recording the highest prevalence of both phenomena. Trends over time do not indicate any change in the incidence of social isolation following the widespread adoption of social media networks from 2010 onwards. The empirical analysis shows that favourable economic circumstances protect against loneliness and social isolation, while living alone and poor health constitute important loneliness risk factors. Although social isolation increases with age, the elderly do not report more frequent feelings of loneliness than other age groups, all other things being equal. The relative contributions of the different objective circumstances included in the empirical analysis  demographic characteristics, economic conditions, living arrangements, health status, religious beliefs and geographical location  to chronic loneliness and social isolation vary substantially.","output":"Loneliness and Social Isolation: An Unequally Shared Burden in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies of blood-brain barrier (BBB) require developing of a novel and convenient in vitro endothelial cell model.

who had clinical cultures with meropenem-resistant and/or carbapenemase gene-positive Enterobacterales We obtained microbiological and clinical data by manual chart review Available clinical isolates underwent long-range genomic sequencing using the MinION (Oxford) for rapid genotyping, resistance gene detection, and phylogenetic analysis Results: From March 1 to May 18, we identified 33 CPE isolates from 13 patients, including 29 Klebsiella pneumonia and four Enterobacter cloacae Most patients (11/13) had a positive respiratory culture, and 7/13 developed bacteremia All patients had prolonged, complex hospitalizations with extensive antibiotic exposure We performed long-range sequencing on 19 isolates from 12 patients 15/16 K pneumoniae isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 258

One of the most discussed topics is socket healing after extraction. The Benex system allows extraction without causing unnecessary socket expansion by removing the tooth vertically, preserving both bone and soft tissue. AIM: To assess postoperative healing signs, symptoms, and complications using the Benex extraction system and compare it with conventional extraction among patients at Umm Al-Qura University. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with hopeless single-rooted teeth were included. They were divided into two equal groups: one in which teeth were extracted using the conventional method and one in which extractions were performed by Benex. The Benex system for tooth extraction was performed by drilling into the root canal, followed by screw insertion. Once the extractor was properly positioned, extraction was accomplished by turning the hand screw clockwise. At baseline, the wound size was evaluated. On days 1, 3, and 7 after extraction, telephone interviews were conducted to evaluate pain and post-extraction complications using a pain scale and questionnaire. Socket healing and wound size were evaluated after 2 and 4 weeks of extraction using the healing index and H(2)O(2) epithelization test. RESULTS: The Benex extraction system accelerated early soft-tissue healing and decreased pain and wound size compared with the control group. Conclusion. The Benex system is relatively safe and easy to use, but this does not eliminate the need for a degree of education and training. Proper selection of the case, knowledge of using the device, and implementation of that knowledge in the treatment planning are important factors in ensuring success with this system.","output":"Evaluation of post-extraction healing after atraumatic axial tooth extraction using Benex system II versus conventional extraction: Randomized control trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is one of the most common autoimmune bullous diseases characterized by autoantibodies targeting BP230 and BP180.

Methods: This cross-sectional study among consenting HCWs taking prophylaxis and working in hospitals with COVID-19 patients used online forms to collect details of HCWs, comorbidities, prophylactic drugs used and AEs after the first dose of HCQ. Verification of dose and AEs was done by personal contact. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine the effect of age, gender and dose of HCQ on AE. Results: Of the 1303 HCWs included, 98.4 per cent (n=1282) took HCQ and 66 per cent (n=861) took 800 mg as first day's dose. Among the 19.9 per cent (n=259) reporting AEs, 1.5 per cent (n=20) took treatment for AE, none were hospitalized and three discontinued HCQ. Gastrointestinal AEs were the most common (172, 13.2%), with less in older [odds ratio (OR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.89], with more in females (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.78-3.38) and in those taking a total dose of 800 mg on day one compared to a lower dose. Hypoglycaemia (1.1%, n=14), cardiovascular events (0.7%, n=9) and other AEs were minimal.

It is important for rural health care professionals to be prepared for a bioterrorist attack or other public health emergency. We sought to determine the barriers impeding rural physicians from being prepared for a human-induced disaster such as a bioterrorist attack. METHODS This study employed a qualitative methodology using key informant interviews followed by grounded theory methods for data analysis. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 6 physicians in the state of Florida from federally designated rural areas. RESULTS The interview participants articulated primary barriers and the associated factors contributing to these barriers that may affect rural physician preparedness for human-induced emergencies. Rural physicians identified 3 primary barriers: accessibility to health care, communication between physicians and patients, and rural infrastructure and resources. Each of these barriers included associated factors and influences. For instance, according to our participants, access to care was affected by a lack of health insurance, a lack of finances for health services, and transportation difficulties. CONCLUSIONS Existing rural organizational infrastructure and resources are insufficient to meet current health needs owing to a number of factors including the paucity of health care providers, particularly medical specialists, and the associated patient-level barriers. These barriers presumably would be exacerbated in the advent of a human-induced public health emergency.

We report herein that gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), a lysosome-associated ISG, restricts the infectious entry of selected enveloped RNA viruses. Specifically, we demonstrated that GILT was constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts and its expression could be further induced by type II interferon. While overexpression of GILT inhibited the entry mediated by envelope glycoproteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV) and Lassa fever virus (LASV), depletion of GILT enhanced the entry mediated by these viral envelope glycoproteins. Furthermore, mutations that impaired the thiol reductase activity or disrupted the N-linked glycosylation, a posttranslational modification essential for its lysosomal localization, largely compromised GILT restriction of viral entry. We also found that the induction of GILT expression reduced the level and activity of cathepsin L, which is required for the entry of these RNA viruses in lysosomes. Our data indicate that GILT is a novel antiviral ISG that specifically inhibits the entry of selected enveloped RNA viruses in lysosomes via disruption of cathepsin L metabolism and function and may play a role in immune control and pathogenesis of these viruses.","output":"GILT restricts the cellular entry mediated by the envelope glycoproteins of SARS-CoV, Ebola virus and Lassa fever virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by human Coronaviruses (CoVs) such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1generally results in moderate to severe respiratory and intestinal infections in humans The deadly human CoVs emerging in the last two decades however became the cause of great global concern The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (MERS-CoV) and the current SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 are related respiratory infections with high degree of mortality With currently no available vaccine or approved therapy for COVID-19, the development of directly acting antiviral drugs becomes a sensible strategy Viral infections, like many other disease conditions have been frequently managed using traditional medicine COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infections have also been treated with preparations from traditional Chinese medicine although their efficacy has not yet been well documented Several antiviral agents have also been reported from natural sources and these could provide good opportunity for developing products and therapies that might be applicable in managing COVID-19 In this review, we discuss natural antiviral products that target the various infection stages of the different viruses including CoV, which may be useful for direct management of COVID-19 or provide insights for the development of effective therapies","output":"Drug development for the management of corona viruses: Insights from natural antiviral agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Chagas disease (CD) and ischemic stroke (IS) have a close, but poorly understood, association.

France has struggled to find the right balance between the rock of economic and social damage caused by containment measures and the hard alternative of a rapidly spreading pandemic. The response to the first wave, including a full lock-down, was an emergency response that revealed the low level of preparedness for pandemics and the overly hospital-centred provision of health care in France. During the second wave, this response evolved into a more level strategy trying to reconcile health needs in a broader perspective integrating socio-economic considerations, but without fully managing to put in place an effective health strategy.

In contrast, the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin-based regimens in late-care settings have been poorly reported. METHODS we identified a real-world mCRC patient cohort who were re-treated with oxaliplatin, and in which clinicopathological features were retrospectively analyzed to identify efficacy-predictive determinants (RETROX-CRC study). RESULTS of 2606 patients, 119 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Oxaliplatin retreatment response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 21.6% (CI 14.4-31.0%), and 57.8% (CI 47.7-67.4). A trend towards better RR and DCR was observed among patients who had first oxaliplatin in an adjuvant setting; a poorer outcome was observed if two or more intervening treatments were delivered. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.1 months (95%CI 4.3-6.1), reducing to 4.0 months (95%CI 3.07-5.13) if oxaliplatin was readministered beyond third-line (HR 2.02; 1.25-3.25; p = 0.004). Safety data were retrieved in 65 patients (54.6%); 18.5% (12/65) and 7.7% (5/65) had G3-4 toxicities. Toxicities led to discontinuation in 34/119 (28.6%). CONCLUSIONS oxaliplatin retreatment produced further RR in around one-fifth of patients and DCR 57.8%.

Among MCFAs, lauric acid (LA) and its monoglyceride derivative, glycerol monolaurate (GML), exhibit the strongest antimicrobial activity. Coconut and palm kernel oils are considered the main sources of LA.

The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. There have been no cases reported in SA, the NT or the ACT in the last four weeks. The numbers of new cases reported from other jurisdictions continue to be very low. Testing rates have been higher across all jurisdictions, with Victoria reporting an 85% testing rate increase and NSW a 40% increase over this period. The positivity rate nationally continues to remain very low at less than 0.1% over the reporting period. Continued high rates of testing are necessary to detect and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the community. Over the past fortnight, 45% of cases acquired their infection overseas. Of cases considered to be locally acquired over this period, most were associated with contacts of confirmed cases or were associated with known outbreaks. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18, a pattern reflected in international reports. A small proportion of cases overall have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease in Australia. In addition, the median number of days between symptom onset and diagnostic testing has improved considerably from 7 days in the early phase of the outbreak to 1 day in the latest phase of the epidemic. Internationally, as at 24 May 2020, there have been recent increases in the number of daily cases reported globally. The largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 6.5%.

Age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19. Obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance, which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene, which is involved in the regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow the completion of their viral replication cycles. Furthermore, a dataset using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lungs, which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for sterol response element-binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung. Moreover, ACE2 expression in human subcutaneous adipose tissue can be regulated through changes in diet. Validation of the in silico data revealed a higher expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and SREBP1 in vitro in lung epithelial cells from obese subjects compared to non-obese subjects. To our knowledge this is the first study to show upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in obesity. In silico and in vitro results suggest that the dysregulated lipogenesis and the subsequently high ACE2 expression in obese patients might be the mechanism underlying the increased risk for severe complications in those patients when infected by SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Regulation of Angiotensin- Converting Enzyme 2 in Obesity: Implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 is a novel pediatric condition with significant morbidity and mortality. The primary objective of this investigation was to describe the point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) findings in patients evaluated in the emergency department (ED) who were diagnosed with MIS-C. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted including patients <21-years-old who had POCUS performed for clinical care in a pediatric ED and were diagnosed with MIS-C. Point-of-care ultrasound studies were performed by pediatric emergency medicine attending physicians or fellows. Data abstracted by chart review included patient demographics, clinical history, physical examination findings, diagnostic test results, the time POCUS studies and echocardiograms were performed, therapies administered, and clinical course after admission. RESULTS: For the 24 patients included, 17 focused cardiac ultrasound, 9 lung POCUS, 7 pediatric modified rapid ultrasound for shock and hypotension, 1 focused assessment with sonography for trauma, 1 POCUS for suspected appendicitis, and 1 ocular POCUS were performed by 13 physicians. Point-of-care ultrasound identified impaired cardiac contractility in 5 patients, large intraperitoneal free fluid with inflamed bowel in 1 patient, and increased optic nerve sheath diameters with elevation of the optic discs in 1 patient.

Our first objective was to identify behavioral language and speech markers of early-stage PPA. Our second objective was to identify the electrophysiological correlates of the language and speech characteristics in PPA. Method The databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for relevant articles. To identify behavioral markers, the initial subjective complaints and the language and speech deficits detected during the initial diagnostic evaluation were summarized for PPA in general and each clinical variant according to the 2011 consensus diagnostic criteria (nonfluent variant [NFV], semantic variant, and logopenic variant [LV]). To identify electrophysiological markers, the studies in which event-related potentials (ERPs) were elicited by a language or speech paradigm in patients with PPA were included. Results In total, 114 relevant studies were identified, including 110 behavioral studies and only four electrophysiological studies. This review suggests that patients with the semantic variant could be accurately differentiated from the NFV and LV in the initial stages based on the consensus criteria. Nonetheless, the early differentiation between the NFV and LV is not straightforward. In the four electrophysiological studies, differences in the latency, amplitude, and topographical distribution of the semantic N400 component were found between patients with PPA and healthy controls. Conclusions To accurately differentiate the NFV from the LV, it could be important to assess the language and speech degeneration by more specific assessments and by more objective diagnostic methods that offer insights into the language-related processes. Electrophysiological markers of PPA were not identified in this review due to the low number of studies that investigated language-related ERPs. More controlled ERP studies in larger patient cohorts are needed to investigate the diagnostic applicability of language-related ERPs in PPA.

Patients were also evaluated at baseline (T0). At each assessment, general and ED psychopathology (SCL-90-R and EDE-Q) were assessed. Childhood abuse experiences (CTQ) and adult attachment (ECR-R) were investigated at T1, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (IES-R) at T2.ResultsPatients reported a significant increase in compensatory exercise;in addition, patients with BN and those who achieved remission at T1 showed a significant exacerbation of binge-eating. The longitudinal trend (T1-T2) of psychopathology was not different between patients and controls, however the expected benefit from treatment on ED psychopathology was significant only for AN, while no changes were noted in BN. Patients with BN reported more severe post-traumatic stress symptoms than AN and controls, and these symptoms correlated positively with prior traumatic experiences and an insecure attachment style.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown had a significant impact on subjects with eating disorders, both by interfering with the treatment process and in terms of post-traumatic stress symptoms.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on eating disorders: A longitudinal study with assessments before and after the lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in repeated, prolonged restrictions in daily life. Social distancing policies as well as health anxiety are thought to lead to mental health impairment. However, there is lack of longitudinal data identifying at-risk populations particularly vulnerable for elevated Covid-19-related distress. Methods: We collected data of N=1268 participants (n=622 healthy controls (HC), and n=646 patients with major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) at baseline (2014-2018) and during the first lockdown in Germany (April-May 2020). We obtained information on Covid-19 restrictions (number and subjective impact of Covid-19 events), and Covid-19-related distress (i.e., subjective fear and isolation). Using multiple linear regression models including trait variables and individual Covid-19 impact, we sought to predict Covid-19-related distress. Results: HC and patients reported similar numbers of Covid-19-related events, and similar subjective impact rating. They did not differ in Covid-19-related subjective fear. Patients reported significantly higher subjective isolation. 30.5% of patients reported worsened self-rated symptoms since the pandemic. Subjective fear in all participants was predicted by four variables: trait anxiety (STAI-T), conscientiousness (NEO-FFI), Covid-19 impact, and sex. Subjective isolation in HC was predicted by social support (FSozu), Covid-19 impact, age, and sex; in patients, it was predicted by social support and Covid-19 impact.

BLAZE-1 trial noted lower hospitalization rates in high-risk patients receiving monoclonal antibody (mAb) vs placebo (4.2% vs 14.6%) for mild to moderate infections, making it a treatment option for LTCF residents;however, many LTCF lack staff to prepare and administer mAb therapy. To address this need, Region VII Disaster Health Response Ecosystem (R7DHRE) coordinated via NE Medical Emergency Operations Center (NEMEOC) an ASPR pilot project to facilitate infusion of COVID-19 mAb therapeutics for LTCF residents in the state. Methods R7DHRE partnered with Great Plains Health, Nebraska DHHS, Nebraska Antimicrobial Stewardship Assessment and Promotion Program (ASAP) and Infection Control Assessment and Promotion Program (ICAP) to surveil cases in the state, establish distribution/administration pathways, and educate providers on mAb therapeutics. A multi-hub-and-spoke model was created to allow LTCF to work with regional hospitals or pharmacy services to administer drug in their facilities, reducing time to therapy and transmission risk associated with patient transport. A centralized request process was created using a REDCap platform and verification of patient eligibility by ASAP. This request link, informational documents, fact sheets, and custom-built order form templates were hosted on a dedicated ASAP webpage, and details were shared during weekly ICAP LTCF webinars. Outcomes data, including 14- and 28-day COVID-related hospitalizations and mortality, were collected using databases from Nebraska Health Information Initiative and Nebraska DHHS.

To mitigate transmission of COVID-19 at polling locations, jurisdictions have adopted changes to protocols and procedures, informed by CDC's interim guidance, developed in collaboration with the Election Assistance Commission (2). The driving principle for this guidance is that voting practices with lower infection risk will be those which reduce the number of voters who congregate indoors in polling locations by offering a variety of methods for voting and longer voting periods. The guidance for in-person voting includes considerations for election officials, poll workers, and voters to maintain healthy environments and operations. To assess knowledge and adoption of mitigation strategies, CDC collaborated with the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services and the Delaware State Election Commission on a survey of poll workers who served during the statewide primary election on September 15, 2020. Among 522 eligible poll workers, 93% correctly answered all three survey questions about COVID-19 transmission. Respondents noted that most voters and poll workers wore masks. However, masks were not always worn correctly (i.e., covering both the nose and mouth). Responses suggest that mitigation measures recommended for both poll workers and voters were widely adopted and feasible, but also highlighted gaps in infection prevention control efforts. Strengthening of measures intended to minimize the risk of poll workers acquiring COVID-19 from ill voters, such as additional training and necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as support for alternative voting options for ill voters, are needed. Adherence to mitigation measures is important not only to protect voters but also to protect poll workers, many of whom are older adults, and thus at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness. Enhanced attention to reducing congregation in polling locations, correct mask use, and providing safe voting options for ill voters are critical considerations to minimize risk to voters and poll workers. Evidence from the Delaware election supports the feasibility and acceptability of implementing current CDC guidance for election officials, poll workers, and voters for mitigating COVID-19 transmission at polling locations (2).","output":"Adoption of Strategies to Mitigate Transmission of COVID-19 During a Statewide Primary Election  Delaware, September 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, minority groups and non-citizens may not be sufficiently included in the COVID-19 vaccine coverage.

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces COVID-19 disease, characterized by an inflammatory response mediated through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which results in the production of IL-1 and IL-18 along with pyroptotic cell death. The NLRP3 inflammasome could be also triggered by sterile danger signals such as extracellular ATP triggering the purinergic P2X7 receptor. Severe inflammation in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is associated with pneumonia, hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, these being the causes of death associated with COVID-19. Both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3 have been considered as potential pharmacological targets for treating inflammation in COVID-19. However, there is no experimental evidence of the involvement of the P2X7 receptor during COVID-19 disease. In the present study we determined the concentration of different cytokines and the P2X7 receptor in the plasma of COVID-19 patients and found that along with the increase in IL-6, IL-18 and the IL-1 receptor antagonist in the plasma of COVID-19 patients, there was also an increase in the purinergic P2X7 receptor. Increase in COVID-19 severity and C-reactive protein concentration positively correlated with increased concentration of the P2X7 receptor in the plasma, but not with IL-18 cytokine.

Methods: Healthy adults were recruited from two urban Bristol GP practices. To identify respiratory pathogens in all saliva samples and RTI-S stool samples reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was applied. We compared oral and gut samples from participants who developed RTI symptoms (RTI-S) and those who remained healthy (no-RTI) using 16S rRNA profiling microbiome analysis to identify the core microbiome, alpha and beta diversity, and biomarkers for susceptibility to RTIs from baseline samples (TP-A) when all participants were healthy. Results: We recruited 56 participants but due to the UK COVID-19 pandemic disruption we did not receive samples from 16 participants leaving 19 RTI-S and 21 no-RTI participants with socio-demographic and microbiome data. RT-PCR revealed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus carriage was significantly higher in RTI-S participants compared to those who remained healthy and RTI symptoms may have been due to viral influenzae and bacterial co-infection with Haemophilus influenzae. Core microbiomes of no-RTI participants contained a greater number of taxa compared to RTI-S participants. Microbial biomarkers of RTI susceptibility in the oral cavity were an increased abundance of the pathobiont Streptococcus sobrinus and decreased probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius whereas in the gut there was an increased abundance of the genus Veillonella and decreased abundance of Coprobacillus.

We therefore investigated the effects of stress index guided PEEP titration on pulmonary mechanics and hemodynamics in the prone position in a piglet acute lung injury model. METHODS Ten piglets with severe lavage-induced lung injury were mechanically ventilated in a decremental PEEP trial after full lung recruitment in the prone position. Stress-index PEEP was the level at which the airway pressure stress index was 1, and open-lung PEEP was the level at which it was required to keep the lung open according to computed tomography (CT) scans. Respiratory mechanics, blood gases, hemodynamics, and whole-lung CT were recorded at the two PEEP levels. RESULTS Respiratory system elastance and lung elastance were improved in the prone position but the ratio of chest wall elastance and respiratory system elastance was higher in the prone position. There was no significant difference between open-lung and stress-index guided PEEPs in the prone position (P = 0.46). There was no significant difference between collapsed lung volume (P = 0.07) and hyperinflation lung volume (P = 0.76) in the two groups. Similarly, there was no significant difference between open-lung and stress-index guided PEEPs in terms of oxygenation index (P = 0.95) and PaCO2 (P = 0.42).

Nasal airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are closely related. The aim of this study was to use the 3D imaging software, ITK-SNAP as a platform to define a gold standard for anatomically accurate boundaries of the nasal airway in 3D CBCT and to create a more reliable and precise 3D CBCT segmentation of the nasal airway for assisting diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of nasal airway obstruction and OSAS. METHOD AND MATERIALS After review of the literature to identify established parameters using CBCT and CT technology for the segmentation of the nasal airway, and the existing drawbacks, a gold standard for locating the anatomical boundaries of the nasal airway using CBCT is proposed. This new method aims at standardization of segmentation and quantification, allowing for more reliable comparison between studies. ITK-SNAP software was used to segment three CBCT samples of healthy patients aged 21 to 59 years, who were patients of record, with CBCT obtained for either orthodontic, endodontic, or prosthodontic treatment planning purposes. RESULTS The literature search identified 11 studies describing nasal airway parameters utilizing CBCT and CT. A great variation was detected on where the anatomical boundaries for the nasal airway were selected. A new standard in the identification of anatomical boundaries of the nasal airway is proposed for consistent segmentation and quantification using 3D CBCT by using the following landmarks: the inferior ANS-PNS border, the anterior nares border, the posterior sella-PNS border, and superiorly the border in alignment with the base of the skull (excluding the ostia, frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal air cells). The three segmented samples were volumetrically measured, and statistically analyzed. The mean average Hounsfield unit intensity using the CBCT samples in this study was 629 with a standard deviation of 190. CONCLUSION The literature indicates a lack of a gold standard using CBCT technology for the segmentation of the nasal airway. With the proposed standard in this study, it is possible to quantify the nasal airway volume and thereby its reduction. For the general dental practitioner, this is an important aspect during the evaluation of overall airway assessment.

A broad segment of scholarly literature has found that a crisis often leads to the resurgence of nationalism. When the coronavirus started to spread rapidly in Europe, individual European nation states unilaterally closed their borders, hoarded critical medical supplies, and played blame games. The early period of the pandemic crisis revealed some hybrid form of medical nationalism, economic nationalism, and everyday nationalism. However, the common crisis has also heightened the importance of regional solidarity, and reinforces a strengthening of cross-national cooperation and multilateral institutions. Based on empirical discussions, this research offers an analytical framework to establish the hypothetic mechanisms of understanding this mixed phenomenon. Delving into the interaction between crisis and nationalism, this article argues that the causation from one to the other is not a linear, one-way process. There are competing mechanisms through which both nationalists and liberalists can use the crisis to push for their political agenda. Whether there will be a new wave of neo-nationalism in Europe is largely contingent on the responses the EU and the member states adopt in handling domestic and regional challenges in the post-pandemic era. Therefore, instead of simply exploring the causal relation between crisis and nationalism, more-nuanced questions can be examined in the future concerning the conditions under which and the mechanisms through which a crisis is more/less likely to provoke neo-nationalism.","output":"From Crisis to Nationalism?: The Conditioned Effects of the COVID-19 Crisis on Neo-nationalism in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased stress and decreased resources during a lockdown and social distancing can augment the risk for child abuse and neglect during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Diagnosis is usually via real-time PCR, and it is unclear whether the semi-quantitative capability of this method, determining viral load through cycle threshold (Ct) values, can be leveraged. OBJECTIVES: We aim to review available knowledge on correlations between SARS-COV-2 Ct values and patient- or healthcare-related outcomes to determine whether Ct values provide useful clinical information. SOURCES: A PubMed search was conducted on 1 June 2020 based on a search strategy of (Ct value OR viral load) AND SARS-CoV-2. Data were extracted from studies reporting on the presence or absence of an association between Ct values, or viral loads determined via Ct value, and clinical outcomes. CONTENT: Data from 18 studies were relevant for inclusion. One study reported on the correlation between Ct values and mortality and one study reported on the correlation between Ct values and progression to severe disease; both reported a significant association (p < 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively). Fourteen studies reported on the correlation between Ct value or viral loads determined via Ct value and disease severity, and an association was observed in eight (57%) studies. Studies reporting on the correlation of viral load with biochemical and haematological markers showed an association with at least one marker, including increased lactate dehydrogenase (n = 4), decreased lymphocytes (n = 3) and increased high-sensitivity troponin I (n = 2). Two studies reporting on the correlation with infectivity showed that lower Ct values were associated with higher viral culture positivity. IMPLICATIONS: Data suggest that lower Ct values may be associated with worse outcomes and that Ct values may be useful in predicting the clinical course and prognosis of patients with COVID-19; however, further studies are warranted to confirm clinical value.

conducted a retrospective observational study where all adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to ICUs of Montefiore Medical Center and developing AKI were included The study period was from 3/10- 4/11/2020 We did 60 day follow up on all patients till 6/11/2020 RESULTS: Out of 300 adult admissions in the ICUs with COVID-19 pneumonia, 224 patients developed AKI with the incidence of 74 6% The mean (+- SD) age was 60 (+-11 78) years and 140 (62%) were males By the end of our follow up period on June 11th, 149 (66 5%) patients expired, 75 (33 5%) survived (67 discharged alive, 8

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional document review within two purposively selected clusters (one poorly-resourced and one well-resourced), from each arm of a cluster-randomized trial at two different time points: before and during the trial. The total trial consisted of 16 clusters randomized into 8 intervention and 8 control clusters to assess the impact of an mCDMSS on neonatal mortality in Ghana. We evaluated health workers' adherence (expressed as percentages) to birth asphyxia, neonatal jaundice and cord sepsis protocols by reviewing medical records of neonatal in-patients using a checklist. Differences in adherence to neonatal health protocols within and between the study arms were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and permutation tests for each morbidity type. In addition, we tracked concurrent neonatal health improvement activities in the clusters during the 18-month intervention period. RESULTS: In the intervention arm, mean adherence was 35.2% (SD = 5.8%) and 43.6% (SD = 27.5%) for asphyxia; 25.0% (SD = 14.8%) and 39.3% (SD = 27.7%) for jaundice; 52.0% (SD = 11.0%) and 75.0% (SD = 21.2%) for cord sepsis protocols in the pre-intervention and intervention periods respectively. In the control arm, mean adherence was 52.9% (SD = 16.4%) and 74.5% (SD = 14.7%) for asphyxia; 45.1% (SD = 12.8%) and 64.6% (SD = 8.2%) for jaundice; 53.8% (SD = 16.0%) and 60.8% (SD = 11.7%) for cord sepsis protocols in the pre-intervention and intervention periods respectively. We observed nonsignificant improvement in protocol adherence in the intervention clusters but significant improvement in protocol adherence in the control clusters. There were 2 concurrent neonatal health improvement activities in the intervention clusters and over 12 in the control clusters during the intervention period.

With no effective treatment yet, vaccination seems to be the most effective method of prevention. Recently developed vaccines have been approved for emergency use only and are currently applied to large populations. Considering both the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases (AIIRDs) and the immunosuppressive drugs used in treatment, vaccination for COVID-19 deserves special attention in such patients. In this article, we aimed to give simple messages to the clinicians for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with AIIRDs based upon the current evidence regarding the use of other vaccines in this patient group. For this purpose, we conducted a \\"Pubmed search\\" using the following keywords: Influenza, Hepatitis B, Pneumococcal, and Shingles vaccines and the frequently used conventional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Likewise, an additional search was performed for the COVID-19 immunization in patients with AIIRDs and considering such drugs. In summary, patients with AIIRDs should also be vaccinated against COVID-19, preferably when disease activity is under control and when there is no concurrent infection. Low-degree immunosuppression does not appear to decrease antibody responses to vaccines. Ideally, vaccinations should be done before the initiation of any biological DMARDs. Patients receiving rituximab should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks before or 6 months after treatment. Since tofacitinib may also reduce antibody responses, especially in combination with methotrexate, it may be appropriate to discontinue this drug before vaccination and to restart after 14 days of immunization. Key points a? COVID-19 vaccinations should preferably be made during remission in patients with autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases. a?

DESIGN Nationwide, population-based, retrospective observational study. SETTING Metropolitan France between 2015 and 2019. PARTICIPANTS Between 2015 and 2019, 1 224 433 patients with sepsis of presumed bacterial aetiology were selected from the French National Hospital Discharge Database (Programme de Mdicalisation des Systmes d'Information) and were identified from corresponding ICD-10 codes for explicit sepsis or implicit sepsis. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES Annual overall and age-specific and gender-specific incidence and 95% CI, as well as trends in sepsis incidence and mortality, were estimated. Comorbidities, length of hospital stay and outcomes were described. RESULTS The sex-standardised and age-standardised incidence per 100 000 (95% CI) increased from 357 (356.0 to 359.0) in 2015 to 403 (401.9 to 405.0) in 2019 and remained higher for males compared with females. Children under 1 year and patients over 75 years consistently had the highest incidence. The most common comorbidities were cancer and chronic heart failure.

A sports food composition database based on portion size usually consumed by athletes and/or recommended in commercial packaging was created. Within each sports foods group, different subgroups were defined due to differences in the main and/or secondary macronutrient. The definition of each exchange list with the amounts-in grams-of each sports food within each group and subgroup, was done using statistical criteria such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and Z value.

These reforms promoted big data led (1) market regulation, (2) supervision and management systems, and (3) service provision processes. By applying a case study analytical approach, this paper explores how advancements in big data contributed to these reforms aimed at centralising information in China. Combining the joint knowledge of surveillance and China studies scholarship, this paper offers evidence of big data surveillance streamlining China's fragmented intergovernmental policy system. We build on David Murakami Wood's 2017 outline of a political theory of surveillance and argue that decentralisation of data collection points and centralisation of both bureaucratic and public access to information are keycomponents of the Party-states regulatory governance strategy- incorporating the use of big data and comprehensive surveillance. Our findings have implications for future analyses of the relationship between political organisations and surveillance within other nation-state contexts, particularly in situations where Chinese technologies and systems are being adopted and adapted.","output":"Decentralising Data Collection and Centralising Information in the People's Republic of China: Decentralise, Manage, and Service Reforms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many factors influence the prices of energy commodities and the value of energy and fuel companies.

The aim of the paper is to examine what the probability and intensity of a decrease in the prices of shares of energy and fuel companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (Poland) was during the first wave of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. The study used the survival analysis methods: the Kaplan-Meier estimator, the test of equality of duration curves and the Cox non-proportional hazards model. The analysis showed that the probability and intensity of price decline of energy and fuel companies in the initial period was the same as that of other companies. The differences become apparent only after 50 days from the established maximum of their value. The risk of price declines in energy and fuel companies increased significantly. This situation was related both to a temporary reduction in demand for energy and fuels, pandemic restrictions introduced in individual countries and the behaviour of stock market investors.","output":"Decline in Share Prices of Energy and Fuel Companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a Reaction to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online educational videos have the potential to enhance undergraduate biology learning, for example by showcasing contemporary scientific research and providing content coverage.

The recent failure of an experimental vaccine in a phase IIb study, named the STEP trial, intended solely to elicit cell-mediated immune responses against HIV-1, has highlighted the need for a balanced immune response consisting of not only cellular immunity but also a broad and potent humoral antibody response that can prevent infection with HIV-1.

In a cross-sectional design, 81 women, aged 18-35 (mean [SD] age, 23.4 [3.9]), were included (41 with NSSI and 40 healthy controls). A quantitative sensory testing protocol, including heat pain thresholds, heat pain tolerance, pressure pain thresholds, conditioned pain modulation (assessing central down-regulation of pain), and temporal summation (assessing facilitation of pain signals) was used. Thermal pain stimuli were assessed during fMRI scanning and NSSI behaviors and clinical symptoms were self-assessed. NSSI participants demonstrated higher pain thresholds during heat and pressure pain compared to controls. During conditioned pain modulation, NSSI participants showed a more effective central down-regulation of pain for NSSI participants. Temporal summation did not differ between the groups. There were no correlations between pain outcomes and NSSI behaviors or clinical characteristics. The fMRI analyses revealed increased activity in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex in NSSI participants, compared to healthy controls, which are brain regions implicated in sensory aspects of pain processing. The findings suggest segregated inhibitory mechanisms for pain and emotion in NSSI, as pain insensitivity was linked to enhanced inhibitory control of pain in spite of significant impairments in emotion regulation.

Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste. Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in COVID-19 may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases. METHODS: A single-institution, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet-based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for COVID-19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with COVID-19 positivity. RESULTS: A total of 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms underwent COVID-19 testing between March 3, 2020, and March 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) COVID-19-positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) COVID-19-negative patients. Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of COVID-19-positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of COVID-19-negative patients (p < 0.001).

METHODS: This study is an interrupted-time-series observational study of children presenting to 11 Canadian tertiary-care pediatric EDs. Data were grouped into weeks in 3 study periods: prepandemic (January 1, 2018-January 27, 2020), peripandemic (January 28, 2020-March 10, 2020), and early pandemic (March 11, 2020-April 30, 2020). These periods were compared with the same time intervals in the 2 preceding calendar years. Primary outcomes were number of ED visits per week. The secondary outcomes were triage acuity, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, length of hospital stay, ED revisits, and visits for trauma and mental health concerns. RESULTS: There were 577,807 ED visits (median age, 4.5 years; 52.9% male). Relative to the prepandemic period, there was a reduction [-58%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -63% to -51%] in the number of ED visits during the early-pandemic period, with concomitant higher acuity. There was a concurrent increase in the proportion of ward [odds ratio (OR), 1.39; 95% CI, 1.32-1.45] and intensive care unit (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) admissions, and trauma-related ED visits among children less than 10 years (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.45-1.56). Mental health-related visits in children declined in the early-pandemic period (in <10 years, -60%; 95% CI, -67% to -51%; in children &#8805;10 years: -56%; 95% CI, -63% to -47%) relative to the pre-COVID-19 period. There were no differences in mortality or length of stay; however, ED revisits within 72 hours were reduced during the early-pandemic period (percent change: -55%; 95% CI, -61% to -49%; P < 0.001).

To help guide public health policies it is important to monitor efficiently its spread. Genome sequencing is the gold standard for identification of Delta, but is time-consuming, expensive, and unavailable in many regions. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a rapid, simple and inexpensive alternative to sequencing for Delta identification. METHODS: A double-mismatch allele-specific RT-PCR (DMAS-RT-PCR) was developed. The technique exploits allele-specific primers, targeting two spike gene mutations, L452R and T478K, within the same amplicon. The discriminatory power of each primer was enhanced by an additional mismatch located at the fourth nucleotide from the 3 end. Specificity was assessed by testing well characterised cell culture-derived viral isolates and clinical samples, most of which had previously been fully sequenced. RESULTS: In all cases the results of viral genotyping by DMAS-RT-PCR were entirely concordant with the results of sequencing, and the assay was shown to discriminate reliably between the Delta variant and other variants (Alpha and Beta), and wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Influenza A and RSV were non-reactive in the assay. The sensitivity of DMAS-RT-PCR matched that of the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR screening assay. Several samples that could not be sequenced due to insufficient virus were successfully genotyped by DMAS-RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: The method we describe would be simple to establish in any laboratory that can conduct PCR assays and should greatly facilitate monitoring of the spread of the Delta variant globally.","output":"Highly sensitive and specific detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant by double-mismatch allele-specific real time reverse transcription PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyse a Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) system assisted with quantum communication technologies.

Participants (N = 581; 50% male) between 14 and 86 years of age completed up to 3 waves (T1-T3) of Big Five trait questionnaires and experience-sampling assessments during 6 years. During each three-week experience-sampling period, participants reported their momentary affect and occurrences of hassles on average 55 times. Latent change models showed that increases over time in affective reactivity to daily hassles were associated with increases in neuroticism. This effect was consistent from T1 to T2 as well as from T2 to T3, and most pronounced in young adulthood. Importantly, the results were specific to associations between stress reactivity and neuroticism because changes in frequency of hassles in daily life did not predict changes in neuroticism, and stress reactivity did not consistently predict changes in the other Big Five traits. The findings help to inform theoretical models that outline how short-term states might contribute to gradual longer-term changes in traits like neuroticism.

OBJECTIVE: The sequential introduction of severe measures, intentionally aiming at reducing the number of new infections, also imposes sharp restrictions on populations with potentially unintended, detrimental effects on public mental health. METHOD: We used observational data reflecting the number of phone calls made to national crisis hotlines in Austria and Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020-April 2020) to investigate the impact of government restrictions as well as their later revocations on public mental health. Importantly, both countries have comparable health care systems, are similar in their political and socio-economic idiosyncrasies, and took similar restrictive government measures in order to contain COVID-19-but implemented them at different points in time. RESULTS: Analysis indicated that the number of crisis hotline calls increased in both countries. This increase seemed to occur at around the same time as the implementation of restrictive governmental responses. Importantly, the revocation of these governmental restrictions (i.e., re-opening the economy, allowing more social contact) seemed to occur at around the same time as the decrease in the number of calls. CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the notion that the implementation of severe measures affects public mental health.

Methods: This study is based on data collected between Apr 2020 and Jan 2021 as part of the online cross-sectional national community-based survey. The included participants were located in North America, 18 years and older, with self-reported sleep-related breathing disorder (SBD) and usage of a PAP device in the last month before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (in the past 7 days). Results: Of all respondents, 7.2% (41/570) stopped using PAP during the pandemic. There were no significant differences between individuals who continued and stopped using PAP in the time elapsed since the pandemic declaration, age, sex, education level, occupational status, family income, or the proportions of individuals endorsing symptoms that could be related to COVID-19. Compared to individuals who continued using PAP, those who stopped had significantly shorter sleep time, lower sleep efficiency, and poorer sleep quality.

Patients were eligible (1) if they were admitted for 48 hours or (2) if they had been admitted to the hospital within a month. Chart reviews were conducted. We calculated the prevalence of antimicrobial use as follows: patients receiving 1 antimicrobial during survey period per number of patients surveyed  100%. RESULTS In each survey, 28-47 hospitals participated. In 2002, 2,460 (36.5%; 95% CI, 35.3%-37.6%) of 6,747 surveyed patients received 1 antimicrobial. In 2009, 3,566 (40.1%, 95% CI, 39.0%-41.1%) of 8,902 patients received 1 antimicrobial. In 2017, 3,936 (39.6%, 95% CI, 38.7%-40.6%) of 9,929 patients received 1 antimicrobial. Among patients who received 1 antimicrobial, penicillin use increased 36.8% between 2002 and 2017, and third-generation cephalosporin use increased from 13.9% to 18.1% (P < .0001). Between 2002 and 2017, fluoroquinolone use decreased from 25.7% to 16.3% (P < .0001) and clindamycin use decreased from 25.7% to 16.3% (P < .0001) among patients who received 1 antimicrobial.

Qualitatively, where surface skin temperatures and lower tropospheric temperature and humidity are not uniform, the downwelling longwave radiation (DLR) will be determined not just by radiation from the atmosphere above a given location, but also by adjacent surface temperatures. We quantify this three-dimensional longwave radiative effect over the Upper Colorado River Basin in clear-sky conditions by calculating surface DLR with observed land-surface temperatures from ECOSTRESS. We find that this effect is due to terrain-subtended sky-view and represents 22% of the surface longwave flux, rising to 28% and 24% in the East and Southeast of the Basin, respectively, and can be >50% in extreme cases. The common omission of this effect in atmospheric radiation models leads to an underestimation of DLR in complex terrain, especially at higher elevations, which has significant implications for mountainous ecohydrology simulations. ? 2022 The Authors.","output":"Three-Dimensional Surface Downwelling Longwave Radiation Clear-Sky Effects in the Upper Colorado River Basin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSRACT PURPOSE: To demonstrate that oral drug absorption is terminated in finite time.

Optic neuritis can occur in association with some viruses, such as influenza and mumps viruses. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, spread throughout the world. Coronavirus is known to cause optic neuritis in animal models, and several adult cases have been reported up to now, as well. However, to date, no case of optic neuritis has been reported in children with COVID-19. Case Presentation: The patient was an eight-year-old boy referred to our center, complaining of sudden bilateral and progressive blurring of vision with right-eye preference. He had a history of severe headache for three days in the previous two weeks and slight mood disturbance. On physical examination, bilateral disk swelling and significant loss of vision were detected in his both eyes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed bilateral maxillary sinus thickening with mild optic nerves enlargement with slightly hyperintense T2 and mild post-contrast enhancement. No pathologic finding was seen in the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid and other immunologic tests were normal. Due to the patients history of headache and outbreak of COVID-19, a nasopharyn-geal reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 was requested, and a positive result was obtained, confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. The optic neuritis was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone and the patients vision improved.

Elevated expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on cardiac cells of patients with heart diseases may be related to cardiovascular burden. We have thus analysed cardiovascular and inflammatory microRNAs (miRs), sensitive markers of cardiovascular damage, in critically ill, ventilated patients with COVID-19 or influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (Influenza-ARDS) admitted to the intensive care unit and healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Circulating miRs (miR-21, miR-126, miR-155, miR-208a, and miR-499) were analysed in a discovery cohort consisting of patients with mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 15). A validation study was performed in an independent cohort of mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 patients (n = 20), Influenza-ARDS patients (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 32). In both cohorts, RNA was isolated from serum and cardiovascular disease/inflammatory-relevant miR concentrations were measured by miR-specific TaqMan PCR analyses. In both the discovery and the validation cohort, serum concentration of miR-21, miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Calculating the area under the curve using receiver operating characteristic analysis miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 showed a clear distinction between COVID-19 and Influenza-ARDS patients. CONCLUSION: In this exploratory study, inflammation and cardiac myocyte-specific miRs were upregulated in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures-including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing-might be required to reduce transmission. We aimed to estimate the reduction in transmission under different control measures across settings and how many contacts would be quarantined per day in different strategies for a given level of symptomatic case incidence. METHODS: For this mathematical modelling study, we used a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, or other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40a162 UK participants. We simulated the effect of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing, and physical distancing scenarios. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated reduction in the effective reproduction number and the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies. RESULTS: We estimated that combined isolation and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone: mean transmission reduction of 2% for mass random testing of 5% of the population each week, 29% for self-isolation alone of symptomatic cases within the household, 35% for self-isolation alone outside the household, 37% for self-isolation plus household quarantine, 64% for self-isolation and household quarantine with the addition of manual contact tracing of all contacts, 57% with the addition of manual tracing of acquaintances only, and 47% with the addition of app-based tracing only. If limits were placed on gatherings outside of home, school, or work, then manual contact tracing of acquaintances alone could have an effect on transmission reduction similar to that of detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where 1000 new symptomatic cases that met the definition to trigger contact tracing occurred per day, we estimated that, in most contact tracing strategies, 15a000-41a000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day. INTERPRETATION: Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimated that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number lower than 1 in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission.

Participants were 298 high school students aged 14C18 years (191 females). Variables included school age, PE grade, sports participation, anthropometric indices, four PF tests, and PL (evidenced by CAPL-2-knowledge and understanding questionnaire (CAPL-2-KU) and PLAYself questionnaire). Gender-stratified analyses of differences were conducted using the t-test for independent samples or the Mann-Whitney test. Associations between variables were calculated with Pearsons product moment correlation or Spearmans rank order correlation. PF was positively correlated CAPL-2-KU in both genders. PE grade was significantly associated with PLAYself score (Pearsons correlation = 0.36 and 0.38, p < 0.001 for boys and girls, respectively) but not with the CAPL-2-KU score. School age was not correlated with PL among boys, but there was a significant but negligible correlation between CAPL-2-KU and school age in girls (<2% of the common variance). Adolescents involved in sports had better PL and PF compared with adolescents not involved in sports. In conclusion, participation in out-of-school sports offers a good base for developing PL. Although this study took part over the COVID-19 pandemic period when the regular PE curriculum was significantly altered, the poor associations between school age and PL could lead to the assumption that the current PE curriculum does not allow for improvement of PL in later high school age, which warrants further investigation.","output":"Out-of-School Sports Participation Is Positively Associated with Physical Literacy, but What about Physical Education?

In the past dozens of years, SARS-CoV under the branch of the new evolutionary tree has threatens greatly global public health and the severe acute respiratory syndrome new coronavirus (COVID-19) reported in China could cause fatal pathological lesions. Especially in areas with poor medical care, neglect of indirect transmission can cause more serious consequences. METHODS First of all, with reference to SARS-CoV and other relevant studies, the possibility of virus residues on the surface of multiple media is discussed. Further, it is found that the surface residue of this substance may be an important factor in iatrogenic infection. RESULTS This correspondence could point out the direction to study the pathomechanism of COVID-19 infecting human beings. CONCLUSIONS Mucosa exposure and inappropriate treatment of medical and non-medical articles used by the patients all could increase the risks of COVID-19 transmission.","output":"COVID\\\\19 indirect contact transmission through the oral mucosa must not be ignored"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are potentially a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, because of physiologic immune suppression in pregnancy. However, data on the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 among pregnant women, compared to nonpregnant women, are sparse and inconclusive. We sought to assess the impact of pregnancy on COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality, with particular attention to the impact of pre-existing comorbidity. METHODS: We used retrospective data from January through June 2020 on female patients aged 18-44 years old utilizing the Cerner COVID-19 de-identified cohort. We used mixed-effects logistic and exponential regression models to evaluate the risk of hospitalization, maximum hospital length of stay (LOS), moderate ventilation, invasive ventilation, and death for pregnant women while adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, insurance, Elixhauser AHRQ weighted Comorbidity Index, diabetes history, medication, and accounting for clustering of results in similar zip-code regions. RESULTS: Out of 22,493 female patients with associated COVID-19, 7.2% (n = 1609) were pregnant. Crude results indicate that pregnant women, compared to non-pregnant women, had higher rates of hospitalization (60.5% vs. 17.0%, P < 0.001), higher mean maximum LOS (0.15 day vs. 0.08 day, P < 0.001) among those who stayed < 1 day, lower mean maximum LOS (2.55 days vs. 3.32 days, P < 0.001) among those who stayed &#8805;1 day, and higher moderate ventilation use (1.7% vs. 0.7%, P < 0.001) but showed no significant differences in rates of invasive ventilation or death. After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, pregnant women, compared to non-pregnant women, saw higher odds in hospitalization (aOR: 12.26; 95% CI (10.69, 14.06)), moderate ventilation (aOR: 2.35; 95% CI (1.48, 3.74)), higher maximum LOS among those who stayed < 1 day, and lower maximum LOS among those who stayed &#8805;1 day. No significant associations were found with invasive ventilation or death. For moderate ventilation, differences were seen among age and race/ethnicity groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among women with COVID-19 disease, pregnancy confers substantial additional risk of morbidity, but no difference in mortality. Knowing these variabilities in the risk is essential to inform decision-makers and guide clinical recommendations for the management of COVID-19 in pregnant women.","output":"The risk of clinical complications and death among pregnant women with COVID-19 in the Cerner COVID-19 cohort: a retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND AIM: SARS-CoV-2 infection was declared as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, and the death toll from COVID-19, which is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has already passed those of many previous epidemics. A wide variety of treatment options are being considered for COVID-19, but there is still no definitive treatment or vaccine. This review aims to explain the background of the convalescent plasma treatment and its relations with COVID-19 immunity, to define the ideal treatment procedures and to reveal present and future perspectives in the light of rapidly growing data. Immunological basis of COVID-19 associated immune response and convalescent plasma as a treatment option: Since it has been shown that the impaired immune response of the host is one of the most important factors that increase the severity of the infection, treatment strategies to suppress aberrant immune activation are being dwelled on. Convalescent/immune plasma, which is derived from recently recovered patients and contains neutralizing antibodies and many other immune-modulatory substances, seems to be the most convenient strategy to restore normal immune function considering the fast-spreading nature of the ongoing pandemic. Conclusion and future perspectives: Even though mechanisms of action of plasma therapy are not fully delineated, it has been shown that it could lead to a reduction in mortality since other alternatives such as monoclonal antibodies or SARS-CoV-2 hyper immunoglobulin require much more time and effort to be developed.","output":"Perspectives for the immune plasma treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater-based monitoring for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the individual building level could be an efficient, passive means of early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Preliminary samples were collected from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side by side to assess feasibility, performance, and sensitivity. Refined sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n = 105 and 66) over 8 weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24-h composite collection had a sensitivity of 96.2% and a specificity of 100%. However, the method could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. If the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive, then the sensitivity is 100% and specificity drops to 45%. It was determined that the proposed approach constitutes a highly sensitive wastewater surveillance method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, but it could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding. Future work must focus on approaches to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to fully realize the potential of building wastewater as a surveillance tool for congregate living. IMPORTANCE Some of the most severe outbreaks of COVID-19 have taken place in places where persons live together, such as nursing homes. Wastewater testing from individual buildings could be used for frequent pooled surveillance of virus from all occupants, including those who are contagious, with or without symptoms. This work provides a sensitive practical method for detecting infected individuals, as validated in two building complexes housing occupants who underwent frequent clinical testing performed by external entities. Although this sensitive method could be deployed now for pooled surveillance as an early warning system to limit outbreaks, the study shows that the approach will require further refinement to differentiate contagious, newly infected individuals from persons who have persistent viral fragments shedding in their stool outside the contagious period.","output":"Development of Wastewater Pooled Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from Congregate Living Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A coordinated system of disease surveillance will be critical to effectively control the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Such systems enable rapid detection and mapping of epidemics and inform allocation of scarce prevention and intervention resources. Although many lower- and middle-income settings lack infrastructure for optimal disease surveillance, health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) provide a unique opportunity for epidemic monitoring. This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institutes Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal;determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing;determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility;and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response. The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care C conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures. In this protocol we report the details of our cohort design, questionnaires, data and reporting structures, and standard operating procedures in hopes that our project can inform similar efforts elsewhere.","output":"Protocol: Leveraging a demographic and health surveillance system for Covid-19 Surveillance in rural KwaZulu-Natal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and lockdown period may induce an impairment in quality of life (QoL), disruption in treatment (DIT), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in chronic neurological diseases (CNDs). To reach this information, a multicenter, cross-sectional study (COVQoL-CND) was planned. Parkinson's disease (PD), headache (HA), multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy (EP), polyneuropathy (PNP), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) were selected as the CND. METHODS: The COVQoL-CND study includes demographic data, the World Health Organization Quality of Life short form (WHOQOL-BREF), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) forms. RESULTS: The mean age of a total of 577 patients was 49  17 (19C87 years), and the ratio of female/male was 352/225. The mean age of patients with PD, HA, MS, EP, PNP, and CVD were 65  11, 39  12, 38  10, 47  17, 61  12, and 60  15 years, respectively. The IES-R scores were found to be higher in the younger group, those with comorbid disease, contacted with CO-VID-19 patients, or diagnosed with COVID-19. In the group with a high IES-R score, the rate of DIT was found to be high. IES-R scores were negatively correlated with QoL. IES-R total scores were found highest in the CVD group and lowest in the PD group. The ratio of DIT was found highest in the PNP group and the lowest in the EP group. Contact with CO-VID-19 patients was high in the EP and HA group.

Online public repositories have been one of the most popular ways for end users to obtain software, but there is a lack of systematic security evaluation of popular public repositories. In this paper, we bridge this gap by analyzing five popular software repositories. We focus on their software updating dynamics, as well as the presence of traces of vulnerable and/or trojanized applications among the top-100 most downloaded Windows programs on each of the evaluated repositories. We analyzed 2,935 unique programs collected in a period of 144 consecutive days. Our results show that: (i) the repositories frequently exhibit rank changes due to applications fast climbing toward the first positions; (ii) the repositories often update their payloads, which may cause the distribution of distinct binaries for the same intended application (binaries for the same applications may also be different in each repository); (iii) the installers are composed by multiple components and often download payloads from the Internet to complete their installation steps, posing new risks for users (we demonstrate that some installers are vulnerable to content tampering through man-in-the-middle attacks); (iv) the ever-changing nature of repositories and installers makes them prone to abuse, as we observed that 30% of all applications were reported malicious by at least one AV.","output":"On the Security of Application Installers and Online Software Repositories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stress and sleep have been implicated in the etiology of psychosis, and literature suggests they are closely related. Two distinct domains of stress associated with sleep dysfunction in the general population are responsivity to environmental stressors and stress sensitivity. However, to date, no research has examined relationships between these stress domains and sleep dysfunction in individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. A total of 57 CHR (mean age = 18.89, SD = 1.82) and 61 healthy control (HC; mean age = 18.34, SD = 2.41) adolescents and young adults completed a measure of emerging stress intolerance. A subset of participants (CHR = 50, HC = 49) completed a measure indexing responsivity to family stressors - an integral context for this developmental stage overlapping with the psychosis-risk period. Sleep efficiency, continuity, and duration were objectively assessed by actigraphy (CHR = 38, HC = 36). Partial correlations with age and sex as covariates were conducted in both groups separately to examine relationships between stress and sleep. Results indicated that automatic maladaptive responsivity to family stressors was associated with disrupted sleep in the CHR but not HC group. Specifically, greater involuntary engagement was associated with poorer sleep efficiency (r = -.42) but not sleep continuity (r = 0.31) and duration (r = .-19). Interestingly, both adaptative and maladaptive voluntary responses to stressors (engagement and disengagement coping) were not associated with sleep. Finally, impaired stress tolerance was associated with sleep efficiency (r = -0.47), continuity (r = 0.37), and duration (r = -0.43). Taken together, findings provided important groundwork for understanding the role of the relationship between involuntary maladaptive responsivity to family stressors and stress sensitivity with sleep in psychosis etiology.","output":"The relationship between stress responding in family context and stress sensitivity with sleep dysfunction in individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The academic sectors are badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic globally.

With advances in treatment options, the identification of patients with obstructive ETD is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study was to validate a Danish translation of the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7). METHODS: All participants underwent tympanometry, otomicroscopy and completed the ETDQ-7. We included 34 ears from patients with obstructive ETD who had abnormal tympanometry curves but no history of cholesteatoma or adhesive otitis. As a control group, 48 otherwise healthy ears with a normal tympanometry curve were included from patients with known sensorineural hearing loss or normal hearing. RESULTS: A Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 indicated a good internal consistency reliability of the questionnaire. The mean ETDQ-7 score in the obstructive ETD group was 31 versus 13.5 in the control group (p = 0.00). A receiver operating characteristics analysis produced an area under the curve of 94%, showing excellent discriminatory abilities between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ETDQ-7 has previously been validated in English, German, Dutch and Portuguese, demonstrating good clinical relevance. The Danish translation of the ETDQ-7 has produced similar results and may be valuable in diagnosing obstructive ETD and in monitoring the effect of balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube.

In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged with a high transmission rate and severe effects on human health, with 5% infected persons requiring hospitalisation and 3.81 million deaths to date globally. Aerosol particles containing virions are considered the main source of SARS CoV-2 transmission in this pandemic, with increased infection rates in confined spaces. Consequently, public and private institutions had to institute mitigation measures including the use of facial masks and social distancing to limit the spread of the virus. Moreover, the role of air purification and bio-decontamination is understood as being essential to mitigate viral spread. Various techniques can be applied to bio-decontaminate the air such as the use of filtration and radiation; however, these methods are expensive and not feasible for home use. Another method of air purification is where indoor plants can purify the air by the removal of air pollutants and habituated airborne microbes. The use of indoor plants could prove to be a cost-efficient way of indoor air-purification that could be adapted for a variety of environments with no need for special requirements and can also add an aesthetic value that can have an indirect impact on human health. In this review, we discuss the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the currently used air purification methods, and we propose the use of indoor plants as a new possible eco-friendly tool for indoor air purification and for reducing the spread of COVID-19 in confined places.","output":"The Role of Indoor Plants in air Purification and Human Health in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Proposal for a Novel Line of Inquiry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the paper, the authors review origins, motivations, and generalizations of a series of inequalities involving finitely many exponential functions and sums, establish three new inequalities involving finitely many exponential functions and sums by finding convexity of a function related to the generating function of the Bernoulli numbers, survey the history, backgrounds, generalizations, logarithmically complete monotonicity, and applications of a series of ratios of finitely many gamma functions, present complete monotonicity of a linear combination of finitely many trigamma functions, construct a new ratio of finitely many gamma functions, derive monotonicity, logarithmic convexity, concavity, complete monotonicity, and the Bernstein function property of the newly constructed ratio of finitely many gamma functions, and suggest two linear combinations of finitely many trigamma functions and two ratios of finitely many gamma functions to be investigated.","output":"From inequalities involving exponential functions and sums to logarithmically complete monotonicity of ratios of gamma functions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The relative risk of SARSCCoV\\\\2 infection and COVID\\\\19 disease severity among people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) compared to those without RMDs is unclear.

Modeling PPIs is useful for many biomedical applications, such as vaccine design, antibody therapeutics, and peptide drug discovery. Pre-training a protein model to learn effective representation is critical for PPIs. Most pre-training models for PPIs are sequence-based, which naively adopt the language models used in natural language processing to amino acid sequences. More advanced works utilize the structure-aware pre-training technique, taking advantage of the contact maps of known protein structures. However, neither sequences nor contact maps can fully characterize structures and functions of the proteins, which are closely related to the PPI problem. Inspired by this insight, we propose a multimodal protein pre-training model with three modalities: sequence, structure, and function (S2F). Notably, instead of using contact maps to learn the amino acid-level rigid structures, we encode the structure feature with the topology complex of point clouds of heavy atoms. It allows our model to learn structural information about not only the backbones but also the side chains. Moreover, our model incorporates the knowledge from the functional description of proteins extracted from literature or manual annotations. Our experiments show that the S2F learns protein embeddings that achieve good performances on a variety of PPIs tasks, including cross-species PPI, antibody-antigen affinity prediction, antibody neutralization prediction for SARS-CoV-2, and mutation-driven binding affinity change prediction.","output":"Multimodal Pre-Training Model for Sequence-based Prediction of Protein-Protein Interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is ongoing debate as to whether cardiac complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) result from myocardial viral infection or are secondary to systemic inflammation and/or thrombosis.

Thus, this pandemic and its subsequent impacts on the natural order of our life, would be one of the most important threats against the entire human race. Aims & Objective: Due to this, in this project, we have made attempts to find an operative approach for synthesizing this compound as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which showed it could be effective in inhibiting the newly emerged coronavirus. RESULTS The designed scheme uses relatively cheap precursors, and contains one pot stages, instead of seven time consuming, and more costly, linear steps. Also, it is tried to use safe and cheap solvents like water, and ethanol, instead of toxic ones like methanol, and pyridine which could cause rejection of the API in the organic volatile impurities (OVI) test of pharmacopeia analysis, as well as increasing the concern of inflammability, explosive, and carcinogenic properties of those common solvents.

We used Pearson's Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression to evaluate relationships. RESULTS: Of 452 Michigan NHs contacted via e-mail, 145 (32.1%) opened the survey and of these, 143 (98.6%) responded. Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated their response plan addressed most issues. NHs reported receiving rapidly changing guidance from many sources. Two-thirds reported shortages of personal protective equipment and other supplies. Half (50%) lacked sufficient testing resources with only 36% able to test residents and staff with suspected COVID-19. A majority (55%) experienced staffing shortages. Sixty-three percent experienced resignations, with front-line clinical staff more likely to resign, particularly in facilities caring for COVID-19 patients (P < .001). Facilities adapted quickly, creating COVID-19 units (78%) to care for patients on site.

Therefore, the purpose of this review was to identify relevant peer-reviewed literature in this area to thematically produce evidence-based recommendations that would inform community planning and response amongst homeless populations. Although this review is inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, our intention was to produce relevant recommendations to for all current and future outbreaks and pandemics more generally. Our search criteria focused on pandemics and rapid-spread illnesses such as contagious respiratory diseases with contact spread and with an emphasis on individuals experiencing homelessness. Content analysis methods were followed to extract and thematically synthesise key information amongst the 223 articles that matched our search criteria between the years of 1984 and 2020. Two reviewers were assigned to the screening process and used Covidence and undertook two rounds of discussion to identify and finalise themes for extraction. This review illustrates that the current breadth of academic literature on homeless populations has thus far focused on tuberculosis (TB) rather than diseases that are more recent and closely related to COVID-19-such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or H1N1. Our thematic content analysis revealed six themes that offer tangible and scalable recommendations which include (1) education and outreach, (2) adapting structure of services, (3) screening and contract tracing, (4) transmission and prevention strategies, (5) shelter protocols and (6) treatment, adherence and vaccination. The breadth and depth of reviews such as these are dependent on the quantity and quality of the available literature. Therefore, the limited existing literature outside of tuberculosis specific to homelessness in this review illustrates a need for more academic research into the intersections of pandemics and homelessness-particularly for evaluations of response and planning. Nonetheless, this review offers timely considerations for pandemic response and planning amongst homeless populations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and can facilitate future research in this area.","output":"Responding to pandemics and other disease outbreaks in homeless populations: A review of the literature and content analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents anomaly detection in activities of daily living based on entropy measures.

Therefore, the residents activity is expected to be different when there is a visitor, which could be considered as an abnormal activity pattern. Identifying anomalies is essential for healthcare management, as this will enable action to avoid prospective problems early and to improve and support residents ability to live safely and independently in their own homes. Entropy measure analysis is an established method to detect disorder or irregularities in many applications: however, this has rarely been applied in the context of activities of daily living. An experimental evaluation is conducted to detect anomalies obtained from a real home environment.

The accident involves the most between the motorcyclist and other vehicles such as a passenger car which is 17 times safer than the motorcyclist. Current research reveals that the three major forms of incidents in Malaysia are single-motorcycle incidents, passenger car crashes and carsCmotorcycles crash. In general, the lack of accuracy of road geometric design, traffic volumes and overlapping movements of vehicles was the main cause of road accidents in Malaysia, which caused drivers to make mistakes and errors due to road geometric characteristics and traffic environments. However, during our recent COVID-19 pandemic, the traffic volumes are relatively low in the whole country as the government announces the movement control order in March 2020. The country was almost completely lockdown (people and vehicles' movements were controlled). In contrast with the reduction of the traffic volumes, the number of crashes shows relatively high numbers. This phenomenon can be derived so that other factors cause vehicle crashes and fatalities should be considered. Several factors related to road geometric such as lane width, shoulder width, access point, curve length and tangent length are considered in developing profiles of operating speed for motorcycles and cars formed of tangents and curves. The analysis of the geometric factors and traffic environments took place at federal road F0050 from 21 to 25 km in Johor, Malaysia. This study was carried out using GPS (DG-200) where the data (vehicles tracked movements) on the continuous speed profiles used a current method of analysis to determine the profiles of road design consistency for motorcycles and cars. The profiles are used to measure the importance index of the integrated design consistency model of the road. The model depends on parameters such as the confine region of speed profiles, average speed, and velocity deviation standard of the profiles. Therefore, a special software of ACAD was used to build the profile of the consistency model. The design accuracy of the speed profile in traffic and safety assessments are affected by the integrated-consistency model. The highest number of accidents has been identified at 24 km at F0050 based on the area design consistency where poor design is the integrated quality consistency model for car and motorcycle. The study shows that crashes and fatalities are not fully affected by traffic volumes but road design performances and driving behaviors.","output":"Crash model based on integrated design consistency with low traffic volumes (due to health disaster (COVID-19)/movement control order)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been three months since the first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, and people now have a more complete picture of the extent of the pandemic.

The current population-based study aimed to evaluate the depression and anxiety of people in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were randomly recruited and asked to complete a structured questionnaire, including the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), the global rating of change scale and items related to COVID-19. Of the 500 respondents included in the study, 19% had depression (PHQ-9 score  10) and 14% had anxiety (GAD score  10). In addition, 25.4% reported that their mental health had deteriorated since the pandemic. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that not experiencing the SARS outbreak in 2003, being worried about being infected by COVID-19, being bothered by having not enough surgical masks and being bothered by not being able to work from home were associated with a poorer mental health status.

The first hypothesis was that early postpartum dairy cows from different farms differ in the level of inflammation, which might be determined using APP assays in both pooled and individual blood samples. The second hypothesis was that the APP haptoglobin (Hp) might be the most sensitive parameter to detect cows at risk of excessive postpartum inflammation concomitant with systemic disease. Serum concentrations of Hp, serum amyloid-A (SAA), total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), coeruloplasmin (Cp) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in 100 fresh lactating cows (within 0-8 d postpartum) from 10 farms were compared and associated to clinical health parameters (rectal body temperature, vaginal discharge (Metricheck? score), rumen fill, vulvovaginal laceration) using both pooled and individual blood samples. Mean serum concentrations of Hp, SAA and TP revealed significant differences among farms. Pooled serum samples of farms showed high correlations with the mean of individual samples. Only Hp was significantly positively correlated to both body temperature and Metricheck? score. In conclusion, Hp differentiates dairy farms regarding the inflammatory state of transition cows using individual and pooled serum samples within the first week postpartum. It also mirrors the individual degree of inflammation, thus proving to be a diagnostic parameter of high interest during the periparturient period.","output":"Evaluation of different acute-phase proteins for herd health diagnostics in early postpartum Holstein Friesian dairy cows."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first Covid-19 patient was admitted to Montefiore Medical Center (MMC) on March 10, 2020 Soon thereafter there was a rapid and exponential surge of Covid-19 admissions to MMC that could have resulted in catastrophic consequences if MMC had been overwhelmed, as happened in Europe To adjust to this crisis our institution, under the inspiring leadership of Dr Philip Ozuah, President and CEO of Montefiore Medicine, adopted an \\"all hands on deck\\" approach, mobilizing our entire workforce to expand our units to accommodate the growing number of patients being admitted Given that the internal medicine (IM) and ICU units are part of the department of medicine (DOM), the DOM was at the center of this mobilization The DOM is the largest department at MMC and mobilizing it required careful planning, seamless teamwork, and strong leadership To achieve that goal, we applied a framework that we designate the \\"3C framework,\\" denoting Coordination, Communication, and Collaboration In this report we describe the many initiatives the Montefiore Einstein DOM implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic using the 3C framework These included establishing the Medicine Covid-19 Taskforce to lead our efforts, starting a daily newsletter for up-to-date communications, rapidly expanding the ICU and IM units, converting most specialty inpatient consults to eConsults, coordinating research studies, and more The goal of this report is to serve as a guide on how the 3C framework helped us organize, mobilize, and energize the department of medicine effectively and efficiently during this unprecedented crisis","output":"Teamwork and Leadership Under Fire at the Epicenter of the COVID-19 Epidemic in the Bronx"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intertwined with the persisting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world economy, the price of WTI crude oil futures became negative on April 20, 2020.

We compared 80 self-selected subjects (51 vegans, 67% females, and 29 non-vegans, 55% females, p = 0.344). Nutritional status was assessed by bio-electrical impedance and standardized food frequency questionnaires (i.e., contribution of nutrients from foods and supplementation, combined and separate). Serum lipid concentrations and blood pressure (BP) were assessed from annual or initial examination reports, while sociodemographic, economic, and lifestyle statuses were obtained by standardized questionnaires. Finally, a multivariate linear regression model was used to estimate the relationship between total fiber and saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) values. The vegans had a significantly lower body mass index (22.8  2.4 vs. 26.6  3.6 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and body fat % (19.3  7.3 vs. 25.8  8.2%, p < 0.001) than the non-vegans. There were significant differences between vegans and non-vegans in energy intake, and most macronutrient (10/12) and micronutrient (15/23) intakes in units/day. Both diets were well designed, with high fiber and low SFA and free sugar intake but remained insufficient in n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (for vegans), vitamin D, calcium, sodium (for vegans) and iodine. Vegans also had a significantly lower lipid profile and BP than non-vegans, except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, both groups met targeted recommendations.

Automated, objective pain detection from physiological data in patients provides valuable information to hospital staff and caregivers to better manage pain, particularly for patients who are unable to self-report. Galvanic skin response (GSR) is one of the physiologic signals that refers to the changes in sweat gland activity, which can identify features of emotional states and anxiety induced by varying pain levels. This study used different statistical features extracted from GSR data collected from postoperative patients to detect their pain intensity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work building pain models using postoperative adult patients instead of healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to present an automatic pain assessment tool using GSR signals to predict different pain intensities in noncommunicative, postoperative patients. METHODS: The study was designed to collect biomedical data from postoperative patients reporting moderate to high pain levels. We recruited 25 participants aged 23-89 years. First, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit was employed to obtain patients' baseline data. In the second part, the Empatica E4 wristband was worn by patients while they were performing low-intensity activities. Patient self-report based on the numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to record pain intensities that were correlated with objectively measured data. The labels were down-sampled from 11 pain levels to 5 different pain intensities, including the baseline. We used 2 different machine learning algorithms to construct the models. The mean decrease impurity method was used to find the top important features for pain prediction and improve the accuracy. We compared our results with a previously published research study to estimate the true performance of our models. RESULTS: Four different binary classification models were constructed using each machine learning algorithm to classify the baseline and other pain intensities (Baseline [BL] vs Pain Level [PL] 1, BL vs PL2, BL vs PL3, and BL vs PL4). Our models achieved higher accuracy for the first 3 pain models than the BioVid paper approach despite the challenges in analyzing real patient data. For BL vs PL1, BL vs PL2, and BL vs PL4, the highest prediction accuracies were achieved when using a random forest classifier (86.0, 70.0, and 61.5, respectively). For BL vs PL3, we achieved an accuracy of 72.1 using a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. CONCLUSIONS: We are the first to propose and validate a pain assessment tool to predict different pain levels in real postoperative adult patients using GSR signals. We also exploited feature selection algorithms to find the top important features related to different pain intensities.

Whole-brain SWI was used to detect multiple thrombus fragments, and their clinical significance was analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Pretreatment SWI was analyzed for the presence of a single intracranial thrombus or multiple intracranial thrombi. Associations with baseline clinical characteristics, complications, and clinical outcome were studied. RESULTS Single intracranial thrombi were detected in 300 (92.6%), and multiple thrombi, in 24 of 324 patients (7.4%). In 23 patients with multiple thrombi, all thrombus fragments were located in the vascular territory distal to the primary occluding thrombus; in 1 patient, thrombi were found both in the anterior and posterior circulation. Only a minority of thrombus fragments were detected on TOF-MRA, first-pass gadolinium-enhanced MRA, or DSA. Patients with multiple intracranial thrombi presented with more severe symptoms (median NIHSS scores, 15 versus 11; P = .014) and larger ischemic areas (median DWI ASPECTS, 5 versus 7; P = .006); good collaterals, rated on DSA, were fewer than those in patients with a single thrombus (21.1% versus 44.2%, P = .051). The presence of multiple thrombi was a predictor of unfavorable outcome at 3 months (P = .040; OR, 0.251; 95% CI, 0.067-0.939).

Models have been valuable tools during the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks, able to generate possible trajectories of disease burden, evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies, and estimate key transmission variables. Particularly given the rapid pace of model development, evaluation, and integration with decision making in emergency situations, it is necessary to understand the benefits and pitfalls of transmission models. We review and highlight key aspects of the history of infectious disease dynamic models, the role of rigorous testing and evaluation, the integration with data, and the successful application of models to guide public health.

However, these machines cannot precisely simulate a live pitcher's pitching motion. To understand if a batter's movement strategy would be altered due to disparate visual information provided by a pitching machine as opposed to a live pitcher, the present study aimed to compare differences in baseball batting movement patterns under the two delivery conditions. Methods: To examine movement variations and different strategies of each high-level athlete rather than obtaining averaged group performance, single-subject analysis was adopted. Four professional baseball players were recruited to bat around 50 pitches under each delivery condition. Vertical ground reaction forces of the participants' batting movements were recorded. Relative timings of key events and values of several kinetic parameters during batting were examined. Results: When batting against the pitching machine, batters initiated forward stepping earlier (relative to ball release), had smaller loading rate at landing the step, and altered the duration from forward bat swing to ball impact. These results might be attributed to lacking visual cues of a live pitcher's whole body kinematics prior to ball release. Without sufficient visual information, greater uncertainty and incomplete weight transfer affected the batter's decision making and movement execution. Conclusion: The batters in this study did adjust their movement strategy in batting against a pitching machine. With dissimilar batting movement patterns under the two delivery conditions, extensive reliance on training with pitching machines is not recommended.","output":"Differences in Baseball Batting Movement Patterns Between Facing a Pitcher and a Pitching Machine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Through great efforts, the outbreak of 2019 novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) has been slowing down in Wuhan This study was to assess the potential errors of established admission procedures from a tertiary cancer center Methods: A multidisciplinary team of eight frontline nurses and oncologists would conduct a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to our established procedures The FMEA consisted of 4 main steps, Including a detailed review of the on-going admission processes and the drawing of the corresponding flow chart, followed by repeated discussions of the possible errors among those processes, and then evaluation of the occurrence (O), detectability (D), and severity of impact (S) of each failure mode according to a scoring criteria (a five-point scale) Finally, the risk of errors were determined through a calculation of risk priority number (RPN=O*D*S) Results: From March 24, 2020 to May 14, 2020, based on the established procedures, our center has screened 1,214 cancer patients in the oncology outpatient department and subsequent buffer wards No nosocomial infection (among doctors or patients, or between patients and doctors) occurred On the scale of RPN from high to low, ten high-risk steps were identified by FMEA, involving a failure of scheduled screening for particularly vulnerable populations, the failure of hand hygiene in outpatient and buffer wards, and the incorrect disposal of clinical waste by cleaning service staff In addition, the psychological burden to cancer patients might increase the risk of buffer ward management failure Conclusions: Self-review and continuous improvement for established procedures can minimized underlying mistakes Increasing the approaches to treatment appointments, reasonably optimizing the working during for outpatient physicians, strengthening the awareness of hand hygiene (both physicians and patients), and setting up oncological psychological counseling groups will likely improve the potential error steps Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors Funding: Has not received any funding Disclosure: All authors have declared no conflicts of interest","output":"Risk assessment of admission procedures for cancer patients during the convalescence of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus COVID-19 has presented a serious new threat to humans since the first case was reported in Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019 By the end of February 2020 the virus has spread to 57 countries with nearly 86,000 cases, and there is currently no effective vaccination available Chinese herbal medicine has been used in this epidemic with encouraging results, but with concerns regarding disturbance of patients' digestive function This study aims to explore the role of acupuncture in treating COVID-19 by investigating relevant current literature along with classical Chinese medicine texts on epidemics Based on this analysis, acupuncture points and strategies are suggested for practitioners to use as a guide to treatment","output":"Acupuncture in the Treatment of COVID-19: An Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and interferon beta-1a compared to lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta-1a in patients with confirmed COVID-19, who are moderately ill.

Specifically, the study analyzed: (a) if different conditions were associated with different levels of distress, different levels of worry, and different emotion regulation strategies (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression); and (b) if distress levels were associated with levels of worry about COVID-19, emotion regulation strategies, and changes to medical treatment due to the pandemic. METHOD: This cross-sectional study involved 124 individuals (79.8% female; mean age = 48.88 years; SD = 14.95) with a diagnosis of chronic disease. The questionnaires, administered during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy (April-May 2020), comprised the Perceived Stress Scale, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, a COVID-19 worry questionnaire, and a questionnaire designed to collect anamnestic and sociodemographic data. RESULTS: Higher levels of expressive suppression and worries related to COVID-19, and changes to medical treatment due to the pandemic, were associated with higher perceived stress in patients with a preexisting chronic disease. No differences emerged in the study variables according to the type of chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of considering expressive suppression, levels of worry about COVID-19, and changes to scheduled medical treatment.

Even people not directly affected by the virus itself were impacted in their physical and/or mental health, as well as in their financial security, by governmental lockdown measures. We investigated whether the combination of these events had changed people's appraisal of social scenes by testing 241 participants recruited mainly in Italy, Austria, and Germany in an online, preregistered study conducted about 50 days after the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. Images depicting individuals alone, in small groups (up to four people), and in large groups (more than seven people) were rated in terms of valence, arousal, and perceived physical distance. Pre-pandemic normative ratings were obtained from a validated database (OASIS). Several self-report measures were also taken, and condensed into four factors through factor analysis. All images were rated as more arousing compared to the pre-pandemic period, and the greater the decrease in real-life physical interactions reported by participants, the higher the ratings of arousal. As expected, only images depicting large gatherings of people were rated less positively during, compared to before, the pandemic. These ratings of valence were, however, moderated by a factor that included participants' number of days in isolation, relationship closeness, and perceived COVID-19 threat. Higher scores on this factor were associated with more positive ratings of images of individuals alone and in small groups, suggesting an increased appreciation of safer social situations, such as intimate and small-group contacts. The same factor was inversely related to the perceived physical distance between individuals in images of small and large groups, suggesting an impact of lockdown measures and contagion-related worries on the representation of interpersonal space. These findings point to rapid and compelling psychological and social consequences of the lockdown measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic on the perception of social groups. Further studies should assess the long-term impact of such events as typical everyday life is restored.","output":"Large Gatherings? No, Thank You.

Investigations on the colorimetric and photodynamic properties of a series of these materials were implemented through CIELab evaluation, as well as photooxidation and antibacterial studies. Generally, the photodynamic efficacy of these dual-dyed fabrics was impacted by both the choice, and how much of the traditional cationic dye was employed in the dyeing of the W/A fabrics.

Compared to 36 non-COVID-19 patients, those with COVID-19 were younger (P=0.016) with a lower serum creatinine on hospital admission (P=0.049), and lesser degrees of metabolic acidosis (P<0.001) and lactatemia (P<0.001) before initiation of RRT. In addition, the duration of RRT requirement was longer (P<0.001). Despite lower CVVHF exchange rates with higher serum creatinine levels following RRT initiation in the COVID-19 patients, metabolic abnormalities were corrected. Hospital mortality was 60% among COVID-19 patients requiring RRT, compared to 67% in non-COVID-19 patients (P=0.508), and renal recovery among survivors without pre-existing CKD was similar (P=0.231). CONCLUSIONS: The requirement for RRT in COVID-19 patients was primarily related to fluid balance. Using lower CVVHF exchange rates was effective to correct metabolic abnormalities. Renal recovery occurred in all but one patient by 60 days in the 40% of patients who survived.","output":"Comparison of renal replacement therapy and renal recovery before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a single center observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research presents an integrated approach combining Coloured Petri Nets and Interpretive Structural Modelling, called hybrid ISM-CPN model, to risk assessment of wind farms development. The dynamic nature of the component elements of wind farms and considering the risks interdependencies motivate this combination. A questionnaire survey targeting experts is conducted for calculating the modified Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs). Thirty-four factors are ranked, and the nine CSFs identified as Political instability, Sanctions, Economic insecurity, Interest rate fluctuations, Exchange rate fluctuations, Inflation rate fluctuations, Feasibility risk, Shortage of capital risk, and Supplier risk. The values of RPNT = 260.26, RPNC = 251.31, and RPNQ = 238.77 indicate that Exchange rate fluctuations is the most important critical risk. The second one, is Political instability with RPNT = 255.35, RPNC = 247.28, and RPNQ = 230.56. The simulation results of a 50 MW wind farm reveal, with a 90% confidence level, Sanctions would cause 43.9% increase in project execution time and 28% decrease in project quality, and Shortage of capital risk has the greatest impact on project cost, with a 25.79% increase.

Nevertheless, there is no evidence that their digital native characteristics determine whether or not they would use technology in the classroom. Although not widely evaluated, the four-factor, 21-item Digital Nativity Assessment Scale (DNAS) was one of the first instruments to assess digital nativeness (DN). This study aim is to explore the influence of pre-service teachers DN on their intention to use technology in the future classroom in Serbia, by evaluating the DNAS on Serbian sample and using it for measuring the DN. Six variables were incorporated to examine their mutual relationships based on technology acceptance model: digital nativeness, behavioral intention (BI), perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), subjective norm (SN), and technological complexity (TC). Data were collected from 688 pre-service teachers in Serbia. Exploratory factor analysis confirmed a four-factor model for the DNAS, and Serbian pre-service teachers demonstrated a high level of DN. To evaluate the hypothesized model structural equation modeling was utilized. The suggested model had a good fit for describing the BI of Serbian pre-service teachers, accounting for 27.1% of the variance in BI. It was found that direct dominant predictors of BI are digital native traits, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Significant influence of digital native traits on all other variables in the model was also confirmed.

Particularly, nursing students experience greater stress as their normal curriculum is interrupted and some of them face the risk of being infected as frontline workers. Nursing faculty members may face similar struggles, in addition to developing teaching materials for online learning. Thus, it is important to examine the faculty members' and students' views on their ability to adapt during the pandemic to obtain a holistic view of how learning and training has been affected. DESIGN: The descriptive cross-sectional quantitative design was used. SETTINGS: Data were collected from Southeast and East Asian Nursing Education and Research Network (SEANERN) affiliated nursing institutions from January 2021 to August 2021. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1897 nursing students and 395 faculty members from SEANERN-affiliated nursing institutions in Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam were recruited for this study. METHODS: Quantitative surveys were used to explore the satisfaction levels in education modalities, confidence levels, psychosocial well-being, sense of coherence and stress levels of nursing students and faculty members during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Participants were mostly satisfied with the new education modalities, although most students felt that their education was compromised. Both groups showed positive levels of psychosocial well-being, despite scoring low to medium on the sense of coherence scale and experiencing great stress. The participants' sense of coherence was positively correlated with their psychosocial well-being and negatively correlated with stress levels. CONCLUSIONS: While the COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impacted the lives of nursing students and faculty members, most of them had a healthy level of psychosocial well-being. Having a strong sense of coherence was associated with better psychosocial health and lower stress levels. As such, it may be helpful to develop interventions aimed at improving the sense of coherence of nursing students and staff to help them manage stressors better.","output":"Salutogenesis and COVID-19 pandemic impacting nursing education across SEANERN affiliated universities: A multi-national study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 causes multi-organ dysfunction with significant morbidity and mortality.

This study (1) describes the production of an alternative low-cost dressing and (2) compares the alternative dressing and Xeroform using the metrics of cost-effectiveness, antimicrobial activity, and biocompatibility in vitro, and wound healing in vivo. METHODS To produce the alternative dressing, 3% bismuth tribromophenate powder was combined with petroleum jelly by hand and applied to Kerlix gauze. To assess cost-effectiveness, the unit costs of Xeroform and components of the alternative dressing were compared. To assess antimicrobial properties, the dressings were placed on agar plated with Escherichia coli and the Kirby-Bauer assay performed. To assess biocompatibility, the dressings were incubated with human dermal fibroblasts and cells stained with methylene blue. To assess in vivo wound healing, dressings were applied to excisional wounds on rats and the rate of re-epithelialization calculated. RESULTS The alternative dressing costs 34% of the least expensive brand of Xeroform. Antimicrobial assays showed that both dressings had similar bacteriostatic effects. Biocompatibility assays showed that there was no statistical difference (P < 0.05) in the cytotoxicity of Xeroform, alternative dressing, and Kerlix gauze. Finally, the in vivo healing model showed no statistical difference (P < 0.05) in mean re-epithelialization time between Xeroform (13.0  1.6 days) and alternative dressing (13.5  1.0 days). CONCLUSIONS Xeroform is biocompatible, reduces infection, and enhances healing of burn wounds by preventing desiccation and mechanical trauma.

Methods: In this clinical retrospective study, the levels of serum calcium, hormone levels and clinical laboratory parameters of admission were recorded. The clinical severity and outcome variables were also recorded. Results: From February 10 to February 28 2020, 241 patients were enrolled in this study. Of these patients, 180 (74.7%) had hypocalcemia on admission. The median serum calcium levels were 2.12 (IQR, 2.04-2.20) mmol/L, median parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were 55.27 (IQR, 42.73-73.15) pg/mL, median 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (VD) levels were 10.20 (IQR, 8.20-12.65) ng/mL. The serum calcium levels were significantly positive correlated with VD levels (P =0.004), whereas negative correlated with PTH levels (P = 0.048). Patients with lower serum calcium levels (especially 2.0 mmol/L) had worse clinical parameters, higher incidence of organ injury septic shock and higher 28-day mortality.

Recent advances aimed at improving outcomes and reducing CAP disease burden are summarized. RECENT FINDINGS Emerging data suggests that newer CAP risk stratification indices based on disease severity hold promise in predicting intensive care need. Additional evidence supports a role of procalcitonin and pro-adrenomedullin as biomarkers of disease severity and for guiding antimicrobial therapy. New diagnostic tools have greatly contributed to early diagnosis and better-targeted therapy. There is increasing recognition of the role of coinfections in CAP. In patients with severe disease, therefore, current guidelines advise against monotherapy. Although inclusion of coverage for atypical pathogens in nonsevere CAP has been challenged, evidence suggests that such coverage is beneficial in patients with severe disease. Use of steroids as adjunctive therapy for CAP, however, is associated with complications and prolonged hospitalization. Updated prevention strategies include approval of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for adults at risk.

There are few studies exploring policymakers perspectives towards PC services, with most shedding light on obstacles to PC development. Furthermore, no study has explored policymakers perspectives towards providing PC at the national level in resource-limited countries. This study provides a platform for providing PC as part of the Palestinian healthcare system (HCS) by exploring policymakers perspectives on PC, an essential step to developing a PC programme. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study design was employed using semi-structured interviews. Participants were those identified as responsible for making executive and legislative decisions about health services (including PC) in the HCS. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Twelve decision and policymakers participated in the study. Four categories were generated from the content analysis: (1) the nature of current PC healthcare services, (2) the potential benefits of PC, (3) challenges to providing PC, and (4) considerations in providing PC. The current PC services provided to Palestinian patients with life-limiting illnesses and their families are not comprehensive, and are limited to symptom management. There is a Palestinian national strategic plan for developing PC; however, the development goals are not clearly defined, and the plans capabilities are inadequate. Several challenges to the provision of PC were found to relate to issues of education and training, the allocation of funding, and the availability of medications. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating PC into the Palestinian university curricula as a compulsory course and establishing higher degree programmes in PC to overcome the shortage of PC specialists is required. Developing policies aligned with national laws could help enhance health services to patients and their families and resolve several challenges. Cooperating with national and international institutions in seeking funding could boost PC development and medication availability.

Material and Methods: A long-term campaign involves the measurement of different PM (particulate matter) fractions, using portable direct-reading instrumentation. The measurements will be carried out in two different seasons for two consecutive weeks. The data relating to the exposure concentrations will be acquired at the same time by a subject in WFH conditions for 24 hours per day, and by a second subject in WFO conditions for 8 working hours. In a short-term campaign, at least 50 subjects are expected to be enrolled, who will carry out two consecutive monitoring days (respectively in WFO and WFH conditions). Results and Conclusions: Preliminary results (for both campaigns) indicate that, on average, the levels of exposure to the different PM fractions are higher during the WFH mode. The WFH/WFO ratios calculated on the different PM fractions are on average equal to 2.4 and 1.9 respectively for the short-term and long-term campaign. Differences in terms of median exposure concentrations measured during the two working conditions are statistically significant (p<0.001 for all PM fractions, in both campaigns).","output":"Exposure assessment to atmospheric pollutants in different working conditions: WFO (Working from Office) versus WFH (Working from Home)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article provides information on the patent activity of inventors in relation to applications for inventions related to coronaviruses, in particular, to SARS-CoV-2.

Study Design: An analytical cross-sectional and a follow-up study Place and Duration of Study: An institutional COVID-19 quarantine center, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between May 2020 and July 2021 Methodology: A sample of 138 participants were recruited. After obtaining the participants demographics date and consent, an electronic questionnaire was distributed to assess participants psychological well-being using the 42-item depression, anxiety, and stress scales (DASS) twice, at the end of quarantine period and one year later, to compare outcomes and associated factors. Results: Out of all the sample (n=138), male represented 64.5% while female accounted for 35.5%. Half the participants (50.7%) were married comparing to 40.6% single and bachelor's or higher degrees holders accounted for 61.6% while 26.8% had high school degree. The psychological health was assessed for all participants twice, resulting with prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress during quarantine period of 34%, 33%, and 22% respectively and a decreased prevalence a year late (20%, 13%, and 9, respectively). The differences between the two psychological assessments were significant (depression: P = .02, anxiety: P<.001, stress: P=.005). Educational level was associated with stress at time of quarantine (P=.03). Marital status and employment status were significantly associated with participants depression levels a year after quarantine (P=.03, P=.04, respectively). Conclusion and Recommendations: The psychological well-being of quarantined participants was negatively impacted during this unlikable experience. Numerous demographic factors were significantly associated with the undesirable effects.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the extent to which individual resilience, well-being and demographic characteristics may predict two indicators of Coronavirus pandemic: distress symptoms and perceived danger. METHOD: Two independent samples were employed: 1) 605 respondents recruited through an internet panel company; 2) 741 respondents recruited through social media, using snowball sampling. Both samples filled a structured online questionnaire. Correlations between psychological/demographic variables and distress and perceived danger were examined. Path analysis was conducted to identify predictive indicators of distress and perceived danger. RESULTS: Significant negative correlations were found between individual/community resilience and sense of danger (-0.220 and -0.255 respectively; p < .001) and distress symptoms (- 0.398 and -0.544 respectively; p < .001). Significant positive correlations were found between gender, community size, economic difficulties and sense of danger (0.192, 0.117 and 0.244 respectively; p < .001). Gender and economic difficulties also positively correlated with distress symptoms (0.130 and 0.214 respectively; p < .001). Path analysis revealed that all paths were significant (p < .008 to .001) except between family income and distress symptoms (p = .12). The seven predictors explained 20% of sense of danger variance and 34% the distress symptoms variance. The most highly predictive indicators were the two psychological characteristics, individual resilience, and well-being. Age, gender, community size, and economic difficulties due to COVID-19 further add to predicting distress, while community and national resilience do not. . CONCLUSIONS: Individual resilience and well-being have been found as the first and foremost predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. Though both predictors are complex and may be influenced by many factors, given the potential return of COVID-19 threat and other future health pandemic threats to our world, we must rethink and develop ways to reinforce them.","output":"Resilience and demographic characteristics predicting distress during the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the positive psychology approach, the present study claims that Leader-Member Exchange Theory and Person-Job Fit Theory could be significant antecedents of flow experience in the workplace, as individuals living in the 21st century spend most of their lives at work. Flow experience is a source of high motivation for employees in terms of both cognitive and emotional functions. Therefore, the concept can cause many psychological states of well-being, such as having fun, feeling happy, or optimism. For this reason, it is quite important for the organizational behavior discipline to define the concept in detail and to focus on possible antecedents. In accordance with this purpose, a cross-sectional research study has been performed in Turkey with the participation of 711 white-collar employees from various companies in the service sector in Istanbul, Turkey. The findings of the research show that high quality manager-employee relationships had significant positive impacts on employees' flow experience ( = 0,801; t = 35,664; p = ,000). In addition, a good match between person and job had significant positive impacts on employees' flow experience ( = 0,559; t = 17,968; p = ,000). Thus, the proposed hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 of the study were supported. The results indicated that leader-member exchange and person-job fit are antecedents of flow experience in the workplace (p < 0,05). In the present study, all study variables are reviewed and the possible relationships among the study variables are discussed in the literature review part.

This model allows determination of the SF level at which fibrin microclots begin to form and the length of time the resulting microclots persist under normal fibrinolytic attack.

However, due to their ecological design based on large spatial units, they neglect the strong localised air-pollution patterns, and potentially lead to inadequate confounding adjustment. We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 on COVID-19 mortality in England using high geographical resolution. In this nationwide cross-sectional study in England, we included 38,573 COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level (n = 32,844 small areas). We retrieved averaged NO2 and PM2.5 concentration during 2014C2018 from the Pollution Climate Mapping. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of air-pollution while adjusting for a series of confounding and spatial autocorrelation.

This corresponds to a posterior probability of a positive effect equal to 0.93 and 0.78 respectively. The spatial relative risk at LSOA level revealed strong patterns, similar for the different pollutants. This potentially captures the spread of the disease during the first wave of the epidemic.

Neocolonial patterns in global health at large and recent opinion reports indicate that stakeholders from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may be under-represented at such conferences. This study aims to describe the factors that impact LMIC representation at global health conferences. METHODS: A systematic review of articles reporting factors determining global health conference attendance was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Articles presenting conference demographics and data on the barriers and/or facilitators to attendance were included. Articles were screened at title and abstract level by four independent reviewers. Eligible articles were read in full text, analysed and evaluated with a risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Among 8765 articles screened, 46 articles met inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis yielded two themes: barriers to conference attendance and facilitators to conference attendance. In total, 112 conferences with 254 601 attendees were described, of which 4% of the conferences were hosted in low-income countries. Of the 98 302 conference attendees, for whom affiliation was disclosed, 38 167 (39%) were from LMICs. CONCLUSION: Conference inequity is common in global health, with LMIC attendees under-represented at global health conferences.

Otorhinolaryngologists (ORLs) are suspected to be at high risk of infection, due to the high viral load in the mucosa of the upper airways. The current review evaluates the impact of the pandemic on ORLs' activities and assesses the risk infection. METHODS: A selective literature research was conducted using relevant English and German terms for ORL, SARS-CoV-2, risk, and infection at PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv, as well as in the Deutsches ?rzteblatt and on the websites of the Robert Koch Institute and the Johns Hopkins University. RESULTS: Protection recommendations for ORL include general hygiene measures and wearing KN95 masks for routine professional activities. When in contact with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, it is recommended to extend the personal protective equipment by eye protection, gloves, cap, and gown. International otorhinolaryngology societies have released guidelines for procedures (e.g., tracheostomy, sinus surgery), propagating personal protection for the surgical team and reduction of aerosols. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients and medical staff can contribute to reducing the risk of infection. Vaccination would provide some additional protection for ORLs and other health care professionals with increased exposure to aerosols. There is increasing evidence that ORLs are at a high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2.

RESULTS With incremental base-case vaccination coverage up to 50% among persons at lower risk and 0% increment among persons at higher risk, each of two intervention strategies averted nearly one quarter of acute HBV infections (3-dose strategy: 24.8%; 2-dose strategy: 24.6%). Societal incremental cost per QALY gained of $152,722 (Interquartile range: $119,113, $235,086) and $155,429 (Interquartile range: $120,302, $242,226) were estimated for 3-dose and 2-dose strategies, respectively. Risk of acute HBV infection showed the strongest influence.

Herein, we describe a mimetic of the HIV-1 gp41 HR1 trimer, N3G, as a promising therapeutic against HIV-1 infection. Surprisingly, we found that in addition to protection against HIV-1 infection, N3G was also highly effective in inhibiting infection of human -coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV-2, possibly by binding the HR2 region in the spike protein of -coronaviruses to block their hexameric structure formation. These studies demonstrate the potential utility of anti-HIV-1 HR1 peptides in inhibiting human -coronavirus infection. Moreover, this strategy could be extended to the design of broad-spectrum antivirals based on the supercoiling structure of peptides.","output":"Supercoiling Structure-Based Design of a Trimeric Coiled-Coil Peptide with High Potency against HIV-1 and Human -Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns over secondary infections because it has limited treatment options and empiric antimicrobial treatment poses serious risks of aggravating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients are predisposed to develop secondary infections. This study was conducted to ascertain the prevalence and profiles of co- & secondary infections in patients at the COVID-19 facility in North India. METHODS: We studied the profile of pathogens isolated from 290 clinical samples. Bacterial and fungal pathogens were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the Vitek2? system. Additionally, respiratory samples were tested for any viral/atypical bacterial co-infections and the presence of AMR genes by FilmArray test. The clinical and outcome data of these patients were also recorded for demographic and outcome measures analyses. RESULTS: A total of 151 (13%) patients had secondary infections, and most got infected within the first 14 days of hospital admission. Patients aged >50 years developed severe symptoms (p = 0.0004) and/or had a fatal outcome (p = 0.0005). In-hospital mortality was 33%.K.pneumoniae (33.3%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by A. baumannii (27.1%). The overall resistance was up to 84%.Majority of the organisms were multidrug-resistant (MDR) harbouring MDR genes.

Primarily, direct-acting antivirals rely on inhibition of the interaction between ACE2 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein or targeting the more conserved heptad repeats (HRs), involved in the membrane fusion process. The inhibition of host TMPRSS2 and cathepsins B/L may represent a complementary strategy to be investigated.

STIs and bloodborne viruses (BBVs) are over-represented in people experiencing broader health inequalities, which include those with mild learning disabilities. Self-managed care, including self-sampling for STIs/BBVs, is increasingly commonplace, requiring agency and health literacy. To inform the development of a partner notification trial, we explored barriers and facilitators to correct use of an STI/BBV self-sampling pack among people with mild learning disabilities. METHODS: Using purposive and convenience sampling we conducted four interviews and five gender-specific focus groups with 25 people (13 women, 12 men) with mild learning disabilities (July-August 2018) in Scotland. We balanced deductive and inductive thematic analyses of audio transcripts to explore issues associated with barriers and facilitators to correct use of the pack. RESULTS: All participants found at least one element of the pack challenging or impossible, but welcomed the opportunity to undertake sexual health screening without attending a clinic and welcomed the inclusion of condoms. Reported barriers to correct use included perceived overly complex STI/BBV information and instructions, feeling overwhelmed and the manual dexterity required for blood sampling. Many women struggled interpreting anatomical diagrams depicting vulvovaginal self-swabbing. Facilitators included pre-existing STI/BBV knowledge, familiarity with self-management, good social support and knowing that the service afforded privacy. CONCLUSION: In the first study to explore the usability of self-sampling packs for STI/BBV in people with learning disabilities, participants found it challenging to use the pack. Limiting information to the minimum required to inform decision-making, 'easy read' formats, simple language, large font sizes and simpler diagrams could improve acceptability. However, some people will remain unable to engage with self-sampling at all. To avoid widening health inequalities, face-to-face options should continue to be provided for those unable or unwilling to engage with self-managed care.","output":"How can we make self-sampling packs for sexually transmitted infections and bloodborne viruses more inclusive?

Long-term inhalation exposure to talc is associated with an interstitial lung disease termed talcosis, commonly seen in miners, industry workers, and IV drug users. However, it may unfortunately manifest in the general public secondary to chronic inhalation of talc-containing products. Here, we present a unique case of talcum powder pica induced pulmonary talcosis. 31-year-old female from Jamaica presented for evaluation of mild hemoptysis, subjective fevers, cough, weight loss, and dyspnea of three months duration. Vital signs were unremarkable. Physical examination was notable for bilateral costochondral tenderness. Labs were significant for elevated ESR and CRP. CT chest revealed bilateral apical predominant dense, consolidative airspace opacities with adjacent branching nodular densities and diffuse ground-glass opacification with innumerable miliary nodules. The patient was admitted for tuberculosis rule out. QuantiFERON-TB Gold and four sputum AFB smears and cultures resulted negative. Further questioning revealed history of intentional oral talcum powder ingestion from childhood until age 27. She underwent hemoptysis work-up in Jamaica including lung biopsy for confirmation of suspected sarcoidosis. However, results of pathology confirmed a diagnosis of pulmonary talcosis consistent with her history. Given CT findings, SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated and resulted positive. However, pharmacologic therapy was not indicated given lack of oxygen requirement. She was discharged with outpatient Pulmonary follow-up. Pulmonary talcosis develops with chronic inhalation or intravenous exposure. Talco-silicosis and talco-asbestosis are seen in miners and industrial workers exposed to high levels of inhaled impure talc. Chronic exposure to cosmetic talc also has the potential to cause talcosis. Lung parenchymal changes are not always acutely evident and may manifest up to four decades after inciting events. Pathologic changes occur in the following three major patterns: diffuse interstitial fibrosis, nodular fibrosis, and foreign body granulomatosis. Pica is defined as the persistent consumption of nonnutritive substances that is not socially acceptable and occurs in the context of mental or medical disorders. As a result of an underlying psychiatric diagnosis, pica behavior was the driving force behind our patient's consumption of talc, resulting in chronic, repetitive inhalation exposure, and ultimately led to the development of pulmonary talcosis. Although our patient reported cessation of consumption four years prior, her exposure over time was significant enough for talcosis to develop.

Expression of IP-10 is seen in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells into sites of tissue inflammation. To determine the in vivo function of IP-10, we constructed an IP-10-deficient mouse (IP-10(-/-)) by targeted gene disruption. Immunological analysis revealed that IP-10(-/-) mice had impaired T cell responses. T cell proliferation to allogeneic and antigenic stimulation and IFN-gamma secretion in response to antigenic challenge were impaired in IP-10(-/-) mice. In addition, IP-10(-/-) mice exhibited an impaired contact hypersensitivity response, characterized by decreased ear swelling and reduced inflammatory cell infiltrates. T cells recovered from draining lymph nodes also had a decreased proliferative response to Ag restimulation. Furthermore, IP-10(-/-) mice infected with a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus had an impaired ability to control viral replication in the brain. This was associated with decreased recruitment of CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes into the brain, reduced levels of IFN-gamma and the IFN-gamma-induced chemokines monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig, CXCL9) and IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC, CXCL11) in the brain, decreased numbers of virus-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD8(+) cells in the spleen, and reduced levels of demyelination in the CNS.

Best practices to support children's healthy eating include teachers sitting together with children, eating the same food, and appropriately supporting children in serving and feeding themselves. To understand how the COVID-19 pandemic changed mealtime practices in ECE, this study (1) describes what adaptations ECE directors and teachers made to mealtimes to include best practices, and (2) identifies common adaptations made to comply with COVID-19 infection control guidelines. METHODS: This cross-sectional, mixed-methods study utilized survey and interview questions based on the Trust Model and Social Cognitive Theory. More than 7000 surveys were distributed to ECE directors and teachers in Florida. Surveys were completed by 759 directors and 431 teachers. Also, 29 follow-up interviews with teachers were completed. Participants were asked to describe their mealtimes before and during COVID-19. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were used to analyze survey data and thematic analysis was applied to interview data. RESULTS: Less than 5% of survey respondents reported children serving themselves, a pre-COVID best practice. Interviews identified three common adaptations: (1) modification-best practices were incorporated into new routines, such as eating together but sitting farther away (2) elimination-routines changed so that best practices were no longer possible, such as teachers wearing masks and standing during meals, and (3) minimal change-minimal changes due to COVID-19 occurred and consequently mealtime practices did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Current recommendations do not allow children to self-serve, which previously was a key best practice. ECE centers that have successfully integrated COVID-19 modifications and maintained mealtime best practices-perhaps in a new form-can serve as examples for others.

Two opposite positions emerged. Those convinced of a sinusoidal seasonality recurring over one-year period driven by climate. Those believing that a fluctuation of the outbreaks repeats without limits, in the absence of control measures. We studied the series of daily confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in 30 different countries (February 2020 - December 2021), investigating the hypothesis of whether seasonal and geographic variations may guide the pandemic trajectory. Methods: We chose 30 countries from different geographies and climates. With a discrete Fourier transform, we performed a spectral analysis of the series of the daily SARS-CoV-2 infections, looking for peaks in the frequency spectrum that could correspond to a recurrent cycle of a given length. This analysis allows to question whether COVID-19 outbreaks have an observable seasonal periodicity. Results: All the 30 investigated countries see the recurrence of at least one COVID-19 wave, repeating over a period in the range 3 - 9 months, with a peak of magnitude at least half as large as that of the highest peak ever experienced since the beginning of the pandemic until December 2021. We also computed the distance in days between the two higher peaks in each country, and then we averaged those values over the 30 countries, yielding a mean of 190 days (SD 100). This suggests that outbreaks may repeat with cycles of different lengths, without a precisely predictable seasonality of one year. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to occur worldwide, with cycles of repetition of variable lengths.

Where closure is not possible, or the wound subsequently breaks down, wounds may be left to heal from the bottom up (healing by secondary intention). Surgical wound healing by secondary intention (SWHSI) frequently presents a significant management challenge. Additional treatments are often required during the course of healing, and thus a significant financial burden is associated with treating these wounds. Increasingly, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is used in the management of SWHSI. This wound dressing system provides a negative pressure (vacuum) to the wound, removing fluid into a canister, which is believed to be conducive to wound healing. Despite the increasing use of NPWT, there is limited robust evidence for the effectiveness of this device. A well-designed and conducted randomised controlled trial is now required to ascertain if NPWT is a clinically and cost-effective treatment for SWHSI. METHODS: SWHSI-2 is a pragmatic, multi-centre, cross surgical specialty, two arm, parallel group, randomised controlled superiority trial. Adult patients with a SWHSI will be randomised to receive either NPWT or usual care (no NPWT) and will be followed up for 12 months. The primary outcome will be time to healing (defined as full epithelial cover in absence of a scab) in number of days since randomisation. Secondary outcomes will include key clinical events (hospital admission or discharge, treatment status, reoperation, amputation, antibiotic use and death), wound infection, wound pain, health-related quality of life, health utility and resource use. DISCUSSION: Given the increasing use of NPWT, despite limited high-quality supporting evidence, the SWHSI-2 Trial will provide robust evidence on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of NPWT in the management of SWHSI.

Results: Sixty patients (21 females; median age 61 years, range 38C81 years) were included. Inter-reader agreement improved from good to excellent when mlCXR instead of CXR was used (k = 0.831 vs. k = 0.742). Sensitivity for pneumonia detection improved from 79.5% to 92.3%, however, on the cost of specificity 100% vs. 71.4% (p = 0.031). Overall, sensitivity for the detection of consolidation was higher than for GGO (37.5% vs. 70.4%; respectively). No differences could be found in disease extent estimation between mlCXR and CXR, even though the detection of GGO could be improved. Diagnostic confidence was better on mlCXR compared to CXR (p = 0.013).

One inexpensive and noninvasive screening method for COVID-19 is the analysis of chest X-ray (CXR) images for pathological features in the lungs. These features are difficult to detect by humans, but convolutional neural networks (CNN) have proven effective at extracting them. This paper uses four ImageNet-pre-trained CNNs: VGG16, DenseNet201, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB3 to perform transfer learning to a task of COVID-19 CXR image detection on a dataset containing COVID-19, healthy, and viral pneumonia CXR images. We compare the performance of the retrained CNNs using standard measures and investigate the features they use for their predictions using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). The networks are retrained on two classification tasks: Task 1 consists of classifying healthy and COVID-19 CXR images and task 2 consists of classifying viral pneumonia and COVID-19 CXR images. We find that DenseNet201 and VGG16 achieve higher accuracies than ResNet50 and EfficientN etB3 in both tasks. However, the LIME explanations reveal that VGG16 does not learn disease-relevant features in the lungs, while DenseNet201, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB3 use regions in the lungs to make their predictions. This observation is reinforced by comparing LIME explanations with ground-truth lung regions on an unseen dataset.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort design, leveraging 2015C2020 data on all members 65 years and older with no prior ADRD diagnosis, enrolled in a large integrated healthcare system for at least 2 years. Incident ADRD was defined as the first ICD\\\\10 code at any encounter, including outpatient (face\\\\to\\\\face, video, or phone), hospital (emergency department, observation, or inpatient), or continuing care (home, skilled nursing facility, and long\\\\term care). We also examined incident ADRD codes and use of telehealth by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and spoken language. RESULTS: Compared to overall annual incidence rates for ADRD codes in 2017C2019, 2020 incidence was slightly lower (1.30% vs. 1.40%), partially compensating later in the year for reduced rates during the early months of the pandemic.

Clinical and experimental studies suggest a sexual dimorphism in HI-induced brain injury and therapy responses. A major hallmark of HI pathophysiology is the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the injured brain. However, the specific role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in neonatal HI is still unknown. METHODS: Nine-day-old mice were exposed to HI by ligation of the right common carotid artery followed by 1 hour hypoxia (10% oxygen). Using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and microarray analyses, Tregs were investigated in the brain, spleen, and blood 24 hours post HI. The functional role of Tregs was evaluated by acute Treg depletion in depletion of regulatory T cells transgenic mice. Brain injury, neuroinflammatory responses, and vascular injury were analyzed via immunohistochemistry and Western blot 48 hours and 7 days after HI. Functional outcome was assessed 3 days and 5 weeks after HI. RESULTS: Female mice revealed an increased cerebral Treg infiltration, coinciding with elevated chemokine receptor expression. Treg depletion in females aggravated HI-induced brain tissue injury, short-term motor deficits, and long-term deficits in exploratory activity, paralleled by an increased microglia and endothelial activation and leukocyte infiltration. Treg depletion in male mice reduced HI-induced brain injury, short-term motor, and long-term cognitive deficits, associated with reduced vascular injury. Ex vivo isolated female Tregs displayed an increased immunosuppressive activity on effector T cell proliferation and an increased gene enrichment in pathways related to enhanced Treg activity. CONCLUSIONS: Tregs from neonatal female mice provide endogenous neuroprotection, whereas Tregs from male mice increase secondary neurodegeneration. As potential mechanisms, we identified intrinsic transcriptional differences associated with enhanced anti-inflammatory activity of female Tregs.

STUDY DESIGN: Sentinel data obtained for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus cases were analyzed and compared between the season 2019/2020 and the five previous seasons. RESULTS: We observed a rapid and statistically significant reduction of cumulative cases for all these viruses within short time after the lockdown in March 2020, compared to previous seasons (each p < 0.001). Also, sentinel screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections was performed and a decrease of SARS-CoV-2 was seen after the lockdown. While for the seasonally occurring viruses as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus the lockdown led to the end of the annual epidemics, a re-increase of rhinovirus infections was observed after liberalization of numerous lockdown measures. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that occurrence of different respiratory virus infections reflect not only the efficiency of lockdown measures taken against SARS-CoV-2 but it shows also the effects of lockdown releases on the transmission of respiratory viruses.","output":"Significant impact of nationwide SARS-CoV-2 lockdown measures on the circulation of other respiratory virus infections in Austria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a global confinement of more than 2 months in Spain. As a result, the general population has significantly decreased their physical activity levels. The consequences of this abrupt, sedentary lifestyle in Spanish people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) were unknown. Our aim was to examine the impact of COVID-19 home confinement on neuromuscular performance, functional capacity, physical self-perception, and anxiety in pwMS. METHODS: Eighteen pwMS (8:10 men/women, age: 43.4110.88 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale: 2.851.34) participated in the study. Rate of force development (RFD) and maximal voluntary isometric contraction during knee extension in both legs, Timed-Up and Go test (TUG), sit-to-stand test, 6 min walk test, 10 m walk test, Physical-Self Perception Questionnaire (PSPQ) and State-Train Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were performed just before and after home confinement. RESULTS: A non-significant moderate effect (p = 0.07; ES = -0.48) was observed in the time in the sit-to-stand test compared to pre-home confinement. There was a significant increase in the time in TUG (p = 0.02; ES = -0.67). The PSQP score decreased (p = 0.01; ES = 0.79) and STAI-state increased (p = 0.01; ES = -0.65) following home confinement.

We compared 30-day hospitalization/re-hospitalization and clinical outcomes between patients on chronic DOAC therapy and patients not on oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy at time of COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: We used data from TriNetX, a global federated health research network. Patients aged 18 years who were treated with DOACs at time of COVID-19 diagnosis between 20 January 2020 and 28 February 2021 were included, and matched with patients not on OAC therapy from the same period. All patients were followed-up at 30-days after COVID-19 diagnosis. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, hospitalization/re-hospitalization, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). RESULTS: 738,423 patients were included. After propensity score matching (PSM), 26,006 patients remained in the study (13,003 on DOACs; 13,003 not on OAC). DOAC-treated patients (mean age 67.1  15.4 years, 52.2% male) had higher relative risks (RRs) and lower 30-days event-free survival as compared to patients not on OAC for all-cause mortality (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12C1.44; Log-Rank test p = 0.010), hospitalization/re-hospitalization (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.64C1.82; Log-Rank test p < 0.001) and VTE (RR 4.51, 95% CI 3.91C5.82; Log-Rank test p < 0.001), but not for ICH (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.54C1.51; Log-Rank test p = 0.513).

The spread and prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been an influential risk factor for abuse. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the rate of abuse in patients with SCI during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study population was all SCI cases in Ilam, Iran. Researcher-made forms and questionnaires with confirmed validity and reliability, including the demographic characteristics, form and perceived abuse researcher-made questionnaire for people with SCI, were used. The perceived abuse questionnaire for patients with SCI was a researcher-made questionnaire designed based on library studies, interviews with patients, and determination of abuse instances. This instrument consists of 20 questions answered as yes (score 1) or no (score 0). After data collection, statistical analyzes were performed using the SPSS software version 16. Results: According to our results, the mean +/- SD of the perceived abuse score by caregivers and patients was 8.48 +/- 2.31 and 42.45% during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Moreover, the mean +/- SD of the age of patients was 62.86 +/- 19.15 years, and the patient abuse increased with elevation in age (P = 0, F = 27.42). The possible abuse score was 0 - 20 divided into three categories of low (20, 20.4%), moderate (76, 76.5%), and high (2, 2%). The perceived abuse score was significantly higher among women and patients with a history of more than 10 years of SCI. Abuse prevalence did not have a significant relationship with income and marital status. Regarding age and abuse, our results showed a rise in perceived abuse scores with an increase in age. Conclusions: The present study showed that it is necessary to take measures to prevent abuse in patients with SCI. Moreover, the prevalence of abuse related to COVID-19 in patients with SCI was high. Therefore, preventive actions need to be proposed in this field.","output":"Abuse in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background International Medical Graduates (IMG) form a significant part of the paediatric workforce in the UK. IMGs come from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and some have many years of postgraduate training in their country of origin (COO). The composition of this workforce includes: Speciality Trainees (ST1-ST8), Trust grade (Clinical Fellows), SAS (Speciality and Associate Specialty), and Locums. Due to the heterogeneity of this group, it is hard to find data to characterise this vital part of the workforce. We hope to fill a gap by starting to understand this group and the particular challenges they face, related to adopting to the new environment in their personal, social and work life. During Covid many of these doctors have faced additional challenges of isolation, being separated for long periods from family overseas, and not having the usual opportunities to make connections outside work. Our project, 'Soft Landing' aims to understand and help address these challenges. Objectives To explore the challenges faced by an IMGs in personal, social and working lives and how they progress through their careers in UK. Methods The survey was distributed via email to Training Programme Directors, as well as via social media. It was open to all paediatric IMGs in UK. Results 108 IMGs participated in the survey. 44% of them had worked in the UK for <12 months. Almost half planned to apply for training posts. The doctor's roles: Trainees: 15%, Non-Trainees (Level 1 and 2): 65%, Locum SHO: 20%. For most (80%), induction at start of post was not IMG tailored. 75% of participants had more than 5 years postgraduate experience. Despite most having many years of clinical experience, only 14% of IMGs felt confident during their first on call. Communication was a challenge for 50% of the cohort, and safeguarding was another concern with only 9% reporting feeling confident. Career-wise, 33% of participants mentioned their educational supervisor was aware of their career goals. 90% of the cohort reported opportunity to participate in audits and QIPs. However, only 30% of participants had an opportunity to present at national/international conference. Of concern, and reflecting WRES (Workforce Race Equality Standard) data on the experience of the medical BAME workforce, 60% of the cohort, mentioned that they had to take time off from work due to stress. The stress was related to 'work load', 'racism', 'non-supportive supervisors', 'difficult colleagues' and 'challenging patients'. 56% of the cohort mentioned that they were bullied and harassed in the work place. 40% of the cohort had received negative feed back at work. A large number, 46%, of the cohort had considered leaving UK. Conclusions Our survey highlights areas of challenge, data which reflects our own experiences as IMGs. This allows us to identify key areas for improvement. With a better understanding of the issues, and gaps identified we have established the Soft Landing project. We hope to work with key stakeholders to address these identified areas for improved support in order to continue to recruit and retain this valuable part of the workforce.","output":"Imgs 'the glue of paediatric rotas', but who are they?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 20019 (COVID19) pandemic which first emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan city, China.

Recently, the potential pathogenicity of infection-associated aPL has gained momentum since an increasing number of patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been described with coagulation abnormalities and hyperinflammation, together with the presence of aPL. Here, we present data from a multicentric, mixed-severity study including three cohorts of individuals who contracted SARS-CoV-2 as well as non-infected blood donors. We simultaneously measured 10 different criteria and non-criteria aPL (IgM and IgG) by using a line immunoassay. Further, IgG antibody response against three SARS-CoV-2 proteins was investigated using tripartite automated blood immunoassay technology. Our analyses revealed that selected non-criteria aPL were enriched concomitant to or after an infection with SARS-CoV-2. Linear mixed-effects models suggest an association of aPL with prothrombin (PT). The strength of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 was further influenced by SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and sex of the individuals. In conclusion, our study is the first to report an association between disease severity, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoreactivity, and aPL against PT in patients with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Anti-prothrombin autoantibodies enriched after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenced by strength of antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter takes a socionarrative approach to examine the recurrent narratives on translation in the Arabic linguistic context to further understand how Arabic translation occurs in public discourse.

Participants reported both detrimental psychological effects of lockdown such as anxiety and sleep problems and positive effects including reduced stress and enjoyment of having more free time. Most continued creative pursuits throughout lockdown, most commonly shifting to online platforms. However, many barriers to creative pursuits were reported, including lack of technological expertise or equipment. Concerns were raised about inequality, in particular racial disparities in the financial impact of the pandemic and additional pressures faced by performers with disabilities; with insufficient funds to afford the equipment needed to shift to remote performing; and with additional caring responsibilities.

Intrauterine exposure to GDM raises the risk for complications in offspring as well, including stillbirth, macrosomia, and birth trauma, and long-term risk of metabolic disease. One of the strongest risk factors for GDM is the occurrence of GDM in a prior pregnancy. Preliminary data from epidemiologic and bariatric surgery studies suggest that reducing body weight before pregnancy can prevent the development of GDM, but no adequately powered trial has tested the effects of a maternal lifestyle intervention before pregnancy to reduce body weight and prevent GDM recurrence. METHODS: The principal aim of the Gestational Diabetes Prevention/Prevencin de la Diabetes Gestacional is to determine whether a lifestyle intervention to reduce body weight before pregnancy can reduce GDM recurrence. This two-site trial targets recruitment of 252 women with overweight and obesity who have previous histories of GDM and who plan to have another pregnancy in the next 1C3 years. Women are randomized within site to a comprehensive pre-pregnancy lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss with ongoing treatment until conception or an educational control group. Participants are assessed preconceptionally (at study entry, after 4 months, and at brief quarterly visits until conception), during pregnancy (at 26 weeks gestation), and at 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome is GDM recurrence, and secondary outcomes include fasting glucose, biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease, prenatal and perinatal complications, and changes over time in weight, diet, physical activity, and psychosocial measures. DISCUSSION: The Gestational Diabetes Prevention /Prevencin de la Diabetes Gestacional is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a lifestyle intervention delivered before pregnancy to prevent GDM recurrence. If found effective, the proposed lifestyle intervention could lay the groundwork for shifting current treatment practices towards the interconception period and provide evidence-based preconception counseling to optimize reproductive outcomes and prevent GDM and associated health risks.

APPROACH: Third- and fourth-year medical students at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai formed the COVID-19 Student WorkForce to connect students to essential roles in the Mount Sinai Hospital System and support physicians, staff members, researchers, and hospital operations. With the administration's support, the WorkForce grew to include over 530 medical and graduate students. A methodology was developed for clinical students to receive elective credit for these volunteer activities. OUTCOMES: From March 15, 2020 to June 14, 2020, student volunteers recorded 29,602 hours (2,277 hours per week) in 7 different task forces which operated at 7 different hospitals throughout the health system. Volunteers included students from all years of medical school as well as PhD, master's, and nursing students.

A cohort of instructors who are part of the NSF RCN-UBE funded Sustainable, Transformative Engagement across a Multi-Institution/Multidisciplinary STEM (STEM)(2) Network (a working group of faculty from two community colleges and three 4-year universities) analyzed introductory biology and chemistry courses to identify essential laboratory skills that students will need in advanced courses. Seven essential laboratory proficiencies were derived from reviewing disciplinary guiding documents such as AAAS Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education, the American Society for Microbiology Recommended Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Microbiology Education, and the American Chemical Society Guidelines for Chemistry: data analysis, scientific writing, proper handling and disposal of laboratory materials, discipline-specific techniques, measurement, lab safety and personal protective equipment, and interpersonal and collaborative skills. Our analysis has determined that some of these skills are difficult to develop in a remote or online setting but could be recovered with appropriate interventions. Skill recovery procedures suggested include a skills boot camp, department or college coordinated club events, and a triage course.

Although many strategies have been designed for the recovery or elimination of this metal from environmental sources, microbial bioremediation has proven to be the most effective and environmentally friendly strategy and thus control heavy metal contamination. The main objective of this work, using native bacterial strains obtained from contaminated soils of the Peruvian region of Secocha, was to identify which of these strains would have growth capacity on mercury substrates to evaluate their adsorption behavior and mercury removal capacity. Through a DNA analysis (99.78% similarity) and atomic absorption spectrometry, the Gram-positive bacterium Zhihengliuella alba sp. T2.2 was identified as the strain with the highest mercury removal capacity from culture solutions with an initial mercury concentration of 162 mgL?1. The removal capacity reached values close to 39.5% in a period of incubation time of 45 days, with maximum elimination efficiency in the first 48 h. These results are encouraging and show that this native strain may be the key to the bioremediation of water and soils contaminated with mercury.","output":"Identification and Characterization of Peruvian Native Bacterial Strains as Bioremediation of Hg-Polluted Water and Soils Due to Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining in the Secocha Annex, Arequipa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Surgeons are trained as internists that also operate, bringing an important skillset to patient management during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A review was performed to illustrate the response of surgical staff during the pandemic with regard to patient care and residency training.

No IRB approval or written consent was obtained nor it was necessary for the purposes of this paper. RESULTS: Hospital policy was enacted to hinder transmission of COVID-19 and included limited gatherings of people, restricted travel, quarantined symptomatic staff, and careful surveillance for disease incidence. Surgical residency transformed as residents were diverted from traditional surgical services to staff new COVID-19 ICUs. Education transitioned to an online-based platform for lectures and reviews. New skills sets were acquired such as PICC line placement and complex ventilator management.

To date, the standard operation with the circular stapler (CS) used the 25 mm with a staple height of 4.8 mm. We present herein our experience with the 3.5-mm staple height. METHODS A total of 1,074 morbidly obese patients who underwent fully stapled laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass over a period of 18 months were included in the study. Mean body mass index was 41.9 (range 28.6-70.7). Mean age was 40.9 years (range 15-74 years). Mean operating time was 73 min (range 43-210 min) and the mean length of stay was 4.2 days (range 1-25 days). The 30-day complication rate associated with GJA was prospectively analyzed. RESULTS Twenty patients (1.86%) developed postoperative bleeding. Four developed GJA bleeding (0.37%). One leak was recorded from the vertical staple line of the gastric pouch, but no leaks from the GJA were seen. Conversion to open approach was required in two patients (0.18%). Reoperation and readmission rates were 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively. Perioperative complications were observed in 34 patients (3.1%). One case of clinical GJA stenosis was detected in a mean follow-up of 10.5 months (range 5-20 months). There was no mortality in our series. CONCLUSION Compared to our previous experience with 4.8 mm CS, creating the GJA using a smaller staple height significantly reduced the bleeding rate and seems to be a safe technique that potentially reduces other complications related to the GJA as reported in the literature.","output":"Smaller staple height for circular stapled gastrojejunostomy in laparoscopic gastric bypass: early results in 1,074 morbidly obese patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiencies of selected anti\\\\emetic drugs (metoclopramide, ondansetron and maropitant) in preventing vomiting in the treatment of canine parvoviral enteritis.

Recent dangerous coronaviruses are MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, causing respiratory illness and even failure of several organs. However, profound impact of coronavirus on host cells remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed transcriptome of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung-derived cells, and observed that infection of these coronaviruses all induced increase of retrotransposon expression with upregulation of TET genes. Upregulation of retrotransposon was also observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected human intestinal organoids. Retrotransposon upregulation may lead to increased genome instability and enhanced expression of genes with readthrough from retrotransposons. Therefore, people with higher basal level of retrotransposon such as cancer patients and aged people may have increased risk of symptomatic infection. Additionally, we show evidence supporting long-term epigenetic inheritance of retrotransposon upregulation. We also observed chimeric transcripts of retrotransposon and SARS-CoV-2 RNA for potential human genome invasion of viral fragments, with the front and the rear part of SARS-CoV-2 genome being easier to form chimeric RNA. Thus, we suggest that primers and probes for nucleic acid detection should be designed in the middle of virus genome to identify live virus with higher probability. In summary, we propose our hypothesis that coronavirus invades human cells and interacts with retrotransposon, eliciting more severe symptoms in patients with underlying diseases.

This study aimed to investigate the patients-perceived drug shortages experience and their view on outcomes in different European hospital settings. Furthermore, we wanted to explore information preferences on drug shortages. METHODS: A retrospective, cross sectional, a mixed method study was conducted in six European hospital settings. One hospital (H) from each of this country agreed to participate: Bosnia and Herzegovina (H-BiH), Croatia (H-CR), Germany (H-GE), Greece (H-GR), Serbia (H-SE) and Poland (H-PO). Recruitment and data collection was conducted over 27 months from November 2017 until January 2020. Overall, we surveyed 607 patients which completed paper-based questionnaire. Questions related to: general information (demographic data), basic knowledge on drug shortages, drug shortages experienced during hospitalization and information preferences on drug shortage. Differences between hospital settings were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fishers exact test. For more complex contingency tables, Monte Carlo simulations (N = 2000) were applied for Fishers test. Post-hoc hospital-wise analyses were performed using Fishers exact tests. False discovery rate was controlled using the Bonferroni method. Analyses were performed using R: a language and environment for statistical computing (v 3.6.3). RESULTS: 6 % of patients reported experiences with drug shortages while hospitalized which led to a deterioration of their health. The majority of affected patients were hospitalized at hematology and/or oncology wards in H-BiH, H-PO and H-GE. H-BiH had the highest number of affected patients (18.1 %, N = 19/105, p < 0.001) while the fewest patients were in H-SE (1 %, N = 1/100, p = 0.001). In addition, 82.5 %, (N = 501/607) of respondents wanted to be informed of alternative treatment options if there was a drug shortage without a generic substitute available. Majority of these patients (66.4 %, N = 386/501) prefer to be informed by a healthcare professional. CONCLUSIONS: Although drug shortages led to serious medical consequences, our findings show that most of the patients did not perceive shortages as a problem. One possible interpretation is that good hospital management practices by healthcare professionals helped to mitigate the perceived impact of shortages. Our study highlights the importance of a good communication especially between patients and healthcare professionals in whom our patients have the greatest trust.

Entomophagythe human consumption of edible insects, is a historical and culturally established practice in many regions. Increasing consumption of nutritious insect meal is a possible combative strategy and can promote sustainable food security. However, the nutritional literature frequently lacks consensus, with interspecific differences in the nutrient content of edible insects generally being poorly resolved. Aims and methods: Here we present full proximate and fatty acid profiles for five edible insect species of socio-economic importance in West Africa: Hermetia illucens (black soldier fly), Musca domestica (house fly), Rhynchophorus phoenicis (African palm weevil), Cirina butyrospermi (shea tree caterpillar), and Macrotermes bellicosus (African termite). These original profiles, which can be used in future research, are combined with literature-derived proximate, fatty acid, and amino acid profiles to analyse interspecific differences in nutrient content. Results: Interspecific differences in ash (minerals), crude protein, and crude fat contents were substantial. Highest ash content was found in H. illucens and M. domestica (~10 and 7.5% of dry matter, respectively), highest crude protein was found in C. butyrospermi and M. domestica (~60% of dry matter), whilst highest crude fat was found in R. phoenicis (~55% of dry matter). The fatty acid profile of H. illucens was differentiated from the other four species, forming its own cluster in a principal component analysis characterized by high saturated fatty acid content. Cirina butyrospermi had by far the highest poly-unsaturated fatty acid content at around 35% of its total fatty acids, with -linolenic acid particularly represented. Amino acid analyses revealed that all five species sufficiently met human essential amino acid requirements, although C. butyrospermi was slightly limited in leucine and methionine content. Discussion: The nutritional profiles of these five edible insect species compare favorably to beef and can meet human requirements, promoting entomophagy's utility in combatting undernutrition. In particular, C. butyrospermi may provide a source of essential poly-unsaturated fatty acids, bringing many health benefits. This, along with its high protein content, indicates that this species is worthy of more attention in the nutritional literature, which has thus-far been lacking.","output":"The Nutritional Profiles of Five Important Edible Insect Species From West AfricaAn Analytical and Literature Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and its containment strategies have presented unique challenges to India's healthcare infrastructure.

Here, we show SARS-CoV-2-infected cells display an elevated level of nuclear mRNA accumulation compared to mock-infected cells. We demonstrate that ORF6 is responsible for this nuclear imprisonment of host mRNA, and using a cotransfected reporter assay, we show this nuclear retention of mRNA blocks expression of newly transcribed mRNAs. ORF6s nuclear entrapment of host mRNA is associated with its ability to copurify with the mRNA export factors, Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly copurifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and presymptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also show that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 block nuclear import of a broad range of host proteins.

For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed attention to the importance of secure water and sanitation services in protecting human health; many remote Alaskan communities are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease transmission because of inadequate water and sanitation services. In addition, there are a number of socio-economic, physical, and infrastructure factors in rural Alaska (e.g., remoteness, household overcrowding, climate change impacts, limited medical facilities, and high prevalence of chronic diseases) that contribute to the potential for more severe COVID-19 disease outcomes in these predominantly Alaska Native communities.","output":"Implications of Inadequate Water and Sanitation Infrastructure for Community Spread of COVID-19 in Remote Alaskan Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) was initially observed in a group of Chinese patients with unclear pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei [1] in late December 2019. The first positive case in Switzerland was confirmed on 25 February 2020 in a patient from canton Tessin, who most likely caught the virus during a visit to Milan, Italy [2]. The country has since been preparing for an imminent public health emergency caused by the pandemic. As of 14 May 2020, the Swiss healthcare system is facing a total of 30,463 corona virus-positive people [3]. With numbers of new infections decreasing after the first pandemic wave, the continuing endemic situation will continue to be a major challenge for the Swiss healthcare system. It remains crucial to separate the clinically low-symptomatic from the severely affected patients in order to offer a specific therapeutic strategy to every SARS-CoV-2 patient. Reports from Chinese cohorts describe an increasing role of imaging strategies in the detection and surveillance of COVID-19 patients because of insufficient testing sensitivity of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests [4]. Chest computed tomography (CT), with a reported sensitivity of up to 97% [5, 6], gained importance particularly in patients with false negative RT-PCR results. In this short communication, we describe our first clinical experiences with 55 COVID-19 patients in Central Switzerland, who were either imaged with a standard chest x-ray, chest CT, or both. We provide an illustrative and schematic description of typical COVID-19 imaging features and suggest that imaging plays an important role in the clinical work-up of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

Recently it has been reported that the cardiovascular system and coagulation mechanisms were the second major targets of biological system affected due to the viral replication. The replication mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 involves the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2- (ACE2) surface receptors of endothelial cells belonging to various organs which act as the binding site for the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 virus has been recently listed as a primary risk factor for the following cardiovascular conditions such as pericarditis, myocarditis, arrhythmias, myocardial injury, cardiac arrest, heart failure and coagulation abnormalities in the patients confirmed with COVID-19 viral infection. Direct and indirect type of tissue damage were the two major categories detected with cardiovascular abnormalities.

Hence, anaesthesiologist-intensivist physicians are the medical specialists taking care of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Africa. Likewise, unlike intensive care units (ICUs) in high income countries, those in most African countries face the challenge of a lack of emergency drugs and resuscitation equipment, limited health infrastructure and understaffed and underfunded health care systems. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented one faced by intensivists in high-income countries and anaesthesiologist-intensivist phycisians in Africa. Infected patients with severe forms of the disease like those having grave COVID-19 complications like massive pulmonary embolism, severe cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, septic shock, acute kidney injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome require ICU admission for better management. Both intensivists or anaesthesiologist-intensivist physicians have the peculiarity of securing the airways of critically COVID-19 patients and providing respiratory support with mechanical ventilation after laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation when needed. In so doing, they can easily be infected from respiratory droplets or aerosols expired by the COVID-19 patients. Hence, in Africa, anaesthesiologist-intensivist phycisians have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other health professionals. It's worth to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic struck African anaesthesiologist-intensivist phycisians and ICUs when there were neither prepared skillfully or lacked the required ICU capacity to meet the demands of thousands of severe COVID-19 African patients. These further weakened the already strained health systems in Africa. It required a lot of creativity, engineering skills and courage for these ill prepared African anaesthesiologist-intensivist physicians to provide care to these critically ill patients and improve their outcomes as the pandemic progressed. However, despites the numerous efforts made in African anaesthesiologist-Intensivist phycisians to care for critically ill COVID-19 patients, the pandemic is spreading at a rapid rate across Africa. There is an urgent need for African health authorities to anticipate on how to scale up the future high ICU capacity needs and limited ICU workforce, infrastructure and equipment to manage severe forms of COVID-19 in future.

This chapter summarizes progress in the field of flavivirus neuropathogenesis. Mosquito-borne and tickborne viruses are considered together. Flavivirus neuropathogenesis involves both neuroinvasiveness (capacity to enter the CNS) and neurovirulence (replication within the CNS), both of which can be manipulated experimentally. Neuronal injury as a result of bystander effects may be a factor during flavivirus neuropathogenesis given that microglial activation and elaboration of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1 and TNF-, occur in the CNS during these infections and may accompany the production of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, which can cause neurotoxicity.","output":"Pathogenesis of flavivirus encephalitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social anxiety (SA) is characterized by a persistent fear of negative evaluation and marked difficulties in forming social relationships.

Our results show that high SA individuals tend to align to the groups unfair behavior, even though conformity, in this case, is to mistreat an otherwise well-intentioned stranger.

In this paper, we propose a general framework for addressing reporting delay in disease forecasting efforts with the goal of improving forecasts. We propose strategies for leveraging either historical data on case reporting or external internet-based data to estimate the amount of reporting error. We then describe several approaches for adapting general forecasting pipelines to account for under- or over-reporting of cases. We apply these methods to address reporting delay in data on dengue fever cases in Puerto Rico from 1990 to 2009 and to reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States between 2010 and 2019. Through a simulation study, we compare method performance and evaluate robustness to assumption violations. Our results show that forecasting accuracy and prediction coverage almost always increase when correction methods are implemented to address reporting delay. Some of these methods required knowledge about the reporting error or high quality external data, which may not always be available. Provided alternatives include excluding recently-reported data and performing sensitivity analysis.

One hundred sixty-six patients (103 males; age 43.8  12.3 years) were allocated in the training cohort and 72 patients (38 males; age 45.1  15.8 years) from another independent hospital were assigned in the validation cohort. The primary composite endpoint was admission to an intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed to identify independent predictors. A nomogram was constructed based on the combination of clinical and CT features, and its prognostic performance was externally tested in the validation group. The predictive value of the combined model was compared with models built on the clinical and radiological attributes alone. RESULTS: Overall, 35 infected patients (21.1%) in the training cohort and 10 patients (13.9%) in the validation cohort experienced adverse outcomes. Underlying comorbidity (hazard ratio [HR], 3.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67C6.71; p < 0.001), lymphocyte count (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04C0.38; p < 0.001) and crazy-paving sign (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.03C4.48; p = 0.042) were the independent factors.

The disease symptoms and outcomes depend on the host immunity, in which the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a distinct role. The HLA alleles have an inter-population variability, and understanding their link to the COVID-19 in an ethnically distinct population may contribute to personalized medicine. The present study aimed at detecting associations between common HLA alleles and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in Armenians. In 299 COVID-19 patients (75 asymptomatic, 102 mild/moderate, 122 severe), the association between disease severity and classic HLA-I and II loci was examined. We found that the advanced age, male sex of patients, and sex and age interaction significantly contributed to the severity of the disease. We observed that an age-dependent effect of HLA-B*51:01 carriage [odds ratio (OR)=0.48 (0.28-0.80), P(bonf) <0.036] is protective against severe COVID-19. Contrary, the HLA-C*04:01 allele, in a dose-dependent manner, was associated with a significant increase in the disease severity [OR (95% CI) =1.73 (1.20-2.49), P(bonf) <0.021] and an advancing age (P<0.013). The link between HLA-C*04:01 and age was secondary to a stronger association between HLA-C*04:01 and disease severity. However, HLA-C*04:01 exerted a sex-dependent differential distribution between clinical subgroups [females: P<0.0012; males: P=0.48]. The comparison of HLA-C*04:01 frequency between subgroups and 2,781 Armenian controls revealed a significant incidence of HLA-C*04:01 deficiency in asymptomatic COVID-19. HLA-C*04:01 homozygous genotype in patients blueprinted a decrease in heterozygosity of HLA-B and HLA class-I loci. In HLA-C*04:01 carriers, these changes translated to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide presentation predicted inefficacy by HLA-C and HLA class-I molecules, simultaneously enhancing the appropriate HLA-B potency. In patients with clinical manifestation, due to the high prevalence of HLA-C*04:01, these effects provided a decrease of the HLA class-I heterozygosity and an ability to recognize SARS-CoV-2 peptides.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Commercially available micro- and nanoparticles of fenofibrate (Lipanthyl? and Lipanthylnano?, respectively) were administered orally to five healthy volunteers in fasting and postprandial conditions. Intraluminal and systemic drug concentrations were determined as reference data for the development of a predictive in vitro setup. To capture the observed solubility/permeability interplay, in vitro dissolution testing was performed in the presence of a permeation bag with sink conditions. RESULTS In fasting conditions, intake of nanosized fenofibrate generated increased duodenal concentrations compared to microsized fenofibrate, which was reflected in an improved systemic exposure. In postprandial conditions, duodenal concentrations were greatly enhanced for both formulations, however without an accompanying increase in systemic exposure. It appeared that micellar encapsulation of the highly lipohilic fenofibrate limited its potential to permeate from fed state intestinal fluids. To capture these in vivo observations in an in vitro setup, classic dissolution testing was combined with permeation assessment into a permeation bag with sink conditions. In case of fasting conditions, the dissolution/permeation approach allowed for an improved discriminative power between micro- and nanosized fenofibrate by better simulating the dynamic interplay of dissolution and absorption. In case of postprandial conditions, the observed solubility-permeability interplay could be simulated using the dissolution/permeation approach in combination with biorelevant media (FeSSGFFortimel and FeSSIF-V2) to mimic micellar entrapment and reduced permeation potential of fenofibrate. CONCLUSION For the first time, reduced permeation of a lipophilic drug despite increased intraluminal concentrations, was demonstrated in humans. Dissolution testing using biorelevant media in combination with permeation assessment into a sink permeation bag appeared to be a simple yet pragmatic approach to capture this solubility-permeability interplay in early formulation evaluation.","output":"Gastrointestinal behavior of nano- and microsized fenofibrate: In vivo evaluation in man and in vitro simulation by assessment of the permeation potential."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Viral shedding patterns and its correlation with the immune responses of mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients are still poorly characterized.

Results Despite mild clinical disease, high viral loads and shedding of infectious virus were observed from the respiratory tract, with isolation of infectious virus and prolonged positivity by PCR up to day 7 and 19 post onset of symptoms, respectively. Robust innate responses characterized by an increase in activated CD14+CD16+ monocytes and cytokine responses were observed as early as 2 days after symptoms onset. Cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2 specific adaptive responses were detectable in all patients. Conclusion Infectious virus shedding was limited to the first week of symptom onset in mild cases.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of prostacyclin infusion in mechanically ventilated patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with severe endotheliopathy. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized clinical trial in adults infected with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who required mechanical ventilation and had a plasma level of thrombomodulin >4 ng/ml; patients were randomized to 72-hour infusion of prostacyclin 1 ng/kg/min or placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome was the number of days alive and without mechanical ventilation within 28 days. Key secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality and serious adverse events within 7 days. Eighty patients were randomized (41 prostacyclin and 39 placebo). The median number of days alive without mechanical ventilation at 28 days was 16.0 days (SD, 12) versus 5.0 days (SD, 10) (difference of the medians, 10.96 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], ?5 to 21; P = 0.07) in the prostacyclin and the placebo groups, respectively. The 28-day mortality was 21.9% versus 43.6% in the prostacyclin and the placebo groups, respectively (risk ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.96; P = 0.06).

Nonetheless, since its introduction in human populations, SARS-CoV-2 must have been subject to the selective pressure imposed by the human immune system. We exploited the availability of a large number of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as of validated epitope predictions, to show that B cell epitopes in the spike glycoprotein (S) and in the nucleocapsid protein (N) have higher diversity than nonepitope positions. Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses and for sarbecoviruses sampled in bats. Conversely, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than nonepitope positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8 and ORF3a). Analysis over longer evolutionary time frames indicated that this effect is not due to differential constraints. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 evolves to elude the host humoral immune response, whereas recognition by T cells is not actively avoided by the virus. However, we also found a trend of lower diversity of T cell epitopes for common cold coronaviruses, indicating that epitope conservation per se is not directly linked to disease severity. We suggest that conservation serves to maintain epitopes that elicit tolerizing T cell responses or induce T cells with regulatory activity.","output":"Antigenic variation of SARS-CoV-2 in response to immune pressure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, people in Qatarsimilar to most countries globallywere instructed by health authorities to adopt protective behaviors to avoid infection.

According to UNESCO, at the peak of the crisis over 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries were out of school. After one year, half of the worlds student population is still affected by full or partial school closures. Here we investigated whether or not it is possible to build a multivariate score for dynamic school decision-making specially in scenarios without population-scale RT-PCR tests. METHODS: Normality rate is based on a COVID-19 risk matrix (Table 1). Total score (TS) is obtained by summing the risk scores for COVID-19, considering the six parameters of the pandemic in a city. The COVID-19 Normality Rate (CNR) is obtained by linear interpolation in such a way that a total score of 30 points is equivalent to a 100% possibility of normality and, in a city with only six total points would have zero percent chance of returning to normality: CNR = (TS C 6)/24 (%). The criteria for opening and closing schools can be defined based on the percentages of return to normality (Table 2). Table 1. Limits for each parameter of the risk matrix and \\"normality\\" scores in relation to COVID-19: the lower the risk, higher is the normality score. [Image: see text] Table 2.

The current study investigates alterations in the biological estimates concerning the severity, recovery, mortality, and assessment of treatment-based outcomes. Methods A case series of 165 COVID-19 patients admitted to OMI Institute (a tertiary care hospital) was conducted between May and August 2020. The data regarding demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, radiographic abnormalities, biological estimations, symptoms, treatment, disease progression, complications, and outcomes were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Laboratory estimations included complete blood count (CBC), renal and electrolyte profile, liver function tests (LFTs), hematological indices, and inflammatory markers. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan were also performed, and data were extracted from the medical records. Analysis was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. Results Out of the 165 COVID-19 patients, 79.4% recovered and were successfully discharged, while 20.6% of inpatient died. The patients' mean age was 56.03 +/- 15.96 years, with a male majority (55.1%). The most common comorbid conditions were diabetes and hypertension;fever and dry cough were among the most frequently reported symptoms. The chest imaging findings among the severe/critical COVID-19 patients showed extensive bilateral patchy opacities. The median laboratory investigations, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (14.83), C-reactive protein (CRP) (7.4 mg/dl), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (786 IU/L), ferritin (1401.15 mcg/ml), and mean oxygen saturation (88.25%), were significantly altered among cases with increased disease severity and those who expired (p&lt;0.05). The proportion of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis development was significantly high among severe/critical COVID-19 patients (p&lt;0.05). Treatment with tocilizumab, remdesivir, doxycycline, ivermectin, enoxaparin sodium, and steroids was deemed to be potentially effective treatment options in terms of reducing COVID-19 severity and chances of recovery. Furthermore, age (OR 1.05;p=0.047), presence of comorbidity (OR 8.471;p=0.004), high NLR, LDH (final outcome) (OR 1.361 and 1.018;p&lt;0.05), and CRP levels (midpoint) (OR 1.631;p=0.05) were identified as the strong predictors of death among COVID-19 patients. Conclusion The study identified several alterations in the clinical profile of the COVID-19 patients concerning severity during the hospital stay, affecting prognosis. Clinically, tocilizumab, remdesivir, doxycycline, ivermectin, enoxaparin sodium, and steroids were identified as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19 due to their ability to alter disease-associated severity and recovery rate.","output":"Clinical Variants, Characteristics, and Outcomes Among COVID-19 Patients: A Case Series Analysis at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes serious respiratory tract infections in lung transplant recipients (LTRs).

The search equations used included terms such as Return to Work, Long-Standing Health Problems or Disability, Work Health Balance, and job satisfaction or subjective well-being. Eligibility criteria for the studies: Studies that included a measure of employees well-being at work following return to work were selected for the review. Evaluation of the studies and synthesis methods: The studies were selected using predefined fields which included quality criteria. Results: Of the 264 articles returned by the initial search, a total of 20 were finally selected. Results were organized around the three different theoretical approaches for understanding RTW and its antecedents and consequences: (a) RTW and autonomy at work have a positive effect on psychological well-being; (b) job demand is linked to less job satisfaction, whereas a higher level on the workChealth balance is associated with job satisfaction and work engagement; (c) internal and external support is linked to job satisfaction in the case of a disease. Limitations: The evidence provided by the results is restricted by the limited availability of studies focusing on well-being at work following return to work.

We aimed to estimate the impact of closure and temporary interruption of SSP on the HIV epidemic in a rural US setting. METHODS Using an agent-based model calibrated to observed surveillance data, we simulated HIV risk behaviors and transmission in adult populations who inject and do not inject drugs in Scott County, Indiana. We projected HIV incidence and prevalence between 2020-2025 for scenarios with permanent closure, delayed closure (one additional renewal for 24 months before closure), and temporary closure (lasting 12 months) of an SSP in comparison to persistent SSP operation. RESULTS With sustained SSP operation, we projected an incidence rate of 0.15 per 100 person-years among the overall population [95% simulation interval: 0.06-0.28]. Permanently closing the SSP would cause an average of 58.4% increase in the overall incidence rate during 2021-2025, resulting in a higher prevalence of 60.8% [50.9%-70.6%] (18.7% increase) among PWID by 2025. A delayed closure would increase the incidence rate by 38.9%. A temporary closure would cause 12 (35.3%) more infections during 2020-2021.

Patients completed the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ VAS), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and the Patient Benefit Index (PBI). Patients with anogenital psoriasis had higher PASI (13.010.6 vs. 8.97.6, P < 0.001) and more DLQI impairments (8.96.9 vs. 7.06.2, P = 0.002) than controls. At the item-level, they also reported more sex-related DLQI impairments (DLQI-i9: 0.50.8 vs. 0.30.7, P < 0.001) and treatment needs (PBI-i17: 2.21.8 vs. 1.91.8, P = 0.001). A great percentage of missing/not-relevant responses was found for sex-related items (23.3-41.9%). These results suggest that the assessment of sex-related impairments and treatment needs should be prioritised in patients with anogenital psoriasis. Questionnaires may be used as a less uncomfortable way for patients to discuss their genital lesions and sexual function during healthcare visits. However, the great percentage of missing/not-relevant responses to sex-related items calls for in-depth assessments and effective patient-physician communication regarding these sensitive topics.","output":"Sex-related impairment and patient needs/benefits in anogenital psoriasis: Difficult-to-communicate topics and their impact on patient-centred care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has established itself as the defining global health crisis of this time.

It causes many changes in hemogram parameters. Low albumin levels are associated with mortality risk in hospitalized patients. The aim of the present study is to reveal the place of neutrophil count to albumin ratio in predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: 144 patients, 65 females and 79 males, were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 was the non-severe group (n:85), and Group 2 was severe (n:59). Demographic data, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts, albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were recorded. Neutrophil count to albumin ratio (NAR) was calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil counts by the albumin levels. The NAR and levels of the two groups were then compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in gender and platelet count (201 vs. 211 K/mL) between the groups (p>0,05). Ages (62.0  14.3 vs 68.6  12.2 years), albumin (33.1 vs 29.9 gr/L), CRP (33 vs 113 mg/l), neutrophil count (4 vs 7.24 K/mL), WBC counts (6.70 vs 8.50 K/mL), NAR values (113.5 vs 267.2) and number of Death (5 vs 33) were found to be statistically higher (p <0.001) in Group 2 than in Group 1.

However, more recent studies are less conclusive and might even indicate that patients with acute brain injury could benefit from ketamine sedation. This systematic review summarizes the evidence regarding the use of ketamine in patients suffering from traumatic brain injury. Databases were searched for studies using ketamine in acute brain injury. Outcomes of interest were mortality, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, blood pressure, heart rate, spreading depolarizations, and neurological function. In total 11 studies were included. The overall level of evidence concerning the use of ketamine in brain injury is low. Only two studies found a small increase in intracranial pressure, while two small studies found decreased levels of intracranial pressure following ketamine administration.

Previous studies indicated that mediated social touch (MST) can induce similar positive outcomes to interpersonal touch. However, studies investigating the user experience of MST technology predominantly involve brief experiments that are performed in well-controlled laboratory conditions. Hence, it is still unknown how MST affects the relationship and communication between physically separated partners in a romantic relationship, in a naturalistic setting and over a longer period of time. In a longitudinal explorative field study, the effects of MST on social connectedness and longing for touch among geographically separated romantic couples were investigated in a naturalistic setting. For 2 weeks, 17 couples used haptic bracelets, that were connected via the internet, to exchange mediated squeeze-like touch signals. Before and after this period, they reported their feelings of social connectedness and longing for touch through questionnaires. The results show that the use of haptic bracelets (1) enhanced social connectedness among geographically separated couples but (2) did not affect their longing for touch. Interviews conducted at the end of the study were analyzed following the thematic analysis method to generate prominent themes and patterns in using MST technology among participant couples. Two main themes were generated that captured (a) the way the bracelets fostered a positive one-to-one connection between partners and (b) the way in which participants worked around their frustrations with the bracelets. Detailed findings and limitations of this longitudinal field study are further discussed, and suggestions are made for future research.","output":"Connected Through Mediated Social Touch: Better Than a Like on Facebook.

METHODS: Patients undergoing LDLT counseling, evaluation and transplant in the period March to June 2020 (group A) under COVID-19 restrictions and special protocols were included. LDLT activity and outcomes among these patients was compared to those in the same period in 2019 (group B). RESULTS: In the period March 15-June 10, we performed 39 and 23 (59%) LDLTs in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The adult patients with cirrhosis in-group A (n=20) had significantly higher MELD score, 19.87.0 versus 16.15.6 in-group B (n=36), p=0.034.

Performance-based risk-sharing arrangements (PBRSAs) are agreements that can potentially reduce the drug lag in which patients wait for an unknown amount of time until a particular drug is covered under their health plan. In addition, PBRSAs can mitigate the risk of investing heavily in drugs that are ineffective or do not deliver good value or bang for the buck. This review describes and evaluates PBRSAs for drugs in the USA and juxtaposes to other developed nations (i.e. Germany) that adopted PBRSAs in their healthcare model. There are different types of outcomes-based health schemes, namely conditional coverage, which can be further broken down into coverage with evidence development (CED), conditional treatment continuation (CTC), and performance-linked reimbursement, which includes outcomes guarantees. Both CED and CTC are conditional on the collected evidence of the new drugs effectiveness, offering discount only if the drug delivers desirable results. The outcomes guarantee scheme offers discount or even a full refund if the outcome is less than expected, forcing the drug to meet the expected effectiveness. The USA can follow the German reference pricing model in which the assessment of new drugs is centralized and done collectively by representatives from a group of healthcare decision makers. In any shape or form, PBRSA is a clever mechanism to cope with uncertainty if drug price is scaled appropriately based on value.","output":"Performance-Based Risk-Sharing Arrangements (PBRSA): Is it a Solution to Increase Bang for the Buck for Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Strategy for Our Nation and Around the World?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have presented to emergency departments (EDs) worldwide with a wide range of symptoms. In this study we reported the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of the cases diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective, descriptive, and observational study. The patients who have admitted to ED between March 11 and May 31, 2020 and diagnosed COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: 130 (73 male and 57 female) patients with COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive test were included in the study. The average age of the study group was calculated as 52.63  17.95 year. While 15.4% of the patients were asymptomatic, the most common symptom was identified as cough (46.2%), followed by dyspnea (23.1%), fever (17.7%). The computed tomography (CT) severity scores proved significantly higher in the patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) than in those without these diseases (p = 0.010 and p = 0.042, respectively). The moderate positive correlation between serum ferritin level and CT severity score is another finding worth noting (rho = 0.530 and p = 0.0001). In a similar vein, the high level of D-dimer in the CT-positive group and its positive moderate correlation with CT severity (rho = 0.375 and p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In our study, serum ferritin and D-dimer levels were observed to be high in the CT-positive group and have moderate positive correlation with CT severity.

All infected rats had significantly more loss of pups than did control rats (P < 0.006), but rats infected prior to breeding or at the beginning of the third trimester (gd 14) were much more likely to have fetal losses. Rats infected in the early second trimester after implantation (gd 11) did not experience severe losses. Litter sizes, total litter weight, and individual pup weight from all infected rats, regardless of gestational stage when infected, were significantly smaller than those of control rats (P < 0.001).

However, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients undergoing treatment is unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this interventional prospective multi-cohort study, priming and booster doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine were administered 21 days apart to solid tumor patients receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted- or hormonal therapy, and patients with a hematologic malignancy receiving rituximab or after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Vaccine safety and efficacy (until three months post-booster) were assessed. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels were followed over time (until 28 days post-booster) and in vitro SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralization titers (NT50) towards the wild-type Wuhan strain were analyzed 28 days post-booster. RESULTS: Local and systemic adverse events (AEs) were mostly mild to moderate (only 1-3% of patients experiencing severe AEs). Local, but not systemic, AEs occurred more frequently after booster dose. 28 days post-booster vaccination of 197 cancer patients, RBD-binding antibody titers and NT50 were lower in the chemotherapy group (234.05IU/mL [95%CI 122.10-448.66] and NT50 of 24.54 [95% CI 14.50-41.52]) compared to healthy individuals (1844.93IU/mL [95% CI 1383.57-2460.14] and NT50 of 122.63 [95% CI 76.85-195.67]), irrespective of timing of vaccination during chemotherapy cycles. Extremely low antibody responses were seen in hematology patients receiving rituximab, only two patients had RBD-binding antibody titers necessary for 50% protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (<200IU/mL) and only one had NT50 above the limit of detection. During the study period, five cancer patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including a case of severe COVID-19 in a patient receiving rituximab, resulting in a 2-week hospital admission.

Frail and older people are at the highest risk of mortality. The main objective of the present research was to quantify the impact of clinical frailty scale (CFS) by increasing severity of frailty and to identify other personal prognostic factors associated with increased mortality from COVID-19. METHODS: This study offers a contemporary systematic review and meta-analysis to analyse the stratified mortality risk by increasing CFS sub-categories (1C3, 4C5 and 6C9). Databases searched included EMBASE, MEDLINE, CAB Abstracts, PsychInfo, and Web of Science with end-search restriction the 18th December 2020. Publications identified via MedRevix were followed up on the 23rd March 2021 in peer-reviewed database search, and citations were updated as published. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies which reported the association between CFS and COVID-19 mortality were included. Thirty-four studies were eligible for systematic review and seventeen for meta-analysis, with 81C87% (I(2)) heterogeneity. FINDINGS: All studies [N: 34] included patients from a hospital setting, comprising a total of 18,042 patients with mean age 72.8 (Min: 56; Max: 86). The CFS 4C5 patient group had significantly increased mortality when compared to patients with CFS 1C3 [(RE) OR 1.95 (1.32 (95% CI), 2.87 (95% CI)); I(2) 81%; p = 0.0008]. Furthermore, CFS 6C9 patient group displayed an even more noticeable mortality increase when compared to patients with CFS 1C3 [(RE) OR 3.09 (2.03, 4.71); I(2) 87%; p<0.0001]. Generic inverse variance analysis of adjusted hazard ratio among included studies highlighted that CFS (p = 0.0001), male gender (p = 0.0009), National Early Warning Score (p = 0.0001), Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD) (p = 0.07), Hypertension (HT) (p<0.0001), and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (p = 0.0009) were associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest a differential stratification of CFS scores in the context of COVID-19 infection, in which CFS 1C3 patients may be considered at lower risk, CFS 4C5 at moderate risk, and CFS 6C9 at high risk of mortality regardless of age. Overall, our study not only aims to alert clinicians of the value of CFS scores, but also highlight the multiple dimensions to consider such as age, gender and co-morbidities, even among moderately frail patients in relation to COVID-19 mortality.

We compiled spectral energy distributions of 85 Galactic post-AGB binary systems. We built a color-color diagram to differentiate between the different disk morphologies traced by the infrared excess. We categorized the different disk types and searched for correlations with other observational characteristics of these systems. Between 8 and 12% of our targets are surrounded by transition disks, that is, disks having no or low near-infrared excess. We find a strong link between these transition disks and the depletion of refractory elements on the surface of the post-AGB star. We interpret this link as evidence of a mechanism that stimulates the dust and gas separation within the disk and that also produces the transition disk structure. We propose that such a mechanism is likely to be due to a giant planet carving a hole in the disk, effectively trapping the dust in the outer disk parts. We propose disk evolutionary scenarios, depending on the presence of such a giant planet in the disk. We advocate that giant planets can successfully explain the link between the transition disks and the observed depletion of refractory materials. If the planetary scenario is confirmed, disks around post-AGB binaries could be a unique laboratory for testing planet-disk interactions and their influence on the late evolution of binary stars. The question of whether such planets are first- or second-generation bodies remains to be considered.

Operative features were similar in terms of overall morbidity 18 (36 %) vs. 36 (36 %), p = 1; intraoperative bleeding, 401 (18-2192) vs. 475 (20-2000) mL, p = 0.89; pedicle clamping, 37 (74 %) vs. 88 (88 %), p = 0.55; margin, 0.6 (0-5) vs. 0.65 (0-5) cm, p = 0.94, and mortality p = 0.65 for the LAP and OP groups, respectively. There was a significant decrease in surgical site infections 1 (2 %) vs. 18 (18 %) p = 0.007 in the LAP group. Operative time was longer: 295 (120-600) vs. 200 (70-450) min (p = 0.0001), and hospital stay significantly shorter: 4 (1-60) vs. 7 (3-44) days, p = 0.0001 with less readmissions (0 vs. 7 %) in the LAP.

Most of the recently reported studies were randomized controlled multicenter clinical trials. Our goal was to test the efficiency of remdesivir in reducing nasopharyngeal viral load and hospitalization length in a real-life setting in admitted patients in a large tertiary center in Israel. METHODS: A total of 142 COVID-19 patients found to have at least three reported SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests during hospitalization were selected for this study. Of these, 29 patients received remdesivir, while the remaining non-treated 113 patients served as controls. RESULTS: Among the tested parameters, the control and remdesivir groups differed significantly only in the intubation rates. Remdesivir treatment did not significantly affect nasopharyngeal viral load, as determined by comparing the differences between the first and last cycle threshold values of the SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests performed during hospitalization (Ct 7.076.85 vs. 7.087.27, p=0.977 in the control and treated groups, respectively). Remdesivir treatment shortened hospitalization length by less than a day compared to non-treated controls and by 3.1 days when non-intubated patients from both groups were compared. These differences, however, were not statistically significant, possibly because of the small size of the remdesivir group. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir was not associated with nasopharyngeal viral load changes, but our study had a significant disease severity baseline imbalance and was not powered to detect viral load or clinical differences.","output":"A real-life setting evaluation of the effect of remdesivir on viral load in COVID-19 patients admitted to a large tertiary center in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this article is to analyze the management of Covid-19 from a socio-environmental perspective, with a scientific, holistic and adaptive approach.

Using this new diagnostic test, we aimed to identify clinical and laboratory features associated with Mp infection. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of children, 3C18 years of age, with CAP from 2016 to 2017. Clinical features and biomarkers were compared between Mp-positive and -negative groups by Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) differences and optimal thresholds were determined by using the DeLong test and Youden J statistic, respectively. RESULTS: Of 63 CAP patients, 29 were Mp-positive (46%). Mp positivity was statistically associated with older age (median, 8.6 vs 4.7 years), no underlying disease, family with respiratory symptoms, prior antibiotic treatment, prolonged prodromal respiratory symptoms and fever, and extrapulmonary (skin) manifestations. Lower levels of C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and procalcitonin (PCT), specifically PCT <0.25 g/L, were statistically associated with Mp infection. A combination of age >5 years (AUC = 0.77), prodromal fever and respiratory symptoms >6 days (AUC = 0.79), and PCT <0.25 g/L (AUC = 0.81) improved diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.90) (P = .05).

Bacterial barrier dressings are a first line of protection against developing wound infections. Most bacterial barrier dressings contain microbicidal chemicals (eg, silver ions, iodine, chlorhexidine) that are released from the dressings, which can be toxic to wound cells. A need exists for cost effective bacterial barrier dressings that absorb wound exudate and do not release toxic materials into the wound or increase the risk for developing bacterial resistance to the microbicidal chemical. The present study reports the development and properties of a novel bacterial barrier dressing that meets these needs. METHODS A high molecular weight (~250 k Daltons) polymer containing a high density of quaternary amines (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride [polyDADMAC]) was permanently bonded onto cellulose fibers (gauze). Microbicidal and mammalian cell cytotoxicity tests were conducted using standard methods. Development of bacterial resistance to the microbicidal fibers was assessed over 10 passages. RESULTS The polyquat-treated bacterial barrier gauze dressing (BIOGUARD [BBD]) had high microbicidal activity even in the presence of proteinaceous fluid against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The BBD dressing passed all mammalian cell toxicity tests due to the non-leaching of the bactericidal polymer. Furthermore, the BBD dressing did not demonstrate any ability to induce bacterial resistance in selection vector testing.

We examined the protective effect of prior COVID-19 disease and vaccination on infection rates among a cohort of healthcare workers (HCW) in South India during the second wave driven mainly by the delta variant. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Symptomatic HCWs were routinely tested by RT-PCR as per institutional policy. Vaccination was offered to all HCWs in late January, and the details were documented. We set up a non-concurrent cohort to document infection rates and estimated protective efficacy of prior infection and vaccination between 16th Apr to 31st May 2021, using a Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates adjusting for daily incidence. Between June 2020 and May 2021, 2735 (23.9%) of 11,405 HCWs were infected, with 1412, including 32 re-infections, reported during the second wave. 6863 HCWs received two doses of vaccine and 1905 one dose. The protective efficacy of prior infection against symptomatic infection was 86.0% (95% CI 76.7%C91.6%). Vaccination combined with prior infection provided 91.1% (95% CI 84.1%C94.9%) efficacy.

A giant magneto-resistive (GMR) sensor was used on which target proteins were fixed and superparamagnetic nanoparticles (diameter: 50 nm) conjugated with drug were used in phosphate buffer, with and without serum. In this study, the following drug-protein pairs were investigated: quercetin and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), Infliximab and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), and Bevacizumab and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). For the quercetin and PKA pair, the time profile of the signal from the GMR sensor due to binding between quercetin and PKA clearly changed before and after the addition of serum. Moreover, it was revealed that not only the association process, but also the dissociation process was influenced by the addition of serum, suggesting that the quercetin and PKA complex may partially contain serum proteins, which affect the formation and stability of the complex. For antibody drugs, little effects of serum matrix were observed on both the association and dissociation processes. These clear differences may be attributed to the hydrophobic and electrostatic character of the drug molecule, target protein, and serum proteins. The real-time monitoring of molecular interactions in a biological matrix enabled by the GMR bio-sensing technique is a powerful tool to investigate such complicated molecular interactions. Understanding the molecular interactions that occur in a biological matrix is indispensable for determining the mechanism of action of the drugs and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics inside the body.

At the scale of a global pandemic, the co-occurrence of natural disasters is inevitable. However, the impact of natural disasters on the spread of COVID-19 has not been extensively evaluated through epidemiological modelling. METHODS: We create an agent-based epidemiology model based on COVID-19 clinical, epidemiological, and geographic data. We first model 35 scenarios with varying natural disaster timing and duration for a COVID-19 outbreak in a theoretical region. We then evaluate the potential effect of an eruption of Vesuvius volcano on the spread of COVID-19 in Campania, Italy. RESULTS: In a majority of cases, the occurrence of a natural disaster increases the number of disease related fatalities. For a natural disaster fifty days after infection onset, the median increase in fatalities is 2, 59, and 180% for a 2, 14, and 31-day long natural disaster respectively, when compared to the no natural disaster scenario. For the Campania case, the median increase in fatalities is 1.1 and 2.4 additional fatalities per 100,000 for eruptions on day 1 and 100 respectively, and 60.0 additional fatalities per 100,000 for an eruption close to the peak in infections (day 50).

However, recent statistics show that the tide is now turning in this regard, with many of these populations beginning to age at rates much faster than many other countries. Such developments require immediate policy action in order to create a sustainable path towards economic growth before demographic changes become less benign in the medium term. In this study, we discuss the economic consequences of population aging, increases in the economic support ratio, and a declining potential growth rate. We argue that it is essential for Southeast Asian developing countries to raise total factor productivity (TFP) growth rates so as to achieve more sustainable economic outcomes. By conducting panel regressions using data from 82 countries across the 1996C2019 study period, our study shows that increasing research and development (R&D) spending and the facilitation of structural changes that transform the digital economy landscape are key policy options that promote TFP growth.","output":"Digital Transformation as a Demographic and Economic Integrated Policy for Southeast Asian Developing Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To validate a smartphone-based Rinne test employing the vibration application of mobile telephones. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective controlled clinical study. SETTING: Tertiary referral medical center. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients hospitalized in the otolaryngology department of a tertiary medical center due to unilateral hearing loss (HL study group), and 30 consecutive inpatients on the same ward who had no otological history (controls) were enrolled. Each participant underwent the traditional 512 Hz tuning fork-based Rinne test, as well as a smartphone-based Rinne test by means of a single uncovered smartphone with a vibration application. The test results were compared to those of formal audiometry. RESULTS: The overall agreement between the traditional Rinne test and the smartphone-based test was 98%. The Sensitivity was 85% for both tests, specificity was 90% and 93% for smartphone and tuning fork tests, respectively. The smartphone-based Rinne test could correctly discriminate between patients with an airCbone gap  25 dB at 512 Hz from patients with a lower or no airCbone gap at 512 Hz. The smartphone-based Rinne could not evaluate two patients with a moderately severe/severe sensorineural hearing loss due to their inability to detect the vibrations. CONCLUSION: A smartphone-based Rinne test was validated for the detection of an airCbone gap  25 dB at 512 Hz in the clinical setting.

Anthropogenic emissions that are harmful to human health have been reduced substantially under COVID-19 lockdown. Satellite remote sensing for air pollution assessments can be highly effective in public health research because of the possibility of estimating air pollution levels over large scales. In this study, we utilized both satellite and surface measurements to estimate air pollution levels in 20 cities across the world. Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) application were used for both spatial and time-series assessment of tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) statuses during the study period (1 February to 11 May 2019 and the corresponding period in 2020). We also measured Population-Weighted Average Concentration (PWAC) of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 using gridded population data and in-situ air pollution estimates. We estimated the economic benefit of reduced anthropogenic emissions using two valuation approaches: (1) the median externality value coefficient approach, applied for satellite data, and (2) the public health burden approach, applied for in-situ data. Satellite data have shown that  28 tons (sum of 20 cities) of NO2 and  184 tons (sum of 20 cities) of CO have been reduced during the study period. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 are reduced by 37 (g/m3), 62 (g/m3), and 145 (g/m3), respectively. A total of 1310, 401, and 430 premature cause-specific deaths were estimated to be avoided with the reduction of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10. The total economic benefits (Billion US$) (sum of 20 cities) of the avoided mortality are measured as 10, 3.1, and 3.3 for NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. In many cases, ground monitored data was found inadequate for detail spatial assessment. This problem can be better addressed by incorporating satellite data into the evaluation if proper quality assurance is achieved, and the data processing burden can be alleviated or even removed. Both satellite and ground-based estimates suggest the positive effect of the limited human interference on natural environments. Further research in this direction is needed to explore this synergistic association more explicitly.","output":"Examining the status of improved air quality in world cities due to COVID-19 led temporary reduction in anthropogenic emissions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is intense interest in developing novel biomaterials which support the invasion and proliferation of living cells for potential applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Decellularization of existing tissues have formed the basis of one major approach to producing 3D scaffolds for such purposes. In this study, we utilize the native hypanthium tissue of apples and a simple preparation methodology to create implantable cellulose scaffolds. To examine biocompatibility, scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in wild-type, immunocompetent mice (males and females; 6-9 weeks old). Following the implantation, the scaffolds were resected at 1, 4 and 8 weeks and processed for histological analysis (H&E, Masson's Trichrome, anti-CD31 and anti-CD45 antibodies). Histological analysis revealed a characteristic foreign body response to the scaffold 1 week post-implantation. However, the immune response was observed to gradually disappear by 8 weeks post-implantation. By 8 weeks, there was no immune response in the surrounding dermis tissue and active fibroblast migration within the cellulose scaffold was observed. This was concomitant with the deposition of a new collagen extracellular matrix. Furthermore, active blood vessel formation within the scaffold was observed throughout the period of study indicating the pro-angiogenic properties of the native scaffolds. Finally, while the scaffolds retain much of their original shape they do undergo a slow deformation over the 8-week length of the study.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the extent to which AI systems in primary care examine the inherent bias toward or against vulnerable populations and appraise how these systems have mitigated the impact of such biases during their development. METHODS We will conduct a search update from an existing scoping review to identify studies on AI and primary care in the following databases: Medline-OVID, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, MathSciNet, AAAI, and arXiv. Two screeners will independently review all abstracts, titles, and full-text articles. The team will extract data using a structured data extraction form and synthesize the results in accordance with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. RESULTS This review will provide an assessment of the current state of health care equity within AI for primary care. Specifically, we will identify the degree to which vulnerable patients have been included, assess how bias is interpreted and documented, and understand the extent to which harmful biases are addressed. As of October 2020, the scoping review is in the title- and abstract-screening stage. The results are expected to be submitted for publication in fall 2021.

We investigated factors associated with primary care engagement among PWUD. METHODS The Participatory Research in Ottawa: Understanding Drugs (PROUD) cohort study meaningfully engaged and trained people with lived experience to recruit and survey marginalized PWUD between March-December 2013. We linked this survey data to provincial-level administrative databases held at ICES. We categorized engagement in primary care over the 2 years prior to survey completion as: not engaged (< 3 outpatient visits to the same family physician) versus engaged in care (3+ visits to the same family physician). We used multivariable logistic regression to determine factors associated with engagement in primary care. RESULTS Characteristics of 663 participants included a median age of 43 years, 76% men, and 67% living in the two lowest income quintile neighborhoods. Despite high comorbidity and a median of 4 (interquartile range 0-10) primary care visits in the year prior to survey completion, only 372 (56.1%) were engaged in primary care. Engagement was most strongly associated with the following factors: receiving provincial benefits, including disability payments (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.30 to 7.43)) or income assistance (AOR 3.69 (95% CI 2.00 to 6.81)), having ever taken methadone (AOR 3.82 (95% CI 2.28 to 6.41)), mental health comorbidity (AOR 3.43 (95% CI 2.19 to 5.38)), and having stable housing (AOR 2.09 (95% CI 1.29 to 3.38)). CONCLUSIONS Despite high comorbidity, engagement in primary care among PWUD was low. Our findings suggest that social care (housing, disability, and income support) and mental health care are associated with improved primary care continuity; integration of these care systems with primary care and opioid substitution therapy may lessen the significant morbidity and acute care use among PWUD.","output":"Engagement in primary health care among marginalized people who use drugs in Ottawa, Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is associated with human-to-human transmission.

It is also fundamental to assessing potential transmission risks of zoonotic pathogens in human-wildlife interfaces. We evaluated the influence of environmental and behavioral variables on the foraging patterns of Pteropus lylei (a reservoir of Nipah virus) in a heterogeneous landscape in Cambodia. METHODS: We employed an approach based on animal-movement modeling, which comprised a path-segmentation method (hidden Markov model) to identify individual foraging-behavior sequences in GPS data generated by eight P. lylei. We characterized foraging localities, foraging activity, and probability of returning to a given foraging locality over consecutive nights. Generalized linear mixed models were also applied to assess the influence of several variables including proxies for energetic costs and quality of foraging areas. RESULTS: Bats performed few foraging bouts (area-restricted searches) during a given night, mainly in residential areas, and the duration of these decreased during the night. The probability of a bat revisiting a given foraging area within 48 h varied according to the duration previously spent there, its distance to the roost site, and the corresponding habitat type. We interpret these fine-scale patterns in relation to global habitat quality (including food-resource quality and predictability), habitat-familiarity and experience of each individual. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that heterogeneous human-made environments may promote complex patterns of foraging-behavior and short-term re-visitation in fruit bat species that occur in such landscapes. This highlights the need for similarly detailed studies to understand the processes that maintain biodiversity in these environments and assess the potential for pathogen transmission in human-wildlife interfaces.","output":"Patterns of foraging activity and fidelity in a southeast Asian flying fox"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations and respiratory failure remain dependent on mechanical ventilation and require tracheostomy, which is an aerosol generating procedure (AGP). The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare staff during AGPs is well documented, and negative-pressure rooms are often unavailable. Innovative techniques to decrease risk to healthcare providers during AGPs are necessary. Our objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) performed using a novel prefabricated low-cost negative-pressure tent (AerosolVE). METHODS: Retrospective review of consecutive PDT procedures performed by neurointensivists on intubated adult patients with COVID-19 using the AerosolVE tent during the pandemic under an innovative clinical care protocol. The AerosolVE negative-pressure tent consists of a clear plastic canopy with slits for hand access attached to a U-shaped base with air vents. Air within the tent is drawn through a high-efficiency particulate air filter and released outside. Preliminary testing during simulated AGPs demonstrated negligible escape of particulate matter beyond the tent. The main outcome measure was successful completion of PDT and bronchoscopy within the AerosolVE tent, without complications. RESULTS: The patients were a 53-year-old man with multifocal ischemic stroke and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 53-year-old woman with cerebellar hemorrhage and ARDS, and a 69-year-old man with ARDS. Pre-procedure FiO(2) requirement was 40C50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8C12 cm H(2)O. The tent was successfully positioned around the patient and PDT completed with real-time ultrasound guidance in all 3 patients. Bronchoscopy was performed to confirm tube position and perform pulmonary toilet. No complications occurred.

It is often confused with child murder, neonaticide, filicide or even genderside. Each of these concepts has to be defined clearly in order to be understood. Through time reasons for infanticide have evolved depending on multiple factors such as culture, religion, beliefs system, or attempts to control the population. It was once seen as a moral virtue. So what has changed? SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between January 2020 and May 2020, a literature search based on electronic bibliographic databases as well as other sources of information (grey literature) was conducted in order to investigate the most recent data on infanticide and child murder, especially the newest socio-economic and psychiatric considerations as well as the different reasons why a mother or a father ends up killing their own child and the Irish situation. RESULTS: Recent works on the subject demonstrate how some new socio economic factors and family considerations impact on infanticide. Mental illness, especially depression and psychosis, is often part of the picture and represent a very high risk factor to commit infanticide and filicide. Fathers and mothers do not proceed the same way nor for the same reasons when they kill their offspring. Neonaticide and infanticide are almost always committed by women. A recent case in Ireland (2020) proves how filicide remains an actual problem. CONCLUSIONS: Filicide is a relatively rare event, and therefore particularly impact both the public and the press when it occurs. Infanticide does not result from a unique cause, but from multiple factors (some being well known, some remaining hypothetical). Psychopathological and socio-economical parameters associated to peculiar family grounds are currently prevalent.

Nevertheless, how immune activation affects motherCoffspring relationships postpartum remains unknown. Here, by using the polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) model of gestational infection we show that viral-like immune activation at mid-gestation persistently changes hypothalamic neurocircuit parameters in mouse dams and, consequently, is adverse to parenting behavior. Poly I:C-exposed dams favor non-pup-directed exploratory behavior at the expense of pup retrieval. These behavioral deficits are underlain by dendrite pruning and lesser immediate early gene activation in Galanin (Gal)(+) neurons with dam-specific transcriptional signatures that reside in the medial preoptic area (mPOA). Reduced activation of an exclusively inhibitory contingent of these distal-projecting Gal(+) neurons allows for increased feed-forward inhibition onto putative dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in Poly I:C-exposed dams. Notably, destabilized VTA output specifically accompanies post-pup retrieval epochs.

They are characterized by high mortality rates and are often caused by Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The increasing number of infections underlines the necessity for additional anti-fungal therapies, which require extended knowledge of gene regulations during fungal infection. MicroRNAs are regulators of important cellular processes, including the immune response. By analyzing their regulation and impact on target genes, novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches may be developed. Here, we examine the role of microRNAs in human dendritic cells during fungal infection. Dendritic cells represent the bridge between the innate and the adaptive immune systems. Therefore, analysis of gene regulation of dendritic cells is of particular significance. By applying next-generation sequencing of small RNAs, we quantify microRNA expression in monocyte-derived dendritic cells after 6 and 12 h of infection with C. albicans and A. fumigatus as well as treatment with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We identified 26 microRNAs that are differentially regulated after infection by the fungi or LPS. Three and five of them are specific for fungal infections after 6 and 12 h, respectively. We further validated interactions of miR-132-5p and miR-212-5p with immunological relevant target genes, such as FKBP1B, KLF4, and SPN, on both RNA and protein level. Our results indicate that these microRNAs fine-tune the expression of immune-related target genes during fungal infection. Beyond that, we identified previously undiscovered microRNAs. We validated three novel microRNAs via qRT-PCR. A comparison with known microRNAs revealed possible relations with the miR-378 family and miR-1260a/b for two of them, while the third one features a unique sequence with no resemblance to known microRNAs.

Individual, occupational, organizational and social factors were investigated. The study also assessed the impact of these factors on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Methods: Healthcare workers in the Quebec (Canada) healthcare system were recruited between May 21 to June 5, 2020. Participants answered an electronic survey 3 months after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak began in Canada. Using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, we studied the prevalence of burnout, PTSD, anxiety and depression in this cohort. Multivariable logistic or linear regression models including resilience, social and organizational support, workload and access to mental health help, simulation techniques and protective personal equipment (PPE) as well as perception of PPE security were conducted for each outcome. Results: In mid-June 2020, 467 participants completed the survey. We found that half (51.8%) of the respondents experienced burnout characterized by emotional exhaustion and/or depersonalization at least once a week. In total, 158 healthcare workers (35.6%) displayed severe symptoms of at least one of the mental health disorders (24.3% PTSD, 23.3% anxiety, 10.6% depression).

However, the mechanism by which HIV-1 mediates its deleterious effects in the brain is poorly defined. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of the HIV-1 tat gene on the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astroglia. Expression of the tat gene as RSV-tat but not that of the CAT gene as RSV-CAT in U373MG astroglial cells led to the induction of NO production and the expression of iNOS protein and mRNA. Induction of NO production by recombinant HIV-1 Tat protein and inhibition of RSV-tat-induced NO production by anti-Tat antibodies suggest that RSV-tat-induced production of NO is dependent on Tat and that Tat is secreted from RSV-tat-transfected astroglia. Similar to U373MG astroglial cells, RSV-tat also induced the production of NO in human primary astroglia. The induction of human iNOS promoter-derived luciferase activity by the expression of RSV-tat suggests that RSV-tat induces the transcription of iNOS. To understand the mechanism of induction of iNOS, we investigated the role of NF-kappaB and C/EBPbeta, transcription factors responsible for the induction of iNOS. Activation of NF-kappaB as well as C/EBPbeta by RSV-tat, stimulation of RSV-tat-induced production of NO by the wild type of p65 and C/EBPbeta, and inhibition of RSV-tat-induced production of NO by deltap65, a dominant-negative mutant of p65, and deltaC/EBPbeta, a dominant-negative mutant of C/EBPbeta, suggest that RSV-tat induces iNOS through the activation of NF-kappaB and C/EBPbeta. In addition, we show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in RSV-tat induced production of NO. Interestingly, PD98059, an inhibitor of the ERK pathway, and deltaERK2, a dominant-negative mutant of ERK2, inhibited RSV-tat-induced production of NO through the inhibition of C/EBPbeta but not that of NF-kappaB.

Although infection can lead to stroke, stroke also induces immune suppression which increases risk of infection. Apart from their short-term effects, emerging evidence suggests that poststroke immune changes may also adversely affect long-term cognitive outcomes in patients with stroke, increasing the risk of poststroke neurodegeneration and dementia. Infections at the time of stroke may also increase immune dysregulation after the stroke, further exacerbating the risk of cognitive decline. This review will cover the role of acute infections, including respiratory infections such as COVID-19, as a trigger for stroke; the role of infectious burden, or the cumulative number of infections throughout life, as a contributor to long-term risk of atherosclerotic disease and stroke; immune dysregulation after stroke and its effect on the risk of stroke-associated infection; and the impact of infection at the time of a stroke on the immune reaction to brain injury and subsequent long-term cognitive and functional outcomes. Finally, we will present a model to conceptualize the many relationships among chronic and acute infections and their short- and long-term neurological consequences. This model will suggest several directions for future research.","output":"Infection as a Stroke Risk Factor and Determinant of Outcome After Stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the characteristics of patients with neurological complaints seeking evaluation in an interdisciplinary emergency department (ED) during the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data on the number of ED presentations due to neurological complaints in weeks 1C15/2020 were collected. In addition, hospital chart data of patients referred for neurological evaluation during weeks 12C15/2020 when the pandemic began impacting on public life in Germany were analysed regarding demographic information, chief complaints, modes of presentation and disposition and ED discharge diagnosis. Both data sets were compared to respective periods from 2017. RESULTS: During the surge of COVID-19, we found a significant decrease of the total number of neurological ED patients by 47.6%. Comparing weeks 12C15 of 2017 and 2020, we found a decrease in the number of patients of <30 years (p<0.001) and an increase of those [Image: see text] 70 years (p<0.001). A higher proportion of patients were admitted to escalated care (p=0.03), and fewer patients were discharged against medical advice (p<0.001). In addition, the ratio of less acute diagnoses (eg, benign headaches) declined significantly. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the pandemic has contributed to a C potentially transient C reframing of laypeoples perception of urgency and necessity for emergency presentation. The establishment and promotion of health-care structures and services like telemedical consultations and the creation of safe ED environments will be essential to enable adequate delivery of care in potential future waves of the pandemic.","output":"Changes in Demographic and Diagnostic Spectra of Patients with Neurological Symptoms Presenting to an Emergency Department During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reeling under the double burden of a biological and a natural disaster, West Bengal needs civil society mobilization in terms of both local and global synergy to rebuild the state and its economy.

This study addressed whether there is strong homology between a SARS-CoV-2 capsid protein and a Mycobacterium bovis protein that would allow for stronger, more specific immune protection. The study also showed the utility of immunohistochemistry in the diagnostic pathology laboratory for elucidating this information. Immunohistochemistry documented that an antibody directed against the SARS-CoV-2 envelope, but not the spike or membrane proteins, strongly cross hybridized to 11/11 Mycobacterial species tested, including M. bovis. BlastP analysis showed high homology of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein with 12 consecutive amino acids of the protein LytR C, which is a consensus protein unique to Mycobacteria. Six additional cases of human tuberculosis with few organisms showed that the viral envelope specific antibody (5/6) was more accurate than the AFB stain (2/6) for diagnostic purposes. These data indicate BCG vaccination induces a specific immunity against SARS CoV-2 that targets the viral envelope protein that is essential for infectivity. Thus, a concurrent booster or first use of the BCG vaccine may reduce the severity of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Prior studies have described various safety threats in ambulatory pediatrics, and little is known about effective strategies to minimize error. The purpose of this review is to identify best practices for optimizing safety in ambulatory pediatrics. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of the patient safety literature in ambulatory pediatrics describes frequencies and types of medical errors. Study of effective interventions to reduce error, and particularly to reduce harm, have been limited. There is evidence that medical complexity and social context are important modifiers of risk. Telemedicine has emerged as a care delivery model with potential to ameliorate and exacerbate safety threats. Though there is variation across studies, developing a safety culture, partnerships with patients and families, and use of structured communication are strategies that support patient safety. SUMMARY: There is no standardized taxonomy for errors in ambulatory pediatrics, but errors related to medications, vaccines, diagnosis, and care coordination and care transitions are commonly described. Evidence-based approaches to optimize safety include standardized prescribing and medication reconciliation practices, appropriate use of decision support tools in the electronic health record, and communication strategies like teach-back.

METHODS: We prospectively compared natural spring water gargle to combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab (ONPS) for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in paired clinical specimens (1005 ONPS and 1005 gargles) collected from 987 unique early symptomatic as well as asymptomatic individuals from the community. RESULTS: Using a direct RT-PCR method with the Allplex? 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene), the clinical sensitivity of the gargle was 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.2 C 98.3%), similar to the sensitivity of the ONPS (93.8%; 95% CI, 88.2 C 97.3%), despite significantly lower viral RNA concentration in gargles, as reflected by higher cycle threshold values. No single specimen type detected all COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable in gargles at room temperature for at least 7 days.

We identified a set of thirteen cell surface antigens capable of distinguishing acute candidemia from healthy individuals and uninfected hospital patients with commensal colonization. Interestingly, a large proportion of these cell surface antigens are involved in either oxidative stress or drug resistance. In addition, we identified 33 antigenic proteins that are enriched in convalescent sera of the candidemia patients. Intriguingly, we found within this subset an increase in antigens associated with heme-associated iron acquisition.

In the presence of NADPH, the recombinant cytochrome P450 proteins encoded by LjFNSII-1.1, LjFNSII-2.1, and LmFNSII-1.1 converted eriodictyol, naringenin, and liquiritigenin to the corresponding flavones directly. The different catalytic properties between LjFNSII-2.1 and LjFNSII-1.1 were caused by a single amino acid substitution at position 242 (glutamic acid to lysine).

In addition, LjFNSII-1.1&2.1 and LmFNSII-1.1 also biosynthesize flavones that were further modified by O-glycosylation in transgenic tobacco. The expression levels of the FNSII genes were consistent with flavone accumulation patterns in flower buds.

Overall, 723 individuals who completed the initial vaccination regime (fully vaccinated group) and an additional 18 who received a booster dose were identifiedtogether, they represented 20.8% of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalized during the same period in the same healthcare institutions (0.5% in the case of a group that received a booster dose). Although laboratory and clinical parameters did not differ between both groups, patients who received a booster tended to have lower CRP, IL-6, PCT, and d-dimer levels and they required oxygen therapy less frequently. The most common early COVID-19 symptoms in the studied group were fatigue, cough, fever (>38 C), and dyspnea. Individuals with no detectable anti-spike IgG antibodies constituted 13%; the odds of being a humoral non-responder to the vaccine were increased in patients aged >70 years. Fully vaccinated patients hospitalized after more than 180 days from the last vaccine dose were significantly older and they were predominantly represented by individuals over 70 years and with comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease. Contrary to mRNA vaccines, most patients vaccinated with adenoviral vector vaccines were infected within six months.

In the present study, we examined whether oxidative stress, which is involved in the pathogenesis of COPD, enhances the responses of TLR3 in airway epithelial cells. The effect of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) on the release of IL-8 from BEAS-2B cells and primary human bronchial epithelial cells after stimulation with polyinosine-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA and a ligand for TLR3, and the signal transduction were examined. One hundred to 150 muM H(2)O(2) significantly potentiated the release of IL-8 from the epithelial cells after stimulation with 10 microg/ml poly(I:C). The H(2)O(2)-augmented IL-8 release was inhibited by treatment with N-acetylcysteine. One hundred micromoles of H(2)O(2) enhanced the translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65, but not that of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), into the nucleus and the NF-kappaB DNA binding activity after poly(I:C) stimulation, which effect was inhibited not by the silencing of IRF-3 but by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, or dexamethasone. One hundred micromoles of H(2)O(2) potentiated the TLR3 expression on the airway epithelial cells treated with poly(I:C).

The highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has begun to cause increases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in parts of the United States. With slowed vaccination uptake, this novel variant is expected to increase the risk of pandemic resurgence in the US in JulyDecember 2021. WHAT IS ADDED BY THIS REPORT? Data from nine mechanistic models project substantial resurgences of COVID-19 across the US resulting from the more transmissible Delta variant. These resurgences, which have now been observed in most states, were projected to occur across most of the US, coinciding with school and business reopening. Reaching higher vaccine coverage in JulyDecember 2021 reduces the size and duration of the projected resurgence substantially. The expected impact of the outbreak is largely concentrated in a subset of states with lower vaccination coverage. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE? Renewed efforts to increase vaccination uptake are critical to limiting transmission and disease, particularly in states with lower current vaccination coverage. Reaching higher vaccination goals in the coming months can potentially avert 1.5 million cases and 21,000 deaths and improve the ability to safely resume social contacts, and educational and business activities.

DESIGN: -Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal tests and a gastrointestinal tissue specimen were included. SARS-CoV-2 in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed on each sample. A subset had SARS-CoV-2 next generation sequencing (NGS) performed. RESULTS: -Twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria. Five had positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal tests within 7 days of their gastrointestinal procedure. Two were ulcerative colitis patients on steroid therapy who lacked typical COVID-19 symptoms. Their colectomies showed severe ulcerative colitis; one demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 by NGS but a negative ISH. Another had an ischemic colon resected as a complication of the COVID-19 course; however, both ISH and NGS were negative. A fourth had a normal-appearing terminal ileum but positive ISH and NGS. The fifth patient had ileal ulcers with SARS-CoV-2 negativity by both modalities. The remaining 20 patients had positive nasopharyngeal tests an average of 53 days prior to procedure. None of their samples demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 ISH positivity, but one was positive on NGS despite a negative nasopharyngeal test. CONCLUSIONS: -Gastrointestinal findings from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients ranged from normal with virus detected by ISH and NGS, to bowel ischemia secondary to systemic viral effects, without evidence of virus in the tissue. No distinct histologic finding was identified in those with gastrointestinal tissue specimens demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 positivity in this cohort.","output":"Gastrointestinal Pathology in Samples from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Positive Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cultural and creative industries (CCIs) are increasingly being recognised in South Africa, as in other countries, as wealth-creating, given appropriate investment, rather than primarily a non-market subsidized sector. However, national innovation policy is still predominantly focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) skillsets and related product markets. This paper analyses how the CCIs in the Cape Town cluster innovate by combining digital technology, creative inputs, and workforce diversity. Based on a similar study conducted in Brighton, UK, a cluster of innovative CCI firms was identified that are to varying degrees fused, defined as combining digital technology and creative design in production. Fused firms have higher levels of innovation in business processes, goods and services. Fused firms were also more likely to employ demographically diverse people, adding insights from the South African mix to the UK studies on disciplinary diversity. While fused creative-digital firms employ greater diversity, a qualitative analysis of SA gaming and animation firms nevertheless demonstrates the challenges for improving diversity in a developing country context.","output":"Innovation and diversity in the digital cultural and creative industries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antisocial behaviors cause harm, directly or indirectly, to others' welfare. The novel coronavirus pandemic has increased the urgency of understanding a specific form of antisociality: behaviors that increase risk of disease transmission. Because disease transmission-linked behaviors tend to be interpreted and responded to differently than other antisocial behaviors, it is unclear whether general indices of antisociality predict contamination-relevant behaviors. In a pre-registered study using an online U.S. sample, we found that individuals reporting high levels of antisociality engage in fewer social distancing measures: they report leaving their homes more frequently (p = .024) and standing closer to others while outside (p < .001). These relationships were observed after controlling for sociodemographic variables, illness risk, and use of protective equipment. Independently, higher education and leaving home for work were also associated with reduced distancing behavior. Antisociality was not significantly associated with level of worry about the coronavirus. These findings suggest that more antisocial individuals may pose health risks to themselves and their community during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Reduced social distancing early in the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with antisocial behaviors in an online United States sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Physiotherapy in urogynecology faces challenges to safely continuing its work, considering the adoption of social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some guidelines have already been published for urogynecology; however, no specific documents have been produced on physiotherapy in urogynecology. This article aimed to offer guidance regarding physiotherapy in urogynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A group of experts in physiotherapy in womens health performed a literature search in the Pubmed, PEDro, Web of Science and Embase databases and proposed a clinical guideline for physiotherapy management of urogynecological disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. This document was reviewed by other physiotherapists and a multidisciplinary panel, which analyzed the suggested topics and reached consensus. The recommendations were grouped according to their similarities and allocated into categories. RESULTS: Four categories of recommendations (ethics and regulation issues, assessment of pelvic floor muscle function and dysfunction, health education and return to in-person care) were proposed. Telephysiotherapy and situations that need in-person care were also discussed. Regionalization is another topic that was considered. CONCLUSION: This study provides some guidance for continuity of the physiotherapist's work in urogynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering the World Health Organization recommendations and the epidemiological public health situation of each region.

In this study, we performed single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of peripheral blood samples collected from six healthy controls and 14 COVID-19 samples including severe, moderate, and convalescent samples from three severely/critically ill and four moderately ill patients. We found that the monocytes were strongly remodeled in the severely/critically ill patients with COVID-19, with an increased proportion of monocytes and seriously reduced diversity. In addition, we discovered two novel severe-disease-specific monocyte subsets: Mono 0 and Mono 5. These subsets expressed amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) gene, exhibited an enriched erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB) signaling pathway, and appeared to exhibit pro-fibrogenic and pro-inflammation characteristics. We also found metabolic changes in Mono 0 and Mono 5, including increased glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and an increased hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway. Notably, one pre-severe sample displayed a monocyte atlas similar to that of the severe/critical samples. In conclusion, our study discovered two novel severe-disease-specific monocyte subsets as potential predictors and therapeutic targets for severe COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: As SARS-CoV-2 spreads and health care facilities near or exceed capacity, facilities may implement alternative care sites (ACSs). With COVID-19 surges predicted, developing additional capacity in alternative facilities, including hotels and convention centers, into patient care environments requires early careful consideration of the existing space constraints, infrastructure, and modifications needed for patient care and infection control. Design-based strategies utilizing engineering solutions have the greatest impact, followed by medical and operational strategies. METHODS: This article evaluates infection control and environmental strategies in inpatient units and proposes system modifications to ACS surge facilities to reduce infection risk and improve care environments. RESULTS: Although adequate for an acute infectious disease outbreak, existing capacity in U.S. biocontainment units and airborne infection isolation rooms is not sufficient for widespread infection control and isolation during a pandemic. To improve patients' outcomes and decrease infection transmission risk in the alternative care facility, hospital planners, administrators, and clinicians can take cues from evidence-based strategies implemented in biocontainment units and standard inpatient rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative technologies, including optimized air-handling systems with ultraviolet and particle filters, can be an essential part of an infection control strategy. For flexible surge capacity in future ACS and hospital projects, interdisciplinary design and management teams should apply strategies optimizing the treatment of both infectious patients and minimizing the risk to health care workers.","output":"Built Environment Airborne Infection Control Strategies in Pandemic Alternative Care Sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Independent Review of the Mental Health Act (MHA) in England and Wales confirmed increasing levels of compulsory detentions, especially for racialised communities.

With the alarming increase in the number of cases and deaths worldwide, the possible risk factors should be determined in order to have a general idea on those who are more susceptible to have this disease. Hypertension, being one of the world's leading causes of noncommunicable diseases, was identified by the CDC to be one of underlying medical conditions that might pose an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the predictive value of hypertension as a comorbidity in COVID-19 mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants included all patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19, and have hypertension as their pre-existing medical condition. Studies were selected based on study design, participants, exposure, outcome, timing, setting and language. The following databases were searched from June to August 2020 for case control and cohort studies on MEDLINE and CINAHL, ScienceDirect, Clinical Key, OVID database, Wiley Online library, and UpToDate. The criteria for evaluation of risk of bias were based on the selection bias, comparability bias and outcome bias. All information gathered were collated and evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and CEBM. RESULTS: Individual studies all showed a significant relationship between hypertension and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Odds ratio ranging from 1.75 to 28.88, and hazard ratio ranging from 1.49 to 3.32 are present in the studies. For the data analysis, Mantel Haenszel method and random effects model was used for case control studies with odds ratio as effect measure; while Inverse variance method and fixed model was used for cohort studies with hazard ratio as effect measure. Both groups showed significant positive association between mortality and hypertension as a prognostic factor. Overall odds ratio is 5.25 (2.42C11.40) with a p value of <0.ehab724.23931, and the pooled hazard ratio is 2.21 (1.75C2.80) with a p value of <0.ehab724.23931. This shows that there is an increased risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients with hypertension as a comorbid condition. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension as a comorbid condition is a prognostic factor in the prediction of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The ten included studies showed that there is a significant positive association suggesting an increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.

These results reinforce past findings that meaning in life can effectively buffer against the impact of negative life events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

We show that the contribution of a nonmaintenance host (i.e., a host type which cannot sustain transmission on its own) to the risk of a major epidemic is greatly diminished as mixing patterns become more assortative, and in such a scenario, a higher proportion of non-maintenance hosts among index cases elevates the probability of extinction.

RESULTS: The prevalence of lifetime and last year non-fatal opioid overdose was 62.5% and 36.9%, respectively. Many of the study participants reported heroin (64%) and fentanyl (45%) use during the 30 days preceding the survey. Nonprescription buprenorphine and fentanyl use were independently associated with higher odds of lifetime NFOD, while marijuana use was associated with lower odds of lifetime NFOD (p < 0.05). Injection as the route of administration, benzodiazepine, nonprescription buprenorphine, heroin, and fentanyl use were independently associated with higher odds, while methadone use was associated with lower odds of past year NFOD (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We documented a high prevalence of past year and lifetime NFOD among PWUD in MA. Our findings provide indicators that can help inform interventions to prevent overdoses among PWUD, including overdose prevention, medication treatment, and naloxone distribution.","output":"Prevalence and correlates of non-fatal overdose among people who use drugs: findings from rapid assessments in Massachusetts, 2017C2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the main challenges that psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner (PMNHP) students experience is preparing to prescribe medications by demonstrating psychopharmacological competency.

We aim to analyse the management of patients presenting with AA to our institution during the first wave of the pandemic, comparing surgically and conservatively managed patients. Method All patients presenting to our centre with AA between March and July 2020 were included. Six-month follow-up data were collected retrospectively using electronic records. Patients were categorised into surgically and conservatively managed groups. The primary outcome was the complication rate (post-operative complications vs failure of antibiotic treatment) and the secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and Alvarado score. Results Fifty-seven patients (n=57) were admitted with AA, 45.6% (n=26) managed conservatively compared to 54.4% (n=31) treated surgically. Higher complication rates were observed amongst the conservatively managed group, although not found to be statistically significant (16% vs 35%; p=0.131). There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay observed between the two groups (surgical: median, 2; interquartile range, 2-3 vs conservative: median, 3; interquartile range, 2-4). White cell count (WCC) and Alvarado score were higher on admission in the surgical group with statistical significance (p=0.012 and p=0.028, respectively). Conclusions COVID-19 has led to a significant cohort of conservatively managed AA patients in the United Kingdom. We propose a stratification pathway based on clinical severity, Alvarado score and imaging to facilitate safe selection for conservative management of AA, in order to reduce failure of treatment rates in this patient group. Further UK-based studies will add to the evidence-based surrounding safe management of AA with conservative treatment.","output":"Surgical Versus Conservative Management of Acute Appendicitis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single-Centre Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Patients with cancer are at higher risk for contracting the COVID-19 infection and are more likely to have higher morbidity and mortality. This is a big challenge for oncology teams that have to treat patients to avoid contamination by SARS-CoV-2.

From 2014, outbreaks were also reported from Central Europe. To characterize the Central European PEDV strains regarding their virulence in suckling piglets, and to assess the protective effect of maternally derived antibodies (MDA), four trial groups were randomly assigned, each consisting of two pregnant sows and their litter. To induce MDA in a subset of piglets, two sows received a cell culture-adapted PEDV strain, and another two sows were inoculated with field material from German PED outbreaks. Four sows stayed na?ve. Subsequently, all piglets were inoculated with the corresponding PEDV strains at an age of 3 to 6 days, and virus shedding, clinical signs and occurrence of specific antibodies were assessed. Piglets without MDA showed a morbidity of 100% and low lethality, while almost all MDA-positive piglets stayed clinically healthy and showed considerably lower virus shedding. Taken together, the Central European PEDV strains showed rather low virulence under experimental conditions, and pre-inoculation of sows led to a solid protection of their offspring. The latter is the prerequisite for a sow vaccination concept that could help to prevent PED induced losses in the piglet sector.","output":"Virulence of current German PEDV strains in suckling pigs and investigation of protective effects of maternally derived antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE It has come to our attention that specific vascular changes (VCs) appear more frequently in chest computed tomography (CT) of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we aimed to investigate if these specific VCs in chest CT correlate with clinical severity of the disease. METHODS CT images of 102 patients who underwent low-dose noncontrast chest CT due to COVID-19 between 11 March 2020 and 11 April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of VCs in CT images. VCs in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 were defined using the following descriptors: decreased lumen caliber, vascular wall irregularity, angulation in the course of the vessel, vascular disruption, and/or interruption. The relationship of these VCs with disease symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath), comorbid conditions (diabetes, hypertension, asthma), smoking habit, disease-specific laboratory changes (white blood cell-lymphocyte count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin, procalcitonin), lung parenchymal infiltration pattern (ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation) and its distribution (peripheral, central, mixed, upper lobes, lower lobes, right middle lobe) on CT were investigated by comparison of these variables between patients with and without VCs in chest CT. RESULTS VCs were observed in 18 out of 102 patients (18%) with typical parenchymal involvement for COVID-19. There was no significant difference in terms of age and sex. We found an irregularity in the wall of the vascular structures in the distal branches and decreased lumen caliber of the vessels related to ground-glass opacities in 15 patients, concentric luminal narrowing in annular form in 4 patients, angulation/traction or springiness in the vascular structures towards the active lesions in 3 patients, and interruptions along the vascular course in 1 patient. VCs were significantly correlated with fever (12/18, 66.7%) and shortness of breath (7/18, 39%). These changes were significantly more remarkable in common disease involving both upper and lower lobes (10/18, 56%). In these cases, there was a substantial increase in CRP (15/18, 83%; mean, 5.76.3 mg/dL) and LDH (8/18, 44%) values compared to those who did not have any VCs. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that specific VCs observed in chest CT may predict the disease severity in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. These changes may be related to respiratory distress in the disease.","output":"A new imaging sign in COVID-19 pneumonia: vascular changes and their correlation with clinical severity of the disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to the highly contagious innate of the novel coronavirus, the surgical team is exposed to the disease during surgical care of patient with confirmed covid-19. Therefore, the necessary measures should be taken to protect surgical caregivers.

METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 183 surgical team members working in hospitals affiliated to Tabriz university of medical sciences in 2020. Participants were selected by stratified random sampling. The required data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire according to the standard protocols of SAGES, EAES and AORN. In the first part of this questionnaire, the level of compliance with the standards of using personal protective equipment (PPE) was evaluated and in the second part, the level of compliance with the preventive strategies in the operating room was evaluated in three phases of Pre, Intra and Post-operative. The data was analyzed using SPSS16. RESULTS: preventive standards observance against COVID-19 was in moderate (55.3  10.5) level and The level of compliance with the standards of using PPE by the surgical team was favorable (61.8  8.1). There was a statistically significant relationship between the level of compliance with the standards of using PPE and the type of specialty (P = 0.004).

Understanding the determinants of vaccine uptake in migrants is critical to address immediate COVID-19 vaccination inequities, and longer-term will help improve coverage for routine vaccinations, aligning with the goals of the new Immunisation Agenda 2030. We did a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and using a PICOS framework (PROSPERO CRD42020219214; MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases, 1 January 2000 - 14 September 2021) exploring barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake and determinants of under-vaccination in migrants in the EU/EEA, UK, and Switzerland. We categorised barriers/facilitators using the 5As Determinants of Vaccine Uptake Taxonomy. 5259 data sources were screened, with 67 studies included from 16 countries, representing 366,529 migrants. Access barriers were most commonly reported (language, literacy and communication barriers; practical and legal barriers to accessing/delivering vaccination services; service barriers, including lack of specific guidelines and knowledge of healthcare professionals) for key vaccines including MMR, DTP, HPV, influenza, polio, COVID-19 vaccines. Acceptance barriers were mostly reported in Eastern European and Muslim communities for HPV, measles, and influenza vaccines. We identified 23 determinants of under-vaccination in migrants, including geographical origin (where 25/26 (96%) studies showed significance) - particularly African/Eastern European origin; recent migration; being a refugee/asylum seeker; higher income; parental education level; no healthcare contact in the past year; and lower language skills. Facilitators of migrants vaccine uptake included tailored vaccination messaging, community outreach and nudging interventions. Migrants barriers to accessing healthcare are already well documented, and this review confirms their role in limiting vaccine uptake. These data hold immediate relevance to strengthening vaccination programmes in high-income countries, including for COVID-19. Our findings suggested that targeted, evidence-informed strategies are needed to address access and acceptance barriers to vaccination in migrants, including the development of migrant-sensitive and adaptable vaccination services and systems, unambiguous public health messaging, and coproduction of tailored interventions.","output":"Defining the determinants of under-vaccination in migrant populations in Europe to improve routine and COVID-19 vaccine uptake: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compelling evidence ties heparanase, an endoglycosidase that cleaves heparan sulfate side (HS) chains of proteoglycans, with all steps of tumor development, including tumor initiation, angiogenesis, growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance.

However, vaccine hesitancy still exists and becomes a barrier for promoting COVID-19 vaccination among PLWHA. OBJECTIVE: Objective: This study aims to investigate factors that contributed to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among PLWHA. METHODS: Methods: The study used a multicenter cross-sectional design and an online survey mode. We recruited PLWHA aged 18-65 years old from five metropolitan cities in China between January and February 2021. Participants completed an online survey through the Golden Data, a widely used encrypted web-based survey platform. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the background characteristics in relation to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and structural equation modeling was performed to assess the relationships among perceived benefits, perceived risks, self-efficacy, subjective norms, and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Results: Among 1735 participants, 41.61% (722/1735) reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. An older age, no other vaccinations in the past 3 years, and having chronic disease history were positively associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Structural equation modeling revealed a direct relationship of perceived benefits, perceived risks, and subjective norms with self-efficacy and vaccine hesitancy and an indirect relationship of perceived benefits, perceived risks, and subjective norms with vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, the self-efficacy toward COVID-19 vaccination was low. PLWHA had concerns of HIV disclosure during COVID-19 vaccination. Family members support could have an impact on the COVID-19 vaccination decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was high among PLWHA in China. To reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, programs and strategies should be adopted to eliminate the concerns for COVID-19 vaccination, disseminate accurate information on the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, encourage family members support for COVID-19 vaccination, and improve PLWHA's trust on medical professionals.","output":"Reasons of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among Chinese People Living with HIV/AIDS: A Structural Equation Modeling Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incident command system provides an organizational structure at the agency, discipline, or jurisdiction level for effectively coordinating response and recovery efforts during most conventional disasters.

As yet there are no reports of transfusion transmission of COVID-19. Haemovigilance findings within a three-month surveillance period during the new coronavirus pandemic are presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Due to great demand and shortage, blood sessions in outpatient facilities were organized during the high prevalence period of COVID-19, alongside a national plan to monitor the evolving public health situation by random molecular screening of high-risk groups of the population. Haemovigilance protocols were implemented as well as surveillance for any COVID-19 case reported post-transfusion. A 14-day quarantine and follow-up molecular and antibody testing of any COVID-19 positive case was obligatory. RESULTS: Post-donation, post-transfusion information and molecular testing of swab samples collected from three asymptomatic donors at risk for COVID-19, revealed the case of an immunosupressed patient who had been transfused with whole blood derived platelets from a donor subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. The recipient exhibited no symptoms of the disease. Molecular and antibody testing results were negative. CONCLUSION: Haemovigilance provided information supporting the absence of transfusion transmission of COVID-19, thus strengthening the hypothesis that, even if it cannot yet be definitively ruled out, COVID-19 is not transmitted through blood transfusion.

Patients who require prolonged isolation until recovery, such as those who suffer from COVID-19, present multiple therapeutic dilemmas to their caregivers. Therefore, utilizing remote care in the daily workflow would be a valuable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic ocular conditions in this challenging clinical setting. Our aim is to review the latest technological and methodical advances in teleophthalmology and highlight their implementation in screening and managing various ocular conditions. We present them as well as potential diagnostic and treatment applications in view of the recent SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak. METHODS: A computerized search from January 2017 up to March 2020 of the online electronic database PubMed was performed, using the following search strings: \\"telemedicine,\\" \\"telehealth,\\" and \\"ophthalmology.\\" More generalized complementary contemporary research data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic was also obtained from the PubMed database. RESULTS: A total of 312 records, including COVID-19-focused studies, were initially identified. After exclusion of non-relevant, non-English, and duplicate studies, a total of 138 records were found eligible. Ninety records were included in the final qualitative analysis. CONCLUSION: Teleophthalmology is an effective screening and management tool for a range of adult and pediatric acute and chronic ocular conditions. It is mostly utilized in screening of retinal conditions such as retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration; in diagnosing anterior segment condition; and in managing glaucoma. With improvements in image processing, and better integration of the patient's medical record, teleophthalmology should become a more accepted modality, all the more so in circumstances where social distancing is inflicted upon us.","output":"Telemedicine in ophthalmology in view of the emerging COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mosque is a unique building by the function as muslim prayer room Indonesia as the world biggest muslim country has mandated each building to provide prayer room especially mosque by issuance of Ministry of Public Work-Housing Settlement decree no 14/2017 Academic building like cam-puss also mandated to have the campus mosque to facilitate the Muslim's civitas academia performing their prayer However, the campus buildings commonly were not designed with mosque facility in purpose Thus, campus designer performed remodelling their building to meet this demand During the pandemic COVID-19 in Indonesia, some of undesignated academic mosques in Architecture Undip were responded it with various adaptation This study purposed to investigate the responses of those mosque and try to figure the scheme of adaptation phase using descriptive analysis The result of this study found that the places were follow the government advices and brought alone prayer into common practice ?

This has led to the development of different surgical techniques to restore knee stability. MATERIAL Y METHODS Clinical study, randomized, blind comparing ACL reconstruction techniques with One Band and ?U-Two? using clinical scales and arthrometria with KT-1000 and Pivot Shift Meter. RESULTS Of 36 patients, 52.94% was drawn for the One Band technique and 47.06% for ?U-Two?. 11.76% of patients had a displacement greater than 11mm in the affected knee with KT-1000. 8.82% showed an equal anterior displacement on both knees. One patient had a major previous displacement after reconstruction surgery with the one band technique, but with improvement on clinical scales. Pivot Shift measurements found a difference in displacement greater than 4,000 m/s on the X axis following the One Band technique compared to the healthy knee calculating integrals, while with U-Two the difference was less than 600 m/s. On the Y axis a difference of 3,500 m/s was found between the healthy and the injured leg, which decreases to less than 2,000 m/s after reconstruction using U-Two technique. CONCLUSIONS Differences have been found throughout the study in patient evolution, indicating that repair using the U-Dos technique has better results in recovering the anteroposterior and rotational stability of the affected limb.","output":"[Comparative study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between the One Band and U-Two techniques]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The success of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) mostly depends on regular injections. Our aim was to investigate adherence to SCIT with aeroallergens during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrate clinical consequences of treatment disruptions in real-life. Methods: Visual analogue scale for quality of life (VAS-QoL), VAS for symptom scores (VAS-symptom), medication scores (MSs) and total symptom scores (TSS-6) were recorded during the pandemic in 327 adult allergic rhinitis and/or asthmatic patients receiving maintenance SCIT and these scores were compared with the pre-pandemic data. Patients were grouped according to SCIT administration intervals;no delay (Group 1), <2 months (Group 2), and 2 month intervals (Group 3). Results: 104 (31.8%) patients (Group 3) were considered as non-adherent which was mostly related to receiving SCIT with HDMs and using public transportation for reaching the hospital. Median MS, VAS-symptom and TSS-6 scores of Group 3 patients during the pandemic were higher than the pre-pandemic scores (p=0.005, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively) whereas median VAS-QoL scores of Group 3 during the pandemic were lower than the pre-pandemic scores (p<0.001). Median TSS-6 and VAS-symptom scores were the highest in Group 3 compared to other groups (p<0.001 for each comparison). Median VAS-QoL scores were the lowest in Group 3 compared to Group 1 and Group 2 (p<0.001, p=0.043, respectively). Conclusion: When precautions in allergy clinics are carefully applied, adherence to SCIT can be high during a pandemic. Patients must be warned about adhering to SCIT injections since delays in SCIT administration can deteriorate clinical symptoms.","output":"Adherence to subcutaneous immunotherapy with aeroallergens in real-life practice during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing SARSCoV-2 pandemic was introduced into Africa on 14th February 2020 and has rapidly spread across the continent causing severe public health crisis and mortality.

We sought to predict the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the timely delivery of non-emergent ophthalmology sub-specialty surgical care in Ontario. METHODS: This is a microsimulation modelling study. We used provincial population-based administrative data from the Wait Time Information System database in Ontario for January 2019 to May 2021 and facility-level data for March 2018 to May 2021 to estimate the backlog size and wait times associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For the postpandemic recovery phase, we estimated the resources required to clear the backlog of patients accumulated on the wait-list during the pandemic. Outcomes were accrued over a time horizon of 3 years. RESULTS: A total of 56 923 patients were on the wait-list in the province of Ontario awaiting non-emergency ophthalmic surgery as of Mar. 15, 2020. The number of non-emergency surgeries performed in the province decreased by 97% in May 2020 and by 80% in May 2021 compared with the same months in 2019. By 2 years and 3 years since the start of the pandemic, the overall estimated number of patients awaiting surgery grew by 129% and 150%, respectively. The estimated mean wait time for patients for all subspecialty surgeries increased to 282 (standard deviation [SD] 91) days in March 2023 compared with 94 (SD 97) days in 2019. The provincial monthly additional resources required to clear the backlog by March 2023 was estimated to be a 34% escalation from the prepandemic volumes (4626 additional surgeries). INTERPRETATION: The estimates from this microsimulation modelling study suggest that the magnitude of the ophthalmic surgical backlog from the COVID-19 pandemic has important implications for the recovery phase. This model can be adapted to other jurisdictions to assist with recovery planning for vision-saving surgeries.","output":"The ophthalmic surgical backlog associated with the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based and microsimulation modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The possibility to use widespread and simple chest X-ray (CXR) imaging for early screening of COVID-19 patients is attracting much interest from both the clinical and the AI community.

Multiple COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in agricultural settings, including a large outbreak among employees of a fruit grower during May-August. Because of this outbreak, Okanogan County Public Health and the Washington State Department of Health initiated one-time, on-site screening testing (2) of all orchard and warehouse employees in August 2020 and assessed risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 3,708 known orchard employees, a valid SARS-CoV-2 test result or information on COVID-19-like symptoms in the absence of a test was available for 3,013 (81%). Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during approximately 3 months among tested orchard employees was 6%. Cumulative incidence was 12% in employees residing in the community, compared with 4% in employees residing in farmworker housing (p<0.001); point prevalence during the single screening testing event was 1% in both groups. Among 1,247 known warehouse employees, a valid result was available for 726 (58%). Cumulative incidence over approximately 3 months among tested warehouse employees was 23%, with substantial variation across job roles. Positive test results were received by 28% of employees who worked packing and sorting fruit, 24% of those in other roles in the packing and sorting area, 10% of forklift operators, 7% of employees in other warehouse roles, and 6% of office employees. Point prevalence among all warehouse workers was 1% at the screening testing event.

Historically, the diagnosis of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) can lead to postponement of surgery due to concerns of perioperative complications related to acute illness. Respiratory viral panels (RVP) are often used to confirm the presence of recent or active viral infection and can affect the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction. This study examined whether RVP positive testing is correlated with perioperative complications and operative findings in pediatric patients undergoing inpatient DLB. Methods A retrospective chart review of 132 pediatric patient encounters was performed. Viral testing results, DLB indication, DLB findings, and perioperative complications were compared. Results Sixty encounters (45.5%) involved a positive RVP, and 72 (54.5%) involved a negative RVP. Those with positive RVP were less likely to have an anatomic airway abnormality (p = 0.0250) and more likely to have a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (p = 0.0464). The most common reason for DLB was to assess for structural airway abnormality. Laryngospasm occurred in 1 (1.7%) RVP positive and 1 (1.4%) RVP negative encounter, and 2 (2.8%) RVP negative encounters required reintubation. No other major complications were observed. No association was noted between RVP results and incidence of major or minor complication. Conclusions Major perioperative complications after surgical intervention with DLB for the management of complex, inpatient children with stridor and respiratory distress are rare.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Crucial treatments were delayed for many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, over concerns for hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections. To protect cancer patients whose survival depended on timely surgery, a \\"COVID-minimal pathway\\" was created. METHODS: Patients who underwent a surgical procedure on the pathway between April and May 2020 were evaluated. The \\"COVID-minimal surgical pathway\\" consisted of: (A) evolving best-practices in COVID-19 transmission-reduction, (B) screening patients and staff, (C) preoperative COVID-19 patient testing, (D) isolating pathway patients from COVID-19 patients. Patient status through 2 weeks from discharge was determined as a reflection of hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: After implementation, pathway screening processes excluded 7 COVID-19-positive people from interacting with pathway (4 staff and 3 patients). Overall, 122 patients underwent 125 procedures on pathway, yielding 83 admissions (42 outpatient procedures). The median age was 64 (56-79) and 57% of patients were female. The most common surgical indications were cancer affecting the uterus, genitourinary tract, colon, lung or head and neck. The median length of admission was 3 days (1-6). Repeat COVID-19 testing performed on 27 patients (all negative), including 9 patients evaluated in an emergency room and 8 readmitted patients.

While robust SARS-CoV-2 serological assays were quickly developed, only limited information on applied serological testing is available. We describe the extent and nature of SARS-CoV-2 serological testing used in Europe and assess the links between epidemiology, mitigation strategies applied and seroprevalence. METHODS: An online questionnaire on SARS-CoV-2 serology was sent to the European Society of Clinical Virology and European Non-Polio Enterovirus Network members in September 2020. Data were analysed by comparing mitigation approaches, serological methods and seroprevalance studies performed. RESULTS: About 100 000 laboratory confirmed cases identified between March and June 2020 were reported by 36 participating laboratories from 20 countries. All responders experienced mitigation strategies including lockdowns and other closures. All except one participant had introduced serological testing; most had validated their assays (n = 29), but some had had difficulties in obtaining reference material. Most used commercial assays (n = 35), measuring IgG response against the spike antigen.

During the past 10 months, COVID-19 has killed over 1 million people worldwide. Under this global crisis, data sharing and management of the COVID-19 information are urgently needed and critical for researchers, epidemiologists, physicians, bioengineers, funding agencies, and governments to work together in developing new vaccines, drugs, methods, therapeutics, and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this deadly and rapidly spreading disease. The COVID-19 pandemic information includes the database of COVID-19-patient biospecimen resources in hospitals or biorepositories, electronic patient health records, ongoing clinical trials and research results on this disease, policies, guidelines, and regulations related to COVID-19, and the COVID-19 outbreak tracking records, and so on. A study of the current management and data-sharing approaches, tools, software, network, and internet systems developed in the United States is conducted in this article. Based on this study, it is revealed that the existing data-sharing and management systems are facing many big challenges and problems associated with data decentralization, inconsistencies, security and legal issues, limited financial support, international communications, standardization, and globalization.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of central Pennsylvanian adults evaluated self-reported knowledge, and a convergent, mixed methods design was used to assess beliefs about recommendations, intended behaviors, perceptions, and concerns related to infectious disease risk, and trust of information sources. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 5,948 adults. The estimated probability of correct response for the basic knowledge score, weighted with confidence, was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.79-0.80). Knowledge was significantly higher in patients with higher education and nonminority race. While the majority of respondents reported that they believed following CDC recommendations would decrease the spread of COVID-19 in their community and intended to adhere to them, only 65.2% rated social isolation with the highest level of belief and adherence. The most trusted information source was federal public health websites (42.8%). Qualitative responses aligned with quantitative data and described concerns about illness, epidemiologic issues, economic and societal disruptions, and distrust of the executive branch's messaging. The survey was limited by a lack of minority representation, potential selection bias, and evolving COVID-19 information that may impact generalizability and interpretability. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about COVID-19 and intended adherence to behavioral recommendations were high. There was substantial distrust of the executive branch of the federal government, however, and concern about mixed messaging and information overload.

The mIAP pseudoknot is an H-type pseudoknot proposed to have structural features in common with the gag-pro frameshifting pseudoknots from simian retrovirus-1 (SRV-1) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). In particular, the mIAP pseudoknot is proposed to contain an unpaired adenosine base at the junction of the two helical stems (A15), as well as one in the middle of stem 2 (A35). A mutational analysis of stem 1 hairpins and compensatory base-pair substitutions incorporated into helical stem 2 was used to assign optical melting transitions to molecular unfolding events. The optical melting profile of the wild-type RNA is most simply described by four sequential two-state unfolding transitions. Stem 2 melts first in two closely coupled low-enthalpy transitions at low t(m) in which the stem 3 to A35, unfolds first, followed by unfolding of the remainder of the helical stem. The third unfolding transition is associated with some type of stacking interactions in the stem 1 hairpin loop not present in the pseudoknot. The fourth transition is assigned to unfolding of stem 1. In all RNAs nvestigated, H(vH) ֦H(cal), suggesting that C(p) for unfolding is small. A35 has the thermodynamic properties expected for an extrahelical, unpaired nucleotide. Deletion of A15 destabilizes the stem 2 unfolding transition in the context of both the wild-type and A35 mutant RNAs only slightly, by G1 kcal mol(?1) (at 37 C). The A15 RNA is considerably more susceptible to thermal denaturation in the presence of moderate urea concentrations than is the wild-type RNA, further evidence of a detectable global destabilization of the molecule. Interestingly, substitution of the nine loop 2 nucleotides with uridine residues induces a more pronounced destabilization of the molecule (G2.0 kcal mol(?1)), a long-range, non-nearest neighbor effect. These findings provide the thermodynamic basis with which to further refine the relationship between efficient ribosomal frameshifting and pseudoknot structure and stability.","output":"Equilibrium unfolding pathway of an H-type RNA pseudoknot which promotes programmed ?1 ribosomal frameshifting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent shutdown of regular activities has resulted in an unprecedented and abrupt rise in stressors for families, including lost support systems and financial hardships Previous studies have shown that caregiver stress elevates the risks associated with an increase in child abuse and neglect Hypothesis: The COVID-19-induced shutdown of regular activity will result in an increase in child abuse cases Objective: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of child abuse cases presenting to a Child Advocacy Center (CAC) Methods: A data review of the CAC client tracking database done to determine the volume of new child abuse cases presenting to the CAC during an eight-week period in 2020 (3/3 - 4/25) and compared with data derived during the same time frame in 2019 (historical controls) The busiest CAC (Census in 2019=3424) in the state provides comprehensive multidisciplinary services to children and families in the county with reported allegations of severe physical abuse (ages 10 years and younger) and sexual abuse (ages 12 years and younger) Statistical analysis was done using SPSS for Windows version 26 Results: The total number of cases for the 8-week study period in 2019 was 573, compared to 297 in 2020, indicating a 48% (p=0 009) decline in volume The weekly trend (with associated events) is illustrated in the figure On-site child abuse medical evaluations were 156 in 2019, and 52 exams in 2020, a decline of 66% (p=0 003) There were 89 (F=61, M=28) sexual abuse examinations in 2019, and only 33 (F=21, M=12) in 2020, a 63% decline Similarly, the number of physical abuse examinations declined from 67 (F=30, M=37) in 2019 to 19 (F=7, M=12) in 2020, a 72% decline No significant associations were detected between the two time periods in terms of the type of abuse or the sex or age of the child Discussion: There were significantly fewer reports of child abuse during this COVID pandemic time belying expectations Usually, the highest percentage of reports are from schools (20%) and with school closures and shelter at home orders, access to mandated reporters is limited It is critical that mechanisms for surveillance, reporting, and intervention are in place, particularly related to domestic violence and child abuse It is speculated that when Covid-19 related measures are lifted, there may be an enormous spike in referrals Conclusion: Despite the concurrent elevation in multiple risk factors, there was a significant decline in the number of child abuse cases and medical evaluations at our child advocacy center during the COVID-19 pandemic This may be a result of under reporting due to school closures and shelter at home orders","output":"COVID-19 and child abuse: A child advocacy center experience at an epicenter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The aims of this research were to review patients visiting the pediatric emergency department over a 6-month period one year before and during the pandemic, to review pediatric emergency department referral ratios, and to determine whether there were any significant decreases in mortality and morbidity. METHODS: All patients between the ages of 0-18 years visiting the University of Health Sciences, Ankara Research and Training Hospital, Pediatric Emergency Service between April to October 2019 and April to October 2020 with no missing information in their records were involved in this retrospective cross-sectional study. RESULTS: The total number of pediatric emergency service consultations was 74,739; the number of emergency visits between April-October 2019 was 55,678, whereas it was 19,061 between April-October 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic period. There was a 67.7% decrease in consultations during the pandemic period. The mean age of participants between April-October 2019 was 8.115.31 years, and 52.4% of cases were male. The mean age between April-October 2020 was 8.585.93 years, and 51% of cases were male. COVID-19 related symptoms were higher during the pandemic period (p<0.05), with fever and gastroenteritis being the most frequently received diagnosis in both periods. During the pandemic period, the newborn consultation ratio was higher (p>0.05), there was a decrease in consultation ratios related to suicide attempts (p<0.05), and a threefold increase in death rates was observed (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In Turkey, where emergency consultation rates are quite high, these decreases look fearsome for secondary injuries that can develop in children. For this reason, families should be made aware of the importance of bringing their children to the hospital during emergencies, and that all necessary health precautions are being taken to decrease the spread of infection in hospitals.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Emergency Service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need for an accurate antibody test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have developed 3 ELISA methods, trimer spike IgA, trimer spike IgG, and nucleocapsid IgG, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We evaluated their performance along with four commercial ELISAs, EDI? Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA, and one lateral flow assay, DPP? COVID-19 IgM/IgG System (Chembio). Both sensitivity and specificity were evaluated and the probable causes of false-positive reactions were determined. The assays were evaluated using 300 pre-epidemic samples and 100 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples. The sensitivities and specificities of the assays were as follows: 90%/100% (in-house trimer spike IgA), 90%/99.3% (in-house trimer spike IgG), 89%/98.3% (in-house nucleocapsid IgG), 73.7%/100% (EDI nucleocapsid IgM), 84.5%/95.1% (EDI nucleocapsid IgG), 95%/93.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgA), 82.8%/99.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgG), 82.0%/91.7% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgM), 92%/93.3% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgG). The presumed causes of false positive results from pre-epidemic samples in commercial and in-house assays were mixed. In some cases, assays lacked reproducibility. In other cases, reactivity was abrogated by competitive inhibition (spiking the sample with the same antigen that was used for coating ELISAs prior to performing the assay), suggesting positive reaction could be attributed to the presence of antibodies against these antigens. In other cases, reactivity was consistently detected but not abrogated by the spiking, suggesting positive reaction was not attributed to the presence of antibodies against these antigens. Overall, there was wide variability in assay performance using our samples, with in-house tests exhibiting the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. The causes of false positivity in pre-epidemic samples may be due to plasma antibodies apparently reacting with the corresponding antigen, or spurious reactivity may be directed against non-specific components in the assay system. Identification of these targets will be essential to improving assay performance.","output":"Performance of nucleocapsid and spike-based SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outcomes 1. Illustrate the role of home care workers (HCWs) in caring for homebound older adults during COVID-19 2. Characterize disruptions in HCW services in the setting of COVID-19 and how these impacted the ability of patients to stay safely at home 3. Identify the impact of HCW services on patients and their family and other unpaid caregivers Importance The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the need for quality home-based care for homebound older adults with serious illness clear. Home care workers (HCWs) played a critical role in keeping homebound older adults safely at home during COVID-19, yet their essential work is often undervalued and understudied. Objective(s) To illustrate the roles of HCWs during COVID-19 and how HCW service disruptions impacted patients and their caregivers. Method(s) We collected demographic and clinical data and performed a thematic analysis of medical records from 53 patients with HCWs in a home-based primary and palliative care practice in New York City. We abstracted unstructured clinical notes between 12/1/2019 and 12/31/2020 into a priori and emergent categories and identified core themes via discussion in team meetings. Results Of the 53 patients, 24.5% died during the initial COVID surge, 34% lived alone, and 41.5% had 24-hour HCWs. The following five themes emerged: Changes to HCW roles included taking on new medical tasks and increased intensity of existing tasks (e.g., managing progressing dementia behaviors); delays in staffing contributed to changes in HCW hours and continuity, including unexpected loss of services; disruptions in HCW services put patients at risk of hospitalization and nursing home placement due to safety concerns; payment structure and patient preferences made it challenging to get sufficient hours of paid care; and lack of adequate and high-quality HCW services created additional caregiver responsibilities and caregiver burden. Conclusion(s) During COVID-19, HCWs were essential to keeping homebound older adults safely at home. Inadequate HCW services, including unstable schedules and inadequate hours of paid care, became particularly disruptive, leading to risk of hospitalization and prolonged length of stay. Impact This analysis can inform policies encouraging better integration of HCWs on medical teams and addressing workforce shortages to expand access to adequate HCW services for homebound older adults and their caregivers to manage serious illness and end-of-life care.","output":"I Depend on Her for Everything: Characterizing the Role of Home Care Workers Caring for Seriously Ill Homebound Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic Through a Mixed-Methods Study (RP419)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Industrial Big Data (IBD) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are propelling the new era of manufacturing - smart manufacturing.

Despite the global impact of COVID-19 and the low deployment success rate, industrialization of the AI mega-trend has dominated the business landscape in 2020. Although these technologies have the potential to advance quality standards, it is not a trivial task. A significant portion of quality leaders do not yet have a clear deployment strategy and universally cite difficulty in harnessing such technologies. The lack of people power is one of the biggest challenges.

If the thrombotic burden is significant enough to cause right ventricular strain, even intermediate-high risk, normotensive patients have a 13% risk of death at three months. Current trials do not support thrombolysis in this group due to excess risk of bleeding. We are narrating our experience of using Sildenafil in patients admitted with SARS-CoV 2 Pneumonia associated ALI ,who developed acute right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and or pulmonary hypertension(PH) secondary to acute sub massive PE/insitu thrombosis.METHOD:Patients who were admitted to intensive care due to SARS-COV 2 related infection and diagnosed as having PE/insitu thrombosis on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography were evaluated with transthoracic echocardiography . Those who developed acute RV dysfunction and or acute PH were started on Sildenafil at an initial dose of 25 mg TDS which was increased to 50mg TDS if possible after 48 hours. The dose was adjusted depending on tolerability in terms of blood pressure, renal function or other e.g. retroviral therapies . All survivors were followed up with repeat transthoracic echocardiography at three months.

The internet is a major source of health information. eHealth literacy is the ability of individuals to find, assess, and use health information available on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to assess coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and examine the relationship between eHealth literacy and COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs). METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults. We adapted the 8-item eHealth Literacy Scale to develop the Coronavirus-Related eHealth Literacy Scale (CoV-eHEALS) to measure COVID-19-related knowledge, conspiracy beliefs, and adherence to protective behaviors (eg, wearing facial masks and social distancing). Our analyses identified sociodemographic associations with the participants' CoV-eHEALS scores and an association between the CoV-eHEALS measure and COVID-19 KAPs. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the adapted CoV-eHEALS measure was high (Cronbach &#945;=.92). The mean score for the CoV-eHEALS was 29.0 (SD 6.1). A total of 29% (306/1074) of the survey participants were classified as having low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy (CoV-eHEALS score <26). Independent associations were found between CoV-eHEALS scores and ethnicity (standardized ?=-.083, P=.016 for Black participants) and education level (standardized ?=-.151, P=.001 for participants with high-school education or lower). Controlling for demographic characteristics, CoV-eHEALS scores demonstrated positive independent associations with knowledge (standardized ?=.168, P<.001) and adherence to protective behaviors (standardized ?=.241, P<.001) and a negative association with conspiracy beliefs (standardized ?=-.082, P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an estimate of coronavirus-related eHealth literacy among US adults. Our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of US adults have low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and are thus at a greater risk of lower and less-protective COVID-19 KAPs. These findings highlight the need to assess and address eHealth literacy as part of COVID-19 control efforts. Potential strategies include improving the quality of health information about COVID-19 available on the internet, assisting or simplifying web-based search for information about COVID-19, and training to improve general or coronavirus-specific search skills.","output":"Relationship Between Coronavirus-Related eHealth Literacy and COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices among US Adults: Web-Based Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction In the current systematic review, we intended to systematically review the epidemiology of burnout and the strategies and recommendations to prevent or reduce it among healthcare providers (HCPs) of COVID-19 wards, so that policymakers can make more appropriate decisions.

While quarantine, self-isolation and shutdown laws helped to effectively contain and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on trauma care in emergency departments (EDs) remains elusive. METHODS: All ED patient records from the 35-day COVID-19 shutdown (SHUTDOWN) period were retrospectively compared to a calendar-matched control period in 2019 (CTRL) as well as to a pre (PRE)- and post (POST)-shutdown period in an academic Level I Trauma Center in Berlin, Germany. Total patient and orthopedic trauma cases and contacts as well as trauma causes and injury patterns were evaluated during respective periods regarding absolute numbers, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and risk ratios (RRs). FINDINGS: Daily total patient cases (SHUTDOWN vs. CTRL, 106.94 vs. 167.54) and orthopedic trauma cases (SHUTDOWN vs. CTRL, 30.91 vs. 52.06) decreased during the SHUTDOWN compared to the CTRL period with IRRs of 0.64 and 0.59. While absolute numbers decreased for most trauma causes during the SHUTDOWN period, we observed increased incidence proportions of household injuries and bicycle accidents with RRs of 1.31 and 1.68 respectively. An RR of 2.41 was observed for injuries due to domestic violence. We further recorded increased incidence proportions of acute and regular substance abuse during the SHUTDOWN period with RRs of 1.63 and 3.22, respectively.

RESULTS: Blood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 13 December 2020. By the end of February 2021, 19% of the population tested seropositive. Notably, 96% of seropositive healthy donors screened (n = 56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titres comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B\\\\cell response. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in the first year since the start of community transmission, seropositivity levels in metropolitan in Stockholm had reached approximately one in five persons, providing important baseline seroprevalence information prior to the start of vaccination.","output":"Seropositivity in blood donors and pregnant women during the first year of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 transmission in Stockholm, Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predicting the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines would aid vaccine development and usage strategies, which is of importance given their limited supplies. Here we develop a multiscale mathematical model that proposes mechanistic links between COVID-19 vaccine efficacies and the neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses they elicit. We hypothesized that the collection of all NAbs would constitute a shape space and that responses of individuals are random samples from this space. We constructed the shape space by analyzing reported in vitro doseCresponse curves of ~80 NAbs. Sampling NAb subsets from the space, we recapitulated the responses of convalescent patients. We assumed that vaccination would elicit similar NAb responses. We developed a model of within-host SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, applied it to virtual patient populations and, invoking the NAb responses above, predicted vaccine efficacies. Our predictions quantitatively captured the efficacies from clinical trials. Our study thus suggests plausible mechanistic underpinnings of COVID-19 vaccines and generates testable hypotheses for establishing them. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","output":"Modeling how antibody responses may determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Swedish response to the COVID-19 pandemic included age-based recommendations of voluntary quarantine specifically for those 70 years of age or older.

The results show that age is not an unproblematic governing principle. Instead, in addition to protecting a vulnerable group, the age-based recommendation meant deprivation of previously assigned individual responsibility and, consequently, autonomy. It is shown how respondents handled this tension through varying degrees of compliance and resistance.

Methods: A randomized trial of screening for AF in individuals 70 years old without AF. Stroke and major bleeding are the efficacy and safety outcomes, ascertained from claims databases and electronic health records. Screening is done using a Zio?XT 14-day continuous cardiac rhythm patch monitor and compared, 1:1, to usual care. Use of OAC for detected AF is decided by patients and their physicians. The planned sample size was 52,000 recruited from U.S. primary care practices. Enrollment was severely hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic and stopped May 31, 2021 with 11,931 participants. Follow-up for stroke and bleeding events continues. Here, we report patch monitor findings from the 5,965 participants randomized to the screening arm. Results: 5,720 (96%) participants returned patches with analyzable data, the largest sample of patch monitor AF screening to date. Median (IQR) age was 75 (72, 79) years;57% were women. Median wear time was 13.9 (13.7, 14.0) days and median analyzable time was 98.4% (95.6, 99.5). 255 (4.5%) participants had AF, including 30 (0.5%) with 100% AF. 100% AF was more common in those age 80 (1.0%) than among younger participants (0.40%), p<.01. In the 225 participants with paroxysmal AF (PAF), median AF burden was 0.48% (0.016-2.5) of time monitored [78 (3.2, 454) minutes]. Median number of AF episodes during monitoring was 3 (1, 19). Median longest single AF episode was 60 (3-278) minutes. AF burden and length of longest episode were highly correlated (r=0.79, p<.001).

The goal was to evaluate whether increasing robotic surgery utilization is associated with increased rates of overall colorectal minimally invasive surgery. METHODS: The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (New York) was used to identify patients undergoing elective colectomy or proctectomy from 2009 to 2015. Individual surgeons were categorized as having increasing or non-increasing robotic utilization (IRU or non-IRU, respectively) based on the annual increase in the proportion of robotic surgery performed. The odds of surgical approach across the study period were evaluated with multinomial regression. RESULTS: Among 72,813 resections from 2009 to 2015, minimally invasive-surgery increased (47C61%, p < 0.0001). For colectomy, overall minimally invasive-surgery rates increased (54C66%, p < 0.0001), laparoscopic remained stable (53C54%), and robotics increased (1C12%). For proctectomy, overall minimally invasive-surgery rates increased (22C43%, p < 0.0001), laparoscopic remained stable (20C21%), and robotics increased (2C22%). Over the study period, 2487 surgeons performed colectomies. Among 156 surgeons with IRU for colectomies, robotics increased (2C29%), while laparoscopy decreased (67C44%), and open surgery decreased (31C27%). Overall, surgeons with IRU performed minimally invasive colectomies 73% of the time in 2015 versus 69% in 2009. Over the study period, 1131 surgeons performed proctectomies. Among 94 surgeons with IRU for proctectomies, robotics increased (3C42%), while laparoscopy decreased (25C15%), and open surgery decreased (73C44%). Overall, surgeons with IRU performed minimally invasive proctectomy 56% of the time in 2015 versus 27% in 2009. Patients in the latter study period had 57% greater odds of undergoing robotic surgery.

Its clinical expression is pleiomorphic and severity is related to age and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. The pathophysiology of the disease relies on aberrant activation of immune system and lymphopenia that has been recognized as a prognosis marker. We wondered if the myeloid compartment was affected in Covid-19 and if monocytes and macrophages could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects monocytes and macrophages without any cytopathic effect. Infection was associated with the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-) and the induction of a macrophagic specific transcriptional program characterized by the upregulation of M2-type molecules. In addition, we found that in vitro macrophage polarization did not account for the permissivity to SARS-CoV-2, since M1-and M2-type macrophages were similarly infected. Finally, in a cohort of 76 Covid-19 patients ranging from mild to severe clinical expression, all circulating monocyte subsets were decreased, likely related to massive emigration into tissues. Monocytes from Covid-19 patients exhibited decreased expression of HLA-DR and increased expression of CD163, irrespective of the clinical status. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 drives circulating monocytes and macrophages inducing immunoparalysis of the host for the benefit of Covid-19 disease progression.","output":"Monocytes and macrophages, targets of SARS-CoV-2: the clue for Covid-19 immunoparalysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and objectives Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

The objective was to assess the prognostic information of AF in COVID-19 patients. A multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed to assess the relationship between AF and mortality. We also evaluated the impact on mortality and embolic events of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in these patients.Results Among 6217 patients enrolled in the HOPE registry, 250 had AF (4.5%). AF patients had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. After propensity score matching, these differences were attenuated. Despite this, patients with AF had a higher incidence of in-hospital complications such as heart failure (19.3% vs 11.6%, P = .021) and respiratory insufficiency (75.9% vs 62.3%, P = .002), as well as a higher 60-day mortality rate (43.4% vs 30.9%, P = .005).

Models previously developed to study severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been rapidly deployed to study SARS-CoV-2. However, it has become clear that despite the common use of ACE2 as a receptor for both viruses, the host range of the 2 viruses does not entirely overlap. Distinct ACE2-interacting residues within the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as species differences in additional proteases needed for activation and internalization of the virus, are likely sources of host differences between the 2 viruses. Spontaneous models include rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, African Green monkeys, hamsters, and ferrets. Viral shedding and transmission studies are more frequently reported in spontaneous models. Mice can be infected with SARS-CoV; however, mouse and rat ACE2 does not support SARS-CoV-2 infection. Murine models for COVID-19 are induced through genetic adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, creation of chimeric SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, use of human ACE2 knock-in and transgenic mice, and viral transfection of wild-type mice with human ACE2. Core aspects of COVID-19 are faithfully reproduced across species and model. These include the acute nature and predominantly respiratory source of viral shedding, acute transient and nonfatal disease with a largely pulmonary phenotype, similar short-term immune responses, and age-enhanced disease. Severity of disease and tissue involvement (particularly brain) in transgenic mice varies by promoter.

Objective: To discover how physical activity and lifestyle affect the epidemic as well as the disease severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included 203 adults infected with COVID-19 and 228 uninfected adults in three Chinese provinces, with 164 (80.7%) of the infected participants and 188 (82.5%) of the uninfected participants answering a doctor-administered telephone questionnaire on lifestyle. The binary logistic regression model and the ordinal logit model were used to observe relevance. Results: Comparing sick and non-sick patients, we found that irregular exercise (P=0.004), sedentary lifestyle (P=0.010), and overexertion (P<0.001) may be associated with the susceptibility to COVID-19. In symptomatic patients, using the recommended status as a reference, risk of severe infection increased with decreased sleep status, being 6.729 (95% CI=2.138-21.181) times higher for potentially appropriate sleep (P=0.001) and peaking at 8.612 (95% CI=1.913-38.760) times higher for lack of sleep (P=0.005). Reduction in average daily sleep time significantly increased the likely severity (P=0.002). Discussion: Through further examination of damage of external lung organs, we found that lack of sleep affected not only disease severity but also prognosis.

Whether genetic events predicted to result in increased and constitutive signaling indeed lead to enhanced biological activity is often unclear and, due to technical challenges, unexplored. Here, we investigated proliferative signaling in CRC using a highly sensitive method for protein detection. The aim of the study was to determine whether multiple changes in proliferative signaling in CRC could be combined and exploited as a \\"complex biomarker\\" for diagnostic purposes. METHODS We used robotized capillary isoelectric focusing as well as conventional immunoblotting for the comprehensive analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathways converging on extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), AKT, phospholipase C1 (PLC1) and c-SRC in normal mucosa compared with CRC stage II and IV. Computational analyses were used to test different activity patterns for the analyzed signal transducers. RESULTS Signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation were differently dysregulated in CRC and, unexpectedly, several were downregulated in disease. Thus, levels of activated ERK1 (pERK1), but not pERK2, decreased in stage II and IV while total ERK1/2 expression remained unaffected. In addition, c-SRC expression was lower in CRC compared with normal tissues and phosphorylation on the activating residue Y418 was not detected. In contrast, PLC1 and AKT expression levels were elevated in disease. Immunoblotting of the different signal transducers, run in parallel to capillary isoelectric focusing, showed higher variability and lower sensitivity and resolution. Computational analyses showed that, while individual signaling changes lacked predictive power, using the combination of changes in three signaling components to create a \\"complex biomarker\\" allowed with very high accuracy, the correct diagnosis of tissues as either normal or cancerous.

This article surveys the kinds of dynamic simulation models that have been used as decision support tools and to forecast the potential impacts of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We developed the Values in Viral Dispersion model, which emphasizes the role of human factors and social networks in viral spread and presents scenarios to guide policy responses. METHODS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 was developed with individual agents able to move between 3 states (susceptible, infectious, or recovered), with each agent placed in 1 of 7 social network types and assigned a propensity to comply with NPIs (quarantine, contact tracing, and physical distancing). A series of policy questions were tested to illustrate the impact of social networks and NPI compliance on viral spread among (1) populations, (2) specific at-risk subgroups, and (3) individual trajectories. RESULTS: Simulation outcomes showed large impacts of physical distancing policies on number of infections, with substantial modification by type of social network and level of compliance. In addition, outcomes on metrics that sought to maximize those never infected (or recovered) and minimize infections and deaths showed significantly different epidemic trajectories by social network type and among higher or lower at-risk age cohorts.

The current gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 is the real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which is a sensitive and specific method to detect SARS-CoV-2. Other RNA-based methods include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), droplet digital reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (ddRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The serological testing of antibodies (IgM and IgG), nanoparticle-based lateral-flow assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used to enhance the detection sensitivity and accuracy. Because antibodies are usually detected a week after the onset of symptoms, these tests are used to assess the overall infection rate in the community.

However, the effect of hemodialysis on cerebral blood flow is poorly studied and confounding factors like blood pressure and ultrafiltration as well as temperature changes have rarely been accounted for. The aim of our study was to use state-of-the-art technology to evaluate the effect of a single dialysis session on cerebral perfusion as well as on vascular stiffness. METHODS Chronic hemodialysis patients (7 male/3 female, mean age 58 years) were recruited. Cerebral blood flow and arterial pulse wave velocity were measured before and immediately after a hemodialysis session. To exclude effects of volume changes we kept ultrafiltration to a minimum, allowing no change in body weight. Isothermic conditions were maintained by using the GENIUS single-pass batch-dialysis system with a high-flux polysulfone dialyser. Cerebral blood flow was measured by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Pulse wave velocity was measured using the SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical, USA) device by a single operator. RESULTS This study shows for the first time that isovolemic, isothermic hemodialysis neither affected blood pressure or heart rate, nor total or regional cerebral perfusion. There was also no change in pulse wave velocity.

To protect national health, government agencies have regulations on hospital chaperoning and visiting. This article presents the development and implementation of a monitoring system for hospital visiting and chaperoning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to create a hospital visiting and chaperoning monitor system that uses nation-wide data sources to more accurately screen hospital visitors and chaperones, assist contract tracing, and prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. METHODS: This project was implemented in 57 ward units of an academic medical center. The system was connected to the National Health Insurance (NHI) system and Hospital Information System (HIS), and built on the data of everyone who accessed either the hospital or ward using an NHI smart card or national identification card. To shorten the time for manual identification, we also developed a new system of \\"app for appointment visits and chaperones\\" to make appointments online. RESULTS: After the implementation of the system, data from visitors and chaperones in the nursing information system could be accessed. Given that all data were registered in the HIS visiting/chaperoning monitor system, an epidemic investigation could be performed whenever there was a confirmed case.

The aim of our study was to compare the number of acute appendicitis cases and the proportion of complicated appendicitis before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all data collected from a multi-center database of patients presenting to the emergency department for acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 12 to June 6, 2020, and compared these data with those from the same periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The number of acute appendicitis cases, proportion of complicated appendicitis, and pre- and postoperative patient characteristics were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in this evaluation. Sixty-five patients presented during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (group A), and 241 patients in previous years (group B: 2017-2019). The number of consultations for acute appendicitis decreased by almost 20 percent during the pandemic compared with previous periods, with a significant increase in complicated appendicitis (52% in group A versus 20% in group B, p < 0,001.). Comparing the two groups, significant differences were also noted in the duration of symptoms (symptoms > 48h in 61% and 26%, p < 0,001), the intervention time (77 vs 61 minutes, p = 0,002), length of hospital stay (hospitalization of > 2 days in 63% and 32%, p < 0.001) and duration of antibiotic treatment (antibiotics > 3 days in 36% and 24% p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decreased number of consultations for acute appendicitis, with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis, most likely due to patient delay in consulting the emergency department at symptom onset. Patients and general practitioners should be aware of this problem to avoid a time delay from initial symptoms to consultation.","output":"An effect of the COVID-19 pandemic: Significantly more complicated appendicitis due to delayed presentation of patients!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Translation initiation of picornavirus RNA is driven by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element located upstream of the initiator codon. RNA structure organization as well as RNA-protein interaction plays a fundamental role in internal initiation. IRES activity has been mainly analyzed in the context of reporter genes, lacking regions of the viral genome potentially affecting translation efficiency. With the aim to understand the vulnerability of the IRES and translation start region to small molecules in the context of the viral genome, we designed a set of customized RNase-resistant 2O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides (2OMe AONs) based on RNA structure data. These AONs were then used to monitor their capacity to interfere viral RNA translation, and thus, to inhibit virus yield. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA translation can be initiated at two in-frame AUG codons. We show here that a 2OMe AON complementary to AUG2 inhibited viral multiplication more efficiently than the one that targeted AUG1. Furthermore, the response of the viral RNA to AONs targeting the IRES region denoted important differences between tissue culture cells and cell-free systems, reinforcing the need to analyze viral RNA response in living cells. Importantly, we have identified four specific motifs within the IRES element that are targets for viral inhibitors both in tissue culture cells and in cell-free systems. The identified targets define accessible regions to small molecules, which disturb either the RNA structural organization or the RNA-protein interactions needed to initiate translation in FMDV RNA.","output":"Exploring IRES Region Accessibility by Interference of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Practitioners and researchers in the midst of overwhelming coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks are calling for new ways of looking at such pandemics, with an emphasis on human behavior and holistic considerations. Viral outbreaks are characterized by socio-behaviorally-oriented public health efforts aimed at reducing exposure and prevention of morbidity/mortality once infected. These efforts involve different points-of-view, generally, than do those aimed to understand the virus natural history. Rampant spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cities clearly signals that urban areas contain conditions favorable for rapid transmission of the virus. MAIN TEXT: The Critical Medical Ecology model is a multidimensional, multilevel way of viewing pandemics comprehensively, rooted simultaneously in microbiology and in anthropology, with shared priority for evolution, context, stressors, homeostasis, adaptation, and power relationships. Viewing COVID-19 with a Critical Medical Ecological lens suggests three important interpretations: 1) COVID-19 is equally  if not more  a socially-driven disease as much as a biomedical disease, 2) the present interventions available for primary prevention of transmission are social and behavioral interventions, and 3) wide variation in COVID-19 hospitalization/death rates is not expected to significantly be attributable to a more virulent and rapidly-evolving virus, but rather to differences in social and behavioral factors  and power dynamics  rather than (solely) biological and clinical factors. Cities especially are challenged due to logistics and volume of patients, and lack of access to sustaining products and services for many residents living in isolation. CONCLUSIONS: In the end, SARS-CoV-2 is acting upon dynamic social human beings, entangled within structures and relationships that include but extend far beyond their cells, and in fact beyond their own individual behavior. As a comprehensive way of thinking, the Critical Medical Ecology model helps identify these elements and dynamics in the context of ecological processes that create, shape, and sustain people in their multidimensional, intersecting environments.","output":"Critical medical ecology and SARS-COV-2 in the urban environment: a pragmatic, dynamic approach to explaining and planning for research and practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Past studies have linked measures of social isolation to mental health among caregivers of children. As people across the world adjust to social distancing measures, there is a need to understand consequences of social distancing measures on mental health. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the association between adherence to social distancing measures and feeling worried/anxious among female caregivers of children ages zero-to-five. METHODS: Data for this study came from an online survey that was administered between May and June 2020 to understand stress and mental health among caregivers of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 358 female caregivers was analyzed using binary logistic regression with feeling worried/anxious as the outcome variable. RESULTS: More than a third of the female caregivers (35.2%) reported feeling worried/anxious during the past month and about 42% reported strictly adhering to social distancing measures. Controlling for the effect of other factors, caregivers who reported strictly adhering to social distancing had 1.86 times higher odds of feeling worried/anxious when compared caregivers who were not strictly adhering to social distancing (AOR=1.86, 95% C.I.=1.07C3.24). Caregivers who felt bothered by withdrawal from activities of interest had 4.11 times higher odds of reporting feeling worried/anxious (AOR=4.11, 95% C.I.=2.32C7.24).

METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing DES-based percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for LMCAD in DM patients and tested for effect measure modification (EMM) by diabetes for adverse events. We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing CABG to DES-based PCI including DM patients with LMCAD published up to March 1, 2021. We completed separate random-effects meta-analyses for four RCTs (4356 patients, mean follow-up of 4.9 years) and six observational studies (9360 patients, mean follow-up of 5.2 years). RESULTS In RCTs among DM patients, DES-based PCI, compared to CABG, was associated with a 30% increased relative risk (RR) (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.56, I2 = 0%), while among non-DM patients, there was a 25% increased relative risk (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07-1.44, I2 = 0%) for the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unplanned revascularization (MACCE). There was no evidence of EMM (p-value for interaction = 0.70). The mean weighted SYNTAX score was 25.7. In observational studies, there was no difference between DES-based PCI and CABG for all-cause mortality in patients with DM (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.91-1.40, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS CABG was superior to PCI for LMCAD in RCTs in DM patients for MACCE.

While the early focus was in Asia, recent evidence suggests that Egypt is a new epicenter for the disease. This includes characterization of a variant clade 2.2.1.1, which has been found almost exclusively in Egypt. We analyzed 226 HA and 92 NA sequences with an emphasis on the H5N1 2.2.1.1 strains in Egypt using a Bayesian discrete phylogeography approach. This allowed modeling of virus dispersion between Egyptian governorates including the most likely origin. RESULTS: Phylogeography models of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) suggest Ash Sharqiyah as the origin of virus spread, however the support is weak based on KullbackCLeibler values of 0.09 for HA and 0.01 for NA. Association Index (AI) values and Parsimony Scores (PS) were significant (p-value < 0.05), indicating that dispersion of H5N1 in Egypt was geographically structured. In addition, the Ash Sharqiyah to Al Gharbiyah and Al Fayyum to Al Qalyubiyah routes had the strongest statistical support. CONCLUSION: We found that the majority of routes with strong statistical support were in the heavily populated Delta region. In particular, the Al Qalyubiyah governorate appears to represent a popular location for virus transition as it represented a large portion of branches in both trees. However, there remains uncertainty about virus dispersion to and from this location and thus more research needs to be conducted in order to examine this. Phylogeography can highlight the drivers of H5N1 emergence and spread. This knowledge can be used to target public health efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality. For Egypt, future work should focus on using data about vaccination and live bird markets in phylogeography models to study their impact on H5N1 diffusion within the country.","output":"Phylogeography of influenza A H5N1 clade 2.2.1.1 in Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the juvenile worms of the genus Paragonimus migrate and cause defects on the surface of the visceral pleura, pneumothorax can develop.

This is primarily due to the fact that the adult inner ear is encased in the toughest bone of the body, whereas its removal leads to the death of the sensory epithelium in culture. We hypothesized that we could take advantage of the integral cochlear structure to maintain the overall inner ear architecture and improve sensory epithelium survival in culture. We showed that by culturing adult mouse cochlea with the (surrounding) bone intact, the supporting cells (SCs) survived and almost all hair cells (HCs) degenerated. To evaluate the utility of the explant culture system, we demonstrated that the overexpression of Atoh1, an HC fate-determining factor, is sufficient to induce transdifferentiation of adult SCs to HC-like cells (HCLCs). Transdifferentiation-derived HCLCs resemble developmentally young HCs and are able to attract adult ganglion neurites. Furthermore, using a damage model, we showed that degenerated adult ganglions respond to regenerated HCLCs by directional neurite outgrowth that leads to HCLC-neuron contacts, strongly supporting the intrinsic properties of the HCLCs in establishing HCLC-neuron connections.

However, acute pericarditis and myocarditis/myopericarditis cases have been described after mRNA vaccination. The mechanism for the development of cardiac involvement is unknown. Potential mechanism for oxidative stress associated with vaccine-induced heart involvement is unidentified. This study aimed to examine the role of oxidative stress and the heart involvement in young adults vaccinated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 23 participants were included and 10 of these participants were asymptomatic patients (control group). Comparison of the cardiac involvement and control group was made by using troponin I, C-reactive protein (hsCRP), D-dimer levels, and oxidative stress tests including nitric oxide, and imaging techniques (ECG, echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance). RESULTS: The median age of acute pericarditis group (10 patients) was 22 years (Q1-Q3: 18.5C31), and the mean age was 24.47.5 years. The median age of myopericarditis group (3 patients) was 22 years (Q1CQ3 18.0C25.0), and the mean age was 21.6 3.5 years. All the myopericarditis cases were male. The patients with myopericarditis had higher troponin I level, hsCRP, and D-dimer levels (troponin I level; 1600.00 ng/mL; D-dimer; 1.20 g/mL, hsCRP; 3.0 mg/L, respectively; p < 0.05). Serum nitric oxide levels and OSI (total oxidant status, H(2)O(2)/total antioxidant status) were lower in myopericarditis group than the control and acute pericarditis group (p < 0.05). This shows inflammatory and procoagulant state. CONCLUSION: Vaccine-induced myopericarditis cases are associated with oxidative stress test abnormality (abnormal NO, OSI levels). However, there is no relationship between NO levels and other oxidative stress tests difference in vaccine-induced acute pericarditis. It is thought that vaccine-induced pericarditis and myopericarditis could have different pathogenesis. This could make it necessary to reassess the second dose of vaccination for vaccine-induced cardiac involvement cases.","output":"The Evaluation of Oxidative Stress in the Young Adults with COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Induced Acute Pericarditis- Myopericarditis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid implementation of telehealth for cancer care during COVID-19 required innovative and adaptive solutions among oncology health care providers and professionals (HPPs). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore oncology HPPs experiences with telehealth implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was conducted at Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt), an NCI (National Cancer Institute)-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Prior to COVID-19, Moffitt piloted telehealth visits on a limited basis. After COVID-19, Moffitt rapidly expanded telehealth visits. Telehealth visits included real-time videoconferencing between HPPs and patients and virtual check-ins (ie, brief communication with an HPP by telephone only). We conducted semistructured interviews with 40 oncology HPPs who implemented telehealth during COVID-19. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for themes using Dedoose software (version 4.12). RESULTS: Approximately half of the 40 participants were physicians (n=22, 55%), and one-quarter of the participants were advanced practice providers (n=10, 25%). Other participants included social workers (n=3, 8%), psychologists (n=2, 5%), dieticians (n=2, 5%), and a pharmacist (n=1, 3%). Five key themes were identified: (1) establishing and maintaining patient-HPP relationships, (2) coordinating care with other HPPs and informal caregivers, (3) adapting in-person assessments for telehealth, (4) developing workflows and allocating resources, and (5) future recommendations. Participants described innovative strategies for implementing telehealth, such as coordinating interdisciplinary visits with multiple HPPs and inviting informal caregivers (eg, spouse) to participate in telehealth visits. Health care workers discussed key challenges, such as workflow integration, lack of physical exam and biometric data, and overcoming the digital divide (eg, telehealth accessibility among patients with communication-related disabilities). Participants recommended policy advocacy to support telehealth (eg, medical licensure policies) and monitoring how telehealth affects patient outcomes and health care delivery. CONCLUSIONS: To support telehealth growth, implementation strategies are needed to ensure that HPPs and patients have the tools necessary to effectively engage in telehealth. At the same time, cancer care organizations will need to engage in advocacy to ensure that policies are supportive of oncology telehealth and develop systems to monitor the impact of telehealth on patient outcomes, health care quality, costs, and equity.","output":"Health Care Providers and Professionals Experiences With Telehealth Oncology Implementation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) has led to significant disruptions in healthcare delivery.

OBJECTIVES: The present study was performed to identify the socio-cultural and behavioural determinants that affect antibiotics prescription behaviour among primary care physicians and estimate the awareness about antibiotic resistance of public health importance. METHODOLOGY: The questionnaire was divided into three sections: Section-I, which contained demographic content. Section-II contained 21 question items measuring attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, and behavioural intentions of the prescribers. Section III had 12 questions related to knowledge about antibiotic resistance. As determined by Cronbachs  for each set of measured constructs of questionnaire scale, the internal consistency was good (  0.7). The participants' socio-cultural and behavioural determinants were graded in 3 categories depending upon the mean score, while frequencies were used to estimate antibiotic resistance awareness. The data was analyzed by calculating the one-way ANOVA and by post-hoc Tukey-Kramer HSD multiple comparison test. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-four primary health care physicians responded to the questionnaire, and data was statistically investigated. Participants' knowledge of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was poor with greater behavioural intentions to prescribe antibiotics, but a positive attitude and acceptable perceived social pressure towards antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that awareness towards antibiotic-resistant bacteria among primary care physicians of Saudi Arabia stands insufficient but favourable attitude and satisfactory social pressure towards antibiotics with greater behavioural intentions to prescribe antibiotics.

All compounds exhibited good antifungal activity better than reference drugs bifonazole (1.4 - 41 folds) and ketoconazole (1.1 - 406 folds) against all fungal species. In order to elucidate the mechanism of action docking studies on different antimicrobial targets were performed. CONCLUSION According to docking analysis, the antifungal activity can be explained by the inhibition of the CYP51 enzyme for most of the compounds with better correlation of the results obtained for the P.v.c. strain (linear regression between estimated binding Energy and log(1/MIC) with R 2 =0.867 and p=0.000091 or R 2 = 0.924, p= 0.000036, when compound 3 is excluded.

Analysis of available epidemiological data suggest that physiological acclimatization/adaptation that counterbalance the hypoxic environment in high-altitude may protect from severe impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Potential underlying mechanisms such as: (i) a compromised half-live of the virus caused by the high-altitude environment, and (ii) a hypoxia mediated down regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main binding target of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the pulmonary epithelium are discussed.","output":"Does the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 virus decrease at high-altitude?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools primarily for typically developing children is rare. However, less is known about transmission in schools for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), who are often unable to mask or maintain social distancing. The objectives of this study were to determine SARS-CoV-2 positivity and in-school transmission rates using weekly screening tests for school staff and students and describe the concurrent deployment of mitigation strategies in six schools for children with IDD. METHODS: From 11/23/20 to 5/28/21, weekly voluntary screening for SARS-CoV-2 with a high sensitivity molecular-based saliva test was offered to school staff and students. Weekly positivity rates were determined and compared to local healthcare system and undergraduate student screening data. School-based transmission was assessed among participants quarantined for in-school exposure. School administrators completed a standardized survey to assess school mitigation strategies. RESULTS: A total of 59 students and 416 staff participated. An average of 304 school staff and students were tested per week. Of 7,289 tests performed, 21 (0.29%) new SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified. The highest weekly positivity rate was 1.2% (n = 4) across all schools, which was less than community positivity rates. Two cases of in-school transmission were identified, each among staff, representing 2% (2/103) of participants quarantined for in-school exposure. Mitigation strategies included higher than expected student mask compliance, reduced room capacity, and phased reopening. CONCLUSIONS: During 24 weeks that included the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found no evidence for elevated SARS-CoV-2 screening test positivity among staff and students of six schools for children with IDD compared to community rates. In-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was low among those quarantined for in-school exposure.

Herein, we have expanded on this study by investigating the role of three of the plants, Pithecellobium dulce (Fabaceae), Leonotis nepetifolia (Lamiaceae), and Opuntia ficus-indica (Cactaceae), on the survival, fecundity, and egg viability of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. METHODS: We tested these effects using females that received (i) an initial three rations of blood meals and (ii) no blood meal at all. Two controls were included: age-matched females fed on glucose solution with or without an initial blood meal and those fed exclusively on blood meals. Data were collected daily over a 30-day period. The amino acid contents of Ae. aegypti guts and their respective diets were detected by coupled liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Females fed on P. dulce and an exclusively blood meal diet had a shorter survival than those fed on glucose. On the other hand, females fed on L. nepetifolia survived longer than those fed exclusively on blood meals, whereas those fed on O. ficus-indica had the shortest survival time. With an initial blood meal, females fed on L. nepetifolia laid 1.6-fold more eggs while those fed on the other diets laid fewer eggs compared to those fed exclusively on blood meals. Hatching rates of the eggs laid varied with the diet. Mass spectroscopic analysis of gut contents of mosquitoes exposed to the different diets showed qualitative and quantitative differences in their amino acid levels.

This study describes the impact of socioeconomic deprivation on 30-day survival following critical care admission for COVID-19, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on critical care capacity in Scotland. Methods: This cohort study used linked national hospital records including ICU, virology testing and national death records to identify and describe patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care units in Scotland. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the impact of deprivation on 30-day mortality. Critical care capacity was described by reporting the percentage of baseline ICU bed utilisation required. Findings: There were 735 patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care units across Scotland from 1/3/2020 to 20/6/2020. There was a higher proportion of patients from more deprived areas, with 183 admissions (24.9%) from the most deprived quintile and 100 (13.6%) from the least deprived quintile. Overall, 30-day mortality was 34.8%. After adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity, mortality was significantly higher in patients from the most deprived quintile (OR 1.97, 95%CI 1.13, 3.41, p=0.016). ICUs serving populations with higher levels of deprivation spent a greater amount of time over their baseline ICU bed capacity.

COVID-19 vaccination has been recommended by national and international organizations in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). The aim of the study was to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine willingness and hesitancy in a population of Italian patients with IBD, and their determinants. METHODS: In February 2021 an online questionnaire focused on COVID-19 vaccine was proposed to a representative sample of Italian IBD patients. Socio-demographic characteristics, IBD features, lifestyle, perception of COVID-19, general attitude towards vaccinations and to COVID-19 vaccines were investigated. Patients were divided into willing, hesitant and refusive towards COVID-19 vaccine. The hesitation reasons were investigated. The associations between baseline characteristics and willingness (determinants) were evaluated by calculating crude and adjusted Odds Ratio (AdjOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The baseline characteristics are shown below. 1252 surveys were collected. 1005 (80.3%), 222 (18.1%) and 33 (2.63 %) patients were defined as willing, hesitant and refusive, respectively. Concerns for vaccine adverse effects constituted the main reason for refusal (73.4%) (Figure). 49.1% of hesitant patients reported that presence of IBD exerted an influence on their answer. Among the patients willing to be vaccinated whenever possible, 78.2% (786) thought that their IBD represented a valid motivation to access vaccination with priority. Willingness to COVID-19 vaccine was significantly associated with adherence to previous vaccinations (AdjOR 17.6, 95% CI 11.4C27.2), male gender (1.68 95% CI 1.16C2.43), graduation degree (1.48, 95% CI 1.03C2.13), perceived higher risk of COVID-19 due to IBD (1.47, 95% CI 1.05C2.08), alcohol intake (1.69, 95% CI 1.16C2.45). Conversely, the hesitancy was significantly associated with use of complementary and alternative medicines (0.58, 95% CI 0.36C0.92). Notably, 54.5% of patients were under the impression to have a higher risk of COVID-19 and 31.8% a more severe course due to their IBD. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Most IBD patients would accept COVID-19 vaccines, though one out of five is hesitant to date, principally due to fear of adverse events.

Design Observational study. Setting and Participants Altogether 1,785 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 6,744 hospitalized for non-COVID-19 causes at seven geriatric clinics in Stockholm from March 6th to July 31st, 2020 were included. Methods Across admission month, patient vital signs and pharmacological treatment in relationship to risk for in-hospital death were analyzed using the Poisson regression model. Incidence rates (IR) and Incidence rate ratios (IRR) of death are presented. Results In patients with COVID-19, the IR of mortality were 27%, 17%, 10%, 8%, and 2% from March to July, respectively, after standardization for demographics and vital signs. Compared with patients admitted in March, the risk of in-hospital death decreased by 29%(IRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.99) in April, 61%(0.39, 0.26-0.58) in May, 68%(0.32, 0.19-0.55) in June and 86%(0.14, 0.03-0.58) in July. The proportion of patients admitted for geriatric care with oxygen saturation <90% decreased from 13% to 1%, which partly explains the improvement of COVID-19 patient survival. In non-COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, mortality rates remained relatively stable (IR 1.3%-2.3%). Compared with non-COVID-19 geriatric patients, the IRR of death declined from 11 times higher (IRR 11.7, 95%CI 6.11-22.3) to 1.6 times (2.61,0.50-13.7) between March and July in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Implications Mortality risk in geriatric patients from the Stockholm region declined over time throughout the first pandemic wave of COVID-19. The improved survival rate over time was only partly related to improvement in saturation status at the admission of the patients hospitalized later throughout the pandemic.

In the light of the research (and the literature data), it can be stated that the coronavirus epidemic that appeared in Hungary in the spring of 2020 caused panic shopping, and the freedom of choice (abundance of goods) was again replaced by consumer vulnerability like before the years of regime change. The analysis shows that 75 percent of those over the age of 60, while only 62 percent of the members of the youngest age group think it is worth piling up. It is also interesting to note that the main reason for over-buying is the creation of a contingency reserve. Larger store types, mostly with a wide range of goods, were well suited for this. Also, 33,2 % of respondents thought they had bought more to reduce the number of shopping trips (and thus presumably to slow down the spread of the virus).

Secondly, investigate if increasing NaOCl concentration and/or contact-time improves the performance of these techniques. METHODOLOGY A total of 83 extracted human maxillary permanent canines were decoronated to 15 mm and root canals prepared to a size 40,.10 taper. Root dentine was stained with crystal violet for 72 h and embedded in silicone. Eighty specimens were randomly distributed into 16 groups (n = 5) according to the irrigant activation technique, NaOCl concentration (2%; 5.25%) and irrigant contact-time (10 min; 20 min). All activation techniques were used for 60 s in the last minute of irrigation. Additionally, 3 teeth were not exposed to NaOCl to confirm adequate dentine staining had occurred (i.e. negative control). All specimens were subsequently dissected, observed under a light microscope and NaOCl penetration depth (m) determined by measuring the average width of bleached dentine using ImageJ software. Statistical comparisons were made with paired and unpaired t-tests, ANOVAs followed by post-hoc Tukey and Dunnett's tests, and a general linear model ( < 0.05). RESULTS Overall, NaOCl penetration ranged from 38.8 m - 411.0 m with MDA, PUI and SI consistently resulting in significantly greater tubular infiltration than CNI (P < 0.05). The deepest measurements in the coronal, middle and apical segments were all recorded in the MDA; 5.25%; 20 min group and the least in the CNI; 2%; 10 min group. Increasing either irrigant concentration or contact-time resulted in significantly greater NaOCl penetration depths for all techniques and segments of the canal (P < 0.05). However, when irrigant concentration and contact-time were increased together, a significant interaction effect between these two independent variables was observed on overall NaOCl penetration (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Agitating irrigants with MDA, PUI or SI, as well as using greater irrigant concentrations or contact-times, potentiated NaOCl penetration into root dentine. However, longer durations of NaOCl exposure at lower concentrations resulted in similar depths of tubular penetration as those achieved at higher concentrations.","output":"The influence of irrigant activation, concentration and contact time on sodium hypochlorite penetration into root dentine: an ex vivo experiment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthy aging with dignity and aging in place are important for Taiwanese individuals. Although Taiwan did not experience COVID-19 outbreaks prior to May 2021, many older adults have been encouraged to stay at home since the beginning of the global pandemic in January 2020. Such shelter-in-place recommendations have resulted in significant lifestyle changes, limiting activities associated with aging with dignity such as exercise and community engagement. Few studies have explored how to promote or maintain holistic health practices and physical fitness in older adults residing in rural communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. This pilot study aimed to establish an interdisciplinary collaboration with community care workers (CCWs) and evaluate the impact of an innovative summer camp (ISC) program for older adults residing in rural areas. METHODS: A quasi-experimental pre-post-test design with an interdisciplinary collaborative approach was implemented. The ISC program was based on a standardized protocol of modified Baduanjin exercise combined with three recreational breathing games. Participants were recruited from three community centers around the western coastal region of Yunlin County between June and August 2020. The ISC program was designed and executed by a nurse-led health promotion research team that collaborated with trained CCWs for 90 min per day, five days per week, for 12 weeks. Participants and CCWs wore facemasks during all activities. Paired t-test was used to measure changes in physical biomarkers, pulmonary lung function, and health-related fitness changes. RESULTS: Sixty-eight participants completed the ISC program. The ISC program significantly improved the participants physiological biomarkers and health-related fitness, including reduced body weight, waistline, and systolic blood pressure, and increased forced vital capacity, biceps arm flexion, and ability to sit and stand from a chair, step with a knee up in situ, and stand on one foot with eyes open. Most participants reported that they felt happy, satisfied, and hoped that this program would be continued in their community center. CONCLUSIONS: This interdisciplinary, collaborative ISC program improved physical biomarkers and health-related fitness in older adults.

Segmentation is the preprocessing step for classification, and 12 DWT-PCA-based texture features extracted from the segmented image are utilized as input for the random forest machine-learning algorithm to classify COVID-19/non-COVID-19 disease. Diagnosing COVID-19 disease through an RT-PCR test is a time-consuming process. Sometimes, the RT-PCR test result is not accurate; that is, it has a false negative, which can cause a threat to the person's life due to delay in starting the specified treatment. At this moment, there is an urgent need to develop a reliable automatic COVID-19 detection tool that can detect COVID-19 disease from chest CT scan images within a shorter period and can help doctors to start COVID-19 treatment at the earliest. In this article, a variant of the whale optimization algorithm named improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA) is introduced. The efficiency of the IWOA is tested for unimodal (F1CF7), multimodal (F8CF13), and fixed-dimension multimodal (F14CF23) benchmark functions and is compared with the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), salp swarm optimization (SSA), and sine cosine algorithm (SCA). The experiment is carried out in 30 trials and population size, and iterations are set as 30 and 100 under each trial. IWOA achieves faster convergence than WOA, SSA, and SCA and enhances the exploitation and exploration phases of WOA, avoiding local entrapment. IWOA, WOA, SSA, and SCA utilized Otsu's maximum between-class variance criteria as fitness function to compute optimal threshold values for multilevel medical CT scan image segmentation. Evaluation measures such as accuracy, specificity, precision, recall, Gmean, F_measure, SSIM, and 12 DWT-PCA-based texture features are computed. The experiment showed that the IWOA is efficient and achieved better segmentation evaluation measures and better segmentation mask in comparison with other methods. DWT-PCA-based texture features extracted from each of the 160 IWOA-, WOA-, SSA-, and SCA-based segmented images are fed into random forest for training, and random forest is tested with DWT-PCA-based texture features extracted from each of the 40 IWOA-, WOA-, SSA-, and SCA-based segmented images.

METHODS: We included adult patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were critically ill and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from Feb 4, 2020 to Feb 20, 2020. Data were collected and compared between patients who died and improved. Logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors for death of SARS-CoV-2-infected critically ill patients. RESULTS: A total of 160 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, of which 146 patients with appeared outcomes were included into the final analysis. The random blood glucose, serum sodium and effective plasma osmolarity were higher in deceased patients, especially in patients with diabetes. There were 7 patients with diabetes with hyperosmolar status and all of them were deceased. Multivariable regression revealed that older age (odds ratio 4.28, 95% CI 1.01C18.20; p = 0.049), higher C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.01, 1.00C1.03; p = 0.024), higher interleukin-6 (odds ratio 1.01, 1.00C1.03; p = 0.0323), and d-dimer greater than 1 g/mL (odds ratio 1.10, 1.01C1.20; p = 0.032) at admission were associated with increased odds of death.

Reviews synthesized evidence about five categories of climate impacts; the two most common were meteorological and extreme weather events. Reviews covered ten health outcome categories; the three most common were 1) infectious diseases, 2) mortality, and 3) respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary or neurological outcomes. Most reviews suggested a deleterious impact of climate change on multiple adverse health outcomes, although the majority also called for more research. Interpretation: Overall, most systematic reviews suggest that climate change is associated with worse human health. Future research could explore the potential explanations between these associations to propose adaptation and mitigation strategies and could include psychological and broader social health impacts of climate change.

SETTINGS: National populations in 186 United Nations countries and territories and populations in first-level subnational administrative entities in Brazil, China, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Spain and the USA. PARTICIPANTS: None (death statistics only). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: An unstandardised occurrence/exposure rate comparable to the Crude Death Rate; an indirectly age-and-sex standardised rate that can be derived even when the breakdown of COVID-19 deaths by age and sex required for direct standardisation is unavailable; the reduction in life expectancy at birth corresponding to the 2020 number of COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: To date, the highest unstandardised rate has been in New York, at its peak exceeding the state 2017 crude death rate. Populations compare differently after standardisation: while parts of Italy, Spain and the USA have the highest unstandardised rates, parts of Mexico and Peru have the highest standardised rates. For several populations with the necessary data by age and sex for direct standardisation, we show that direct and indirect standardisation yield similar results. US life expectancy is estimated to have declined this year by more than a year (-1.26 years), far more than during the worst year of the HIV epidemic, or the worst 3 years of the opioid crisis, and to reach its lowest level since 2008. Substantially larger reductions, exceeding 2 years, are estimated for Panama, Peru, and parts of Italy, Spain, the USA and especially, Mexico. CONCLUSIONS: With lesser demand on data than direct standardisation, indirect standardisation is a valid alternative to adjust international comparisons for differences in population distribution by sex and age-groups. A number of populations have experienced reductions in 2020 life expectancies that are substantial by recent historical standards.","output":"Beyond deaths per capita: comparative COVID-19 mortality indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Social distancing is considered the best strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19). We aimed to analyse the effect of 'social distancing' on the emotional state, post-operative pain and functional outcomes of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed data of male patients who underwent RARP within the study period (from March to April 2019 [Group A = 27 patients] and from March to April 2020 [Group B = 29 patients]). Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) results were collected on the first day of hospitalization. Post-operative pain was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS) and visual analogic scale (VAS) after surgery in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 24 hours. Functional outcomes were evaluated at the one-month follow-up. Demographic, pathological and peri-operative data were collected for all patients. Results: There were no significant differences in demographics and pathological characteristics amongst the groups. We observed that patients in Group A had a statistically lower value on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires than patients of Group B. Moreover, Group A showed statistically significant better post-operative pain control in PACU and at 24 hours. At one-month follow-up, patients in Group B required more diapers for incontinence than Group A, showing poor early continence. Patients in Group A showed interest in sexual rehabilitation after 1.11 .320 months while patients in Group B after 2.59 .712 months (p <.001). Moreover, 17 out of 29 patients (58.62%) in Group B were referred to an andrologist, compared to 100% of patients from Group A (p = 0.0006). Conclusions: Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a poor pre-operative emotional state, as well as influencing post-operative pain, early urinary continence and desire for sexual rehabilitation.","output":"Preliminary evidence of the impact of social distancing on psychological status and functional outcomes of patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chinese cities have been placed upon lockdown in early 2020 in an attempt to contain the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), as increasingly huge demands are being placed upon Chinese and international health professionals to address this pandemic.

Since 1950, non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) have experienced higher rates of mortality than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Previous studies have revealed geographic variation in mortality rates by race. The identification of areas with the greatest disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality may assist policymakers in the allocation of resources, including for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does geographic variation in racial disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality exist? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database for Multiple Cause of Death between 1999 and 2018 for NHB and NHW decedents &#8805; 25 years of age with a Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems code for influenza (J09-J11) and pneumonia (J12-J18) was used. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) with 95% CIs were computed by race for Health & Human Services (HHS) regions and urbanization in NHBs and NHWs. RESULTS: In 1999 through 2018, there were 540,476 deaths among NHBs and NHWs 25 to 84 years of age. AAMRs were higher in NHBs than NHWs in each age group and in seven of 10 HHS regions. The greatest disparity was in HHS regions 2 (New York and New Jersey) and 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada). In HHS region 2, NHBs (24.6; 95% CI, 24.1-25.1) were more likely to die than NHWs (15.7; 95% CI, 15.6-15.9). Similarly, in region 9, NHBs (23.2; 95% CI, 22.7-23.8) had higher mortality than NHWs (16.1; 95% CI, 15.9-16.2). Within these regions, disparities were greatest in the core of major metropolitan areas. A very high AAMR in NHBs was noted in large, central metropolitan areas of region 2: 28.2 (95% CI, 27.6-28.9).

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All residents of LTCFs registered in Senior Alert, a Swedish national database of health examinations in older adults, during 2019-2020. METHODS: We selected residents with confirmed COVID-19 until September 15, 2020, along with time-dependent propensity score-matched controls without COVID-19. Exposures were COVID-19, age, sex, comorbidities, medications, and other patient characteristics. The outcome was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3731 residents (median age 87 years, 64.5% female) with COVID-19 were matched to 3731 controls without COVID-19. Thirty-day mortality was 39.9% in COVID-19 cases and 5.7% in controls [relative risk 7.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.10-8.14]. In COVID-19 cases, the odds ratio (OR) for 30-day mortality was 2.44 (95% CI 1.57-3.81) in cases aged 80-84 years, 2.99 (95% CI 1.93-4.65) in cases aged 85-89 years, and 3.28 (95% CI 2.11-5.10) in cases aged &#8805;90 years, as compared with cases aged <70 years. Other risk factors for mortality among COVID-19 cases included male sex (OR, 2.60, 95% CI 2.22-3.05), neuropsychological conditions (OR, 2.18; 95% CI 1.76-2.71), impaired walking ability (OR, 1.45, 95% CI 1.17-1.78), urinary and bowel incontinence (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.22-1.85), diabetes (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.14-1.62), chronic kidney disease (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.68) and previous pneumonia (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.85). Nutritional factors, cardiovascular diseases, and antihypertensive medications were not significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In Swedish LTCFs, COVID-19 was associated with a large excess in mortality after controlling for an extensive number of risk factors. Beyond older age and male sex, several prevalent clinical risk factors independently contributed to higher mortality. These findings suggest that reducing transmission of COVID-19 in LTCFs will likely prevent a considerable number of deaths.","output":"Excess Mortality After COVID-19 in Swedish Long-Term Care Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recently found responsible for the pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this work, a novel approach based on deep learning is proposed for identifying precursors of small active RNA molecules named microRNA (miRNA) in the genome of the novel coronavirus. Viral miRNA-like molecules have shown to modulate the host transcriptome during the infection progression, thus their identification is crucial for helping the diagnosis or medical treatment of the disease. The existence of the mature miRNAs derived from computationally predicted miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) in the novel coronavirus was validated with small RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells. The results demonstrate that computational models can provide accurate and useful predictions of pre-miRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, underscoring the relevance of machine learning in the response to a global sanitary emergency. Moreover, the interpretability of our model shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the viral infection, thus contributing to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and the fast development of new treatments. Our study shows how recent advances in machine learning can be used, effectively, in response to public health emergencies. The approach developed in this work could be of great help in future similar emergencies to accelerate the understanding of the singularities of any viral agent and for the development of novel therapies.

There are many challenges, including varying head scales, the diversity of crowd distribution across images and cluttered backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale context aggregation network (MSCANet) based on single-column encoder-decoder architecture for crowd counting, which consists of an encoder based on a dense context-aware module (DCAM) and a hierarchical attention-guided decoder. To handle the issue of scale variation, we construct the DCAM to aggregate multi-scale contextual information by densely connecting the dilated convolution with varying receptive fields. The proposed DCAM can capture rich contextual information of crowd areas due to its long-range receptive fields and dense scale sampling. Moreover, to suppress the background noise and generate a high-quality density map, we adopt a hierarchical attention-guided mechanism in the decoder. This helps to integrate more useful spatial information from shallow feature maps of the encoder by introducing multiple supervision based on semantic attention module (SAM). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better performance than other similar state-of-the-art methods on three challenging benchmark datasets for crowd counting.

The issue of protection against vaccine-preventable diseases has acquired new urgency in connection with the decrease in the vaccination rate established by WHO against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic. This creates the conditions for outbreaks and puts patients with immunopathological diseases at particular risk, who are most often not vaccinated from the moment of diagnosis Purpose of the study C to assess the safety of specific antibodies to measles, mumps, rubella and diphtheria in children with JIA, depending on the duration of vaccination, the duration of the disease and the therapy received. Materials and methods. The vaccination rate of 171 children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) aged (11,310,31 years) with the duration of the disease at the time of examination was 4,690,29 years, who had previously received 1-2 vaccinations against measles, mumps, rubella and 3-6 vaccinations against diphtheria. Antibodies to these infections were determined by ELISA. Results. 42.1% of children had no protective titers of antibodies to measles, 19,9% C to mumps, 9,4% C to rubella and 16,4% C to diphtheria. Among 93 vaccinated and revaccinated patients, there were no protective titers of antibodies to measles C 40,9% (38 children), mumps C 13,9% (13 people), rubella C 5,4% (5 children), and among 78 vaccinated once, respectively: measles C 43.6% (34 children), mumps C 25.6% (20 children), rubella C 14,1% (11). The level of protection against diphtheria was comparable for those who received 3-5 vaccinations. Depending on the therapy, 3 groups were identified: group 1-71 children received metatrexate and glucocorticosteroids, 2-82 children received modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) and 18 children without this therapy (Group 3). Children of the 2nd group were on average older (12,480,42 years) than in the 1st and 3rd groups (10,040,48 and 10,960,96 years, respectively), they had significantly more frequent systemic variant and polyarthritis (64,6% compared to 36,6% and 16,7%, px2<0,001). The number of vaccine doses received by children in all groups before the onset of the disease did not significantly differ. The average level of antibodies to measles in children of group 2 (0,320,07 IU/ml) was 2,8 times less than in group 3 and significantly less than in group 1 (0,780,16, Pt=0.009), the average value of antibodies to rubella was also significantly less in group 2 (84,487,34 IU/ml) than in group 1 (109,738,09, Pt=0,022) and in group 3 (120,0115,42, Pt=0,042). The analysis showed that the safety of antibodies to antigens of live vaccines, especially against measles, is negatively affected by the duration of the disease and the nature of therapy. Children who received combined therapy with anti-TNF, anti-IL-6 and anti-CD-80 drugs had a longer duration of the disease (7,50,97 years)=0,00082 compared to those who received only anti-IL-6 (2,90,7 years) and anti-TNF therapy (6,10,5 years) and with a comparable number of vaccine doses received, significantly lower average values of antibodies and a larger number of unprotected ones. Conclusions. The duration of the disease, the lack of timely age-related revaccinations, as well as the presence of combination therapy aimed at suppressing various mechanisms of the immune response in children with JIA are factors that lead to an increase in the number of unprotected from controlled infections.

Recently, an explicit analytic, approximate expression (MT) for the peak time of the fraction of infected persons during an outbreak within the susceptible-infectious-recovered/removed (SIR) model had been presented and discussed (Turkyilmazoglu, 2021). There are three existing approximate solutions (SK-I, SK-II, and CG) of the semi-time SIR model in its reduced formulation that allow one to come up with different explicit expressions for the peak time of the infected compartment (Schlickeiser and Kr?ger, 2021; Carvalho and Gon?alves, 2021). Here we compare the four expressions for any choice of SIR model parameters and find that SK-I, SK-II and CG are more accurate than MT as long as the amount of population to which the SIR model is applied exceeds hundred by far (countries, ss, cities). For small populations with less than hundreds of individuals (families, small towns), however, the approximant MT outperforms the other approximants. To be able to compare the various approaches, we clarify the equivalence between the four-parametric dimensional SIR equations and their two-dimensional dimensionless analogue.

Chest sonography plays a key role in the approach for this group of patients, through extended and focused evaluation with trauma sonography (E-FAST). OBJECTIVES: To establish the diagnostic performance of the extension of the thoracic spine sign using chest sonography in trauma to diagnose hemothorax and compare it with the gold standard test chest computed tomography (CT). METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted over 1 year. Patients who attended the emergency room with closed or penetrating thoracic or thoraco-abdominal trauma, an indication for a chest CT as part of a diagnostic evaluation according to institutional protocols, and who previously underwent a chest sonogram to determine the extent of the thoracic spine sign to diagnose hemothorax. Sonographic results were compared to a radiologist's interpretation of the chest CT. The radiologists were blinded to the initial sonogram interpretation. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were enrolled with an average age of 32 years. They mainly had closed trauma, which accounted for 77.6% of samples, and 222 chest images were taken. The sensitivity and specificity for this study were 78.7% and 92.6%, respectively, with a positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 65% and 97.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Extension of the thoracic spine sign allows rapid identification of the presence, and more precisely, the absence of pleural effusion.

In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. In pooled sample testing, multiple samples are combined (or pooled) together and tested as a single unit. If the pool is positive, the individual samples can then be individually tested to identify the positive case(s). Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the limit of detection of this assay was comparable to laboratory-developed reverse-transcription quantitative PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, with observed detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert? Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were pooled in groups of six. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted based on public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or the pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care testing site and can be determined by the positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates.

The macro fold is roughly 25 kDa in size and is composed of a mixed C fold with similarity to the P loop-containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases. They function as binding modules for metabolites of NAD(+), including poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), which is synthesized by PAR polymerases (PARPs). Although there is a high degree of sequence similarity within this family, particularly for residues that might be involved in catalysis or substrates binding, it is likely that the sequence variation that does exist among macro domains is responsible for the specificity of function of individual proteins. Recent findings have indicated that macro domain proteins are functionally promiscuous and are implicated in the regulation of diverse biological functions, such as DNA repair, chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Significant advances in the field of macro domain have occurred in the past few years, including biological insights and the discovery of novel signaling pathways. To provide a framework for understanding these recent findings, this review will provide a comprehensive overview of the known and proposed biochemical, cellular and physiological roles of the macro domain family. Recent data that indicate a critical role of macro domain regulation for the proper progression of cellular differentiation programs will be discussed. In addition, the effect of dysregulated expression of macro domain proteins will be considered in the processes of tumorigenesis and bacterial pathogenesis. Finally, a series of observations will be highlighted that should be addressed in future efforts to develop macro domains as effective therapeutic targets.","output":"The macro domain protein family: Structure, functions, and their potential therapeutic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 continues adapting to human hosts during the current worldwide pandemic since 2019. This virus evolves through multiple means, such as single nucleotide mutations and structural variations, which has brought great difficulty to disease prevention and control of COVID-19. Structural variation, including multiple nucleotide changes like insertions and deletions, has a greater impact relative to single nucleotide mutation on both genome structures and protein functions. In this study, we found that deletion occurred frequently in not only SARS-CoV-2 but also in other SARS-related coronaviruses. These deletions showed obvious location bias and formed 45 recurrent deletion regions in the viral genome. Some of these deletions showed proliferation advantages, including four high-frequency deletions (nsp6 106-109, S 69-70, S 144, and 28271) that were detected in around 50% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and other 19 median-frequency deletions. In addition, the association between deletions and the WHO reported variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI) of SARS-CoV-2 indicated that these variants had a unique combination of deletion patterns. In the spike (S) protein, the deletions in SARS-CoV-2 were mainly in the N-terminal domain. Some deletions, such as S 144/145 and S 243-244, have been confirmed to block the binding sites of neutralizing antibodies. Overall, this study revealed a conservative regional pattern and the potential effect of some deletions in SARS-CoV-2 over the whole genome, providing important evidence for potential epidemic control and vaccine development. IMPORTANCE Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 were studied extensively, while only the structure variations on the spike protein were discussed well in previous studies. To study the role of structural variations in virus evolution, we described the distribution of structure variations on the whole genome. Conserved patterns were found of deletions among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2-like, and SARS-CoV-like viruses. There were 45 recurrent deletion regions (RDRs) in SARS-CoV-2 generated through the integration of deleted positions. In these regions, four high-frequency deletions parallelly appeared in multiple strains. Furthermore, in the spike protein, the deletions in SARS-CoV-2 were mainly in the N-terminal domain, blocking the binding sites of some neutralizing antibodies, while the structural variations in SARS-related coronavirus were mainly in the N-terminal domain and receptor binding domain. The receptor binding domain is highly related to hosting recognition.

It is the product of rotavirus gene 9 which potentially encodes a protein of 326 amino acids that contains two amino terminal hydrophobic domains, h1 and h2, each preceded by an initiation codon. Comparison of the size of products derived from altered genes containing coding sequences for both h1 and h2 with those lacking the h1 sequence ('dhl' mutants), indicates that initiation takes place at M30 immediately preceding h2 (residues F32 to L48) and that h2 is cleaved, confirming the studies of others (Stirzaker, S.C., P.L. Whitfeld, D.L. Christie, A.R. Bellamy, and G.W. Both. 1987. J. Cell Biol. 105:2897-2903). Our previous work had shown that deletions in the carboxy end of h2, extending to amino acid 61 in the open reading frame, resulted in secretion of VP7. The region from amino acid number 51-61, present in wild-type VP7 but missing in the secreted mutant delta 47-61, was thus implicated to have a role in ER retention. To test this, a series of chimeric genes were constructed by fusing the first 63 codons of wild-type VP7, delta 1-14 or delta 51-61/dhl, to the mouse salivary alpha-amylase gene, a secretory protein, such that the fusion junction was located at the exact mature terminus of amylase. The chimeric proteins VP7(63)/amylase, delta 1-14(63)/amylase and delta 51-61(63)/dhl/amylase were secreted when expressed in cells and the h2 domain was cleaved when mRNA was translated in vitro. These results imply that the sequence 51-61 is necessary but not sufficient for ER retention. When a second series of VP7/amylase chimera were constructed extending the VP7 contribution to amino acid 111, the product expressed by delta 1-14(111)/amylase was not secreted whereas that of delta 47- 61(111)/amylase was. Significantly, the intracellular delta 1- 14(111)/amylase product exhibited an amylase enzymatic specific activity that was similar to that of the wild-type amylase product. We conclude that two regions of VP7 mediate its retention in the ER, the first lies within the sequence 51-61 and the second within the sequence 62-111, which contains the glycosylation site for VP7. Both regions are necessary for retention, though neither is sufficient alone.","output":"Primary sequence domains required for the retention of rotavirus VP7 in the endoplasmic reticulum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study extends the literature on big data applied to tourism by validating the significance of point-of-sale (POS) electronic transactions, which have received little attention within tourism literature, as a reliable and effective alternative to surveys on guests stays at tourist accommodation establishments.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","output":"Clinical consensus recommendations regarding non-invasive respiratory support in the adult patient with acute respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there has been an increase of the use of antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT).

It is unclear if anticoagulants or antiplatelets in patients with COVID-19 influences disease severity. We report outcomes of COVID-19 patients prescribed anticoagulants or antiplatelets for preexisting conditions within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health system serving 4.4 million members. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included KPNC adult members (18 years) with positive COVID-19 testing between February 25,2020, and May 8,2020. Patients were stratified based on electronic medical records indicating a filled prescription or actively taking antiplatelets or anticoagulants within 90 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Primary outcomes included emergency department (ED) visit, inpatient hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, venous thromboembolism (VTE), mechanical ventilation, and mortality between date of COVID-19 diagnosis and the first of either 45 days after diagnosis or 6/9/2020. Any severe outcome was defined as any of inpatient hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, or mortality. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of anticoagulants or antiplatelets with primary outcomes, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Models were adjusted for week of diagnosis given changing testing and treatment guidelines over time. The Research Determination Committee for KPNC has determined the project does not meet the regulatory definition of research involving human subjects per 45 CFR 46.102(d). Results: Of 2,972 patients with confirmed positive COVID-19, 167(6%) were on antiplatelets, 69(2%) were on anticoagulants, and 7(<1%) on both. Most patients on anticoagulants or antiplatelets were older (77% aged >60 years), non-white (53%), overweight or obese (69%), and had >3 comorbidities (62%). After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelets use was not associated with a lower risk of any primary outcome, including VTE, ED visit, ICU stay or severe outcome (OR 1.03, CI 0.74-1.45). Older patients had an increased risk of all outcomes except VTE, with the highest risk of severe outcomes in those > 80 years compared to 18-29 years (OR 13.62, CI 7.69-24.11). Male patients and Asian or Hispanic patients (compared to white patients) also had increased risk of severe outcomes. A higher mortality risk was noted in patients with underlying obesity (OR 2.28, CI 1.31-3.95) and hypertension (OR 2.03, CI 1.30-3.19), but not with diabetes (OR 1.43, CI 0.89-2.28). (Table 1) Conclusions: This analysis using a socio-demographically diverse cohort of COVID-19 positive patients demonstrated that patients on chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelets did not have lower risk for inpatient hospitalization, invasive ventilator, or death. There was a significantly higher risk of severe outcomes in those with older age, Asian or Hispanic ethnicity, male gender, obesity, hypertension and diabetes. Infection with COVID-19 can lead to a severe systemic inflammatory response, vascular endothelial dysfunction and hemostatic derangements, predisposing to microvascular and macrovascular thrombi and significant morbidity. Efforts to mitigate the disease severity have generated discussions regarding empiric use of anticoagulants and antiplatelets in COVID-19 patients. We did not find a difference in the risk of hospitalizations, mechanical ventilation or death for patients on chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelets. Our findings argue against the empiric use of these agents at COVID-19 diagnosis until prospective studies powered to evaluate thrombosis risk and clinical outcomes with value to patients and health care systems are completed. The major strength of this study included the availability of all outcomes data for inpatients and outpatients with COVID19. Limitations include possible missed data from undiagnosed COVID-19 patients due to evolving COVID-19 testing and variance in inpatient treatments which may influence outcomes. Despite this, our findings do not suggest a clinical benefit of chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelets in mitigating disease severity in COVID-19 patients Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.","output":"Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Use Not Associated with Improvement in Severe Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A diversified workforce is a current trend in organizations today.

By utilizing multigroup analyses, we found support for the hypothesis that compared to women, men perceive their organization as more inclusive. However, in contrast to what was hypothesized, the proposed relationships in the model were stronger for men than women, suggesting that not only do men perceive their work environment as more inclusive, but their perception of inclusion is also more strongly related to beneficial outcomes for the organization.

Outpatient clinics were stopped for non-urgent patients: it became a priority to manage hundreds of fragile neurological patients who suddenly had less reference points. In Italy, before the pandemic, Televisits were neither recognized nor priced. METHODS: At the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico C. Besta, we reorganized outpatient clinics to deliver Neuro-telemedicine services, including Televisits and Teleneurorehabilitation, since March 2020. A dedicated Working Group prepared the procedure, tested the system, and designed satisfaction questionnaires for adults and children. RESULTS: After a pilot phase, we prepared a procedure for Telemedicine outpatient clinics which was approved by hospital directions. It included prescription, booking, consenting, privacy and data protection, secure connection with patients (Teams Microsoft 365), electronic report preparation and delivery, reporting, and accountability of the services. During the March-September 2020 period, we delivered 3167 Telemedicine services, including 1618 Televisits, to 1694 patients (972 adults, 722 children) with a wide range of chronic neurological disorders. We successfully administered different clinical assessment and scales. Satisfaction among patients and caregivers was very high. CONCLUSIONS: During the dramatic emergency, we were able to take care of more than 1600 patients by organizing Neuro-telehealth in a few weeks, lessening the impact of the pandemic on fragile patients with chronic neurological disorders;this strategy is now stably embedded in our care pathways. In Italy, Telehealth is at present recognized and priced and is becoming a stable pillar of the health system.","output":"Neuro-telehealth for fragile patients in a tertiary referral neurological institute during the COVID-19 pandemic in Milan, Lombardy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) are essential for the clinical care of immunocompromised individuals. These patients often require specialized testing not available from commercial manufacturers and are therefore dependent on the laboratory to create, validate, and perform these assays. Recent paradigm-shifting legislation could alter the way that LDTs are operationalized and regulated. RECENT FINDINGS: On March 5th, 2020 the Verifying Accurate and Leading-Edge In-Vitro Clinical Tests Development Act (VALID) was introduced in the US Congress. This statute would overhaul existing regulatory framework by unifying the oversight of LDTs and commercial in-vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs) through the FDA. If enacted, LDTs would be subject to regulatory requirements like those found in commercial submissions for market review. Stakeholders continue to discuss the details and scope of the proposed legislation in the setting of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic, where LDTs are integral to the national COVID-19 response. SUMMARY: Congressional lawmakers have introduced legislation to alter the regulatory framework governing LDTs. Moving forward, a balance must be struck to ensure the availability of safe and accurate testing without delays or overregulation that could be harmful to patients. The downstream implications of how VALID and other legislation will impact laboratories, clinicians, and patients warrant close examination.","output":"Laboratory-developed test regulation and the immunocompromised patient: uncertainty ahead"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in healthcare systems that impact the management of chronic diseases such as diabetic foot (DF). We hypothesized that lack of access to healthcare would increase the severity of disease and lead to worse outcomes. METHODS: The medical records of patients with DF were reviewed to determine demographic data and outcomes including wound healing, major amputation (MA), and death. Groups were divided into the pre-COVID-19 era (15 March 2019-15 March 2020) and the COVID-19 era (16 March 2020-16 March 2021); multivariable logistic analysis was performed to identify risk factors for MA. RESULTS: 261 patients with DF were included, 163 in the pre-COVID-19 era and 98 during the COVID-19 era. Patients in the COVID-19 presented with increased cardiovascular disease (19 vs 7%, p = 0.01), increased mean HbA1C (9.1  2.1 vs 8.2  2.1, p = 0.008) and higher WIFI-IV stage (78 vs 53%, p  0.0001). Patients with DF in the COVID-19 era were more likely to require MA (41 vs 21%, p  0.0001). Revascularization (OR = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.038-0.38) was a protective factor to reduce MA. CONCLUSIONS: MA among DF patients increased two-fold during the COVID-19 era. Revascularization avoids MA in diabetic patients even during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that revascularization should be performed when possible.","output":"Revascularization prevents amputation among patients with diabetic foot during the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a new strategy for portfolio selection in the Brazilian equity market with the use of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) as a mechanism to select assets based on their efficiency levels Empirical analysis uses daily prices to compose minimum variance (MVP) and maximum Sharpe ratio (MSR) long-only portfolios, and also includes their performances during the COVID-19 pandemic MF-DFA indicated a multifractal nature for asset price returns, generally associated with long-term persistence The strategy using the most efficient equities resulted in portfolios with lower levels of systematic risk (betas), indicating that the lack of efficiency is related to higher sensitivity to macroeconomic and conjuncture changes The MVP portfolio produces higher performance than the alternatives in terms of risk and return Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, besides its consistent negative impacts, MVP and MSR portfolios verified lower losses than the IBOVESPA ? 2021 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","output":"A new approach to portfolio management in the Brazilian equity market: Does assets efficiency level improve performance?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Single photon emission computed tomography ventilation/perfusion (SPECT V/Q) imaging has many proponents within the nuclear medicine community and has already largely replaced planar V/Q scintigraphy in daily practice for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE).

METHODS In this prospective cohort, 162 targeted biopsies of 43 patients with therapy-na?ve, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype GBM were obtained after defining areas of interest based on imaging parameters [18F] FET PET, CBV, FA and MD. Histopathological analysis of cellularity and neovascularization was conducted and results correlated to imaging data. RESULTS ANOVA analysis showed a significant increase of CBV in areas with high neovascularization. For diffusion metrics, and in particular FA, a trend for inverse association with neovascularization was found. [18F] FET PET showed a significant positive correlation to cellularity, while CBV also showed a trend towards correlation with cellularity, not reaching significant levels. In contrast, MD and FA were negatively associated with cellularity.

Socioeconomic heterogeneity across counties closely manifests differences in the post-NPIs growth rate of incidence, which is a crucial indicator to guide future infectious control policy making. Few studies, however, examined the geospatial and sociological variations in the epidemic growth across different time points of NPIs. OBJECTIVE To guide a more effective reopening plan while controlling the transmission, the current study aims at 1) identifying hotspots of the growth rate of COVID-19 incidence among the 57 counties and New York City in NYS over time, and 2) examining the association of COVID-19 growth rates after eight critical NPIs time points and most relevant county-level sociological predictors. METHODS County-level COVID-19 incidence rates were retrieved from the Social Explorer Website between March 7, 2020 to June 22, 2020. 5-day moving average growth rates of COVID-19 incidence were calculated for 16 selected time points, including the dates of eight NPIs and their respective 14-day-lag-behind time points. A total of 36 county-level indicators were extracted from multiple public datasets. Geospatial mapping and heatmap were used to analyze spatial and temporal heterogeneity of county-level COVID-19 outbreak over selected NPIs-related dates. Generalized mixed effect least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, controlling for the 5-day moving average growth rates of COVID-19 testing rates, was employed to identify significant county-level predictors related to the changes of county-level COVID-19 growth rates over time. RESULTS COVID-19 infection increased and peaked by the end of March (=22.50%). Growth rates of COVID-19 decreased by 50.48% after implementing NPIs such as closures of schools, non-essential businesses, parks, and subways. There was a geospatial shift in the region with the highest growth rates from New York metropolitan area towards Western and Northern regions over time. Proportions of population aged 45 years and above (=3.25 [0.17-6.32]), living alone at residential houses (=3.31 [0.39--6.22]), and proportion of crowd residential houses (=6.15 [2.15-10.14]) were positively associated with the growth rate of COVID-19 infection. In contrast, living alone at rental houses (=-2.47 [-4.83--0.12]) and rate of mental health providers (=-1.11 [-1.95--0.28]) were negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rate across all 16 time points. CONCLUSIONS There are geospatial differences in COVID-19 incidence after implementing different NPIs. Socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and healthcare resource disparities at the structural and historical levels across counties need to be considered in infection control policymaking to narrow the unequal health impact on vulnerable populations effectively.

The robustness of individual covariates is measured through posterior inclusion probabilities. The empirical analysis provides conclusive evidence on the role played by the temperatures given that it appears as the most relevant determinant of contagions. This finding is robust to (i) the prior distribution elicitation, (ii) the procedure to assign weights to the regressors, (iii) the presence of measurement errors in official data due to under-reporting, (iv) the employment of different metrics of temperatures or (v) the inclusion of additional correlates. In a second step, relative importance metrics that perform an accurate partitioning of the R2 of the model are calculated. The results of this approach support the evidence of the model averaging analysis, given that temperature is the top driver explaining 45% of regional contagion disparities.

Certain Middle East analysts regard Beijing and Washington as largely \\"homogeneous\\" extra-regional powers competing in international politics, economy, and technology. Many others emphasise their \\"heterogeneity,\\" arguing that the essence of Sino-US confrontation lies in the clash of two models. Most Middle East scholars note that, in contrast to Washington's waning influence, Beijing's growing presence in the region during the past decade has rendered the Middle East a \\"new battleground\\" for the two great powers. Although China and the United States still have shared interests in certain regional affairs, most intellectuals focus on and collectively identify five domains across the Middle East wherein Beijing and Washington are locked in asymmetric competition. In light of both the opportunities and challenges that the emerging Sino-US rivalry engenders, Middle Eastern observers raise various policy suggestions, and debate on whether regional players should proactively take advantage of this great power competition, cautiously hedge against strategic uncertainty and risk, or constructively help reduce hostility between the United States and the People's Republic of China.

Promising effects appear to be attributable to hydroxychloroquine. Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are being tested in ongoing randomized trials. In contrast, oseltamivir was not effective and corticosteroids are not currently recommended. However, few data from ongoing clinical trials are identifying low molecular weight heparins, innate immune system stimulating agents, and inflammatory modulating agents as potential effective agents.

However, the effects of LSG on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are controversial. Asymptomatic GERD and hiatal hernia (HH) is common in obese patients. Therefore, it is important to identify the high risk patients prior to surgery. This study aims to evaluate efficacy of cruroplasty for HH during LSG in morbidly obese patients using ambulatory pH monitoring (APM) results, and to investigate the patients' selection criteria for this procedure. METHODS This retrospective study includes outcomes of 59 patients who underwent LSG and HH repair according to our patient selection algorithm. Outcomes included preoperative GERD Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaire, APM results, percentage of postoperative excess weight loss, and total weight loss. RESULTS For a total of 402 patients, APM was applied in 70 patients who had a positive score of GERD-HRQL, and 59 patients underwent LSG and concomitant HH repair who had a DeMeester score of 14.7% or above. There was no statistically significant difference in weight loss at 6 and 12-month follow-up. Two patients (3.3%) had symptoms of GERD at 12 months postoperatively, and only one (1.6%) patient required treatment of proton pump inhibitor for reflux. In the total cohort, 11 (2.7%) patients also evolved de novo GERD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This study confirm that careful attention to patient selection and surgical technique can reduce the symptoms of GERD at short-term.

Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) is a commonly used Chinese medical preparation to treat viral influenza, including in the fight against SARS in 2002C2003 in China. Recent data also showed that LHQW played a vigorous role in COVID-19 treatment. Purpose: This review will elucidate the pre-clinical and clinical evidence of LHQW in lung protection and antiviral activities, and provide timely data delivery for the exploration of effective treatment strategies in the therapy of COVID-19. Study design and method: The research data were obtained from the academic databases (up to August 8, 2020) including Pubmed, CNKI and Web of Science, on ethnobotany and ethno medicines. The search keywords for screening the literature information were virus, COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2, and Lianhua Qingwen. The documents were filtered and summarized for final evaluation. Results: The collected evidence demonstrated that LHQW exhibited benefits against COVID-19. Impressively, LHQW in conjunction with conventional treatment could significantly improve COVID-19 patients as a synergetic strategy. The mechanisms were mainly involved the antiviral activity, and regulation of inflammation response as well as immune function. Conclusion: Although the data were far from adequate, the latest advances had shown the benefits of LHQW in COVID-19, especially in combination with other antiviral drugs.

Background: This is not the first nor will it be the last time that a member of the ?-coronaviruses wages a full-scale war against human health. Notwithstanding atypical pneumonia being the primary symptom, the emergence of severe disease mainly resulting from the injury of non-pulmonary organs leaves no alternative, in some cases, other than a dreadful death. Methods: To provide a well-conceptualized viewpoint representing the prognostic values of liver-related laboratory parameters in COVID-19, a meta-analysis was performed with the calculation of mean difference and 95% condence intervals of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Bili), and albumin (Alb) in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. Results: While severe COVID-19 cases displayed higher values of ALT, AST, and Bili compared to non-severe patients (mean differences of 7.48, 12.07, and 3.07, respectively), the value of Alb was significantly lower in severe cases (mean differences of -6.15). There was also a correlation between alterations in all of the parameters; however, only correlations between ALT and Bili (R=0.98, p=0.0031), and Bili and Alb (R=-1, p=0.0012) were significant. Conclusion: Abnormal values of liver-related examinations outwardly contribute to reflect the progression of the disease toward an unfavorable outcome. Therefore, careful scrutiny of these parameters will provide clinicians with invaluable information regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least in terms of liver injury.","output":"COVID-19 prognosis: what we know of the significance and prognostic value of liver-related laboratory parameters in SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemisi yarat?c? ve kltrel endstrilerin baz? alt sekt?rlerinin faaliyetlerinde ciddi k?s?tlamalar ya?anmas?na neden olmu?tur.

The aim of this study is to examine the state of art of the arts and culture sectors, which are sub-sectors of creative and cultural industries, during the pandemic in Turkey. In this study, the public supports provided by the government and metropolitan municipalities and the supports of the professional associations, trade unions and civil society organizations to the arts and culture sectors, between March-September 2020, are examined through document analysis technique. The supports offered to the arts and culture sectors under the categories of cinema, television, theater, music and performative arts are analyzed regarding the following themes: Financial support, tax reduction or deferral, digital archive support, early ticket reservation, providing offline or online stages required for the artistic performance, proposing structural solution for the problems encountered during the pandemic. The findings of the research reveal that the arts and culture sector are not adequately supported by the government, while partly supported by the local authorities, professional associations and unions during the pandemic.

For the individual surgeon, advantages of clinical integration through shared care include decreased burnout and professional isolation, and more efficient transitions into and out of practice. Advantages to the system include greater surgeon availability, streamlined disease site wait lists, and promotion of system efficiency through a centralized distribution of clinical resources.

Participants included one parent and two adolescent-aged children from 682 families (2,046 participants). Parents and youth participating in an ongoing longitudinal study in five Midwestern states in the United States completed an additional web-based assessment of family processes and family relationship qualities during the May-June 2020 pandemic-related shutdowns. A series of two-wave latent change score models indicated that family chaos increased with the onset of pandemic-related shutdowns and that the level of chaos within a family during the shutdowns had implications for changes in several parenting processes and family relationship qualities. Specifically, higher levels of family chaos during the pandemic mitigated observed increases in parental knowledge and were associated with declines in parental autonomy granting. Family chaos during pandemic-related shutdowns also was associated with increases in maternal-child conflict, paternal-child conflict, and sibling conflict as well as decreases in paternal-child intimacy, sibling intimacy, and sibling disclosure. Overall, consistent with a family stress perspective, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased strain and commotion within many households, and these changes had implications for multiple family relationships.

In this process, a patient who tests positive for an infectious disease and public health officials work to identify the patient's close contacts, notify them of their risk of possible exposure to the disease, and provide resources to facilitate the decreased spreading of disease. Contact notification can be done physically in person, via phone call, or digitally through the use of media such as SMS text messages and email. When alerts are made through the latter, it is called digital contact notification. OBJECTIVE: For this study, we aim to perform a preliminary evaluation of the use of the TellYourContacts website, a digital contact notification tool for COVID-19 that can be used confidentially and anonymously. We will gather information about the number of website users and message senders, the types of messages sent, and the geographic distribution of senders. METHODS: Patients who chose to get tested for COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for the disease were alerted of their positive results through Curative Inc (a COVID-19 testing laboratory) and Healthvana (a results disclosure app). Included in the notification was a link to the TellYourContacts website and a message encouraging the person who tested positive for COVID-19 to use the website to alert their close contacts of exposure risk. Over the course of three months, from May 18, 2020, to August 17, 2020, we used Google Analytics and Microsoft Excel to record data on the number of website users and message senders, types of messages sent, and geographic distribution of the senders. RESULTS: Over the course of three months, 9130 users accessed the website and 1474 unique senders sent a total of 1957 messages, which included 1820 (93%) SMS text messages and 137 (7%) emails. Users sent messages from 40 US states, with the majority of US senders residing in California (49%). CONCLUSIONS: We set out to determine if individuals who test positive for COVID-19 will use the TellYourContacts website to notify their close contacts of COVID-19 exposure risk. Our findings reveal that, during the observation period, each unique sender sent an average of 1.33 messages. The TellYourContacts website offers an additional method that individuals can and will use to notify their close contacts about a recent COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"A Patient-Initiated Digital COVID-19 Contact Notification Tool (TellYourContacts): Evaluation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of coronary arterial profiles from normal dogs (11 animals) and canines (six dogs) with experimental myocardial infarction (MI) induced by ligation of the left coronary artery (LCA).

The LCA was observed as an infundibular shape, located adjacent to the sinus of Valsalva. The RCA appeared as a tubular structure located 12 o'clock relative to the aorta. In normal dogs, the LCA and RCA mean peak diastolic velocities were 20.84  3.24 and 19.47  2.67 cm/sec, respectively. The LCA and RCA mean diastolic deceleration times were 0.91  0.14 sec and 1.13  0.20 sec, respectively.

We now describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Oromia Regional State, the largest and most populous region in Ethiopia, during the early months of the outbreak.Methods: We analyzed data from the COVID-19 surveillance database of the Oromia Regional Health Bureau. We included RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases diagnosed at healthcare facilities across the region during the period of 13 March to 13 September 2020.Findings: COVID-19 was confirmed in 8955 (55%) of 164206 individuals tested during the surveillance period. The test positivity rate increased from an average of 10% in the first three months to 63% in August and September. About 70% (6230) of the cases were male;the mean age was 300 years (SD=133) and 878% were between 10 and 49 years of age. Only 64 (07%) of the cases had symptoms at diagnosis. Among symptomatic cases, cough was the most common, reported in 48 (750%) and fever the least common, reported in 11 (172%) of cases. Moreover, only 6 (01%) cases presented with severe disease. Overall, 4346 (485%) have recovered from the virus and a total of 52 deaths were reported with a case fatality rate of 12%. However, the reported case fatality rate should be interpreted cautiously since in 44 (846%) of those reported as COVID-19 death, the virus was detected from a dead body.Interpretation: The COVID-19 infection rate in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia is surging six months after the onset of the pandemic in the country. So far, the proportion of symptomatic cases and severe diseases besides the fatality rate are lower than reports from most other developing and developed countries.

It looks back on the 50 years of research on ageism and the body of research produced by the discursive turn in social science and gerontology. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This study followed the five-step scoping review protocol to define gaps in the knowledge on ageism in working life from a discursive perspective. 851 papers were extracted from electronic databases and, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 39 papers were included in the final review. RESULTS The selected articles were based on discursive approaches and included study participants along the full continuum of working life (workers, retirees, jobseekers, students in training). Three main themes representing the focal point of research were identified, namely, experiences of ageism, social construction of age and ageism, and strategies to tackle (dilute) ageism. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Discursive research provides undeniable insights into how participants experience ageism in working life, how ageism is constructed, and how workers create context-based strategies to counteract age stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. Discursive research on ageism in the working life need further development about the variety of methods and data, problematization of age-based labelling and grouping of workers, and a focus on the intersection between age and other social categories. Further research in these areas can deepen our understanding of how age and ageism are constructed and can inform policies about ways of disentangling them in working life.","output":"Ageism in Working Life: A Scoping Review on Discursive Approaches."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presented healthcare providers with an extreme challenge to provide cancer services. The impact upon the diagnostic and treatment capacity to treat pancreatic cancer is unclear. This study aimed to identify national variation in treatment pathways during the pandemic. METHODS: A survey was distributed to all United Kingdom pancreatic specialist centres, to assess diagnostic, therapeutic and interventional services availability, and alterations in treatment pathways. A repeating methodology enabled assessment over time as the pandemic evolved. RESULTS: Responses were received from all 29 centres. Over the first six weeks of the pandemic, less than a quarter of centres had normal availability of diagnostic pathways and a fifth of centres had no capacity whatsoever to undertake surgery. As the pandemic progressed services have gradually improved though most centres remain constrained to some degree. One third of centres changed their standard resectable pathway from surgery-first to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Elderly patients, and those with COPD were less likely to be offered treatment during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the capacity of the NHS to provide diagnostic and staging investigations for pancreatic cancer.

Simulation results show that the cloud of droplets locates around and below the waist height of the manikin after 2 s from coughing, which indicates that kids walking behind an infectious patient are exposed to higher transmission risk than adults. More importantly, two distinct droplet dispersion modes occupying significantly different contamination regions are discovered. A slight change of space size is found being able to trigger the transition of dispersion modes even though the flow patterns are still similar. This shows the importance of accurately simulating the air flow in predicting the dispersion of viral droplets and implies the necessity to set different safe-distancing guidelines for different environments.","output":"Effects of space sizes on the dispersion of cough-generated droplets from a walking person"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accounting technologies can be used to help stimulus packages achieve the twin goals of economic stimulus and climate mitigation Utilising an institutional logic perspective, we show that despite the massive financial consequences of climate change, the current climate response is dominated by the economising logic that justifies limited action Further, despite its strong potential, accounting technologies are not extensively used in the design of stimulus packages We develop a framework to explicitly integrate accounting technologies in the design, delivery and review of stimulus packages, thereby simultaneously enabling economic growth and social equity whilst addressing the climate crisis","output":"Recovery from Covid-19 towards a low-carbon economy: a role for accounting technologies in designing, implementing and assessing stimulus packages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has reduced the availability of health resources which will affect treatment of gynecological cancers.

All the obtained guidelines were studied and the contents were summarized. During the COVID-19 pandemic, early stage endometrial cancer was preferably treated with hormone therapy while radiotherapy was given in preference in later stages. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions should be treated immediately after diagnosis using at least a loop electrosurgical excision procedure while any major surgery should be postponed by 10-12 weeks. In the early stage of cervical cancer, surgery may be delayed by 2-4 weeks, and radiotherapy prescribed for the intervening period. In cases of an ovarian mass with negative tumor markers, no sign of cancer on imaging investigations, no ascites, a low serum CA-125 level, and no papillary projection or vegetation in the base of the cyst, the patient may be given hormone therapy for 2-3 months. In cases of newly diagnosed confirmed ovarian cancers, surgery should be performed as early as possible (maximum: 2-3 weeks). Vulvar and vaginal cancers can be treated within 10-12 weeks of diagnosis, but radiotherapy should be given in preference in this situation.

For children, this research was less extensive, was mainly based on caregivers' reports and neglected personality assessment. In order to measure the impact of the pandemic, and the fears it caused, on primary school children's affect and personality, 323 (180 boys and 143 girls) Italian third, fourth and fifth graders were assessed between October and November 2020, namely during the second wave of COVID-19 infections in Italy, with validated self-reports of affect (Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children, PANAS-C), fear of COVID-19 (Fear of COVID-19 Scale, FCV-19S) and personality (junior Temperament and Character Inventory, jTCI). In comparison with PANAS-C and jTCI normative scores collected prior to the pandemic, data obtained from children in 2020 showed unchanged affect scores in the overall sample, a decrease of Positive Affect in girls, and a decrease in the Harm Avoidance and an increase in the Self-Transcendence scales of personality. Fear of COVID-19 scores were positively correlated with Negative Affect scores and negatively predicted by children's personality profile of resilience (calculated using scores on the Harm Avoidance and the Self-Directedness scales of personality). These results suggested that Italian primary school children, especially boys, maintained their pre-pandemic levels of affect (or restored them after the first COVID-19 wave) and partially diverged from the typical development of personality in an apparently positive sense, namely toward more courageous/optimistic and spiritual profiles. This sort of children's post-traumatic growth might also be attributed to children's family and education systems, which should continue to be supported to promote and maintain community mental health.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Affect, Fear, and Personality of Primary School Children Measured During the Second Wave of Infections in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk of recurring coronavirus disease (COVID-19) resurgences that threaten Africa's health care systems, newly opened communities, schools, and businesses looms as communities abandon precautionary measures, such as mask-wearing, physical distancing, and regular handwashing.

Alongside efforts to reconfigure services and enable continued delivery of safe clinical care for patients with IBD, consideration must also be given to management of IBD research activity. In many centres there has been an effective shutdown of IBD clinical trial activity as research sites have switched focus to either COVID-19 related research or clinical care only. As a result, the early termination of trial programmes and loss of potentially effective therapeutic options for IBD, has become a real and worrying prospect. Moreover, in many countries research activity has become embedded into clinical care - with clinical trials often providing access to new therapies or strategies - which would otherwise not have been available in standard clinical pathways.

The aim of this study is to describe heart involvement in patients with MIS-C. STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, data of 122 patients were included. All patients met WHO and CDC criteria of MIS-C. RESULTS: Various types of heart involvement in MIS-C patients were observed. Patients with solely coronary artery lesions (CAL, n = 10, 8.2%) had typical features of Kawasaki disease: younger age, thrombocytosis and normal ferritin level, without giant CA aneurysms, thrombosis, myocardial infarction, shock, and ICU admission. Patients with solely myocardial involvement (MI, n = 30, 24.6%) had an older onset age, elevated ferritin, LDH, the highest D-dimer, H score, and thrombocytopenia level. The following clinical signs were associated with MI: gastrointestinal and central nervous system disorder, sore throat, swelling face, splenomegaly, shock, and treatment in the intensive care unit required. Patients with a combination of CAL and MI (n = 10, 8.2%) had symptoms similar to patients with solely MI, except for impressive thrombocytopenia. Shock and ICU admission were found in 34.7% of patients without heart involvement (n = 72, 59%). One major criterion [troponin > 32 pg/ml (52 points)] or at least two minor criteria [face swelling (32 points) and D-Dimer > 1,300 ng/ml (29 points)] were associated with MI (>32 points) with a sensitivity of 67.5% and a specificity of 88.9%.

Eligibility criteria included: reporting an ART uptake or adherence result among FSW aged 18 or older; peer-reviewed; published in English between 1996 and 2018. Our search identified 6,735 studies; 30 met eligibility requirements. ART uptake ranges from 0 to 100% and adherence ranges from 50-90%, depending on measurement methods. Uptake and adherence influencing factors are mapped onto a social ecological model (SEM). Knowledge and beliefs, substance use, food insecurity and sex-work engagement were negatively associated, while older age, relationships and social support were positively associated with ART uptake and adherence. Standardised methods to measure uptake and adherence prevalence must be established for data comparison. Evidence regarding ART uptake and adherence barriers and facilitators span multiple SEM levels, although more research is needed regarding structural and occupational level influencers. Results suggest that the multi-level ART uptake and adherence barriers faced by FSW require complex multi-level evidence-based interventions.

Women quickly found themselves filling this domestic void, providing the overwhelming majority of childcare, educational support for their children, and management of household duties, often to the detriment of their careers.

In addition, we investigated how this relationship is moderated by an individuals motivation to communicate through social media (LinkedIn). Based on social capital theory and the conservation of resources theory, we developed a set of hypotheses that were tested based on longitudinal data collected from university employees (N = 101) in middle- and high-level jobs. First, in line with our expectations, social media use for professional development was significantly higher after the learning intervention than before. Second, partially in line with our expectations, social media use for professional development was positively related with the employability dimension anticipation and optimization. Third, contrary to our expectations, motivation to communicate through social media (LinkedIn) did not have a moderating role in this relationship. We concluded that the learning intervention has the potential to foster social media use for professional development, and in turn, can contribute to individuals human capital in terms of their employability.

METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing on human nasal epithelial cells following stimulation of the intracellular viral recognition receptor RIG-I. Next, we evaluated whether measuring identified host mRNAs and proteins from patient nasopharyngeal swabs could predict the presence of a respiratory virus in the sample. RESULTS: Our first study showed that a signature of 3 mRNAs, CXCL10, IFIT2, and OASL, predicted respiratory virus detection with an accuracy of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9C1.0), and identified proteins correlating with virus detection. In a second study, elevated CXCL11 or CXCL10 protein levels identified samples containing respiratory viruses, including viruses not on the initial test panel.

The main outcome of the study were to better characterize the clinical features and the treatment response of PIMS-TS and to explore its relationship with KD determining whether KD and PIMS are two distinct entities. Methods: : The Rheumatology Study Group of the Italian Pediatric Society launched a survey to enroll patients diagnosed with KD (Kawasaki Disease Group C KDG) or KD-like (Kawacovid Group - KCG) disease. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, treatment information, and patients outcome were collected in an online anonymized database (RedCAP?). Relationship between clinical presentation and SARS-CoV-2 infection was also taken into account. Chi square test or exact Fisher test and non-parametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test were used to study differences between two groups Results: : One-hundred-forty-nine cases were enrolled, (96 KDG and 53 KCG). KCG children were significantly older and presented more frequently from gastrointestinal and respiratory involvement. Cardiac involvement was more common in KCG, with 60,4% of patients with myocarditis and 37,8% with hypotension/non-cardiogenic shock. Coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) were more common in the KDG. The risk of ICU admission were higher in KCG. Lymphopenia, higher CRP levels, elevated Ferritin and Troponin-T characterized KCG. KDG received more frequently immunoglobulins (IVIG) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (81,3% vs 66%;p=0.04 and 71,9% vs 43,4%;p=0.001 respectively) as KCG more often received glucocorticoids (56,6% vs 14,6%;p<0.0001).

Comparing KDG with a KD-Historical Italian cohort (598 patients), no statistical difference was found in terms of clinical manifestations and laboratory data. Conclusion: Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection might determine two distinct inflammatory diseases in children: KD and PIMS-TS.

Diagnostic groups include healthy allogeneic donors, autologous multiple myeloma (MM) and non-MM donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Here, we conducted a single-center retrospective study in 64 autologous patients and 48 allogeneic donors. Autologous donors were patients diagnosed with MM or non-MM. All donors were grouped as African American (AA), White (W), or \\"Other\\"(O). RESULTS Multivariate analysis demonstrated diagnostic group differences for CD34+ cell yields between race/ethnicity. Specifically, non-MM patients had the lowest CD34+ cell yields in AA and O, but not in W. For pre-apheresis peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cell numbers, race/ethnicity had a significant effect both in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Non-MM patients had the lowest, and AA patients had the highest PB CD34+ cells. The results support the view that past therapies used in MM are likely more conducive of recovery of HSPC. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that race/ethnicity and diagnostic group differences influenced CD34+ cell mobilization response across donor types. Interestingly, autologous MM donors with the aid of plerixafor displayed comparable CD34 yields to allogeneic donors.

METHODS: To be included in this retrospective case series, patients must have had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), fever, ferritin levels >1,000 ng/ml with 1 additional laboratory marker of hyperinflammation, and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was defined as requiring 15 liters of supplemental oxygen via a nonrebreather mask combined with 6-liter nasal cannula or use of &#8805;95% oxygen by high-flow nasal cannula. We excluded patients in whom there was suspicion of bacterial infection or who were receiving immunosuppressants. Subcutaneous anakinra was initiated at 100 mg every 6 hours and gradually tapered off completely. The primary outcome was the prevention of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Of the 14 patients who met the criteria, 11 patients received anakinra for a maximum of 19 days. Seven of the patients who started anakinra treatment &#8804;36 hours after onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure did not require mechanical ventilation, and all were discharged home. Four patients who started anakinra &#8805;4 days after onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure required mechanical ventilation.

Here, we present the SP3-Rox redox proteomics method that combines tailored low cost isotopically labeled capture reagents with SP3 sample cleanup to achieve high throughput and high coverage proteome-wide identification of redox-sensitive cysteines. By implementing a customized workflow in the free FragPipe computational pipeline, we achieve accurate MS1-based quantitation, including for peptides containing multiple cysteine residues. Application of the SP3-Rox method to cellular proteomes identified cysteines sensitive to the oxidative stressor GSNO and cysteine oxidation state changes that occur during T cell activation.","output":"SP3-Enabled Rapid and High Coverage Chemoproteomic Identification of Cell-StateCDependent Redox-Sensitive Cysteines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Movement Control Order (MCO) for Covid-19 safety measure caused worry and anxiety among university students, especially those stranded in their university hostels or rental accommodation.

This phenomenon may cause lung injury. Thus, a lung model for pendelluft was established, and the effects of ventilatory settings on pendelluft were examined. METHODS Two sets of the twin-bellow-type training test lung (TTL) model were utilized. One bellow simulated the diaphragm, and the other simulated the lung. One TTL model represented the ND region, and the other represented the D region. The lung bellows were connected to each other and were ventilated with 1 ventilator. The diaphragm bellows were ventilated with 2 synchronized ventilators that regulated pleural pressure levels. We simulated pendelluft by applying different pleural pressure levels to the D and ND bellows. The increment of the tidal volume in the D region from the \\"no breathing effort\\" condition was defined as the pendelluft volume. The effects of ventilator settings, such as ventilatory modes, triggering sensitivity, inspiratory pressurization, and inspiratory cycling-off, were examined. The changes in tidal volumes in the D region based on the control settings were compared to assess the severity of pendelluft. RESULTS The gas flow from the D region to the ND region was found to be essential in pendelluft, but the severity of this phenomenon was not always proportional to gas flows. The severity increased with the increase in the differences in pleural pressure levels between the ND and D regions, and it was amplified by the difference in lung mechanics between the ND and D regions. However, the ventilator settings had minimal effect on the severity of pendelluft. CONCLUSIONS The pendelluft was affected by the heterogeneity of lung mechanics and pleural pressure. Furthermore, a minimal association was observed between the ventilator settings and the severity of pendelluft.","output":"Effects of Ventilatory Settings on Pendelluft Phenomenon During Mechanical Ventilation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Serological response and association to clinical manifestation is important for understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

Currently, Medicaid's funding formula, the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), adjusts federal spending by state levels of economic development but fails to adjust for nationwide recessions. During economic contractions, the federal government should use its ability to run budget deficits to reimburse states at higher rates in exchange for maintaining services. In turn, during economic expansions, states should shoulder relatively more costs of Medicaid.

We aimed to develop a quantitative model to investigate the association between the operational conditions and the quantity of medication orders as a measurable indicator of the multidisciplinary care teams cognitive capacity. METHODS: The temporal data of patients at one medical ICU (MICU) of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN between February 2016 to March 2018 was used. This dataset includes a total of 4822 unique patients admitted to the MICU and a total of 6240 MICU admissions. Guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, quantifiable measures attainable from electronic medical records were identified and a conceptual framework of distributed cognition in ICU was developed. Univariate piecewise Poisson regression models were built to investigate the relationship between system-level workload indicators, including patient census and patient characteristics (severity of illness, new admission, and mortality risk) and the quantity of medication orders, as the output of the care teams decision making. RESULTS: Comparing the coefficients of different line segments obtained from the regression models using a generalized F-test, we identified that, when the ICU was more than 50% occupied (patient census > 18), the number of medication orders per patient per hour was significantly reduced (average = 0.74; standard deviation (SD) = 0.56 vs. average = 0.65; SD = 0.48; p < 0.001). The reduction was more pronounced (average = 0.81; SD = 0.59 vs. average = 0.63; SD = 0.47; p < 0.001), and the breakpoint shifted to a lower patient census (16 patients) when at a higher presence of severely-ill patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation during their stay, which might be encountered in an ICU treating patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that ICU operational factors, such as admission rates and patient severity of illness may impact the critical care teams cognitive function and result in changes in the production of medication orders. The results of this analysis heighten the importance of increasing situational awareness of the care team to detect and react to changing circumstances in the ICU that may contribute to cognitive overload.

The CFS/ME diagnostic criteria include a substantial reduction in usual activities for at least six months, exhaustion after exertion, non-refreshing sleep, and either cognitive impairment (brain fog) or feeling light-headed while standing.10 Historical research has found that similar symptoms were noted among survivors of the 1918 influenza pandemic.11 CFS/ME has been noted one year12 and three years13 after SARS infection and one year after MERS.14 A large study of middle-aged SARS survivors in Hong Kong four years after infection found 27% met chronic fatigue syndrome criteria.15 Initial reports of post-COVID-19 illness include symptoms such as extreme fatigue, concentration difficulties, memory lapses, and muscle weakness that are consistent with CFS/ME,16,17 as well as short-term reduced cognitive ability.18 Damage to organs throughout the body COVID-19 also damages organs throughout the body, creating potentially life-long physical health impacts, even for low-risk populations that were not hospitalized.19 COVID-19 symptoms, especially fatigue and difficulty breathing, have been shown to persist for months after infection.20 Lung damage may be life-long for some. While this cardiomyopathy is often reversible, some patients who have otherwise recovered from COVID-19 appear to have long-term myocarditis (inflammation of the heart tissue), which can lead to arrhythmias, heart attacks, and irreversible heart failure.23,24 Studies on patients with viral myocarditis have also shown an increase in five-year mortality.25 As the bodys immune system fights the virus, scientists believe the immune system overreacts, leading to many of the acute lung complications seen in the severe form of COVID-19, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).26 ARDS is an illness of acute respiratory failure in which both lungs fill with fluid, often leading to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and intubation with mechanical ventilation. During acute disease, many viruses, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 cause coagulation disorders, leading to an increase in blood clotting (thrombosis) throughout the body, which can ultimately cause multi-organ failure.31 An observational study in the Netherlands found rates of thrombosis as high as 31% in COVID-19 patients.32 In the lungs, a clot can cause a pulmonary embolism leading to reduced oxygenation;in the kidneys, a clot can cause kidney failure;and in the brain, a clot can cause a stroke.","output":"Policy Planning for the Post-Pandemic World: The Chronic Illness and Mental Health Needs of Tens of Millions of COVID-19 Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to predict the transmission trajectory of the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19).

We examined the associations between the proportion of Black residents in NHs and COVID-19 infections and deaths, accounting for structural bias (operationalized as county-level factors) and stratifying by urbanicity/rurality. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional observational cohort study using publicly available data from the LTCfocus, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Long-Term Care Facility COVID-19 Module, and the NYTimes county-level COVID-19 database. Four multivariable linear regression models omitting and including facility characteristics, COVID-19 burden, and county-level fixed effects were estimated. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 11,587 US NHs that reported data on COVID-19 to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and had data in LTCfocus and NYTimes from January 20, 2020 through July 19, 2020. MEASURES: Proportion of Black residents in NHs (exposure); COVID-19 infections and deaths (main outcomes). RESULTS: The proportion of Black residents in NHs were as follows: none= 3639 (31.4%), <20% = 1020 (8.8%), 20%-49.9% = 1586 (13.7%), &#8805;50% = 681 (5.9%), not reported = 4661 (40.2%). NHs with any Black residents showed significantly more COVID-19 infections and deaths than NHs with no Black residents. There were 13.6 percentage points more infections and 3.5 percentage points more deaths in NHs with &#8805;50% Black residents than in NHs with no Black residents (P < .001). Although facility characteristics explained some of the differences found in multivariable analyses, county-level factors and rurality explained more of the differences. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: It is likely that attributes of place, such as resources, services, and providers, important to equitable care and health outcomes are not readily available to counties where NHs have greater proportions of Black residents. Structural bias may underlie these inequities. It is imperative that support be provided to NHs that serve greater proportions of Black residents while considering the rurality of the NH setting.","output":"Assessment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection and Mortality Rates Among Nursing Homes With Different Proportions of Black Residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The syntheses and XRD molecular structures of a complete series of silylsulfido metalates Cat[M(SSiMe3)2] (M = Cu, Ag, Au) and corresponding silylselenido metalates Cat[M(SeSiMe3)2] (M = Cu, Ag, Au) comprising lattice stabilizing organic cations (Cat = Ph4P+ or PPN+) are reported.

METHODS An online survey on VTE prophylaxis practice patterns and perceptions was emailed to 172 H&N microsurgeons in the United States using an anonymous link. RESULTS There were 74 respondents (43% response rate). These surgeons completed residencies in otolaryngology (59%), plastic surgery (31%), and oral maxillofacial surgery (7%). Most underwent fellowship training (95%) and have practiced at an academic center (97%) for at least 6 years (58%), performing an average of 42  31 H&N free flap cases per year (range = 1-190). Most adhered to general VTE prophylaxis guidelines (69%) while 11% did not and 20% were unsure. Nearly all surgeons (99%) would provide prophylactic anticoagulation, mostly in the form of subcutaneous heparin (51%) or enoxaparin (44%); 64% additionally used aspirin, while 4% used aspirin alone. The majority of surgeons (68%) reported having postoperative VTE complications, with six surgeons (8%) reporting patient deaths due to pulmonary embolism. A third of the surgeons have encountered VTE prophylaxis-related adverse bleeding events, but most still believe that chemoprophylaxis is important for VTE prevention (92%).

Arrhythmia is possible clinical manifestation in COVID-19 patients and several cases of COVID-19 myocarditis have been reported, some as a cause of death3. Case report: We present a case of a 37-years old, previously healthy, female patient who was admitted to COVID-19 Intensive care unit (ICU) at University Hospital Centre Zagreb after out of hospital cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. She manifested episodes of chest pain and palpitations during two months prior to cardiac arrest. Initial laboratory findings showed elevated levels of high-sensitive troponin I and NT-proBNP, significant hypokalemia and normal values of C-reactive protein. Additional urgent work-up (pulmonary CT angiography and brain CT scan) showed no significant pathology and Sars-Cov-2 PCR RNA test came positive, without respiratory involvement. Due to ECG changes and ultrasound finding of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 25-30%) with anteroseptal and apical akinesia and inferior hypokinesia, urgent coronary angiography was performed, there were no signs of coronary artery disease, and the suspected diagnosis was Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. Soon after admission heart failure therapy was introduced, and follow-up echocardiography showed improvement in LVEF (40-45%). Patient was given no specific antiviral treatment nor corticosteroid therapy. Additional work-up regarding serology for cardiotropic viruses came negative, and IgG antibodies for Covid-19 showed borderline result. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 18 days after initial event described recovered left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 53%), with mild hypokinesia, oedema and mid-wall late gadolinium enhancement in apical 2/3 of anterior, anteroseptal and anterolateral wall, with pattern characteristic for myocarditis (Figure 1)4. At follow-up, one month after discharge, patient is completely recovered, without signs of heart failure or arrhythmias, with preserved LVEF and normal NTproNBP levels. Conclusion: This case once again highlights cardiac complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, without respiratory involvement. Also, it shows good prognosis without specific antiviral treatment, emphasizing importance of early introduction of heart failure therapy.

RECENT FINDINGS Recently, with the increasing availability of data on the structure of interindividual and interinstitution networks, models incorporating this type of information have been proposed, with the aim of providing more realistic predictions of disease transmission in healthcare settings. Models incorporating realistic data on individual or facility networks often remain limited to a few settings and a few pathogens (mostly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).

First-trimester primary EVTs in which HLA-C is highly expressed, as well as JEG3, an EVT model cell line, were employed. Single-cell RNA-seq data and quantitative PCR identified high expression of the transcription factor ELF3 in those cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR confirmed that both ELF3 and MED1 bound to the proximal HLA-C promoter region. However, binding of RFX5 to this region was absent or severely reduced, and the adjacent HLA-B locus remained closed. Expression of HLA-C was inhibited by ELF3 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and by wrenchnolol treatment. Wrenchnolol is a cell-permeable synthetic organic molecule that mimics ELF3 and is relatively specific for binding to ELF3s coactivator, MED23, as our data also showed in JEG3. Moreover, the ELF3 gene is regulated by a superenhancer that spans more than 5 Mb, identified by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), as well as by its sensitivity to (+)-JQ1 (inhibitor of BRD4).

In other viral infections, cognitive impairment occurs due to brain damage or dysfunction caused by vascular lesions and inflammatory processes. Persistent cognitive impairment compromises daily activities and psychosocial adaptation. Some level of neurological and psychiatric consequences were expected and described in severe cases of COVID-19. However, it is debatable whether neuropsychiatric complications are related to COVID-19 or to unfoldings from a severe infection. Nevertheless, the majority of cases recorded worldwide were mild to moderate self-limited illness in non-hospitalized people. Thus, it is important to understand what are the implications of mild COVID-19, which is the largest and understudied pool of COVID-19 cases. We aimed to investigate adults at least four months after recovering from mild COVID-19, which were assessed by neuropsychological, ocular and neurological tests, immune markers assay, and by structural MRI and 18FDG-PET neuroimaging to shed light on putative brain changes and clinical correlations. In approximately one-quarter of mild-COVID-19 individuals, we detected a specific visuoconstructive deficit, which was associated with changes in molecular and structural brain imaging, and correlated with upregulation of peripheral immune markers. Our findings provide evidence of neuroinflammatory burden causing cognitive deficit, in an already large and growing fraction of the world population.

Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December, 2019. Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 1,5 million people and caused the death of more than a hundred thousand people across the globe as of writing. Recently, Mao et al. [1] investigated the penetration potential of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system in 214 patients. They reported that 36.4% of the patients had some neurologic findings which are ranged from nonspecific manifestations, e.g., dizziness, headache, and seizure, to specific manifestations, e.g., loss of sense of smell or taste, and stroke. Whether these common symptoms in their patients are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known. However, it is important to mention here that dramatic neurologic symptoms, i.e., depressed level of consciousness, seizure, and stroke, are common in the patients at the late stage of the disease, accounting for increased mortality rate in severely affected patients. Nevertheless, to objectively delve into the direct relation between the neurologic symptoms and COVID-19, medical comorbidities of patients should also be considered [2]. Further studies are needed because we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, and neurologists may be confronted with new-onset neurologic symptoms owing to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates via human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2) that was also utilized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) [3]. Glial cells and neurons have been reported to express ACE-2 receptors, which make them a potential target of COVID-19. It was indicated that SARS CoV causes neuronal death by invading the brain via olfactory epithelium [4]. The electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription- PCR findings have corroborated the presence of SARS-CoV in the brain tissue [4] and cerebrospinal fluid [5]. Together, it can be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain by penetrating the brain via the cribriform plate, which can account for the early findings of the COVID-19 like altered sense of smell or hyposmia. Because SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory symptoms in people aged 60 years and older, it has important implications for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [6]. Therefore, in the countries that have taken action to the virus, clinic studies of AD have been stopped to protect the patients. However, rigorous quarantine of elders has aborted clinic trials and experimental studies conducted with transgenic animals. Transgenic models are quite expensive; the loss of these animals has costly consequences. There is no doubt that this storm will stop, but its catastrophic effects on dementia research will continue for a time. Thus, dementia researchers and pharmaceutical companies should determine an emergency action plan to exit the chaos of this pandemic. Here, we listed some challenges in dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak and table some suggestions. All countries try to control SARS-CoV-2 by social distancing. Therefore, neurology clinics were closed, and routine examination of Alzheimer's patients was stopped. However, the lockdown of patients with AD caused clinical studies to stop. which has severely affected dementia research. Additionally, the arrest of experimental studies due to the closing of universities in two hundred countries also deprives experimental achievements. The closing of universities may lead to data loss, death of expensive transgenic animals, international researchers to be faced with visa problems, and be lost the laboratory staff whose contract has expired [7]. It is impossible that forecasting when this COVID-19 pandemic will end is impossible and thus, it is essential that a solution be developed to continue dementia studies on Alzheimer's patients. Remote monitoring of the patients with the use of technology is in the lead of possible solutions. Clinicians can continue to follow their patients by telemedicine [8], but extended lockdown of patients may cause depression in both patients and their caregivers [9]. It is also known that movement restriction exacerbates AD symptoms [10]. The monitorization of the patient in this condition with telemedicine would not provide objective data. In addition, when patients living in rural areas are considered, it will not be a surprise that reaching equally all patients is impossible. Therefore, a collective action plan protecting dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak should be prepared by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, clinicians, and patients. Data loss is in the lead of expected problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, the planned ending dates of phase 2/3 trials of gantenerumab (Roche) and solanezumab (Lilly) were missed [11]. It is highly essential that patients be monitored from their homes with telemedicine to protect them. Nonetheless, it is not sufficient for the continuation of clinical trials and experimental studies. We suggest that patients of phase trails should be isolated in fully-equipped nursing homes managed by qualified personnel. In this way, the patients can be more effectively protected from SARS-CoV-2 and the depression caused by the lockdown.Young family members going out for basic needs could infect older family members. Also, patients with AD pay less attention to hand hygiene, which makes them more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, cats have recently been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Patients with AD may not follow directions of neurologists on telemedicine and thus, the interaction of Alzheimer's patients with pets can cause a dangerous scenario. Consequently, the lockdown of patients with dementia in their homes might not be an appropriate exit strategy for the future of dementia research. On the other hand, it is important to mention here that the nursing home capacity of the United States may not be sufficient for 5,8 million Alzheimer's patients aged 65 years and older [13]. Thus, we highlight that only the patients involved in the clinic trails should be followed in the nursing homes. The other patients can be monitored with telemedicine from their homes. The data will hardly be lost in patients isolated in nursing homes. In this strategy, secondary risk factors affecting the clinic trails like depression are also removed. The motivations of clinicians and researchers is as important as the patients in the catastrophic atmosphere of the outbreak. Governments, media, and funders can support the motivations of clinicians and researchers. For example, research funders and pharmaceutical companies can extend project deadlines and provide an additional promotion to the researchers who have completed their clinic trails. Consequently, a global action plan should be prepared to block SARS-CoV-2 penetration to dementia research. At first glance, it may be thought that the most appropriate strategy for patients with dementia is social isolation in their homes during the outbreak as in healthy young people and elders. However, we suggest that isolating patients with dementia in fully-equipped nursing homes can be a more appropriate exit strategy for the protection of dementia patients and research.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is penetrating to dementia research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated the short-term effects of mitigation measures imposed by the Italian government on the first 10 municipalities affected by Sars-Cov-2 spread.

MethodsWe conducted a matched case-control (1:1) study (10 April-9 July 2021). Cases (HCWs with confirmed COVID-19) and controls (HCWs without any COVID-19-positive test or symptoms) recruited by email were invited to complete an online questionnaire on their exposures and PPE use. Questions covered the 10 days preceding symptom onset for cases (or testing if asymptomatic) or inclusion for controls. ResultsA total of 4152 matched cases and controls were included. The multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis retained exposure to an infected person outside work (adjusted odds ratio, 19.9 [95% confidence intervaI, 12.4-31.9]), an infected colleague (2.26 [1.53-3.33]) or COVID-19 patients (2.37 [1.66-3.40]), as independent predictors of COVID-19 in HCWs, while partial or complete immunization was protective. Eye protection (0.57 [0.37-0.87]) and wearing a gown (0.58 [0.34-0.97]) during COVID-19 patient care were protective, while wearing an apron slightly increased the risk of infection (1.47 [1.00-2.18]).

Thirty rabbit eyes were injected with the DEX/LAP formulation (15 suprachoroid / 15 intravitreous). Ophthalmological signs were monitored at day 1 and at weeks 1-4-12-24 post-administration. Three eyes per sample time point were used to quantify DEX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ocular tissues' pharmacokinetic parameters (lens, vitreous humour, choroid-retina unit and sclera) were studied. DEX/LAP was well tolerated under both administration methods. Peak intraocular DEX levels from the DEX/LAP were detected in the vitreous humour after both deliveries soon after administration. The vitreous area under the curve was significantly greater after both DEX/LAP deliveries (intravitreal: 205968.47; suprachoroidal: 11442.22 ng/g*day) than after intravitreal administration of the DEX solution (317.17 ng/g*day). Intravitreal DEX/LAP delivery extended higher vitreous DEX levels up to week 24 (466.32  311.15 ng/g). With suprachoroidal delivery, DEX levels were detectable in the choroid-retina unit (12.04  20.85 ng/g) and sclera (25.46  44.09 ng/g) up to week 24. This study demonstrated the intraocular feasibility of both suprachoroidal and intravitreal administration of the DEX/LAP formulation.

How to systematically understand the complex interaction mechanism between human microbes and drugs remains a challenge nowadays. Identifying microbe-drug associations can not only provide great insights into understanding the mechanism, but also boost the development of drug discovery and repurposing. Considering the high cost and risk of biological experiments, the computational approach is an alternative choice. However, at present, few computational approaches have been developed to tackle this task. RESULTS: In this work, we leveraged rich biological information to construct a heterogeneous network for drugs and microbes, including a microbe similarity network, a drug similarity network, and a microbe-drug interaction network. We then proposed a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based framework for predicting human Microbe-Drug Associations, named GCNMDA. In the hidden layer of GCN, we further exploited the Conditional Random Field (CRF), which can ensure that similar nodes (i.e., microbes or drugs) have similar representations. To more accurately aggregate representations of neighborhoods, an attention mechanism was designed in the CRF layer. Moreover, we performed a random walk with restart (RWR) based scheme on both drug and microbe similarity networks to learn valuable features for drugs and microbes respectively. Experimental results on three different datasets showed that our GCNMDA model consistently achieved better performance than seven state-of-the-art methods. Case studies for three microbes including SARS-CoV-2 and two antimicrobial drugs (i.e., Ciprofloxacin and Moxifloxacin) further confirmed the effectiveness of GCNMDA in identifying potential microbe-drug associations.

However, barriers that influence the effective implementation of public health measures were not explore in Ethiopia especially in study Area. Therefore, this study tried to fill this gap by exploring the barriers to effective implementation of public health measures for prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Gamo Zone of southern Ethiopia. METHODS: The study employed a qualitative study with a phenomenology approach among purposely selected 30 individuals in the community and selected institutions. Key informant interview was used to collect the data. The data were transcribed verbatim and translated into the English language. The transcribed data were read several times to clearly understand the content for further analysis. The analysis of the data was conducted based on the modified Tanahashi framework. RESULTS: The study identified different barriers under five main themes: accessibility, acceptability, availability, contact and use, and effective implementation of public health measures related to barriers. The main barriers to effective implementation of public health measures were resistance to change, negligence, lack of community engagement, insufficient training for front line workers, poor supportive supervision, poor law enforcement, and lack of continuous community awareness creation. Beside, acceptability related barriers like cultural and religious norms and availability related barriers like shortage of personal protective equipment and shortage of skilled health professional have also lion share barriers for implementation of the public health measures. CONCLUSION: The study identified different personal, institutional, and societal level barriers for effective implementation of public health measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, proper and targeted continuous community awareness creation with further mandatory law enforcement activities should be implemented by the concerned bodies to mitigate individual and societal level barriers.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With millions of operations cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, pressure is mounting to reopen and increase surgical activity. The risk of admitting patients who have silent SARS-Cov-2 infection to surgery is not well investigated, but surgery on patients with COVID-19 is associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to model the risk of operating on non-symptomatic infected individuals and associated risk of perioperative adverse outcomes and death. METHODS: We developed two sets of models to evaluate the risk of admitting silent COVID-19-infected patients to surgery. A static model let the underlying infection rate (R rate) and the gross population-rate of surgery vary. In a stochastic model, the dynamics of the COVID-19 prevalence and a fixed population-rate of surgery was considered. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 90% uncertainty limits. The modelling was applied for high-income regions (e.g. United Kingdom (UK), USA (US) and European Union without UK (EU27), and for the World (WORLD) based on the WHO standard population. RESULTS: Both models provided concerning rates of perioperative risk over a 24-months period. For the US, the modelled rates were 92000 (UI 68000 to 124000) pulmonary complications and almost 30000 deaths (UI 22000 to 40000), respectively; for Europe, some 131000 patients (UI 97000 to 178000) with pulmonary complications and close to 47000 deaths (UI 34000 to 63000) were modelled. For the UK, the model suggested a median daily number of operations on silently infected ranging between 25 and 90, accumulating about 18700 (UI 13700 to 25300) perioperative pulmonary complications and 6400 (UI 4600 to 8600) deaths. In high-income regions combined, we estimated around 259000 (UI 191000 to 351000) pulmonary complications and 89000 deaths (UI 65000 to 120000). For the WORLD, even low surgery rates estimated a global number of 12 million pulmonary complications and 350000 deaths. CONCLUSION: The model highlights a considerable risk of admitting patients with silent COVID-19 to surgery with an associated risk for adverse perioperative outcomes and deaths. Strategies to avoid excessive complications and deaths after surgery during the pandemic are needed.","output":"A Risk Model of Admitting Patients with Silent SARS-CoV-2 Infection to Surgery and Development of Severe Postoperative Outcomes and Death: Projections Over 24 Months for 5 Geographical Regions"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:A}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/14.md","filePath":"doctor/14.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/14.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
