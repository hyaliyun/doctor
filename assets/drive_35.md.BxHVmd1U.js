Secondary objectives were to determine the frequency, characteristics, and most commonly cited reasons reported for missed items. DESIGN: Retrospective diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING: 16 inpatient rehabilitation facilities in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive clinical sample of 4,256 patients with stroke or other neurological deficits who were assessed for spatial neglect with the KF-NAP. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Catherine Bergego Scale via KF-NAP. RESULTS: The majority (69.7%) of patients had at least one missed item on their KF-NAP. Among those with missed items, it was most common to have two missed items (51.4%) and few had more than three missed items (11.3%). The most commonly missed items were Collisions (37.2%), Cleaning After Meals (36.1%), Meals (34.0%), and Navigation (19.7%). The most commonly reported reasons for missed items included time constraints, cognitive or communication deficits, and behavior or refusal of the therapy session. These reasons were reported for nearly all item types. Item-specific reasons were also commonly reported, such as a lack of a needed resource for task completion or low functional status of the patient. Prorated scoring of measures with up to three missed items maintained an acceptable level of concordance with complete measures (Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficienta?=a?0.96, 95% CIa?=a?0.9478-0.9626) for the combination of three missed items with lowest concordance. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should make every effort to capture all items on the KF-NAP. However, missed items occur in the majority of cases due to patient factors and barriers inherent to the inpatient hospital setting. When missed items are necessary, clinicians can confidently interpret a prorated score when seven or more items are scored.","output":"The Effect of Missed Items on the Reliability of the Kessler Foundation Neglect Assessment Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beginning in December of 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in China and is now a global pandemic with extensive morbidity and mortality. With the emergence of this threat, an unprecedented effort to develop vaccines against this virus began. As vaccines are now being introduced globally, we face the prospect of millions of people being vaccinated with multiple types of vaccines many of which use new vaccine platforms. Since medical events happen without vaccines, it will be important to know at what rate events occur in the background so that when adverse events are identified one has a frame of reference with which to compare the rates of these events so as to make an initial assessment as to whether there is a potential safety concern or not. Background rates vary over time, by geography, by sex, socioeconomic status and by age group. Here we describe two key steps for post-introduction safety evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines: Defining a dynamic list of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) and establishing background rates for these AESI.

Therefore, the first aim of this study was to document the population knowledge on wild edible plants among the Messiwa people. The second objective was to assess the traditional knowledge of our informants according to their socio-economic status. METHODS: The survey was conducted among 149 informants through a semi-structured questionnaire. The relative importance of the plants was obtained by calculating the relative frequency of citation (RFC) for each species. To compare means, we used Student's t test for two-group comparisons and Snedecor's F-test for multi-group comparisons. The multi-range Duncan test was used for multiple mean comparisons. The correspondence factor analysis (CFA) was also used. RESULTS: A set of 64 species belonging to 56 genera from 34 families has been collected and identified. The species used for nutritional and medicinal purposes represent 56%, while 44% were used exclusively as nutritional plants. The most used parts are, respectively, the aerial parts (58%), the fruits (17%), the underground parts (13%), the seeds (8%), and finally the flowers (5%). On the other hand, the higher level of knowledge on wild edible plants was found among women, the elderly, illiterate, married people, and those engaged in agricultural occupations.

BACKGROUND: Due to increasing ED visits annually, an efficient work environment has become one of the main concerns in designing EDs. According to the literature, an efficient work environment and teamwork improve healthcare outcomes and positively impact staff satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, EDs faced various changes such as workflow and space usage. Few studies explored staff perceptions about the influence of design features on efficiency, teamwork, and the COVID-19 spread. METHOD: An online survey with 14 open- and closed-ended questions was distributed among ED staff members to collect data about unit design features that impact efficiency, teamwork, and the COVID-19 spread. RESULTS: The central nursing station was one of the preferred configurations that increased efficiency and teamwork in EDs. Decentralizing disposal rooms in small-size EDs and decentralizing the medication room in large-size EDs with more than 65 exam rooms can decrease staff walking steps. Flexibility to expand treatment spaces on demand, one-way track circulation path, and changing the air pressure in COVID-19 treatment areas were some of the staff suggestions for future EDs. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge that EDs' physical environments can impact efficiency and teamwork among staff and, consequently, healthcare outcomes.

With the increasing accessibility of technology, a \\"flipped classroom\\" allows students to learn foundational material independently. Class time is instead devoted to in-depth skill building with instructors, promoting an active learning environment. This method of content delivery is also relevant given the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES To comprehensively evaluate the benefit of adopting a flipped classroom approach in teaching physical exam skills (PES) to first-year osteopathic medical students. METHODS A cohort study was conducted comparing first-year osteopathic students in the class of 2022 (n=201), who had taken the PES course traditionally, with the class of 2023 (n=203), who experienced the flipped classroom approach. Objective metrics such as cumulative grades, objective structural clinical examination performance (OSCE), and practical exam performance were compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U rank sum tests. Subjective measures such as student course evaluations were used to analyze course perceptions using independent sample t-tests assuming unequal variances. A faculty survey was administered to faculty who taught both cohorts to assess instructor attitudes toward the flipped classroom approach. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Spring 2020 quarter data was not included, given the transition of all classes to an online learning environment. RESULTS The flipped classroom approach significantly improved objective student performance for the Fall (p=0.009) and Winter (p<0.001) student cumulative grades and the History-Taking OSCE (p=0.010). Performance on Fall and Winter practical exam scores had no significant association with the flipped classroom. General student perceptions of the course remained unchanged between both cohorts. Faculty survey results from 10 faculty members showed that six (60%) faculty members preferred the traditional classroom, while four (40%) preferred the flipped classroom. CONCLUSIONS The flipped classroom approach showed some statistically significant improvement in student PES. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of a flipped classroom approach using skills-based assessments styles to measure student performance, with a focus on standardization of in-classroom groupwork.","output":"The flipped classroom: a novel approach to physical examination skills for osteopathic medical students."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between 16 May and 15 August 2020, seven highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N8) virus outbreaks were reported in Europe in poultry, with one outbreak reported in Bulgaria(n=1) andsix in Hungary (n=6) and one low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5N3) virus outbreak was reported in poultry in Italy.

The significance of the expansion and diversification of RhlE-like proteins for bacterial fitness has not yet been established.

We show that, in the course of evolution, RhlE1 and RhlE2 have diverged in their biological functions, molecular partners and RNA-dependent enzymatic activities. Whereas RhlE1 is mainly needed for growth in the cold, RhlE2 also acts as global post-transcriptional regulator, affecting the level of hundreds of cellular transcripts indispensable for both environmental adaptation and virulence. The global impact of RhlE2 is mediated by its unique C-terminal extension, which supports the RNA unwinding activity of the N-terminal domain as well as an RNA-dependent interaction with the RNase E endonuclease and the cellular RNA degradation machinery. Overall, our work reveals how the functional and molecular divergence between two homologous RNA helicases can contribute to bacterial fitness and pathogenesis.","output":"The DEAD-box RNA helicase RhlE2 is a global regulator of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lifestyle and pathogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are vital to reducing the transmission risks. However, the relative efficiency of social distancing against COVID-19 remains controversial, since social distancing and isolation/quarantine were implemented almost at the same time in China. METHODS: In this study, surveillance data of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in the year 2018-2020 were used to quantify the relative efficiency of NPIs against COVID-19 in China, since isolation/quarantine was not used for the influenza epidemics. Given that the relative age-dependent susceptibility to influenza and COVID-19 may vary, an age-structured Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model was built to explore the efficiency of social distancing against COVID-19 under different population susceptibility scenarios. RESULTS: The mean effective reproductive number, R(t), of COVID-19 before NPIs was 2.12 (95% confidential interval (CI): 2.02-2.21). By March 11, 2020, the overall reduction in R(t) of COVID-19 was 66.1% (95% CI: 60.1%-71.2%). In the epidemiological year 2019/20, influenza transmissibility reduced by 34.6% (95% CI: 31.3%-38.2%) compared with that in the epidemiological year 2018/19. Under the observed contact patterns changes in China, social distancing had similar efficiency against COVID-19 in three different scenarios. By assuming same efficiency of social distancing against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 transmission, isolation/quarantine and social distancing could lead to a 48.1% (95% CI: 35.4%-58.1%) and 34.6% (95% CI: 31.3%-38.2%) reduction of the transmissibility of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Though isolation/quarantine is more effective than social distancing, given that typical basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is 2-3, isolation/quarantine alone could not contain the COVID-19 pandemic effectively in China.","output":"Different transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and influenza suggest the relative efficiency of isolation/quarantine and social distancing against COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19, an ongoing global pandemic, is one of the major reasons for the current disruption in the field of health and education.

This collection of virus databases illustrates a greater diversity of purpose, but reveals they often function to support only one or a few virus families grouped by a common theme. The common characteristic is usually genome size as small RNA viruses are typically sequenced in vastly greater numbers and are much less complex than the large DNA viruses; they have variability at the level of SNPs rather than gene presence/absence.

Therefore, we created a new surgical technique of combination retroperitoneal with transperitoneal (CRT) laparoscopic nephroureterectomy (LNU) in a single position and here report our early outcomes. Methods: From January 2017 to December 2019, a total of 106 patients underwent LNU by a single surgeon at our department, of whom 50 patients underwent standard technique and 56 patients underwent CRT technique. Relevant clinical data were collected including each patient's characteristics, surgical outcomes, and follow-up results. A comparative analysis between standard LNU cases and CRT LNU cases was performed. Results: LNU was performed successfully on all 106 patients. There was no significant difference in patients' characteristics. Compared to the standard group, patients in the CRT group had shorter operative time (P=0.001), less estimated blood loss (EBL) (P<0.001), lower visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score (P=0.020) and less scarring (P=0.013). The median time of surgical drain stay decreased from 5 to 2 days (P=0.004) and median hospital stay after surgery decreased from 5 to 3 days (P=0.001). The complication rates did not show statistical differences between the two groups within the first 30 days postoperatively (P=0.263). For the long-term complications, the incidence of abdomen bulge or incisional hernia in the CRT group was less than that in the standard group (P<0.001).

To enable meaningful clinical decisions to be made, robustly evaluated, quantitative serology methods are needed. These should be harmonized to a primary reference material, allowing for the comparison of trial data and improved clinical decision making.

METHODS This prospective observational trial was conducted in an academic medical center. After institutional review board approval, 100 mechanically ventilated subjects were enrolled. A stand-alone respiratory monitor that measures IPI was placed on subjects before starting a spontaneous breathing trial and continued for up to 48 h postextubation.

Mixed-effects regression models were employed to examine differences in IPI patterns between subjects with extubation success or failure. Significant IPI changes from baseline were then evaluated to predict extubation outcome. RESULTS IPI was successfully recorded on 62 subjects (48 successful and 14 failed extubations). Although mean IPI 5 min before and after extubation were not significantly different, mean IPI 1 h after extubation in the failure group was significantly lower by 1.19 (P = .044) compared with the successful group. Negative change in IPI 1 h after extubation increased odds of failure (odds ratio = 1.57, 95% CI 1.001-2.454). The last mean IPI recorded after extubation was also significantly lower in the failure group compared with the successful group by 3.03 (P < .001). Negative change in the last measured IPI increased odds of failure (odds ratio = 1.72, 95% CI 1.26-2.34). CONCLUSIONS Declining IPI measurements postextubation are predictive of extubation failure. Further clinical trials are needed to assess the role of IPI in guiding interventions in extubated patients.","output":"Role of Integrated Pulmonary Index in Identifying Extubation Failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Social inequalities in health have been linked to disproportional impacts in COVID-19 mortality.

METHODS: Between 2012 and 2013, the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III) conducted semi-structured interviews with 36,309 adults in the USA. We identified lifetime suicide attempt prevalence and significant predictors for each racial/ethnic group using stratified logistic regressions. Analyses were exploratory without a priori hypotheses. RESULTS: Asian/Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander and Black individuals had the lowest prevalence of suicide attempts while Alaska Native/American Indian and White individuals had the highest prevalence. Identifying as female and meeting criteria for psychiatric diagnoses featuring mood regulation difficulties (depression, borderline personality disorder, bipolar I disorder) were consistently related to a suicide attempt history across racial and ethnic groups, whereas substance abuse disorders and other sociodemographic factors differed between racial and ethnic groups in their associations with suicide attempt history. CONCLUSIONS: Although several factors were consistently related to suicide risk across racial and ethnic groups, the prevalence of suicide attempts and overall pattern of related factors were not uniform between racial and ethnic groups. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Study findings highlight the importance of considering suicide risk within the context of race and ethnicity both regarding the overall prevalence of risk and in determining personal factors associated with elevated risk. A failure to appreciate experiences related to race and ethnicity may adversely impact suicide risk assessment and treatment, ultimately contributing to health disparities.

The findings revealed that the elevated concentration of surfactants and their degraded products disrupt microbial dynamics and their important biogeochemical processes, hinder plant-surviving processes and their ecological niche, and retard the human organic and systemic functionalities. The enormous adverse effects of surfactants on health and the environment necessitate the need to develop, select, and advance the various analytical and assessment techniques to achieve effective identification and quantification of several surfactants in different environmental matrices. Considering the presence of surfactants in trace concentration and environmental matrices, excellent analysis can only be achieved with appropriate extraction, purification, and preconcentration. Despite these pre-treatment procedures, the chromatographic technique is the preferred analytical technique considering its advancement and shortcomings of other techniques. In the literature, the choice or selection of remediation techniques for surfactants depends largely on eco-friendliness, cost-implications, energy requirements, regeneration potential, and generated sludge composition and volume. Hence, the applications of foam fractionation, electrochemical advanced oxidation processes, thermophilic aerobic membranes reactors, and advanced adsorbents are impressive in the clean-up of the surfactants in the environment.

We examined adverse events (AE) following vaccination with 4vHPV from 11 years of post-marketing data, focusing on a period of enhanced surveillance and adverse events of special interest (AESI). METHODS AE following 4vHPV doses administered between April 2007 and December 2017 reported to Australia's national regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, were examined; reports collected during enhanced surveillance in 2013 and 2014 were analyzed separately. Age and sex-specific rates, using denominator data from the national HPV vaccination register, were determined. Pre-specified AESI were identified using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA?) Preferred Terms and examined in detail. FINDINGS Following nine million doses of 4vHPV vaccine administered in Australia, 4551 AE reports were identified. The crude reporting rate was 39.8 per 100 000 doses in the funded cohorts, excluding the enhanced surveillance period. The reported rate of syncope in 12 to 13-year-old males and females was 29.6 per 100 000 doses during enhanced surveillance and 7.1 per 100 000 doses during the remaining study period; rates of syncope were higher in younger compared to older adolescents. The rate of anaphylaxis (0.32 per 100 000 doses) was consistent with published rates. Other AESI including autoimmune disease, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, Guillain-Barr syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome and venous thromboembolism, were reported at low rates and analysis did not reveal unexpected patterns that would suggest causal association. INTERPRETATION AESI, apart from syncope, were reported rarely. The higher rate of syncope among younger adolescents highlights the need for management protocols to prevent syncope-related injury. Analysis of this large, longitudinal dataset in a country with high vaccine uptake, including a period of enhanced surveillance, affirms the safety profile of 4vHPV.","output":"Adverse events following HPV vaccination: 11 years of surveillance in Australia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diverse health care leadership teams may improve health care experiences and outcomes for patients. We sought to explore the race and gender of hospital and health ministry executives in Canada and compare their diversity with that of the populations they serve. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included leaders of Canadas largest hospitals and all provincial and territorial health ministries. We included individuals listed on institutional websites as part of the leadership team if a name and photo were available. Six reviewers coded and analyzed the perceived race and gender of leaders, in duplicate. We compared the proportion of racialized health care leaders with the race demographics of the general population from the 2016 Canadian Census. RESULTS: We included 3056 leaders from 135 institutions, with reviewer concordance on gender for 3022 leaders and on race for 2946 leaders. Reviewers perceived 37 (47.4%) of 78 health ministry leaders as women, and fewer than 5 (< 7%) of 80 as racialized. In Alberta, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, provinces with a centralized hospital executive team, reviewers coded 36 (50.0%) of 72 leaders as women and 5 (7.1%) of 70 as racialized. In British Columbia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, provinces with hospital leadership by region, reviewers perceived 120 (56.1%) of 214 leaders as women and 24 (11.5%) of 209 as racialized. In Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, where leadership teams exist at each hospital, reviewers perceived 1326 (49.9%) of 2658 leaders as women and 243 (9.2%) of 2633 as racialized. We calculated the representation gap between racialized executives and the racialized population as 14.5% for British Columbia, 27.5% for Manitoba, 20.7% for Ontario, 12.4% for Quebec, 7.6% for New Brunswick, 7.3% for Prince Edward Island and 11.6% for Newfoundland and Labrador. INTERPRETATION: In a study of more than 3000 health care leaders in Canada, gender parity was present, but racialized executives were substantially under-represented.

Methods: Due to the difficulty of accessing electronic health record data in general and in the midst of a global pandemic, and due to the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we propose mining the extensive biomedical literature for treatments to SARS that may also then be appropriate for COVID-19. In particular, we propose a method of mining a large biomedical word embedding for FDA approved drugs based on drug-disease treatment analogies. Results: We first validate that our method correctly identifies ground truth treatments for well-known diseases. We then use our method to find several approved drugs that have been suggested or are currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 in our top hits and present the rest as promising leads for further experimental investigation.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of nature video viewing on isometric exercise and find a useful practice for green exercise in urban living. In the current study, 18 male subjects were recruited in a randomized crossover trial and underwent a sequence of wall squat exercises. The whole experiment contained three periods of baseline (before exercise), exercise, and recovery (after exercise), and each period lasted for 2 min. A video of forest walking was played in the exercise and recovery periods as treatment, while a black screen was set as control. The Rate of Perceived Exertion Scale (RPE) and Feeling Scale (FS) were employed to measure perceived exertion and affective responses in the exercise period; heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) including the standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals (SDNN), the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and the standard deviations of the Poincar plot (SD1), were recorded in the three periods. Heart rate recovery (HRR) in the recovery period was further calculated based on 30 s and 60 s time frames. Results demonstrated that during the exercise period nature video viewing was associated with better affective responses (median of 1.00 and an interquartile (IQR) of 2.00, p = 0.017), lower perceived exertion (median = 6.00, IQR = 2.00, p = 0.021), and lower HR (median = 89.60, IQR = 20.94, p = 0.01), but the differences in HRV indices between the experimental settings were not statistically significant. In the recovery period, significantly higher values of RMSSD (median = 34.88, IQR = 24.52, p = 0.004), SD1 (median = 24.75, IQR = 17.41, p = 0.003), and HR (median = 84.18, IQR = 16.58, p = 0.001) were observed in the treatment setting, whereas no statistically significant difference was found for HRR. In general, our findings support that nature video viewing may help reduce perceived exertion, increase exercise pleasure, buffer heart rate, and improve cardiac autonomic recovery for wall squat exercising, which implies the potential of nature-based stimuli in green exercise. However, due to the limited research sample, further study may need to include female participants and focus on various populations to confirm the effectiveness of using virtual and environments depicting nature at home or in public exercise places to promote positive exercise experience.","output":"Green Exercise: Can Nature Video Benefit Isometric Exercise?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cities in regions including the Middle East can use a variety of approaches to promote wellbeing among the people who live and work there despite dryness and heat, write Maya Negev and colleagues","output":"City design for health and resilience in hot and dry climates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults are a rapidly growing patient population with unique characteristics and health considerations.

It is unclear if the coagulation abnormalities occur because of the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 or indirectly by the cytokine storm and endothelial damage or by a combination of mechanisms. There is a clear indication of in-hospital pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for every patient with COVID-19 after bleed risk assessment. However, there is much debate regarding the best dosage regimen, and there is no consensus on the role of extended thromboprophylaxis. DESIGN: This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily for 354 days versus no intervention after hospital discharge in COVID-19 patients who were at increased risk for VTE and have received standard parenteral VTE prophylaxis during hospitalization. The composite efficacy endpoint is a combination of symptomatic VTE, VTE-related death, VTE detected by bilateral lower limbs venous duplex scan and computed tomography pulmonary angiogram on day 354 post-hospital discharge and symptomatic arterial thromboembolism (myocardial infarction [MI], non-hemorrhagic stroke, major adverse limb events [MALE] and cardiovascular [CV] death) up to day 354 post-hospital discharge.

Recently, diverse mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in United Kingdom (Alpha) and South Africa (Beta) strains which raise concerns over the potential increase in binding affinity towards the host cell receptor and diminished host neutralization capabilities. In order to study the effect of mutation in the binding efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with anti-SARS-CoV/CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we have produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD and two variants SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Alpha RBD and Beta RBD) in Nicotiana benthamiana by transient expression. Plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc, Alpha RBD-Fc and Beta RBD-Fc exhibited specific binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor determined by ELISA. Intriguingly, the binding of plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins to plant-produced mAbs CR3022, B38, and H4 was found to be different depending on the variant mutation. In contrary to the plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc and Alpha RBD-Fc, Beta RBD-Fc variant showed weak binding affinity towards the mAbs.

Subjects underwent test sessions one week before (T0) and one day after (T1) a six-session training period and a retention test session a week later (T2). During each test session, the Kinovea version 0.8.15 software measured the kinematic parameters of the snatch performance. Following distance learning sessions (T1), the VF-PA improved various kinematic parameters (i.e., barbell horizontal displacements, maximum height, looping and symmetry) compared with T0 (p < 0.5; Cohen's d = 0.58-1.1). Most of these improvements were maintained during the retention test (T2) (p<0.01, Cohen's d = 1.2-1.3) when compared withT0.

METHOD: Data were from 215 Black adults (188 recruited from Milwaukee, WI; 27 recruited from across the continental US) and 985 white adults (7 recruited from Milwaukee, WI; 978 recruited from across the continental US) who completed the baseline interview and biomarker assessment during the second wave of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) Study (ages = 34-84). SES life course trajectories were examined using latent class analysis based on objective (e.g., income and education) and subjective (e.g., social status and financial strain) indicators of SES. The association between life course SES trajectories and daily discrimination with markers of inflammation (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen) were examined using multiple linear regression analyses, controlling for demographic, psychological, behavioral, and health-related covariates. RESULTS: Black and white participants showed different patterns of life course SES trajectories. Among Black participants, the trajectories were Objectively Stable Low (45.16%), Downwardly Mobile (18.05%), and Upwardly Mobile (36.79%). Compared to the Upwardly Mobile, the Objectively Stable Low class showed elevated IL-6 after controlling for all covariates. Further, daily discrimination, but not SES trajectories, was significantly associated with CRP and fibrinogen after controlling for demographic, psychological, and behavioral covariates. White participants' experiences of life course SES trajectories were characterized as Objectively Stable Low (7.02%), Subjectively Downward (12.48%), Upwardly Mobile (39.99%), and Stable High (40.51%).

The spironolactone plus ACEI/ARB group included 570 patients, while the ACEI/ARB group included 547 patients. Treatment with spironolactone and ACEI/ARB combination therapy compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone increased the mean serum potassium concentration by 0.19 mEq/L (95% CI, 0.12-0.26 mEq/L), with intermediate heterogeneity across studies (Q statistic = 46.5, P = 0.004; I 2 = 59). Sensitivity analyses showed that the direction and magnitude of this outcome did not change with the exclusion of individual studies, indicating a high level of reliability. Reporting risk of bias was low for 16 studies (80%), unclear for 3 studies (15%) and high for 1 study (5%). CONCLUSION: Treatment with spironolactone in combination with ACEI/ARB therapy increases the mean serum potassium concentration by less than 0.20 mEq/L compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone. However, serum potassium and renal function must be monitored in patients starting combination therapy to avoid changes in serum potassium that could lead to hyperkalemia.","output":"Serum potassium changes due to concomitant ACEI/ARB and spironolactone therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strategic Human Resources Management is one of the concepts of how HR management should be carried out in the organization The strategic HRM approach shows how the organization's goals will be achieved through competent individuals through various HR strategies and integrating HR policies and practices Consequently, HR professionals must understand various activities that have strategic value However, various studies have shown that human resources have not optimized achieving performance at the organizational level Various factors become a black box in determining the extent to which HR can contribute strategically Creativity and innovation, including the ability to act fast and agile, become imperative for an organization to survive It is all in the hands of employee that exist in the organization The Covid-19 pandemic event is momentum for all HR professionals to rethink the extent to which the organization's HR system has been strategic ? 2021 Karadeniz Technical University All rights reserved","output":"Strategic human resources management and organizational performance: A literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>This study aims to compare many artificial neural network (ANN) methods to find out which method is better for the prediction of Covid19 number of cases in N steps ahead of the current time.

DESIGN A multicentre randomised controlled trial was performed in 29 centres in The Netherlands and the UK. Adult patients with Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum who failed >3 months of conventional immunomodulators or steroids without signs of critical strictures were randomised to laparoscopic ileocaecal resection or infliximab. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on the EuroQol (EQ) 5D-3L Questionnaire and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Costs were measured from a societal perspective. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated to show uncertainty. RESULTS In total, 143 patients were randomised. Mean Crohn's disease total direct healthcare costs per patient at 1 year were lower in the resection group compared with the infliximab group (mean difference -8931; 95% CI -12 087 to -5097). Total societal costs in the resection group were lower than in the infliximab group, however not statistically significant (mean difference -5729, 95% CI -10 606 to 172). The probability of resection being cost-effective compared with infliximab was 0.96 at a willingness to pay (WTP) of 0 per QALY gained and per point improvement in IBDQ Score.

Experimental validation of the GH-LCD spectrum and iris contrast (determined to be 1:2.1) enabled the development of optical models that include the effect of a small pupil on image quality and visual quality on an optical system with aniridia characteristics. Visual simulations at different light conditions (high/low photopic and mesopic) demonstrated the theoretical capacity of the customized artificial iris smart contact lens to expand the depth-of-focus and decrease the optical aberrations (in particular, the spherical aberration). The visual modelling suggests a maximum depth-of-focus value for a 2-mm pupil diameter for both eyes as follows: 3D (1,000 cd/m2), 2D (10 cd/m2) and 0.75D (1 cd/m2).

Determining infection rate is difficult due to the limits on testing and the high rate of asymptomatic individuals. Detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may be useful for determining prior exposure to the virus and assessing mitigation strategies, such as isolation, masks, and other protective equipment. METHODS: An online assessment that included demographic, clinical, and exposure information and a blood sample was collected from 20,614 participants out of ~43,000 total employees at Beaumont Health, which includes eight hospitals distributed across the Detroit metropolitan area in southeast Michigan. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined using the EUROIMMUN assay. RESULTS: A total of 1,818 (8.8%) participants were seropositive between April 13 and May 28, 2020. Among the seropositive individuals, 44% reported that they were asymptomatic during the month prior to blood collection. Healthcare roles such as phlebotomy, respiratory therapy, and nursing/nursing support exhibited significantly higher seropositivity. Among participants reporting direct exposure to a COVID-19 positive individual, those wearing an N95/PAPR mask had a significantly lower seropositivity rate (10.2%) compared to surgical/other masks (13.1%) or no mask (17.5%).

Both areas are concerned with a broad range of issues such as curriculum strategies, coaching, mental well-being of students, learning motivation, and academic achievement. The COVID-19 pandemic highly disrupted the higher education sector and shifted the old, chalk-talk teaching-learning model to an online learning format. This meant that the structure and nature of teaching, learning, assessment, and feedback methodologies also changes. With the empowerment in technology, timely and effective feedback is provided by the teachers to achieve greater learning. Through these studies, it is noted that negative feedback discourages the effort and achievement of learners, so it should be carefully crafted and delivered. In this work, a new methodology is planned based on an improved FCN (fully connected network).

As of April 22, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take its toll, with >2.6 million confirmed infections and >183,000 deaths. Dire projections are surfacing almost every day, and policymakers worldwide are using projections for critical decisions. Given this background, we modeled unobserved infections to examine the extent to which we might be grossly underestimating COVID-19 infections in North America. METHODS: We developed a machine-learning model to uncover hidden patterns based on reported cases and to predict potential infections. First, our model relied on dimensionality reduction to identify parameters that were key to uncovering hidden patterns. Next, our predictive analysis used an unbiased hierarchical Bayesian estimator approach to infer past infections from current fatalities. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that, when we assumed a 13-day lag time from infection to death, the United States, as of April 22, 2020, likely had at least 1.3 million undetected infections. With a longer lag time-for example, 23 days-there could have been at least 1.7 million undetected infections. Given these assumptions, the number of undetected infections in Canada could have ranged from 60,000 to 80,000. Duarte's elegant unbiased estimator approach suggested that, as of April 22, 2020, the United States had up to >1.6 million undetected infections and Canada had at least 60,000 to 86,000 undetected infections. However, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data feed on April 22, 2020, reported only 840,476 and 41,650 confirmed cases for the United States and Canada, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified 2 key findings: (1) as of April 22, 2020, the United States may have had 1.5 to 2.029 times the number of reported infections and Canada may have had 1.44 to 2.06 times the number of reported infections and (2) even if we assume that the fatality and growth rates in the unobservable population (undetected infections) are similar to those in the observable population (confirmed infections), the number of undetected infections may be within ranges similar to those described above.

Objectives: To summarize our 13-year experience in the design of multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps for extensive head and neck defect reconstruction, with vascular supercharge and flap prefabrication, either solely or in combination. To discuss the strategy for judicious selection between these techniques in the design of multipedicle flaps at different donor sites. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective study was performed in patients with severe head and neck deformities and treated with multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps between May 2005 and May 2018. Intraoperative indocyanine green angiography was utilized for visualization of flap perfusion and analysis of the hemodynamics of pre-existing perforator and prefabricated vessels. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes measured were (1) features of deformities, (2) multipedicle flap designs, and (3) postoperative complications and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Results: Seventy-five multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps were harvested, including 44 supercharged, 26 prefabricated, and 5 tripedicle, combining both techniques, with sizes ranging from 22  12 to 45  27 cm2. Hemodynamic analysis demonstrated slower arterial inflow (0.60  0.29 U/s vs. 2.65  1.29 U/s, p < 0.05) and venous outflow (0.10 U/s vs. 0.23  0.11 U/s) in prefabricated vessels, compared to the pre-existing perforator, namely the internal mammary arterial perforator. Partial necroses were observed in three patients with only one requiring skin grafting. The aesthetic and functional outcomes were satisfying after reconstruction. Conclusions and Relevance: Multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps fabricated by vascular supercharge and flap prefabrication, either solely or in combination in various donor sites, are powerful reconstructive tools for extensive head and neck defects. For a more reliable design, vascular supercharging should be considered a priority strategy, and flap prefabrication an alternative when suitable supercharging vessels are unavailable.","output":"Augmentation of Perforator Flap Blood Supply with Sole or Combined Vascular Supercharge and Flap Prefabrication for Difficult Head and Neck Reconstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks from international travellers, many countries currently use a combination of up to 14 days of self-quarantine on arrival and testing for active infection. We used a simulation model of air travellers arriving to the UK from the EU or the USA and the timing of their stages of infection to evaluate the ability of these strategies to reduce the risk of seeding community transmission. We find that a quarantine period of 8 days on arrival with a PCR test on day 7 (with a 1-day delay for test results) can reduce the number of infectious arrivals released into the community by a median 94% compared to a no quarantine, no test scenario. This reduction is similar to that achieved by a 14-day quarantine period (median 99% reduction). Shorter quarantine periods still can prevent a substantial amount of transmission; all strategies in which travellers spend at least 5 days (the mean incubation period) in quarantine and have at least one negative test before release are highly effective (e.g. a test on day 5 with release on day 6 results in a median 88% reduction in transmission potential). Without intervention, the current high prevalence in the US (40 per 10,000) results in a higher expected number of infectious arrivals per week (up to 23) compared to the EU (up to 12), despite an estimated 8 times lower volume of travel in July 2020. Requiring a 14-day quarantine period likely results in less than 1 infectious traveller each entering the UK per week from the EU and the USA (97.5th percentile). We also find that on arrival the transmission risk is highest from pre-symptomatic travellers; quarantine policies will shift this risk increasingly towards asymptomatic infections if eventually-symptomatic individuals self-isolate after the onset of symptoms. As passenger numbers recover, strategies to reduce the risk of re-introduction should be evaluated in the context of domestic SARS-CoV-2 incidence, preparedness to manage new outbreaks, and the economic and psychological impacts of quarantine.","output":"Strategies to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-introduction from international travellers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is the most recent coronavirus-related disease that has been announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

In creating these new formulations, the paradigm of drug development target should be introduced. Biological targets relating to the nature of addiction may pose insurmountable hurdles based on our current knowledge and technology, but products that use behavioral targets seem logical and feasible. The population of opioid abusers is large and diverse so behavioral targets are more challenging than they appear at first glance. Furthermore, we need to find ways to correlate behavioral observations of drug liking to actual use and abuse patterns. This may involve revisiting some pharmacodynamic concepts in light of drug effect rather than peak concentration.

Methods: Over the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) was administered to a total of 5,928 adults distributed proportionally from across the United States during independent online cross-sectional surveys collected each month. Data across the 6-month period were compared between those under lockdown versus those not under such restrictions. Results: BPAQ Total Aggression scores showed a significant main effect for both month and lockdown status as well as a significant interaction effect, with increasing scores evident for those reporting that they were under lockdown relative to those reporting no restrictions. This same pattern was evident for all four subscales of the BPAQ, including Physical Aggression, Verbal Aggression, Anger, and Hostility. Limitations: Random sampling of the entire population was not possible, so generalization of the results should be made with caution. Additionally, data were collected cross-sectionally and cannot be considered to reflect longitudinal change within individuals. Finally, the cross-sectional survey design means that it is impossible to infer that the lockdowns caused the increase in aggression. Conclusions: Lockdowns were associated with elevated levels of aggression that were higher in later months of the national pandemic response.","output":"Increasing Aggression During the COVID-19 Lockdowns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has influenced the majority of firms around the world.

MethodsAntibody and cytokine responses were assessed in 263 patients with either solid tumors (SOT, n=63), multiple myeloma (MM, n=70) or inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, n=130) undergoing various immunosuppressive regimens and from 66 healthy controls before the first and the second, as well as four weeks and 5-6 months after the second mRNA vaccine dose with either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. FindingsFour weeks after the second dose, seroconversion was lower in cancer than in IBD patients and controls, with the highest non-responder rate in MM patients (17.1%). S1-specific IgG levels correlated with neutralizing antibody titers. While antibody responses correlated with cellular responses in controls and IBD patients, IFN-{gamma} and antibody responses did not in SOT and MM patients. At six months, 19.6% of patients with MM and 7.3% with SOT had become seronegative, while IBD patients and controls remained seropositive in 96.3% and 100%, respectively. Vaccinees receiving mRNA-1273 presented higher antibody levels than those vaccinated with BNT162b2. InterpretationCancer patients may launch an inadequate seroresponse in the immediate time range following vaccination and up to six months, correlating with vaccine-specific cellular responses. These findings propose antibody testing in immunosuppressed - along with cellular testing - provides guidance for administration of additional vaccine doses, or may indicate the necessity for antibody treatment. IBD patients respond well to the vaccine, but treatment such as with TNF- inhibitors may reduce persistence of immune responses.

Numerous researches on CRM have made significant progress in several areas such as telecommunications, banking, and manufacturing, but research specific to the healthcare environment is very limited. This systematic review aims to categorise, summarise, synthesise, and appraise the research on CRM in the healthcare environment, considering the absence of coherent and comprehensive scholarship of disparate data on CRM. Various databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search of studies that examine CRM in the healthcare environment (including hospitals, clinics, medical centres, and nursing homes). Analysis and evaluation of 19 carefully selected studies revealed three main research categories: (i) social CRM eCRM; (ii) implementing CRMS; and (iii) adopting CRMS; with positive outcomes for CRM both in terms of patients relationship/communication with hospital, satisfaction, medical treatment/outcomes and empowerment and hospitals medical operation, productivity, cost, performance, efficiency and service quality. This is the first systematic review to comprehensively synthesise and summarise empirical evidence from disparate CRM research data (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed) in the healthcare environment. Our results revealed that substantial gaps exist in the knowledge of using CRM in the healthcare environment. Future research should focus on exploring: (i) other potential factors, such as patient characteristics, culture (of both the patient and hospital), knowledge management, trust, security, and privacy for implementing and adopting CRMS and (ii) other CRM categories, such as mobile CRM (mCRM) and data mining CRM.","output":"Customer relationship management systems (CRMS) in the healthcare environment: A systematic literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess feasibility, patient satisfaction, and financial advantages of telemedicine for epilepsy ambulatory care during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The demographic and clinical characteristics of all consecutive patients evaluated via telemedicine at a level 4 epilepsy center between March 20 and April 20, 2020 were obtained retrospectively from electronic medical records. A telephone survey to assess patient satisfaction and preferences was conducted within one month following the initial visit. RESULTS: Among 223 telehealth patients, 85.7% used both synchronous audio and video technology. During the visits, 39% of patients had their anticonvulsants adjusted while 18.8% and 11.2% were referred to laboratory/diagnostic testing and specialty consults, respectively. In a post-visit survey, the highest degree of satisfaction with care was expressed by 76.9% of patients. The degree of satisfaction tended to increase the further a patient lived from the clinic (p = 0.05). Beyond the pandemic, 89% of patients reported a preference for continuing telemedicine if their epilepsy symptoms remained stable, while only 44.4% chose telemedicine should their symptoms worsen. Inclement weather and lack of transportation were factors favoring continued use of telemedicine. An estimated cost saving to patient attributed to telemedicine was $30.20  3.8 per visit. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that epilepsy care via telemedicine provided high satisfaction and economic benefit, without compromising patients quality of care, thereby supporting the use of virtual care during current and future epidemiological fallouts.

Researchers want to get robust gene expression signature from pan-cancer patients. But there is large variance in cancer patients due to heterogeneity. To get robust results, the sample size will be too large to recruit. In this study, we tried another approach to get robust pan-cancer biomarkers by using the cell line data to reduce the variance. We applied several advanced computational methods to analyze the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) gene expression profiles which included 988 cell lines from 20 cancer types. Two feature selection methods, including Boruta, and max-relevance and min-redundancy methods, were applied to the cell line gene expression data one by one, generating a feature list. Such list was fed into incremental feature selection method, incorporating one classification algorithm, to extract biomarkers, construct optimal classifiers and decision rules. The optimal classifiers provided good performance, which can be useful tools to identify cell lines from different cancer types, whereas the biomarkers (e.g. NCKAP1, TNFRSF12A, LAMB2, FKBP9, PFN2, TOM1L1) and rules identified in this work may provide a meaningful and precise reference for differentiating multiple types of cancer and contribute to the personalized treatment of tumors.","output":"Identification of Pan-Cancer Biomarkers Based on the Gene Expression Profiles of Cancer Cell Lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gastric cancer (GC) is the second most common cancer cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.

All are of sarbecoviruses of the genus Betacoronavirus. We have unravelled their recombinational and mutational histories. All showed clear evidence of recombination, most events involving the 3 half of the genomes. The 5 region of their genomes was mostly recombinant free, and a phylogeny calculated from this region confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is closer to RmYN02 than RaTG13, and showed that SARS-CoV-2 diverged from RmYN02 at least 26 years ago, and both diverged from RaTG13 at least 37 years ago; recombinant regions specific to these three viruses provided no additional information as they matched no other Genbank sequences closely. Simple pairwise comparisons of genomes show that there are three regions where most non-synonymous changes probably occurred; the DUF3655 region of the nsp3, the S gene and ORF 8 gene. Differences in the last two of those regions have probably resulted from recombinational changes, however differences in the DUF3655 region may have resulted from selection.

The study aims to collect the patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) survey of patients discharged during the COVID-19 pandemic and their family caregivers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patients aged 18 years, hospitalised between 28 February and 11 May 2020 and then discharged home, plus their family caregivers will be invited to complete a self-administrated questionnaire made up of 14 closed questions and 1 open-ended question. The questionnaire will include items on the patients hospital trajectory and assess the interpersonal trust placed in nurses and physicians based on Krajewska-Ku?ak et als Trust in Nurse Scale and Anderson et als Trust in Physician Scale. Participants perceived stress will be assessed using Cohen et als Perceived Stress Scale. Feelings of safety will be examined based on Dryhurst et als questionnaire on Risk Perception During Pandemics.

Most papers were small-scale descriptive studies, service evaluations or audits. The papers reported mainly on clinical aspects of the ACP role. Most papers related to nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy and radiography roles and these were referred to by a plethora of different titles. ACP roles were reported to be achieving beneficial impacts across a range of clinical and health system outcomes. They were highly acceptable to patients and staff. No significant adverse events were reported. There was a lack of cost-effectiveness evidence. Implementation challenges included a lack of role clarity and an ambivalent role identity, lack of mentorship, lack of continuing professional development and an unclear career pathway. CONCLUSION: This review suggests a need for educational and role standardisation and a supported career pathway for advanced clinical practitioners (ACPs) in the UK. Future research should: (i) adopt more robust study designs, (ii) investigate the full scope of the ACP role and (iii) include a wider range of professions and sectors.","output":"Characterising the outcomes, impacts and implementation challenges of advanced clinical practice roles in the UK: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Six new triterpene saponins (1C5,7) and 3 known saponins (6,8,9) were isolated from MeOH extracts of the cactus Stenocereus pruinosus.

It has not yet been extensively investigated which psychological changes the corona pandemic has brought about in Germany. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to systematically investigate loneliness before and during the corona pandemic in Germany. The research questions were as follows: (1) How lonely do people feel before and during the corona pandemic? (2) How many people feel lonelier since the beginning of the corona pandemic? (3) How many people are affected in their subjective health due to limitations following the corona pandemic? MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2019 (before the corona pandemic) 1003 adults were interviewed and in 2020 (during the corona pandemic) 1050 adults were assessed. Both surveys were conducted online and were representative for Germany (51% women; age 18C90 years). RESULTS: In all, 10.8% vs. 26.6% of Germans felt lonely on two or more days per week before the corona pandemic vs. during the pandemic. Singles, women and younger respondents felt lonely more often in both surveys. Since the corona pandemic, 30.8% felt lonelier, especially younger individuals. Furthermore, 18.9% reported severely impaired health. Feeling more affected was related to younger age, various fears and more frequent perception of loneliness. CONCLUSION: Increasing loneliness and social isolation as well as various fears should be considered in further infection control measures. In general, overcoming loneliness in younger individuals and those living alone should be supported by building adequate coping skills that help to reduce impairments and fears.","output":"Einsam(er) seit der Coronapandemie: Wer ist besonders betroffen?

Globally, extraordinary measures are being adopted to combat the formidable spread of the ongoing outbreak. Under such conditions, people's adherence to preventive measures is greatly affected by their awareness of the disease. Aim: This study was aimed to assess the level of awareness and preparedness to fight against COVID-19 among the healthcare workers (HCWs) and other residents of the South-West Saudi Arabia. Methods: A community-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted using a self-developed structured questionnaire that was randomly distributed online among HCWs and other residents (age  12 years) of South-West Saudi Arabia for feedback. The collected data were analyzed using Stata 15 statistical software. Results: Among 1,000 participants, 36.7% were HCWs, 53.9% were female, and 44.1% were aged  30 years. Majority of respondents showed awareness of COVID-19 (98.7%) as a deadly, contagious, and life-threatening disease (99.6%) that is transmitted through human-to-human contact (97.7%). They were familiar with the associated symptoms and common causes of COVID-19. Health organizations were chosen as the most reliable source of information by majority of the participants (89.6%). Hand hygiene (92.7%) and social distancing (92.3%) were the most common preventive measures taken by respondents that were followed by avoiding traveling (86.9%) to an infected area or country and wearing face masks (86.5%). Significant proportions of HCWs (P < 0.05) and more educated participants (P < 0.05) showed considerable knowledge of the disease, and all respondents displayed good preparedness for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Age, gender, and area were non-significant predictors of COVID-19 awareness. Conclusion: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the awareness and preparedness of the targeted community members, especially the less educated ones. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach the targeted residents beyond borders and further measures are warranted. The outcome of this study highlighted a growing need for the adoption of innovative local strategies to improve awareness in general population related to COVID-19 and its preventative practices in order to meet its elimination goals.","output":"Awareness and Preparedness of COVID-19 Outbreak Among Healthcare Workers and Other Residents of South-West Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The aim of this study is to compare surgical, functional, physiologic outcomes and QOL after low anterior resection (LAR) with andside-to-end or straight colorectal anastomosis.

Wexner score, number of defecations, use of antidiarrheal medicine or laxatives, enemas, pads, episodes of nocturnal incontinence, and urgency were recorded. The Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL) scale was used for assessment of QOL. Anal manometry and volumetric examination were performed. RESULTS Six patients were excluded from the study. There was no mortality. The morbidity rate was 6 (14.6 %) for side-to-end vs. 8 (20.0 %) for straight anastomosis (p = 0.57). The median Wexner score was 5 vs. 6 (p = 0.033), 4 vs. 5 (p = 0.006), and 2 vs. 3 (p = 0.1) at 1, 3, and 6 months after stoma reversal, respectively. Side-to-end anastomosis resulted in a fewer mean numbers of bowel movements per day at the same check points of follow-up: 5.8  0.14 vs. 6.4  0.15 (p = 0.006), 3.7  0.1 vs. 4.2  0.1 (p = 0.003), and 2.5  0.1 vs. 3.0  0.10 (p = 0.0002), correspondingly.

AMI is characterized by an acute onset with potentially fatal consequence, a short optimal treatment window, and frequent complications including respiratory infections and respiratory and circulatory failure, for which active on-site treatment is essential. To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation. For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients. During this special period, the cardiologists, including the interventional physicians, should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of thrombolysis.

Of particular and growing concern are shortages of allied health professionals (AHPs). This study explored the contextual factors impacting the recruitment and retention of AHPs in rural Australia. A qualitative approach using a constructivist-interpretivist methodology was taken. Semi-structured interviews (n = 74) with executive staff, allied health (AH) managers and newly recruited AHPs working in two rural public health services in Victoria, Australia were conducted. Data was coded and categorised inductively and analysed thematically. The findings suggest that to support a stable and sustainable AH workforce, rural public sector health services need to be more efficient, strategic and visionary. This means ensuring that policies and procedures are equitable and accessible, processes are effective, and action is taken to develop local programs, opportunities and supports that allow AH staff to thrive and grow in place at all grade levels and life stages. This study reinforces the need for a whole-of-community approach to effectively support individual AH workers and their family members in adjusting to a new place and developing a sense of belonging in place. The recommendations arising from this study are likely to have utility for other high-income countries, particularly in guiding AH recruitment and retention strategies in rural public sector health services.

As one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions for preventing infectious diseases, immunization against SARS-CoV-2, is at the moment the most effective strategy for controlling the current pandemic. Despite the high vaccine acceptance rates that countries such as Costa Rica have shown in the past, the public acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine is still uncertain. The purpose of this study was to examine adults willingness to get a novel COVID-19 vaccine and its potential predictors in Costa Rica. We conducted a cross-sectional study comprising a sample of 4717 adult participants living in Costa Rica who participated in a voluntary electronic survey regarding their intent to get a future COVID-19 vaccine. Results suggest that a high percentage (86.1%) of Costa Ricans aged 18 or more would be willing to be vaccinated once a safe and effective vaccine is approved and distributed in the country. Some relevant significant predictors of willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine in Costa Rica were higher income, being male, work in the health care sector, and having a relative or a close acquaintance diagnosed with COVID-19.

In the context of cancer therapeutics, plasticity refers to transient fluctuations in the molecular state of tumor cells, driving the formation of rare cells primed to survive drug treatment and ultimately reprogram into a stably resistant fate. However, the biological processes governing this cellular plasticity remain unknown. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screens to reveal genes that affect cell fate decisions by altering cellular plasticity across a range of functional categories. We found that cellular plasticity and cell fate decision making can be decoupled in that factors can affect cell fate decisions in both plasticity-dependent and independent manners. We discovered a novel mode of altering resistance based on cellular plasticity that, contrary to known mechanisms, pushes cells towards a more differentiated state. We further confirmed our prediction that manipulating cellular plasticity before the addition of the main therapy would result in changes in therapy resistance more than concurrent administration. Together, our results indicate that identifying pathways modulating cellular plasticity has the potential to alter cell fate decisions and may provide a new avenue for treating drug resistance.","output":"Genetic screening for single-cell variability modulators driving therapy resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the relevance of public health professionals all over the world, in particular Environmental Health Practitioners (EHPs), who played a major role in the containment of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.

Additionally, due to limited resources, during emergencies EHPs may temporarily transition away from their day-to-day role, potentially increasing other public health and safety risk factors without appropriate surveillance or intervention. To overcome this and prepare for possible future pandemics, it is important to identify and discuss the key roles of EHPs in different countries, providing a common framework for practices that can contribute to population safety and health. To this end, an international workgroup was established to discuss current environmental health practices and challenges across different countries during the pandemic. Findings from discussions concluded that, despite the observed differences across the countries, EHPs are one of the main public health emergency preparedness and response actors.

We aim to review Blue Book compliance during the Covid-19 crisis and review outcomes of hip fractures, including Covid-19 infection rates. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed IHFD data to collection demographic data, IHFD standards of care, 30-day mortality rates and complications between 23rd March and 20th May 2020 and 2019. Covid-19 rates in 2020 were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 36 hip fractures were recorded in 2020, compared with 45 in 2019, resulting in a 20% reduction in presentations. Thirty-day mortality in hip fractures during the Covid-19 crisis was 8.3% compared with 2.2% in 2020. Covid-19 infection was statistically associated with 30-day mortality in the 2020 cohort.

COVID-19, as a pandemic, has led many researchers from different biomedical fields to find solutions or treatments to manage the pandemic. However, no standard treatment for this disease has been discovered to date. Probably, preventing the severe acute respiratory infection form of COVID-19 as the most dangerous phase of this disease can be helpful for the treatment and reduction of the death rate. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based immunomodulation treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach and several clinical trials have begun. Recently, MSCs according to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties attract attention in clinical trials. After the intravenous transplantation of MSCs, a significant population of cells accumulates in the lung, which they alongside immunomodulatory effect could protect alveolar epithelial cells, reclaim the pulmonary microenvironment, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and cure lung dysfunction. Given the uncertainties in this area, we reviewed reported clinical trials and hypotheses to provide useful information to researchers and those interested in stem cell therapy. In this study, we considered this new approach to improve patient's immunological responses to COVID-19 using MSCs and discussed the aspects of this proposed treatment.

Monitoring viral transmission and disease characteristics as the disease spreads globally is vital. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and source of infection in patients with secondary transmission of COVID-19 outside the outbreak area. METHODS The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data of five patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were treated in the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University (Ningxia, China) from 1 January 2020 to 1 March 2020 were presented. The final follow-up evaluation was performed on 12 March 2020. RESULTS The five participants included two couples and a young woman, none of whom had visited Hubei. It was likely that four of the participants had been infected by exposure to asymptomatic visitors from Wuhan. The other participant lived in a densely-populated community with potential COVID-19 cases. A variety of symptoms were presented by four participants, including cough, fevers, sputum, breathlessness, chest pain, fatigue, sore limbs, sore throats, headaches, and rhinorrhea. A severe infection, with dyspnea and decreased oxygen saturation, was experienced by one participant who had a history of chronic bronchitis. A single participant was asymptomatic, but had ground-glass opacities (GGOs) on chest imaging. Another two participants also displayed GGOs. Lymphopenia was noted in three participants.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were intoxicated with a single oral dose of NHPA (1000 mg/kg) and treated with Curc (200 mg/kg p. o.) and/or Lip acid (100 mg/kg i. p.). These treatments were given in 2 doses at 2 hours and 10 hours post-NHPA-administration. Animals were sacrificed 24 hours post-NHPA-administration. RESULTS: Treatment with Curc and/or Lip acid showed effective reduction of NHPA-induced liver injury, demonstrated by reducing serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, as well as hepatic nitric oxide and malondialdehyde. Curc and/or Lip acid treatments counteracted these changes. They also ameliorated NHPA-induced centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis, evidenced by histopathological examination. Moreover, Curc and Lip acid reduced the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen III, upregulated by NHPA intoxication in response to oxidative stress and inflammation.

It considers four scenariosvarying in both the duration of school closures and the effectiveness of any mitigation strategies being deployed by governments. Using data on 174 countries, the analysis finds that the global level of schooling and learning will fall substantially. School closures could result in a loss of between 0.3 and 1.1 years of schooling adjusted for quality, bringing down the effective years of basic schooling that students achieve during their lifetime from 7.8 years to between 6.7 and 7.5 years. Close to 11 million students from primary up to secondary education could drop out due to the income shock of the pandemic alone. Exclusion and inequality will likely be exacerbated if already marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as girls, ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities, are more adversely affected by school closures. Students from the current cohort could, on average, face a reduction of $366 to $1,776 in yearly earnings. In present value terms, this amounts to between $6,680 and $32,397 dollars in lost earnings over a typical student's lifetime. Globally, a school shutdown of 5 months could generate learning losses that have a present value of $10 trillion. By this measure, the world could stand to lose as much as 16 percent of the investments that governments make in the basic education of this cohort of students. In the pessimistic and very pessimistic scenarios, cumulative losses could add up to between $16 and $20 trillion in present value terms.

Molecular disorders derived from COVID-19, as well as their clinical symptoms, can be considered potential risk factors for the development of enamel defects. Individuals with enamel defects experienced high stress levels during pregnancy or early childhood.

Nevertheless, predicting power law phenomena is notoriously difficult because some of its idiosyncratic properties such as lack of well-defined average value, and potentially unbounded variance.

Associated surveillance of S. aureus transmission quantifies the effectiveness of the basic measures to prevent the transmission to patients and clinicians of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To measure transmission, the observational units are pairs of successive surgical cases in the same operating room on the same day. We evaluated appropriate sample sizes and strategies for measuring transmission. There was absence of serial correlation among observed counts of transmitted isolates within each of several periods (all P &#8805;.18). Similarly, observing transmission within or between cases of a pair did not increase the probability that the next sampled pair of cases also had observed transmission (all P &#8805;.23). Most pairs of cases had no detected transmitted isolates. Also, although transmission (yes/no) was associated with surgical site infection (P =.004), among cases with transmission, there was no detected dose response between counts of transmitted isolates and probability of infection (P =.25). The first of a fixed series of tests is to use the binomial test to compare the proportion of pairs of cases with S. aureus transmission to an acceptable threshold. An appropriate sample size for this screening is N =25 pairs. If significant, more samples are obtained while additional measures are implemented to reduce transmission and infections. Subsequent sampling is done to evaluate effectiveness. The two independent binomial proportions are compared using Boschloo's exact test. The total sample size for the 1st and 2nd stage is N =100 pairs.

RECENT FINDINGS Minimally invasive surgery has become a standard of care for the treatment of many benign and malignant gynaecological conditions. Recent advances in conventional laparoscopy and robotic-assisted surgery have favorably impacted the entire spectrum of gynaecological surgery. With the goal of improving morbidity and cosmesis, continued efforts towards refinement of laparoscopic techniques have lead to minimization of size and number of ports required for these procedures. LESS surgery is a recently proposed surgical term used to describe various techniques that aim at performing laparoscopic surgery through a single, small-skin incision concealed within the umbilicus. In the last 5 years, there has been a surge in the developments in surgical technology and techniques for LESS surgery, which have resulted in a significant increase in utilisation of LESS across many surgical subspecialties. Recently published outcomes data demonstrate feasibility, safety and reproducibility for LESS in gynaecology. The contemporary LESS literature, extent of gynaecological procedures utilising these techniques and limitations of current technology will be reviewed in this manuscript. CONCLUSIONS LESS surgery represents the newest frontier in minimally invasive surgery. Comparative data and prospective trials are necessary in order to determine the clinical impact of LESS in treatment of gynaecological conditions.","output":"Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery in gynaecology: A new frontier in minimally invasive surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Common symptoms of pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) include fever and cough.

Exercise has the potential to improve overall health in several diseases, but evidence remains scant in c-TA. The main objective of this study was to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic effects of exercise in c-TA. Methods This was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, to test the effects of a home-based, exercise intervention vs. standard of care in c-TA patients in remission. The primary outcomes were arterial inflammation, assessed by [18F] FDG- PET/MRI and systemic inflammatory markers. Secondary outcomes included, physical activity levels, functionality, body composition, disease-related parameters, and quality of life. Results Thirty-seven patients were assessed for eligibility, which represents the total number of c-TA patients being followed by the three specialized medical ambulatory services in Sao Paulo. After exclusions, fourteen c-TA patients (71.4% females) aged 12-25 years were randomly allocated into exercised (n=5) and non-exercised groups (n=9). Exercise did not exacerbate arterial inflammation. In fact, exercised patients had a reduction in the frequency of vessel segments with severe inflammation, whereas the non-exercised patients had an opposite response (P=0.007). Greater improvements in visceral fat, steps per day, functionality and physical component SF-36 were observed in the exercised patients (P  0.05). Conclusions Exercise is safe and may improve visceral fat, physical activity levels, functionality, and physical component SF-36 in c-TA patients. Thus, exercise arises as a novel, evidence-based intervention to improve general health in c-TA.

SUMMARY ANSWER There is insufficient evidence to conclude EM yields a difference in the resolution of tubal EP, the avoidance of surgery or time to resolution of tubal EP when compared to intramuscular methotrexate in stable patients with -hCG <1500 IU/l. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN The utilisation of medical and surgical management for EP is well established. EM aims to allow spontaneous resolution of the EP without intervention. STUDY DESIGN SIZE AND DURATION We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, OpenGrey.eu, Google Scholar, cross-referencing citations and trial registries to 15 December 2019. There were no limitations placed on language or publication date. Search terms included tubal EP and EM as well as variations of these terms. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING AND METHOD We considered studies that included patients with tubal EP, EM as a comparator, and that were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was resolution of tubal EP. Secondary outcomes included avoidance of surgery and the time to resolution of EP. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, assessed bias and extracted data. Relative risk (RR) and mean difference with 95% CI were assessed using a random effects model. The certainty of evidence was scored according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In total, 920 studies were screened. Five studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Two RCTs comparing methotrexate to EM were identified as being eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis. No RCTs comparing surgery to EM were identified. Compared with EM, there was insufficient evidence that methotrexate yields a difference on resolution of tubal EP (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.88-1.23, P = 0.67; two RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence), avoiding surgery (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.94-1.29, P = 0.25; two RCTs, low-certainty evidence) or the time to resolution of tubal EP (-2.56 days (favouring EM), 95% CI -7.93-2.80, P = 0.35; two RCTs, low-certainty evidence). LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION Only two RCTs with a total of 103 patients were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Further RCTs comparing EM to medical and surgical management are needed and these should also report adverse events. Patient preference should also be evaluated. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS We found insufficient evidence of differences in terms of resolution, avoidance of surgery and time to resolution between expectant and medical management. Given the imprecision in the effect estimates as demonstrated by the wide CIs, resulting in the downgrading of certainty of evidence for all outcomes in this meta-analysis, larger RCTs comparing interventions for tubal EP are needed. Caution should be exercised when trying to decide between EM and methotrexate to treat tubal EP. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS There was no funding for this study.

This study aimed to identify practice patterns and knowledge gaps in CPF management. Methods: To understand the perspectives of colorectal surgeons (CRS) managing patients with CPF, we developed a case-based survey related to management of initial presentation and recurrence of CPF. Surveys were distributed online during Sep/Oct 2020 to US CRS experienced with CPF (1 CPF patient/month). Results: Seventy-eight CRS responses were collected. In patients who initially presented with fistula, there was no standardized approach for CPF evaluation or classification. While the majority (71%) chose seton plus medical management as initial intervention, there was no standard approach to seton removal. No consensus existed on preferred medical/surgical treatment in patients with a partial biologic response or for recurrent fistula. CRS prioritized long-term CPF goals of improved QoL and avoiding major surgery/preserving continence, while fistula healing had the lowest priority. COVID-19 did not have a major effect on patient management. Barriers to optimal CPF management were perceived to be lack of effective medical therapies, poor surgical outcomes/complication risks, patient reluctance, delayed referral/diagnosis, and lack of guidelines/treatment algorithms. Significant barriers to multidisciplinary management included lack of access to CPF specialists and treatment plan communication, and difficulty coordinating care between specialists/centers. A lack of familiarity exists with newer/potential treatments. Conclusion: There is no consensus on how to best manage CPF.

Internet users frequently search for health information online, although the accuracy of the information retrieved varies greatly and can be misleading. Newspapers have the potential to influence public health behaviours, but information has been lacking in relation to how newspapers portray online health information to their readers. METHODS: The newspaper database Nexis(?)UK was searched for articles published from 2003 C 2012 relating to online health information. Systematic content analysis of articles published in the highest circulation newspapers in the UK and US was performed. A second researcher coded a 10% sample to establish inter-rater reliability of coding. RESULTS: In total, 161 newspaper articles were included in the analysis. Publication was most frequent in 2003, 2008 and 2009, which coincided with global threats to public health. UK broadsheet newspapers were significantly more likely to cover online health information than UK tabloid newspapers (p = 0.04) and only one article was identified in US tabloid newspapers. Articles most frequently appeared in health sections. Among the 79 articles that linked online health information to specific diseases or health topics, diabetes was the most frequently mentioned disease, cancer the commonest group of diseases and sexual health the most frequent health topic. Articles portrayed benefits of obtaining online health information more frequently than risks. Quotations from health professionals portrayed mixed opinions regarding public access to online health information. 108 (67.1%) articles directed readers to specific health-related web sites. 135 (83.9%) articles were rated as having balanced judgement and 76 (47.2%) were judged as having excellent quality reporting. No difference was found in the quality of reporting between UK and US articles. CONCLUSIONS: Newspaper coverage of online health information was low during the 10-year period 2003 to 2012. Journalists tended to emphasise the benefits and understate the risks of online health information and the quality of reporting varied considerably. Newspapers directed readers to sources of online health information during global epidemics although, as most articles appeared in the health sections of broadsheet newspapers, coverage was limited to a relatively small readership.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether naturally occurring RBD mutations during the early transmission phase have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, we first analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Among 32,123 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (December 2019 through March 2020), 302 nonsynonymous RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 96 mutant types. The six dominant mutations were analyzed applying molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). The mutant type V367F continuously circulating worldwide displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2 due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The MDS also indicated that it would be difficult for bat SARS-like CoV to infect humans. However, the pangolin CoV is potentially infectious to humans. The increased infectivity of V367 mutants was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F+D614G), which may derivate from recombination. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of early SARS-CoV-2 variants of zoonotic origin under negative selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. IMPORTANCE A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused the pandemic of COVID-19. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with zoonotic infections. The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is identified as the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. Thus, whether mutations in the RBD of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates have altered the receptor binding affinity and made them more infectious has been the research hot spot. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, the significance of our research is in identifying and validating the RBD mutant types emerging during the early transmission phase and increasing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding affinity and infectivity. Our study provides insights into the evolutionary trajectory of early SARS-CoV-2 variants of zoonotic origin. The continuing surveillance of RBD mutations with increased human ACE2 affinity in human or other animals is critical to the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines against these variants during the sustained COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"V367F Mutation in SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD Emerging during the Early Transmission Phase Enhances Viral Infectivity through Increased Human ACE2 Receptor Binding Affinity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The unprecedented worldwide social distancing response to COVID-19 resulted in a quick reversal of escalating case numbers. Recently, local governments globally have begun to relax social distancing regulations. Using the situation in Manitoba, Canada as an example, we estimated the impact that social distancing relaxation may have on the pandemic. METHODS: We fit a mathematical model to empirically estimated numbers of people infected, recovered, and died from COVID-19 in Manitoba. We then explored the impact of social distancing relaxation on: (a) time until near elimination of COVID-19 (< one case per million), (b) time until peak prevalence, (c) proportion of the population infected within one year, (d) peak prevalence, and (e) deaths within one year. RESULTS: Assuming a closed population, near elimination of COVID-19 in Manitoba could have been achieved in 4-6 months (by July or August) if there were no relaxation of social distancing. Relaxing to 15% of pre-COVID effective contacts may extend the local epidemic for more than two years (median 2.1). Relaxation to 50% of pre-COVID effective contacts may result in a peak prevalence of 31-38% of the population, within 3-4 months of initial relaxation. CONCLUSION: Slight relaxation of social distancing may immensely impact the pandemic duration and expected peak prevalence. Only holding the course with respect to social distancing may have resulted in near elimination before Fall of 2020; relaxing social distancing to 15% of pre-COVID-19 contacts will flatten the epidemic curve but greatly extend the duration of the pandemic.","output":"Relaxation of social distancing restrictions: Model estimated impact on COVID-19 epidemic in Manitoba, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhoea remains one of the top three causes of death in Africa. However, data on the molecular epidemiology of enteric viruses in Nigeria is rare. Two hundred and forty three infants and children below the age of 5 years with acute watery diarrhoea were evaluated for the presence of enteric viruses in stool by real-time PCR (rtPCR) during the dry months of December to April 2017, which correspond to diarrhoea season in South-East Nigeria. At least one viral pathogen was detected in 95.1% (231/243) of the study population. Rotavirus, 231(95.1%) was the most common followed by adenovirus, 103(42.4%) and enterovirus 32(13.2%).

Norovirus and hepatitis A and E viruses were not detected. Children that consumed factory packaged water had the lowest prevalence of rotavirus infection (p=0.044). A significant association between the viral pathogen and home treatment of drinking water or exclusive breastfeeding was not observed. Randomly selected 46 samples were genotyped for rotavirus, which showed that G3P[6] (39.1%) was the most common, followed by G1P[8] (15.2%), G9P[8] (13.0%), G12P[8] (6.5%), G9P[6]P[8] (2.2%), and G12P[6] (2.2%).

Questions inevitably arise, some of which are particularly pressing during the pandemic, as events are unfolding quickly and the field is becoming crowded. My central question here is: which professional ethical guidance should the professional follow? MAIN BODY: Adopting a working definition of \\"professional ethical guidance\\", I offer three domains for a healthcare professional to consider, and some associated questions to ask, when determining whether - in relation to any guidance document - they should \\"bin it or pin it\\". First, the professional should consider the source of the guidance: is the issuing body authoritative or, if not, at least sufficiently influential that its guidance should be followed? Second, the professional should consider the applicability of the guidance, ascertaining whether the guidance is available and, if so, whether it is pertinent. Pertinence has various dimensions, including whether the guidance applies to this professional, this patient and/or this setting, whether it is up-to-date, and whether the guidance addresses the situation the professional is facing. Third, the professional should consider the methodology and methods by which the guidance was produced. Although the substantive quality of the guidance is important, so too are the methods by which it was produced. Here, the professional should ask whether the guidance is sufficiently inclusive - in terms of who has prepared it and who contributed to its development - and whether it was rigorously developed, and thus utilised appropriate processes, principles and evidence. CONCLUSION: Asking and answering such questions may be challenging, particularly during a pandemic. Furthermore, guidance will not do all the work: professionals will still need to exercise their judgment in deciding what is best in the individual case, whether or not this concerns COVID-19. But such judgments can and should be informed (and constrained) by guidance, and hopefully these preliminary observations will provide some useful pointers for time-pressed professionals.","output":"Bin it or pin it?

The authors visualize access to online learning technologies using data from the Household Pulse Survey from the early fall 2020 school period (August 19 to October 26). The authors find that 10.1 percent of children participating in online learning nationally did not have adequate access to the Internet and a computer. Rates of inadequate access varied nearly 20-fold across the gradient of parental race/ethnicity and education, from 1.9 percent for children of Asian parents with graduate degrees to 35.5 percent among children of Black parents with less than a high school education. These findings indicate alarming gaps in potential learning among U.S. children.

We performed a retrospective study of patients 18 years of age and under admitted to four New York hospitals in the Northwell Health System interned during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, between March 9 and August 13, 2020. Acute kidney injury was defined and staged according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The cohort included 152 patients; 97 acute-COVID-19 and 55 with MIS-C associated with COVID-19. Acute kidney injury occurred in 8 with acute-COVID-19 and in 10 with MIS-C. Acute kidney injury, in unadjusted models, was associated with a lower serum albumin level (odds ratio 0.17; 95% confidence interval 0.07, 0.39) and higher white blood cell counts (odds ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.2). Patients with MIS-C and acute kidney injury had significantly greater rates of systolic dysfunction, compared to those without (80% vs 49%). In unadjusted models, patients with acute kidney injury had 8.4 days longer hospitalizations compared to patients without acute kidney injury (95% confidence interval, 4.4-6.7). Acute kidney injury in acute-COVID-19 and MIS-C may be related to inflammation and/or dehydration. Further research in larger pediatric cohorts is needed to better characterize risk factors for acute kidney injury in acute-COVID-19 and with MIS-C consequent to COVID-19.","output":"Acute kidney injury in pediatric patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on invasive mechanical ventilation were found to have high rates of barotrauma.

We sought to determine the specific mediators that are associated with more severe illness in young children. METHODS Children  5 years of age seen in our emergency department for respiratory symptoms from September 1998 to May 2008 were eligible for enrollment. Nasopharyngeal wash samples were collected from all eligible patients, and clinical data were recorded. Individuals were included in this study if nasopharyngeal wash samples were positive for RSV only. Patients enrolled in the study were stratified by disease severity, defined as mild (not hospitalized), moderate (hospitalized) or severe (requiring intensive care unit stay). Concentrations of individual inflammatory biomarkers in nasopharyngeal wash fluids were determined using the Luminex human 30-plex assay. RESULTS Eight hundred fifty-one patients met study criteria: 268 (31.5%) with mild, 503 (59.1%) with moderate and 80 (9.4%) with severe illness. As expected, illness severity was directly associated with young age, prematurity, heart or lung disease, infection with RSV group A and elevated concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, CXCL8, tumor necrosis factor-, interferon-, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL2. In addition, we report several novel and mechanistically important inflammatory biomarkers of severe RSV disease, including IL-1, IL1-RA, IL-7, epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor. CONCLUSIONS In a large, longitudinal study (10 years, 851 enrolled patients) limited to RSV infection only, in which well-known risk factors are confirmed, we identified 5 novel biomarkers specifically of severe disease.

The development of chitosan-based thin film materials with selectivity for nicotine derivatives is described. The molecular imprinting of a combination of nicotine derivatives in N-diacryloyl pipiradine-chitosan-methacrylic acid copolymer films on quartz crystal resonators was used to generate thin films with selectivity for nicotine and a range of nicotine analogues, particularly 3-phenylpyridine. The polymers were characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic evaluations; surface area, pore size, pore volume using Breuner-Emmet-Teller method. Temperature characteristics were also studied. The swelling and structure consistency of the Chitosan was achieved by grafting with methylmethacrylic acid and cross-linking with N-diacrylol pipiradine. A blend of 0.002 g (0.04 mmol) of Chitosan, 8.5 L Methylmethacrylic Acid and 1.0 mg N-diacrylol pipradine (BAP) presented the best blend formulation. Detections were made within a time interval of 99 s, and blend templates were detected at a concentration of 0.5 mM from the Quartz crystal microbalance resonator analysis. The successful crosslinking of the biopolymers ensured successful control of the swelling and agglomeration of the chitosan, giving it the utility potential for use as thin film sensor. This successful crosslinking also created successful dual multiple templating on the chitosan matrix, even for aerosolized templates.

The aim of this paper is to share their personal experiences and the best recommendations for resolving their difficulties. We summarise their complex thoughts on the subject of the home office in relation to the household, homeschooling and the education of all concerned. In order to address this question, a qualitative research paradigm using WhatsApp as a medium in order to explore the following research questions was used: 1) How are employees able to manage the home office, homeschooling and the household under one roof? and 2) Will WFH and homeschooling disadvantage working mothers more than working fathers? Data were collected from 10 working parents (five males and five females) in Austria. According to coding, four major themes were explored: 1) Compatibility, 2) Work/home space, 3) Work week separation and 4) Suggestions and organisational recommendations. It was determined that at the beginning of the lockdown drawing a clear boundary between the home, office and school environments caused some difficulties. Especially parents with younger children experienced problems of compatibility. Secondly, flexibility and housing in relation to the home-office-school environment was a common topic throughout the interviews. Furthermore, before Covid-19 all participants had a more classic separation of roles. Roles and expectations changed as all the family members stayed at home day in and day out. Finally, in privileged situations (more living space, jobs that could be done remotely or support of the entire family), it was often easier to deal with the current challenges. This pandemic has brought many changes in everyday life and in terms of performing old tasks and new ones. This includes work at home and homeschooling. The obtained data provide important insights into how to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on work, home and school while emphasising the importance of these questions as well as of future research for support and information. ? 2021 Michal Beno.

In 2019, samples were taken from two peat bogs in Germany and two in Slovenia to determine differences in their levels of potentially toxic elements (PTE). The Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) lockdown caused global decrease in air pollution. Therefore, we repeated the monitoring in 2020 to see if this was also reflected in moss composition. Despite the variability within bogs and the areas, it is possible to distinguish the degree of air pollution between the two countries. The Harz mosses have higher contents of almost all elements and Slovenian Cr and Hg in 2020. Comparison of the PTE contents, their ratios to Sc and the enrichment factors show that the COVID-19 lockdown led to a decrease in long-range pollutants bound to finest particles and increased the influence of local soil dusting. The effect prevailed over lower precipitation in 2020 compared to 2019. Transport and industry continued to contribute significantly to contamination. Sphagnum mosses proved to be good indicators of the spatial and temporal extent of pollution.

With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. MHC tetramers were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead left out to serve as a test of whether T-REX identifies biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4(+) T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by 95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots with virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either after clearing the infection (Day 28) or samples taken prior to infection (Day 0). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

The EAU Guideline Office Rapid Reaction Group (GORRG) issued priority recommendations for use during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated if the clinical prioritisation for suspected renal cell carcinoma (RCC) planned for surgery matched final pathological risk. Materials & Methods: From 23 March 2020 at the beginning of the first lock-down in the UK, patients with suspected RCC were prioritised according to GORRG recommendations until 10 October 2020. To increase statistical power, GORRG prioritisation was also retrospectively assigned to pre-lockdown RCC surgical cases, dating back to April 5 2019. Patient and tumour characteristics were assessed, as was priority group according to GORRG, TNM, and postoperative risk according to 2003 Leibovich scores. We assessed concordance between pre-operative GORGG prioritisation group and post-operative risk, and if stratification could be further improved by subgrouping of size. Results: 351 patients with suspected RCC were prioritised and underwent surgery, of which 16 were benign and 335 were RCC after specimen analysis. The intermediate priority group did not match the pathological risk group in 47.7%, with 25.7% and 16.4% of the group being pathological low and high risk, respectively. The low GORRG priority group harboured 14.9% intermediate and 1.06% high risk RCC, and the high GORRG priority group 27.9% intermediate and no low risk RCC respectively. Within the GORRG intermediate group, 34.2% of cT1b tumours were low risk, and 32.3% of cT2a tumours high risk. Analysing at 1 cm increments, 45.1% of 4-5cm tumours were low risk. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for priority groups in predicting matched postoperative risk group was 0.60 (95% CI 0.55-0.65). The sankey diagram shows patients categorised according to EAU GORGG guidelines (left) and pathological risk (right).(Figure Presented)Conclusions: The recommended prioritisation system can be error prone and should be prudently applied based on the centres needs. Particularly amongst the intermediate group, centres with clinical capacity should not defer intervention of cT2a tumours for longer than absolutely necessary and in severely limited resources may consider intermediate priority tumours <5cm as low priority.","output":"European Association of Urology COVID intermediate prioritisation group is poorly predictive of pathological high-risk among patients with renal tumours"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Water is an essential resource required for various human activities such as drinking, cooking, and other recreational activities. While developed nations have made significant improvement in providing adequate quality water and sanitation devoid of virus contaminations to a significant percentage of the residences, many of the developing countries are still lacking in these regards, leading to many death cases among the vulnerable due to ingestion of virus-contaminated water and other waterborne pathogens. However, the recent global pandemic of COVID-19 seems to have changed the paradigm by reawakening the importance of water quality and sanitation, and focusing more attention on the pervasive effect of the use of virus-contaminated water as it can be a potential driver for the spread of the virus and other waterborne diseases, especially in developing nations that are characterized by low socioeconomic development. Therefore, this review assessed the socioeconomic inequalities related to the usage of virus-contaminated water and other waterborne pathogens in developing countries. The socioeconomic factors attributed to the various waterborne diseases due to the use of virus-contaminated water in many developing countries are poverty, the standard of living, access to health care facilities, age, gender, and level of education.

The hyperinflammatory hypermetabolic nature of the disease and the complexity of its management create barriers to the delivery of nutritional therapy. This review identifies the key differences which characterize this pandemic from other disease processes in critical illness and discusses alternative strategies to enhance success of nutritional support. RECENT FINDINGS: Prolonged hyperinflammation, unlike any previously described pattern of response to injury, causes metabolic perturbations and deterioration of nutritional status. High ventilatory demands, hypercoagulation with the risk of bowel ischemia, and threat of aspiration in patients with little or no pulmonary reserve, thwart initial efforts to provide early enteral nutrition (EN). The obesity paradox is invalidated, tolerance of EN is limited, intensivists are reluctant to add supplemental parenteral nutrition (PN), and efforts to give sufficient nutritional therapy remain a low priority. SUMMARY: The nature of the disease and difficulties providing traditional critical care nutrition lead to dramatic deterioration of nutritional status. Institutions should not rely on insufficient gastric feeding alone but focus instead on redoubling efforts to provide postpyloric deep duodenal/jejunal EN or re-examine the role of supplemental PN in this population of patients with such severe critical illness.","output":"How Differences in the Disease Process of the COVID-19 Pandemic Pose Challenges to the Delivery of Critical Care Nutrition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the status of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam, major response successes, factors that prompted implementation of certain public health actions, and the impact of these actions.

In order to understand the dependencies of the shielding properties of the hydrogels on filler contents and photon energies, the filler contents added to the hydrogels were varied from 0C40 wt.% and the photon energies were varied from 0.001C5 MeV. The results, which were verified for their reliability and correctness with those obtained from PHITS (Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System), indicated that overall shielding performances, which included the mass attenuation coefficients ((m)), the linear attenuation coefficient (), the half-value layer (HVL), and the lead equivalence (Pb(eq)), of the hydrogels improved with increasing filler contents but generally decreased with increasing photon energies. Among the three compounds investigated in this work, Bi(2)O(3)/PVA hydrogels exhibited the highest photon attenuation capabilities, determined at the same filler content and photon energy, mainly due to its highest atomic number of Bi and the highest density of Bi(2)O(3) in comparison with other elements and compounds. Furthermore, due to possible reduction in self-healing and mechanical properties of the hydrogels with excessive filler contents, the least content of fillers providing a 10-mm sample with the required Pb(eq) value of 0.5 mmPb was investigated.

The preformed, constitutive distribution and accumulation patterns of (+)-catechins closely follow those of stilbene glucosides. Phloem phenolics are not translocated but form a layered defense barrier with oleoresin compounds in response to pathogen attack. Our results suggest that axial phloem parenchyma cells are the primary location for (+)-catechin storage and synthesis in Norway spruce phloem. Chemical mapping of bark defensive metabolites by cryo-ToF-SIMS, in addition to structural and chemical microanalyses of the defense reactions, can provide novel information on the local amplitudes and localizations of chemical and structural defense mechanisms and pathogen-host interactions of trees.","output":"Localization of (+)-Catechin in Picea abies Phloem: Responses to Wounding and Fungal Inoculation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intracellular transport of chloride by members of the CLC transporter family involves a coupled exchange between a Cl(?) anion and a proton (H(+)), which makes the transport function dependent on ambient pH.

Our findings support the Uses and Gratification theory that users on Reddit and Twitter are engaging with platforms that they may feel best reflect their sense of self. Using the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes as our study cases, we collected 510,579 tweets and 45,770 Reddit posts (including 1437 submissions and 44,333 comments) to answer the following research questions: (1) What were the similarities and differences between public responses on Twitter and Reddit? (2) Considering the different mechanisms of Twitter and Reddit, what unique information of public responses can we learn from Reddit as compared with Twitter? By answering these research questions, we aim to bridge the gap of cross-platform public responses research towards natural hazards. Our study evinces that the users on the two different platforms have both different topics of interest and different sentiments towards the same earthquake, which indicates the necessity of investigating cross-platform OSNs to reveal a more comprehensive picture of peoples general public responses towards certain disasters.

Then the data were analyzed by the SPSS22.0 software. Results 38.8% of the nurses had a low risk of infection, 18.0% of them had a medium risk, 29.6% had a medium high risk, and 13.6% had a high risk. The SAS scores of clinical nurses in this hospital were statistically significant different, compared with the Chinese norm value ( P <0.05). The difference between TAF score and the degree of crisis response of nursing students in SARS period was statistically significant ( P <0.05). The majority of clinical nurses had less crisis response to NCP, with 80.7% of them suffered mild cognitive, emotional and behavioral damage, and only 2.0% suffered severe damage. Analysis of related factors showed that department, self-test risk of infection, length of service had significant influence on SAS and TAF scores of clinical nurses ( P <0.05).

We calibrate the model against borough-level incidence data collected between 27 February 2020 and 27 October 2020, while using Bayesian inference to estimate critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the coronavirus spread. Given that working with metapopulation models leads to rather high computational time consumption, and parameter estimation of these models may lead to high memory RAM consumption, we do a clustering analysis that is based on mobility trends to work on these clusters of borough separately instead of taken all of the boroughs together at once. This clustering analysis can be implemented in smaller or larger scales in different parts of the world. In addition, this clustering analysis is divided into the phases that the government of Mexico City has set up to restrict individual movement in the city.

COVID19 convalescent plasma has been utilized as a potential therapy for patients hospitalized with COVID19 pneumonia. This study evaluated the outcomes of hospitalized COVID19 patients treated with COVID19 convalescent plasma in a prospective, observational multicenter trial. METHODS: From April 2020 through August 2020, hospitalized COVID19 patients at 16 participating hospitals in Colorado were enrolled and treated with COVID19 convalescent plasma (CCP) and compared to hospitalized patients with COVID19 who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Plasma antibody levels were determined following the trial given that antibody tests were not approved at the initiation of the trial. CCP-treated and untreated COVID19 hospitalized patients were matched using propensity scores followed by analysis for length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality. RESULTS: 542 total hospitalized COVID19 patients were enrolled at 16 hospitals across the region. A total of 468 hospitalized COVID19 patients were entered into propensity score matching with 188 patients matched for analysis in the CCP-treatment and control arms. Fine-Gray models revealed increased length of hospital stay in CCP-treated patients and no change in inpatient mortality compared to controls. In subgroup analysis of CCP-treated patients within 7 days of admission, there was no difference in length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality.

Collected data from real world situations are represented as day to day newly infections, from these data help to determine numbers of waves. The current existing mathematical models cannot be used to predict waves, while having known the predicted numbers of waves one can take several measures to control the situation. To solve this problem, we questioned the fact that the rates of infection and recovery are constant and suggested an indicator function, the function is obtained using experimental data. The indicator function is used as rate and introduced into the mathematical model. We considered a simple SIR model with different types of differential operators including classical and fractional derivatives. The models were solved numerically using well-known numerical schemes. The numerical solutions were plotted for different theoretical parameters, the obtained results depict real-world behaviours. To test the efficiency of this new approach, we collected data from South Africa and compared with experimental data. Not only our model waves but also it fit experimental data very accurately.

METHODS: A population-based, random telephone survey was performed during the peak of the third wave of COVID-19 outbreak (27/07/2020 to 27/08/2020) in Hong Kong. All adults aged &#8805; 18 years were eligible. The survey included sociodemographic details; self-report health conditions; trust scales; and self-reported health outcomes. Multivariable regression analyses were applied to examine independent associations. The primary outcome is the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: We conducted 1200 successful telephone interviews (response rate 55%). The overall vaccine acceptance rate after adjustment for population distribution was 37.2% (95% C.I. 34.5-39.9%). The projected acceptance rates exhibited a \\"J-shaped\\" pattern with age, with higher rates among young adults (18-24 years), then increased linearly with age. Multivariable regression analyses revealed that perceived severity, perceived benefits of the vaccine, cues to action, self-reported health outcomes, and trust in healthcare system or vaccine manufacturers were positive correlates of acceptance; whilst perceived access barriers and harm were negative correlates. Remarkably, perceived susceptibility to infection carried no significant association, whereas recommendation from Government (aOR = 10.2, 95% C.I. 6.54 to 15.9, p < 0.001) was as the strongest driving factor for acceptance. Other key obstacles of acceptance included lack of confidence on newer vaccine platforms (43.4%) and manufacturers without track record (52.2%), which are of particular relevance to the current context. CONCLUSIONS: Governmental recommendation is an important driver, whereas perceived susceptibility is not associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 4538 patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), transient ischemic attack (TIA), or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) from two hospitals stroke registries, which were linked to NHI claims data. We developed several algorithms based on ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes and prescription claims data to identify hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation (AF), and ischemic heart disease (IHD) using registry data as the reference standard. The agreement of risk factor status between claims and registry data was quantified by calculating the kappa statistic. RESULTS: According to the registry data, the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, AF, and IHD among all patients was 77.5%, 41.5%, 47.9%, 12.1%, and 7.1%, respectively. In general, including diagnosis codes from prior inpatient or outpatient claims to those from the stroke hospitalization claims improved the agreement. Incorporating prescription data could improve the agreement for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and AF, but not for IHD. The kappa values of the optimal algorithms were 0.552 (95% confidence interval 0.524C0.580) for hypertension, 0.802 (0.784C0.820) for diabetes, 0.514 (0.490C0.539) for hyperlipidemia, 0.765 (0.734C0.795) for AF, and 0.518 (0.473C0.564) for IHD.

The 2006 Great Recession and then the 2019 pandemic have a lot to share in terms of unemployment rate, consumption expenditures, and interest rates set by Federal Reserve. In addition to quantitative historical data, it is also interesting to compare the contents of Federal Reserve statements for the period of these two crises and find out whether Federal Reserve cares about similar concerns or there are some other issues that demand separate and unique monetary policies. This paper conducts an analysis to explore the Federal Reserve concerns as expressed in their statements for the period of 2005 to 2020. The concern analysis is performed using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and a trend analysis of concern is also presented.

One immediate concern was what the impact of the comprehensive disease control measures on rates of violence and abuse against children and adolescents would be. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish rates of child abuse and degree of family conflict during the first COVID-19 lockdown spring 2020. Additionally, we aimed to investigate associations between preexisting and concurrent risk factors and abuse during these unique times. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A total of 3545 Norwegian 13- to 16-year-olds participated in this study. A total of 1944 of these had provided data 1a?year before the lockdown. METHODS: We used a web survey format to assess abuse exposure and associated risk factors. The survey was administered in schools during school hours in June 2020, shortly after the reopening of schools after the first lockdown. RESULTS: In this sample 8.2% reported psychological abuse during lockdown, 2.4% had experienced physical abuse and 1.4% sexual abuse. For online sexual abuse, the rate was 5.6% during this time period. Adolescents did not report an increase in family conflict. Concurrently perceived family affluence and family risk factors were most strongly associated with physical abuse during lockdown (ORa?=a?11.01(95% CI 5.32-22.84); ORa?=a?5.36 (95% CI 2.69-10.67)), but also other types of child maltreatment. Analyses across assessment points suggested that prior victimization was the most accurate predictor of abuse experiences during lockdown (ORa?=a?3.84 (95% CI 2.85-5.20)). CONCLUSIONS: The negative consequences of the COVID-19 preventative measures struck the adolescent population unevenly. The findings underscore the need for targeted measures to mitigate the negative outcomes of health-related crises for adolescents in risk groups such as those with low family affluence and prior abuse experiences.","output":"Violence and abuse experiences and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in a population-based sample of Norwegian adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2/2019-nCoV) infection is an emerging pandemic.

We summarize here the results of studies, which used these technologies to investigate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in different organs. Studies with in vitro models of lung epithelia showed that alveolar epithelial type II cells, but not differentiated lung alveolar epithelial type I cells, are key targets of SARS-CoV-2, which triggers cell apoptosis and inflammation, while impairing surfactant production. Experiments with human small intestinal organoids and colonic organoids showed that the gastrointestinal tract is another relevant target for SARS-CoV-2. The virus can infect and replicate in enterocytes and cholangiocytes, inducing cell damage and inflammation. Direct viral damage was also demonstrated in in vitro models of human cardiomyocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells. At variance, endothelial cells and neurons are poorly susceptible to viral infection, thus supporting the hypothesis that neurological symptoms and vascular damage result from the indirect effects of systemic inflammatory and immunological hyper-responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Disease Modelling Using Stem Cell Technology and Organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To present a case with progressive keratoconus after treated with radial keratotomy (RK) and was undergone corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) for preventing the progress of keratectasia.

The continuous process was based on the generation of hydroxyl-radicals via the UV-C (254 nm) photo-degradation of hydrogen peroxide and ozone. The decontamination efficacy of the gAOP was dependent on the orientation of the N95 mask passing through the gAOP unit with those positioned horizontally enabling greater exposure to hydroxyl-radicals compared to when arranged vertically. The lethality of gAOP was independent of the applied hydrogen peroxide concentration (2-6% v/v) but was significantly (P<0.05) higher when H2O2 was introduced into the unit at 40 ml/min compared to 20 ml/min. A suitable treatment for N95 masks was identified as 3% v/v hydrogen peroxide delivered into the gAOP reactor at 40 ml/min with continuous introduction of ozone gas and a UV-C dose of 113 mJ/cm2 (30 s processing time). The treatment supported >6 log CFU decrease in Geobacillus stearothermophilus endospores, > 8 log reduction of human coronavirus 229E, and no detection of Escherichia coli K12 on the interior and exterior of masks. There was no negative effect on the N95 mask fitting or particulate efficacy after 20 passes through the gAOP system. No visual changes or hydrogen peroxide residues were detected (<1 ppm) in gAOP treated masks. The optimized gAOP treatment could also support >6 log CFU reduction of endospores inoculated on the interior or exterior of surgical masks. G. stearothermophilus Apex spore strips could be applied as a biological indicator to verify the performance of gAOP treatment. Also, a chemical indicator based on the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole was found suitable for reporting the generation of hydroxyl-radicals.

This study investigated disturbances to working life and mental health among Americans aged 55 during early months of the pandemic. METHODS: Using data from the nation-wide COVID-19 Coping Study (N=6,264), we examined rates of job loss, furloughs, hour/income reductions, and work-from-home, along with unchanged work status, by age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and occupation. We next described sources of worry by job transition group and tested the adjusted associations of COVID-19-related job transitions with life satisfaction, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Most job loss occurred among respondents under age 65 and those without college degrees. Job loss and reduced hours/income were more common among Hispanics compared to other racial/ethnic groups, and work-from-home transitions were most common among respondents with high educational attainment and jobs in government- and education-related occupations. Workers who lost their jobs had the lowest life satisfaction and the highest loneliness and depressive symptoms, followed by workers who were furloughed and workers with reduced hours/income. Work-from-home was associated with more anxiety than unchanged work. DISCUSSION: COVID-19-related job transitions are detrimental to mental health, even when they might keep workers safe. These results enhance our understanding of the potentially long-term mental health effects of social and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for economic and mental health support for aging Americans.","output":"Job transitions and mental health outcomes among US adults aged 55 and older during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evidence of initiatives to support General Practitioners (GPs) during the Covid-19 pandemic is scant. AIM: To understand the impact of a novel method of providing support in the early stages of the pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: A mixed-methods study of GPs working in a socially deprived area of Belfast. METHOD: A survey was distributed to GPs who had attended a series of educational meetings at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey incorporated the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale and questions about the virtual meetings. Follow-up interviews were undertaken with five GPs to further explore their lived experiences and their perceptions of the virtual support forum. RESULTS: The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a measurable diminution of emotional well-being in GPs in North and West Belfast. Attendees rated a series of virtual meetings highly and described the following themes (and subthemes): a sudden traumatic change (emotional response, fight or flight, painful reminders of the status of general practice in the NHS); a coming together (stepping up to take responsibility, sharing of information, feeling of affirmation); reflections on what worked (calming facilitation, careful selection of speakers, creating the right atmosphere, ownership and autonomy) and building future direction (defining future direction, capitalising on lesson learned). CONCLUSION: The virtual meetings harnessed the instinct to come together witnessed at the beginning of the pandemic, and as well as sharing valuable information, also provided emotional support along with a sense of comradeship, ownership and autonomy. HOW THIS FITS IN: GPs did not feel included or supported at the outset of the pandemic. Coming together with fellow professionals was a welcome source of support. Professional support can be delivered using a virtual platform.

The aim of this study was to assess how enlarging the JJS with a bidirectional linear stapling can aid in avoiding the risk of early SBO by kinking. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective cohort study concerns 1327 patients who underwent RYGB with CMD between May 2007 and August 2016. The first 626 patients (group A) had a unidirectional JJS. The following 701 patients (group B) had a bidirectional side-to-side JJS and a hand-sewn closure of the remaining defect. We compared early SBO between the two groups. RESULTS Eleven (1.75%) early SBO due to the JJS kinking occurred in group A, whereas none occurred in group B (p = 0.0012). Thirty-nine early postoperative complications happened in group A versus 32 in group B (p = 0.17). Nine (1.2%) digestive bleedings occurred in group B versus two (0.3%) in group A (OR = 4.05 [0.87-18], p = 0.054). Average operating time was 81 min [37-330] in group A and 77 min [33-240] in group B. CONCLUSION Enlarging the JJS with a bidirectional linear stapling is associated with a reduced risk of early SBO due to the anastomosis kinking.

Considerable improvements in molecular pathogen testing emerged in the last few years. Our prospective study combinedly used traditional culture, antigen tests, PCR and mNGS in SCAP pathogen identification with clinical outcomes. From June 2018 to December 2019, we conducted a multi-centre prospective study in 17 hospitals of SCAP patients within 48 hours of emergency room stay or hospitalization in China. All clinical data were uploaded into an online database. Blood, urine and respiratory specimens were collected for routine culture, antigen detection, PCR and mNGS as designed appropriately. Aetiology confirmation was made by the local attending physician group and scientific committee according to microbiological results, clinical features, and response to the treatment. Two hundred seventy-five patients were included for final analysis. Combined detection methods made identification rate up to 74.2% (222/299), while 14.4% (43/299) when only using routine cultures and 40.8% (122/299) when not using mNGS. Influenza virus (23.2%, 46/198), S. pneumoniae (19.6%, 39/198), Enterobacteriaceae (14.6%, 29/198), Legionella pneumophila (12.6%, 25/198), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (11.1%, 22/198) were the top five common pathogens.

Inflammation markers such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-, quantified in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid indicated major improvement in rats treated with dexamethasone microspheres by intravenous route. Additionally, the microspheres substantially inhibited the protein infiltration, neutrophil accumulation and lipid peroxidation in the lungs of ARDS bearing rats, suggesting a reduction in oxidative stress. Histopathology showed decreased damage to the pulmonary tissue upon treatment with the dexamethasone-loaded microspheres. The multipronged formulation technology approach can thus serve as a potential treatment modality for reducing lung inflammation in ARDS. An improved therapeutic profile would help to reduce the dose, dosing frequency and, eventually, the toxicity.","output":"Lung Targeted Lipopolymeric Microspheres of Dexamethasone for the Treatment of ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Before the discovery of the endogenous opioid system in the 1970s, opioids were understood only through the lens of opioid drug effects. Opium produced sleep, pain relief, and addiction. Once a variety of opioids had been extracted from opium, and still others synthesized chemically, it became clear that there must be endogenous receptors to explain differential drug effects. So, the search was on to identify the receptors, and subsequently their endogenous ligands. Even then, the consequential ways in which the endogenous opioid system influences the way we respond to the environment and survive took time to unravel. Today's understanding extends far beyond simply accepting pain relief and addiction as separate processes, to the realization that the endogenous opioid system achieves constant adjustments between punishment (pain) and reward in communicating areas of the brain previously thought to subserve separate functions. The system also plays a crucial role in socialization. Taken together, these 2 lines of research have led to new insights into why the endogenous opioid system is so important in terms of evolution, individual survival and day-to-day function, and how important it is to consider opioid medications within the context of these critical natural functions.","output":"Discovery of endogenous opioid systems: what it has meant for the clinician's understanding of pain and its treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In Italy, during the first epidemic wave of 2020, the peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality was reached at the end of March. Afterward, a progressive reduction was observed until much lower figures were reached during the summer, resulting from the contained circulation of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to determine if and how the pathological patterns of the individuals deceased from COVID-19 changed during the phases of epidemic waves in terms of: (i) main cause of death, (ii) comorbidities, and (iii) complications related to death. Methods: Death certificates of persons who died and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, provided by the National Surveillance system, were coded according to ICD rev10. Deaths due to COVID-19 were defined as those in which COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death. Results: The percentage of COVID-19 deaths varied over time. It decreased in the downward phase of the epidemic curve (76.6 vs. 88.7%). In FebruaryCApril 2020, hypertensive heart disease was mentioned as a comorbidity in 18.5% of death certificates, followed by diabetes (15.9% of cases), ischemic heart disease (13.1%), and neoplasms (12.1%). In MayCSeptember, the most frequent comorbidity was neoplasms (17.3% of cases), followed by hypertensive heart disease (14.9%), diabetes (14.8%), and dementia/Alzheimer's disease (11.9%). The most mentioned complications in both periods were pneumonia and respiratory failure with a frequency far higher than any other condition (78.4% in FebruaryCApril 2020 and 63.7% in MayCSeptember 2020). Discussion: The age of patients dying from COVID-19 and their disease burden increased in the MayCSeptember 2020 period. A more serious disease burden was observed in this period, with a significantly higher frequency of chronic pathologies. Our study suggests better control of the virus' lethality in the second phase of the epidemic, when the health system was less burdened. Moreover, COVID-19 care protocols had been created in hospitals, and knowledge about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 had improved, potentially leading to more accurate diagnosis and better treatment. All these factors may have improved survival in patients with COVID-19 and led to a shift in mortality to older, more vulnerable, and complex patients.","output":"Evolution of Pathology Patterns in Persons Who Died From COVID-19 in Italy: A National Study Based on Death Certificates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the unprecedented events of the COVID19 outbreak, most universities in the UAE and worldwide had to move to online teaching.

Answering these questions about the past or crafting newer policy decisions in the future requires a quantification of how policy choices affect the spread of the infection. Policy landscape as well as the infection trajectories from different states and countries diverged so fast that comparing and learning from them has not been easy. In this work, we standardize and pool together the ensemble of lockdown and graded re-opening policies adopted by the 50 states of USA in any given week between 9th March and 9th August. Using artificial intelligence (AI) on this pooled data, we build a predictive model (R2training=0.79, R2test=0.76) for the weekly-averaged transmission rate of infections. Predictability conceptually raises the possibility of an evidence-based or data-driven mitigation policy-making by evaluating the relative merits of the different policy scenarios. Probing the predictions with interpretable AI highlights how factors such as the closing of bars or the use of masks influence transmission, effects which have been hard to decouple from the ensemble of policy instrument combinations. While acknowledging the limitations of our predictions as well as of the infection testing, we ask the theoretical question if the observed transmission rates in the states were as efficient as they could have been under various levels of restrictions, and if the mitigation policies of the states are overdesigned. The model can be further refined with a more detailed inclusion of geographies and policy compliances, as well as expanded as newer policies emerge.","output":"Predicting and interpreting COVID-19 transmission rates from the ensemble of government policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Disparities in COVID-19 testingthe pandemics most critical but limited resourcemay be an important but modifiable driver of COVID-19 inequities. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Missouri State Department Health and Senior Services on all COVID-19 tests conducted in the St. Louis and Kansas City regions. We adapted a well-established tool for measuring inequitythe Lorenz curveto compare COVID-19 testing rates per diagnosed case among Black and White populations. RESULTS: Between 3/14/2020 and 9/15/2020, 606,725 and 328,204 COVID-19 tests were conducted in the St. Louis and Kansas City regions, respectively. Over time, Black individuals consistently had approximately half the rate of testing per case compared to White individuals. In the early period (3/14/2020 to 6/15/2020), zip codes in the lowest quartile of testing rates accounted for only 12.1% and 8.8% of all tests in the St. Louis and Kansas City regions, respectively, even though they accounted for 25% of all cases each region. These zip codes had higher proportions of residents who were Black, without insurance, and with lower median incomes. These disparities were reduced but still persisted during later phases of the pandemic (6/16/2020 to 9/15/2020). Lastly, even within the same zip code, Black residents had lower rates of tests per case compared to White residents.

Due to its high mortality rate and infectious nature, most Ebola research to date has focused on healthcare response and interventions; however, little is known about the experiences of Ebola survivors and communities. This qualitative study aimed to better understand the lived experiences of community members, including children, during and after the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. METHODS: During June 2016 and June 2017, we conducted four focus groups comprised of primary school students, female caretakers, male caretakers, and teachers, and two individual in-depth interviews with local nurses in Calaba Town, a small village outside of Freetown. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using a modified grounded theory methodology. FINDINGS: All participants shared that they experienced significant challenges during and after the Ebola epidemic. During the epidemic, participants endured daily life challenges pertaining to fear, financial distress, and school closures. They also experienced suffering, loss, isolation, grief, and compromised culture. Confusion and distrust were also prevalent during the epidemic, with participants reporting confusion around Ebola transmission and distrust in the government and healthcare services. We also found that the struggle for food and grief stemming from the loss of loved ones continued more than a year after the epidemic ended. Despite Sierra Leone being declared Ebola-free, stigma and fear persisted and community members shared their continuing distrust of the government due to their actions during and after the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this qualitative study reveal that the Ebola epidemic was a traumatizing period for the Calaba Town community, and that confusion and distrust toward the government health care system have continued.

However, nurses have been dissatisfied after implementations of HIS. In particular, poorly functioning electronic health records (EHRs) have been found to induce stress and cognitive workload. Moreover, the need to learn new systems may require considerable effort from nurses. Thus, EHR implementations may have an effect on the well-being of nurses. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the associations of EHR-to-EHR implementations and the sufficiency of related training with perceived stress related to information systems (SRIS), time pressure, and cognitive failures among registered nurses. Moreover, we examined the moderating effect of the employment sector (hospital, primary care, social services, and others) on these associations. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional survey study of 3610 registered Finnish nurses in 2020. EHR implementation was measured by assessing whether the work unit of each respondent had implemented or will implement a new EHR (1) within the last 6 months, (2) within the last 12 months, (3) in the next 12 months, and (4) at no point within the last 12 months or in the forthcoming 12 months. The associations were examined using analyses of covariance adjusted for age, gender, and employment sector. RESULTS: The highest levels of SRIS (adjusted mean 4.07, SE 0.05) and time pressure (adjusted mean 4.55, SE 0.06) were observed among those who had experienced an EHR implementation within the last 6 months. The lowest levels of SRIS (adjusted mean 3.26, SE 0.04), time pressure (adjusted mean 4.41, SE 0.05), and cognitive failures (adjusted mean 1.84, SE 0.02) were observed among those who did not experience any completed or forthcoming implementations within 12 months. Nurses who perceived that they had received sufficient implementation-related training experienced less SRIS (F(1)=153.40, P<.001), time pressure (F(1)=80.95, P<.001), and cognitive failures (F(1)=34.96, P<.001) than those who had received insufficient training. Recent implementations and insufficient training were especially strongly associated with high levels of SRIS in hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: EHR implementations and insufficient training related to these implementations may endanger the well-being of nurses and even lead to errors. Thus, it is extremely important for organizations to offer comprehensive training before, during, and after implementations. Moreover, easy-to-use systems that allow transition periods, a re-engineering approach, and user involvement may be beneficial to nurses in the implementation process. Training and other improvements would be especially important in hospitals.","output":"Electronic Health Record Implementations and Insufficient Training Endanger Nurses Well-being: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On July 30 the COVID-19 pandemic expanded to over 17 million cases and over 660 thousand deaths worldwide (Dong et al., 2020). High-risk populations include people older than 65 years, with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and immunocompromised patients (Sokolowska et al., 2020). Primary immunodeficient patients have been identified as a high-risk population for infectious diseases including viral infections (Sokolowska et al., 2020) and severe COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020). However, the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the course of the disease in these patients is not well known (Gao et al., 2020;Shaker et al., 2020). The impact of tailored healthcare on these patients for COVID-19 has not been stablished (Waltuch et al., 2020;Zhong et al., 2020). Although immunoglobulin replacement protects them against various types of infections, its role against COVID-19 is not guaranteed (Waltuch et al., 2020) because of the lack of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (Sanders et al., 2020). Furthermore, it remains unclear if immunomodulation could play a role in immunodeficient patients (Waltuch et al., 2020;Zhong et al., 2020) or in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) (Waltuch et al., 2020;Y?ez et al., 2020b). The COVID-19 pandemic burden has called for urgent therapeutic solutions in treating infected patients (Sanders et al., 2020). However, its poorly understood pathophysiological process remains a therapeutic challenge, especially in high risk populations as primary immunodeficiency patients (Sanders et al., 2020). Various specific and unspecific targets for SARS-CoV-2 are currently been evaluated in various preclinical and clinical studies. Some of the relevant targets include anti IL-6R antibodies, IL-1 R antagonists, JAK-STAT inhibitors, CD147 antibodies, convalescent plasma, eculizumab targeting complement C5, immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs (Sanders et al., 2020). However, the inclusion of primary immunodeficiency patients is not part of the drug development paradigm. Colchicine is a drug used in various auto-inflammatory disorders such as Familiar Mediterranean Fever and Bechet disease (Maggiore and Manenti, 2020) that have a close correlation with primary immunodeficiency (Savic et al., 2020). The mechanism of action of colchicine is based on counteracting the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and mitigating the interleukin activation (Deftereos et al., 2020) and potentially preventing the cytokine storm (Montealegre-Gmez et al., 2020) via presumably the viroporin E (Casta?o-Rodriguez et al., 2018). Four (4) randomized clinical trials are in progress to assess colchicine efficacy in COVID-19 patients administered alone or in combination with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Deftereos et al., 2020). However, these Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials do not include primary immunodeficiency patients.Brazil is currently the second country in the world with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 with over 2 million cases (Dong et al., 2020). Even though there is no clear data of the total burden of primary immunodeficient patients in Brazil, it is estimated that 160,000 cases can be accounted for (Carneiro-Sampaio et al., 2013). Challenges in clinical diagnosis and auxiliary methods for primary immunodeficiencies have historically been a problem, but also in the treatment of these patients in both the public and private sectors specially in Latin America (Costa-Carvalho et al., 2017). The latter has become more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic where special care protocols for patients with immunodeficiencies are needed. However, clinics currently are focused in performing PCR tests, blood testing for antibodies, CT-scans, and consultation visits of COVID-19 confirmed or suspected cases. Thus, an immunocompromised patient would not be able to go to a regular clinic nowadays because the risk would be too high (Shaker et al., 2020). Because of the deep concern in these patients, in our clinic in Brazil we have implemented telemedicine to monitor and continue their treatment. However, in-office consultations are still necessary to attend certain cases and because of this we have implemented strict in-office protocols. Our healthcare workers involved in the care of patients with immunodeficiencies must follow rules of behavior and social responsibility to avoid the spread of the virus. Furthermore, our healthcare workers undergo constant training to answer all their COVID-19 related concerns and provide psychological support when needed in order to avoid anxiety, distress and intention to change jobs (Y?ez et al., 2020a). We are also in the approval stage of a Phase 3 clinical trial in Brazil to evaluate effect of colchicine in COVID-19 patients (n=200). We are also in discussion with the Brazilian authorities to start a clinical trial that includes primary immunodeficient and COVID-19 concomitant patients in order to better understand the course of the disease in this population and assess potential immunomodulating treatments. The COVID-19 pandemic is a deep concern for the primary immunodeficient patients, we urge to re-evaluate their inclusion in COVID-19 clinical trials, and to pay closer attention to their proper care, treatment and monitoring in clinics. This is the right time to not overlook this neglected high-risk population in order to offer them opportune, secure and quality care.","output":"Primary Immunodeficiency during COVID-19: Can Colchicine Play a Role in This Overlooked Population?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Luks, Andrew M. and Colin K.

High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000, 2021.-With the increasing availability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and the eventual decline in the burden of the disease, it is anticipated that all forms of tourism, including travel to high altitude, will rebound in the near future. Given the physiologic challenges posed by hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude, it is useful to consider whether high-altitude travel will pose risks to those previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, particularly those with persistent symptoms after resolution of their infection. Although no studies have specifically examined this question as of yet, available data on the cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 provide some sense of the problems people may face at high altitude and who warrants evaluation before such endeavors. On average, most individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 have normal or near normal gas exchange, pulmonary function testing, cardiovascular function, and exercise capacity, although a subset of individuals have persistent functional deficits in some or all of these domains when examined up to 5 months after infection. Evaluation is warranted before planned high-altitude travel in individuals with persistent symptoms at least 2 weeks after a positive test or hospital discharge as well as in those who required care in an intensive care unit or suffered from myocarditis or arterial or venous thromboembolism. Depending on the results of this testing, planned high-altitude travel may need to be modified or even deferred pending resolution of the identified abnormalities.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of patients who underwent EIN or CST surgery for tibia shaft fracture at our center from 2013 to 2018. The patient demographics, fracture characteristics, radiographic information, length of hospital stay, and medical expenses were recorded. All patients were clinically followed-up until they started to walk or for at least 6 months. The treatment outcomes and postoperative complications of the two procedures were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 186 patients who underwent EIN and CST were included in the study. The EIN patients had more low-energy mechanism of injury. In radiographic evaluation, significant differences were observed in distributions of fracture classification and location. Moreover, associated fibula fractures were higher in the EIN group than in the CST group. The CST procedure had faster surgical time, cast duration and lower expenses, and longer hospitalization time. Although they required more clinical visits, patients in the EIN group began exercising and endured weight-bearing earlier than those in the CST group. The average time for bone healing was 68.5 days in the EIN group, and 69.6 days in the CST group. However, the CST provided slight better results of coronal correction than EIN. Moreover, CST patients had less malalignment (> 5) in complications. None had delay union, nonunion, and shortening over 10 mm at final assessment.

METHODS: Retrospective review of electronic patient records between October 2019 to September 2020. Cross referencing of operative and blood transfusion records performed compared to the primary audit cycle of April 2018 to March 2019. RESULTS: A total of 225 open hernia repairs including inguinal, femoral and all other abdominal wall hernias were performed during the 2(nd) cycle compared to 410 in the 1(st) cycle.

In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutation induces loss-of-function effects on the currents produced by channels incorporating mutant subunits; these effects were counteracted by the selective Kv7 opener retigabine and by gabapentin, a recently described Kv7 activator. Given these data, the patient started treatment with gabapentin, showing a rapid and sustained clinical and EEG improvement over the following months. Overall, these results suggest that gabapentin can be regarded as a precision therapy for DEEs due to KCNQ2 loss-of-function mutations.","output":"Gabapentin treatment in a patient with KCNQ2 developmental epileptic encephalopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension is proved to be associated with severity and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) However, little is known about the effects of pre-admission and/or in-hospital antihypertension treatments on clinical outcomes Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between in-hospital blood pressure (BP) control and COVID-19-related outcomes and to compare the effects of different antihypertension treatments This study included 2864 COVID-19 patients and 1628 were hypertensive Patients were grouped according to their BP during hospitalization and records of medication application Patients with higher BP showed worse cardiac and renal functions and clinical outcomes After adjustment, subjects with pre-admission usage of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (HR = 0 35, 95%CI 0 14-0 86, P = 022) had a lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, septic shock, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit admission Particularly, hypertension patients receiving RAAS inhibitor treatment either before (HR = 0 35, 95%CI 0 13-0 97, P = 043) or after (HR = 0 18, 95%CI 0 04-0 86, P = 031) admission showed a significantly lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes than those receiving application of other antihypertensive medicines Furthermore, consecutive application of RAAS inhibitors in COVID-19 patients with hypertension showed better clinical outcomes (HR = 0 10, 95%CI 0 01-0 83, P = 033) than non-RAAS inhibitors users We revealed that COVID-19 patients with poor BP control during hospitalization had worse clinical outcomes Compared with other antihypertension medicines, RAAS inhibitors were beneficial for improving clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with hypertension Our findings provide direct evidence to support the administration of RAAS inhibitors to COVID-19 patients with hypertension before and after admission","output":"Influence of blood pressure control and application of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors on the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between February 2019 and March 2021, 388 dried blood spot samples were obtained from 257 children <30 months of age who were part of a longitudinal maternal/infant cohort in Haiti.

Most likely, the new variant emerged in a persistently infected patient, justifying a special focus on these cases. Our aim in this study was to explore certain clinical profiles involving severe immunosuppression that may help explain the prolonged persistence of viable viruses. We present three severely immunosuppressed cases (A, B, and C) with a history of lymphoma and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding (2, 4, and 6 months), two of whom finally died. Whole-genome sequencing of 9 and 10 specimens from Cases A and B revealed extensive within-patient acquisition of diversity, 12 and 28 new single nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively, which suggests ongoing SARS-CoV-2 replication. This diversity was not observed for Case C after analysing 5 sequential nasopharyngeal specimens and one plasma specimen, and was only observed in one bronchoaspirate specimen, although viral viability was still considered based on constant low Ct values throughout the disease and recovery of the virus in cell cultures. The acquired viral diversity in Cases A and B followed different dynamics. For Case A, new single nucleotide polymorphisms were quickly fixed (13C15 days) after emerging as minority variants, while for Case B, higher diversity was observed at a slower emergence: fixation pace (1C2 months). Slower SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pace was observed for Case A following the administration of hyperimmune plasma.

We investigated the viral determinants of antibody response, the predictors of nonseroconversion, and the role of antibodies on viral dynamics. METHODS: This was a prospective study in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that was microbiologically confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serial nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and plasma samples were obtained for measuring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and antibodies (total and S-IgG/N-IgG), respectively. RESULTS: Of 132 patients included, 99 (75%) showed positive antibody titers after a median (Q1CQ3) of 11 (8C14) days. The median (Q1CQ3) follow-up was 74.5 (63.0C87.0) days. In an adjusted linear regression model, time to seropositivity was inversely associated with peak log SARS-CoV-2 viral load (P = .009) and positively with time to viral clearance (P = .004). Adjusted predictors of S-IgG levels were time to viral clearance (P < .001), bilateral lung infiltrates on admission (P = .011), and the time-dependent SARS-CoV-2 RNA (P < .001) and SARS-CoV-2 RNA area under the curve (P = .001). Thirty-three (25%) patients showed undetectable antibody titers. Patients who did not seroconvert had higher cycle threshold values of RT-PCR (38.0 vs 28.0; P < .001), had shorter time to viral clearance (3.0 vs 41.0; P < .001), and were more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 only detected on fecal samples (P < .001). Nonseroconvertors had also lower levels of blood inflammatory biomarkers on admission and lower disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Viral replication determines the magnitude of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, which, in turn, contributes to viral clearance.

METHOD: This retrospective observational multi-centric study analysed patient data collected from clinicians belonging to different specialties in Bangalore, India. The data included the presentation and management of patients presenting with aggressive maxillofacial and rhino-cerebro-orbital fungal infections and explored the relationship between SARS-CoV-2, corticosteroid administration and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: All 18 patients were Covid positive. Sixteen of the 18 patients received steroids for Covid treatment and 16 patients were diabetic (of whom 15 patients who were diabetics received steroids for Covid-19 treatment). Loss of vision was noted in 12 of the 18 patients and 7 of them underwent orbital exenteration. The fungi noted was mucormycosis in 16 patients, aspergillosis in 1 patient and a mixed fungal infection in 1 patient. Eleven of the patients survived, 6 died and 1 was lost to follow-up.

METHOD Retrospective study. RESULTS A total of 127 patients of COVID-19 Associated Mucormycosis (CAM) were evaluated at four centres in India. All patients underwent endoscopic sinus debridement surgery and received systemic amphotericin-B therapy. Five patients (5/13; 38.4%) received retrobulbar amphotericin-B injections. Orbital exenteration was performed in advanced orbital involvement or progression of orbital disease in spite of maximal medical therapy. In his cohort, 13/127 (10.2%) patients presented with new onset DM, where one patient had bilateral disease. The mean age was 35.9 years (range: 20-51 years) and the mean duration from diagnosis of COVID-19 to the diagnosis of mucormycosis was 14.2 days. While 7/13 (53.8%) of the patients received systemic corticosteroids during the course of their treatment for COVID-19, six patients received no steroids or immunomodulators. The mean follow-up period was 9.2 weeks (range: 3-18 weeks) following discharge. Life salvage was possible in 100% of the cases. While overall globe salvage was possible in 42.8% (6/14 eyes), the globe could be preserved in 4/5 patients who received retrobulbar amphotericin-B injections. CONCLUSIONS Those involved in the care of COVID-19 patients should be aware about the possibility of recent-onset DM, even in patients without a history of corticosteroid therapy.

In this learning pedagogy, students receive lesson any time from lecture videos pre-loaded on digital platform at their convenience places and it is followed by in-classroom activities such as doubt clearing, problem solving, etc. However, students are constantly exposed to high levels of distraction in this age of the Internet. Therefore, it is hard for an instructor to know whether a student has paid attention while watching pre-loaded lecture video. In order to analyze attention level of individual students, captured brain signal or electroencephalogram (EEG) of students can be utilized. In this study, we utilize a popular feature extraction technique called Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and improvise it to develop an enhanced feature selection method. The adapted feature selection method termed as 1D Multi-Point Local Ternary Pattern (1D MP-LTP) is used to extract unique features from collected electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Standard classification techniques are exploited to classify the attention level of students. Experiments are conducted with the data captured at Intelligent Data Analysis Lab, NIT Rourkela, to show effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction technique. The proposed 1D Multi-Point Local Ternary Pattern (1D MP-LTP)-based classification techniques outperform traditional and state-of-the-art classification techniques using LBP.

The objective of this study was to describe our approach and its first results in a case series. We analyzed data from patients who received suppressive antibiotic therapy by subcutaneous (SC) route with beta-lactams as salvage therapy for prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and had TDM with PK/PD-based dose adjustment. Ten patients (six women and four men with a mean age of 77 years) were included from January 2017 to May 2020. The drugs administered by SC route were ceftazidime (n = 4), ertapenem (n = 4), and ceftriaxone (n = 2). In each patient, PK/PD-guided dosage individualization was performed based on TDM and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements. The dose interval could be prolonged from twice daily to thrice weekly in some patients, while preserving the achievement of PK/PD targets. The infection was totally controlled by the strategy in nine out the 10 patients during a median follow-up of 1,035 days (~3 years). No patient acquired carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria during the follow-up. One patient presented treatment failure with acquired drug resistance under therapy, which could be explained by late MIC determination and insufficient exposure, retrospectively.

To assess whether the COVID\\\\19 pandemic resulted in an increased prevalence of accidental hand sanitizer/alcoholic beverage exposure in children and adolescents, we compared pediatric hospitalization rates during COVID\\\\19 and the previous year. For poisoning admissions during COVID\\\\19, we also evaluated the cause by age and clinical outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective data linkage study evaluated data from the Legal Medicine Organization (reporting mortalities) and hospitalization data from nine toxicology referral centers for alcohol\\\\poisoned patients (age 0 to 18 years) for the study period (February 23 to June 22, 2020) and the pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 reference period (same dates in 2019). RESULTS: Hospitalization rates due to ethanol and methanol exposure were significantly higher in 2020 (n = 375) than 2019 (n = 202; OR [95% CI] 1.9 [1.6, 2.2], p < 0.001). During COVID\\\\19, in patients 15 years, the odds of intoxication from hand sanitizers were significantly higher than from alcoholic beverages, while in 15\\\\ to 18\\\\year\\\\olds, alcoholic beverage exposure was 6.7 times more common (95% CI 2.8, 16.1, p < 0.001).

To date, various techniques have been reported to develop cellulose-based matrices for fabricating different types of biosensors. Trends of involving cellulosic materials in paper-based multiplexing devices and microfluidic analytical technologies have increased because of their disposable, portable, biodegradable properties and cost-effectiveness. Cellulose also has potential in the development of cytosensors because of its various unique properties including biocompatibility. Such cellulose-based sensing devices are also being commercialized for various biomedical diagnostics in recent years and have also been considered as a method of choice in clinical laboratories and personalized diagnosis. In this paper, we have discussed the engineering aspects of cellulose-based sensors that have been reported where such matrices have been used to develop various analytical modules for the detection of small molecules, metal ions, macromolecules, and cells present in a diverse range of samples.

Although the plant is known to treat ulcers, there is no significant scientific validation. The present study aimed to assess the acute toxicity, subacute toxicity, and antiulcer properties of the leaf methanol extract of I. wightii (IWL). In the subacute study, the extracts were given orally at 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg doses for 28 days, and we analyzed the biochemical and histological parameters to evaluate the toxicity of IWL. Two different models were assessed to explore antiulcer properties, such as indomethacin- and ethanol-induced ulcer model. Ulcer areas and ulceration percentage histopathology of the stomach were used to study the efficacy of extracts. The acute toxicity study showed that IWL was safe to the maximum dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight. In a subacute toxicity study, the oral administration of IWL did not produce any mortality in the tested animals. The analysis of haematological, liver biochemical, kidney profile, lipid profile, and in vivo antioxidant parameters depicted that all the values were within the control limits after the experimental period and were considered nontoxic to animals. Additionally, the antiulcer study demonstrated a positive response of IWL in a dose-related manner (indomethacin- and ethanol-induced models). Macroscopic analysis showed that pretreatment with I. wightii leaf methanol extract significantly reduced the gastric lesion and decreased the ulceration area (14.52 mm(2)), demonstrating superior results to the positive control group (27.71 mm(2)). The histopathological analysis revealed that pretreatment with a high dose of 400 mg/kg of I. wightii leaf methanol extract and positive control group (omeprazole) markedly protected pathological effects, and the gastric mucosa appeared normal. In conclusion, I. wightii has solid nontoxic potential as a promising native herb for an integral therapy for the treatment of ulcers.","output":"Toxicity and Antiulcer Properties of Ipomoea wightii (Wall.)

Several patient-centred and external factors, e.g., drugs, comorbidities, trauma, environmental temperature, type of anaesthesia, as well as extent and duration of surgery, influence core temperature. Perioperative hypothermia has negative effects on coagulation, blood loss and transfusion requirements, metabolization of drugs, surgical site infections, and discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit. Therefore, active temperature management is required in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative period to diminish the risks of perioperative hypothermia. Temperature measurement should be done with accurate and continuous probes.

A number of variants of the TSST exist, including ones for children, groups, and virtual reality. All of these versions, though, require in-person assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic has made in-person assessment impossible or extremely difficult and potentially dangerous. The purpose of this study was to validate a completely remote, online, version of the TSST for children. METHOD A sample of 68 (27 female) 15- and 16-year old participants were administered the TSST-Online (TSST-OL) during the late afternoon hours (3-6 p.m. start time). The participants, judges (one male, one female), and experimenter (female) all joined the assessment from their own homes via the online platform, ZOOM?. Two sessions were conducted, one to obtain consent, explain procedures, work with the family to arrange the computer and room set-up for the TSST-OL and one within two weeks to conduct the procedure. The participants were trained to take their own saliva samples and a saliva sampling kit was mailed to the home in between the first and second session. The samples were then mailed to the researchers within a day of collection. The participant was observed during saliva collection to determine correct procedures were followed. Salivary cortisol, salivary -amylase and self-reports of stress were measured multiple times over the second session. RESULTS rmANOVAs yielded a significant effect of trials, for cortisol, F(1.37,90.46) = 15.13, p = .001, sAA, F(2.75,146.68) = 6.91, p = .001, and self-rated stress, F(3.43,222.69) = 118.73, p = .001. There were no significant sex by trials interactions for any measure, although females reported more stress than males, F(1,65) = 9.14, p = .004. For cortisol, from baseline to expected peak (30 min after the onset of speech preparation), the Cohen's effect size was dz = 0.57. Using 1.5 nmol/l (or 0.54 g/dl) as the criterion for a response (Miller, Plessow, Kirschaum, & Stalder, 2013), 63% of the participants produced a significant increase in cortisol. CONCLUSIONS The responses to the TSST-OL are consistent with in-person responses among children and adolescents (see recent meta-analysis (Seddon et al., 2020). The protocol is a viable way of assessing reactivity of the HPA axis and other stress systems without needing to bring the participant into the research laboratory. This method will be useful during periods of widespread infection. It should also work to study populations who all live too far from the research laboratory to be assessed in person.","output":"Validation of an online version of the Trier Social Stress Test in a study of adolescents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 pandemic recently has a great impact on personalized protection and healthcare, especially in the area of the respiratory mask However, due to the complex relationship between filtration performance and thermal management, there is a lack of investigation considering both characters in respirators Woolen knitwears are recently well acknowledged as textiles for both hot and cold because of their superior water\\\\actuated shape memory performance To incorporate protective function against bacteria, virus, microdroplet, and particulate matter, melt\\\\blown polypropylene can be introduced as a barrier layer Herein, a robust and sustainable bio\\\\based woolen respirator with the superior ability of thermal management is prepared using simple knitting and melt\\\\blown technology The as\\\\prepared respirators provide excellent protection from airborne particulate along with the high level of comfort, compared with a commercial mask Moreover, it exhibits a high rating during wear trial This provides a new insight to develop high quality sustainable respiratory mask with an excellent comfort performance from functional biomaterials [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Advanced Materials Technologies is the property of John Wiley & Sons, Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Woolen Respirators for Thermal Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented scale of testing required to effectively control the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated urgent implementation of rapid testing in clinical microbiology laboratories.

Here, we performed a prospective validation study of a commercially available assay, the AusDiagnostics Coronavirus Typing (8-well) assay. Respiratory tract samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing were collected between 1 March and 25 March 2020. All positive samples and a random subset of negative samples were sent to a reference laboratory for confirmation. In total, 2673 samples were analysed using the Coronavirus Typing assay. The predominant sample type was a combined nasopharyngeal/throat swab (2640/2673; 98.8%). Fifty-four patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (2.0%) using the Coronavirus Typing assay; 53/54 (98.1%) positive results and 621/621 (100%) negative results were concordant with the reference laboratory. Compared to the reference laboratory gold standard, sensitivity of the Coronavirus Typing assay for SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (95% CI 93.2-100%), specificity 99.8% (95% CI 99.1-100%), positive predictive value 98.1% (95% CI 90.2-99.7%) and negative predictive value 100% (95% CI 99.4-100%). In many countries, standard regulatory requirements for the introduction of new assays have been replaced by emergency authorisations and it is critical that laboratories share their post-market validation experiences, as the consequences of widespread introduction of a suboptimal assay for SARS-CoV-2 are profound.

This ongoing observational study aimed to describe the level of post-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibodies depending on B lymphocyte count, current therapy, and remission status of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and related plasma cell dyscrasias, after the first dose of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Methods In this single-center study, patients aged 18 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of MM, monoclonal gammopathies of clinical significance (MGCS) or systemic light-chain amyloidosis (AL) who were eligible for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination according to the International Myeloma Society recommendations were included. Data were collected between January 1st and May 21th, 2021, at the department of oncology and hematology at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate a possible correlation between antibody titers and CD19+ B lymphocyte count and secondary to identify other possible factors influencing immune response. This study is part of the COVIDOUT trial (NCT04779346). Written informed consent was provided by each patient according to local requirements. Results A total of 82 patients were included in this study. The median age was 67.5 years (range 40-85 years). 78 patients had MM, 2 MGCS, and 2 AL. Overall, 63 patients were vaccinated with mRNA-based and 19 with vector-based vaccines, respectively. At the time of vaccination, 69 (84.1%) patients were under current anti-myeloma treatment. In total, 34 (41%) patients received anti-CD38-targeting therapies and 52 (63%) patients received IMiD-based therapies. 57 (69.5%) patients were in deep remissions (very good partial remission or better) at the time of vaccination. Assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody titer (SP-AbT) took place on a median of 25 days after the first vaccination (SD  11.8). A positive SP-AbT was detected in 23% (17/74) of assessable patients. A cut-off value of  30 CD19+ B cells/l was significantly positively correlating with higher SARS-CoV-2 SP-AbT. Individuals with current anti-CD38-antibody treatment showed lower SP-AbT and the likelihood for positive titer results was significantly lower in patients with current anti-CD38 treatment compared to those without. Treatment with immunomodulatory drugs did not harm the development of antibody titers. Furthermore, in multivariable linear regression, higher age and insufficiently controlled disease ( partial remission) were significantly negatively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 SP-AbT. Conclusion Based on our results, the majority of myeloma patients respond poorly after receiving the first dose of any anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Since both low CD19+ B lymphocyte count and CD38-directed therapy negatively impact vaccination response, booster vaccination seems therefore of utter importance.","output":"OAB-049: Poor post-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibody response in patients with Multiple Myeloma correlates with low CD19+ B-lymphocyte count and anti-CD38 treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic forced society to shift to remote education and work This shift relies on various video conference systems (VCSs) such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Jitsi, consequently increasing pressure on their digital service infrastructure Although understanding the performance of these essential cloud services could lead to better designs and improved service deployments, only limited research on this topic currently exists Addressing this problem, in this work we propose an experimental method to analyze and compare VCSs Our method is based on real-world experiments where the client-side is controlled, and focuses on VCS resource requirements and performance We design and implement a tool to automatically conduct these real-world experiments, and use it to compare three platforms on the client side: Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Jitsi Our work exposes that there are significant differences between the systems tested in terms of resource usage and performance variability, and provides evidence for a suspected memory leak in Zoom, the system widely regarded as the industry market leader ? 2021 Association for Computing Machinery","output":"An empirical evaluation of the performance of video conferencing systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to explore university students' perceptions and experiences of SARS-CoV-2 mass asymptomatic testing, social distancing and self-isolation, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Participants were purposively sampled university students (n = 25) representing a range of gender, age, living circumstances (on/off campus), and SARS-CoV-2 testing/self-isolation experiences. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Six themes with 16 sub-themes emerged from the analysis of the qualitative data: 'Term-time Experiences', 'Risk Perception and Worry', 'Engagement in Protective Behaviours', 'Openness to Testing', 'Barriers to Testing' and 'General Wellbeing'. Students described feeling safe on campus, believed most of their peers are adherent to protective behaviours and were positive towards asymptomatic testing in university settings. University communications about COVID-19 testing and social behaviours need to be timely and presented in a more inclusive way to reach groups of students who currently feel marginalised. Barriers to engagement with SARS-CoV-2 testing, social distancing and self-isolation were primarily associated with fear of the mental health impacts of self-isolation, including worry about how they will cope, high anxiety, low mood, guilt relating to impact on others and loneliness. Loneliness in students could be mitigated through increased intra-university communications and a focus on establishment of low COVID-risk social activities to help students build and enhance their social support networks. These findings are particularly pertinent in the context of mass asymptomatic testing programmes being implemented in educational settings and high numbers of students being required to self-isolate. Universities need to determine the support needs of students during self-isolation and prepare for the long-term impacts of the pandemic on student mental health and welfare support services.","output":"Students' Views towards Sars-Cov-2 Mass Asymptomatic Testing, Social Distancing and Self-Isolation in a University Setting during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are critically involved in basic brain functions and neurodegeneration as well as tumor invasiveness.

The goal of this study was to assess the magnitude and overtime changes of inequalities in vitamin A supplementation among children aged 6-59 months in Ethiopia. Methods: We extracted data from four waves of the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys (2000, 2005, 2011, and 2016). The analysis was carried out using the 2019 updated World Health Organization's Health Equity Assessment Toolkit software that facilitates the use of stored data from World Health Organization's Health Equity Monitor Database. We conducted analysis of inequality in vitamin A supplementation by five equity stratifiers: household economic status, educational status, place of residence, child's sex, and subnational region. Four summary measures-population attributable fraction, ratio, difference, and population attributable risk-were assessed. We computed 95% uncertainty intervals for each point estimate to ascertain statistical significance of the observed vitamin A supplementation inequalities and overtime disparities. Results: The findings suggest marked absolute and relative pro-rich (population attributable fraction = 29.51, 95% uncertainty interval; 25.49-33.53, population attributable risk = 13.18, 95% uncertainty intervals; 11.38-14.98) and pro-urban (difference = 16.55, 95% uncertainty intervals; 11.23-21.87, population attributable fraction = 32.95, 95% uncertainty intervals; 32.12-33.78) inequalities.

In asthma, levels of exhaled NO have been utilized as a window into airway inflammation caused by allergic processes. However, respiratory infections count among the most important triggers of disease exacerbations. Among the multitude of factors that affect NO levels are psychological processes. In particular, longer lasting states of psychological stress and depression have been shown to attenuate NO production. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has caused a pandemic, and with that, sustained levels of psychological stress globally, also adversely affects NO signaling. We review evidence on the role of NO in respiratory infection, including COVID-19, and stress, and argue that boosting NO bioavailability may be beneficial in protection from infections, thus benefitting individuals who suffer from stress in asthma or SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Boosting Nitric Oxide in Stress and Respiratory Infection: Potential Relevance for Asthma and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective lecturing stimulates learning, creates a verbal history for our profession, and is a central basis for evaluating academic promotion.

The identification and characterization of interactions between cellular and pathogenic components are essential for the development of antiviral treatments. Due to its small-sized genome, HBV highly depends on cellular functions to produce and export progeny particles. Deploying biochemical-silencing methods and molecular interaction studies in HBV-expressing liver cells, we herein identified the cellular ERGIC-53, a high-mannose-specific lectin, and distinct components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export machinery COPII as crucial factors of viral trafficking and egress. Whereas the COPII subunits Sec24A, Sec23B and Sar1 are needed for both viral and subviral HBV particle exit, ERGIC-53 appears as an exclusive element of viral particle propagation, therefore interacting with the N146-glycan of the HBV envelope in a productive manner. Cell-imaging studies pointed to ER-derived, subcellular compartments where HBV assembly initiates. Moreover, our findings provide evidence that HBV exploits the functions of ERGIC-53 and Sec24A after the envelopment of nucleocapsids at these compartments in conjunction with endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) components.

A directed content analysis approach including quantitative data processing was used to analyse the transcribed data. RESULTS Through the analysis of 3912 statements, scripts were identified and a nursing script model is proposed; the medical illness script, including enabling conditions, fault and consequences, is extended with management, boundary, impact, occurrence and explicative statements. Nurses often used explicative statements when pathophysiological causes are absent or unknown. To explore the applicability of Illness script theory we analysed scripts' richness and maturity with descriptive statistics. Expert nurses, like medical experts, had rich knowledge of consequences, explicative statements and management of familiar patient problems. CONCLUSION The knowledge of expert nurses about patient problems can be described in scripts; the components of medical illness scripts are also relevant in nursing. We propose to extend the original illness script concept with management, explicative statements, boundary, impact and occurrence, to enlarge the applicability of illness scripts in the nursing domain.

HYPOTHESIS To examine the relationship between media reports of the swine flu and self-registrations in an emergency department (ED) of a tertiary hospital in Flanders, Belgium. METHODS All articles concerning swine flu published in seven Flemish newspapers were selected during the biggest flu peak in Belgium. This number was compared with the number of patients who presented themselves with a self-diagnosis of swine flu symptoms during the same time frame. The Pearson's correlation coefficient was selected to determine the relationship. The cross-correlation function determined the direction of this relationship. RESULTS A strong correlation was found between the number of potential patients (n = 308) and the number of articles in the Flemish press (n = 1657). The number of patients was the leading indicator; increases in the volume of written press followed increases in the number of patients. CONCLUSION Media reporting is extensive when a new infectious disease breaks out and intensifies when it is feared that pandemic levels are reached. This was also the case with the swine flu outbreak in Flanders.

Sample retention of the 3D swab is governed by the volume, porosity density, and void fraction of the head as well as by the pore geometry. 3D-printed swabs outperform conventional flock-head swabs in terms of sample retention. It is argued that mechanically functional designs of the swab head, such as corkscrew-shaped heads and negative Poisson ratio heads, maximize sample retention and improve patient comfort. In addition, available designs of swab shafts for an optimized sample collection procedure are characterized. The study is conducted in vitro, using artificial mucus, covering the full range of human mucus viscosities in a 3D-printed model of a nasal cavity. The work sets the path for the resilient supply of widespread sterile testing equipment as a rapid response to the current and future pandemics.","output":"Rapid Fabrication of Sterile Medical Nasopharyngeal Swabs by Stereolithography for Widespread Testing in a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automation is considered as the driving force of Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) to develop smart and automated devices for existing manufacturing processes.

A collateral effect of these lockdowns may be a change to transmission dynamics of a wide range of infectious diseases that are all highly dependent on rates of contact between humans. With timing, duration and intensity of lockdowns varying country-to-country, the wave of lockdowns in 2020 present a unique opportunity to observe how changes in human contact rates, disease control and surveillance affect dengue virus transmission in a global natural experiment. We explore the theoretical basis for the impact of lockdowns on dengue transmission and surveillance then summarise the current evidence base from country reports. RECENT FINDINGS: We find considerable variation in the intensity of dengue epidemics reported so far in 2020 with some countries experiencing historic low levels of transmission while others are seeing record outbreaks. Despite many studies warning of the risks of lockdown for dengue transmission, few empirically quantify the impact and issues such as the specific timing of the lockdowns and multi-annual cycles of dengue are not accounted for. In the few studies where such issues have been accounted for, the impact of lockdowns on dengue appears to be limited. SUMMARY: Studying the impact of lockdowns on dengue transmission is important both in how we deal with the immediate COVID-19 and dengue crisis, but also over the coming years in the post-pandemic recovery period. It is clear lockdowns have had very different impacts in different settings. Further analyses might ultimately allow this unique natural experiment to provide insights into how to better control dengue that will ultimately lead to better long-term control.","output":"What Is the Impact of Lockdowns on Dengue?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had devastating health and socio-economic impacts. Human activities, especially at the wildlife interphase, are at the core of forces driving the emergence of new viral agents. Global surveillance activities have identified bats as the natural hosts of diverse coronaviruses, with other domestic and wildlife animal species possibly acting as intermediate or spillover hosts. The African continent is confronted by several factors that challenge prevention and response to novel disease emergences, such as high species diversity, inadequate health systems, and drastic social and ecosystem changes. We reviewed published animal coronavirus surveillance studies conducted in Africa, specifically summarizing surveillance approaches, species numbers tested, and findings. Far more surveillance has been initiated among bat populations than other wildlife and domestic animals, with nearly 26,000 bat individuals tested. Though coronaviruses have been identified from approximately 7% of the total bats tested, surveillance among other animals identified coronaviruses in less than 1%. In addition to a large undescribed diversity, sequences related to four of the seven human coronaviruses have been reported from African bats. The review highlights research gaps and the disparity in surveillance efforts between different animal groups (particularly potential spillover hosts) and concludes with proposed strategies for improved future biosurveillance.","output":"Overview of bat and wildlife Coronavirus surveillance in Africa: a framework for global investigations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus has resulted in inevitable radical changes across almost all areas of daily life, with the pandemic having revealed perhaps the greatest crisis humanity has faced in modern history.

METHODS Cancer Genome Atlas Sequence Read Archive (SRA) was used to get RNA sequencing data for CRC-LM and primary CRC. The CDseqR deconvolution method followed by the edgeR statistical approach was employed to accurately find differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to determine the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA pairs in CRC-LM etiology. Three alternative methods were used to explore fusion transcripts to anticipate the potential driver chimeras. RESULTS Multiple cancer-related pathways were enriched in the up-regulated genes, including cell cycle, DNA replication, and RNA transport. SPP1 was the most up-regulated gene important in the cellular proliferation and migration and CCDC152 was the most down-regulated gene known in the metastatic spread of CRC. There were seven distinct lncRNAs discovered, two of which were novel (LOC107984834 and LOC107985040) and associated with metastatic related pathways such as the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction. Overall survival analysis demonstrated that SPP1 and LOC107985040 were significantly associated with poor prognosis outcomes. Seven new fusion transcripts were found in seven CRC-LM patients (22.5%) anticipated to have potential driver functions in cancer. CONCLUSION The newly discovered dysregulated genes and other transcriptome abnormalities could contribute to a better understanding of the CRC-LM underlying mechanism, leading to the development of new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic molecular options for personalized medicine.","output":"Transcriptome analysis of colorectal cancer liver metastasis: The importance of long non-coding RNAs and fusion transcripts in the disease pathogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about clusters of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in acute care hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To describe the detection, mitigation, and analysis of a large cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections in an acute care hospital with mature infection control policies. DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: Patients and staff with cluster-related SARS-CoV-2 infections. INTERVENTION: Close contacts of infected patients and staff were identified and tested every 3 days, patients on affected units were preemptively isolated and repeatedly tested, affected units were cleaned, room ventilation was measured, and specimens were sent for whole-genome sequencing. A caseCcontrol study was done to compare clinical interactions, personal protective equipment use, and breakroom and workroom practices in SARS-CoV-2Cpositive versus negative staff. MEASUREMENTS: Description of the cluster, mitigation activities, and risk factor analysis. RESULTS: Fourteen patients and 38 staff members were included in the cluster per whole-genome sequencing and epidemiologic associations. The index case was a symptomatic patient in whom isolation was discontinued after 2 negative results on nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction testing. The patient subsequently infected multiple roommates and staff, who then infected others. Seven of 52 (13%) secondary infections were detected only on second or subsequent tests. Eight of 9 (89%) patients who shared rooms with potentially contagious patients became infected. Potential contributing factors included high viral loads, nebulization, and positive pressure in the index patient's room. Risk factors for transmission to staff included presence during nebulization, caring for patients with dyspnea or cough, lack of eye protection, at least 15 minutes of exposure to case patients, and interactions with SARS-CoV-2Cpositive staff in clinical areas. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that 2 staff members were infected despite wearing surgical masks and eye protection. LIMITATION: Findings may not be generalizable.

METHODS: We consulted eight web pages of transnational organizations, 17 of international media, 99 of government institutions in the 19 countries included, and besides, we included nine studies (out of 34 identified) that met inclusion criteria. RESULT: Some countries are focused on establishing travel restrictions, isolation of identified cases, and high-risk people. Others have a combination of mandatory quarantine and other drastic social distancing measures. The timing to implement the interventions varied from the first fifteen days after detecting the first case to more than 30 days. The effectiveness of isolated non-pharmaceutical interventions may be limited, but combined interventions have shown to be effective in reducing the transmissibility of the disease, the collapse of health care services, and mortality. When the number of new cases has been controlled, it is necessary to maintain social distancing measures, self-isolation, and contact tracing for several months. The policy decision-making in this time should be aimed to optimize the opportunities of saving lives, reducing the collapse of health services, and minimizing the economic and social impact over the general population, but principally over the most vulnerable.

We then propose two uncertainty-aware signal temporal logic (STL) inference approaches to classify the undesired behaviors and desired behaviors of a system. Instead of classifying finitely many trajectories, we classify infinitely many trajectories within the interval trajectories. In the first approach, we incorporate robust semantics of STL formulas with respect to an interval trajectory to quantify the margin at which an STL formula is satisfied or violated by the interval trajectory. The second approach relies on the first learning algorithm and exploits the decision tree to infer STL formulas to classify behaviors of a given system. The proposed approaches also work for non-separable data by optimizing the worst-case robustness in inferring an STL formula. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in two case studies, where the proposed algorithms show reductions in the computation time by up to four orders of magnitude in comparison with the sampling-based baseline algorithms (for a dataset with 800 sampled trajectories in total).","output":"Uncertainty-Aware Signal Temporal Logic Inference"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes is the greatest public condition among patients with coronavirus disease and has been found to affect prognosis worldwide It is revealed that hyperglycemia is one of the elements that elevates the risk of consequences in these persons This study designed to analysis the overall features of the novel coronavirus and provide an understanding of the coronavirus disease in diabetic patients, and its treatment These patients are usually treated with various medications and this review clarify the role of metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors as helpful factors in these patients Recommendations are made on the probable pathophysiological mechanisms of the association between coronavirus and diabetes, and its management Additional study about this association and its clinical managing is necessary ? 2021, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications All rights reserved","output":"Diabetes and covid-19 pandemic: A potential mechanisms: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The SARS-CoV-2 virus is causing severe end-stage fibrosis and respiratory failure in otherwise healthy individuals Lung transplant (LTX) has been performed internationally in select patients for this indication, but there is limited evidence on its role in COVID-19 We describe a patient who received a bilateral LTX 12 weeks after an initial diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia Case Report A 51-year-old male with hypertension and presented to an outlying hospital with dyspnea, fever and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 He was hypoxic and a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was made by nasopharyngeal swab He was treated with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma, mechanical ventilation and eventually femoral VV-ECMO cannulation to maintain oxygenation He was extubated and was transitioned to a left subclavian dual-limb 30 Fr VV-ECMO cannula for improved rehabilitation He was then transferred to our center for LTX consideration given refractory ARDS Evaluation for LTX revealed pulmonary hypertension, negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and deconditioning but no absolute contraindications He participated in intensive rehabilitation and progressed to assisted steps despite severe deconditioning and hypoxia He was listed for a bilateral lung transplant with a lung allocation score of 90 and received a donor offer 7 days after listing and after 82 days on ECMO He underwent bilateral LTX via clamshell exposure with central VA ECMO support Intraoperatively, the lungs were densely consolidated with severe hilar adenopathy without peripheral adhesions Post-operatively, he was transitioned back to his original VV ECMO circuit and then decannulated on post-op day 3 Standard induction with basiliximab and immunosuppression with IV methylprednisolone, mycophenolate and tacrolimus was administered He had a transient elevation of liver enzymes on post-operative day 1 and an early planned tracheostomy was performed due to deconditioning He has since, been progressing well on oxygen via tracheostomy collar and is able to speak with a one-way valve and participate in rehabilitation Summary For patients with irreversible end-stage lung disease after COVID-19 pneumonia, LTX is a viable option Timely transfer to a lung transplant center and intensive rehabilitation are essential Standard established immunosuppression and post-transplant protocols should be followed","output":"Bilateral Lung Transplantation for End-Stage Respiratory Failure from COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, in which acute respiratory infections are associated with high socio-economic burden.

This has lead to an increased desire to leave the profession. Since thoughts of leaving are influenced by factors such as ability to work and the relationship between effort and reward, both should be recorded and examined in relation to the desire to leave the profession. METHODOLOGY: In a standardized, online-based cross-sectional study, nurses from all areas were asked about their ability to work (Work Ability Index: WAI), the ratio of effort and reward (Effort-Reward-Imbalance: ERI-Ratio) as well as their desire to either leave the job or to change employers. RESULTS: A total of 2,689 questionnaires returned by nurses (average 41.3 years old, 75.1% female) were evaluated. The WAI indicates an average working ability (37.9 (6.7)). Nurses put in more effort than they get rewarded for (ERI ratio 1.7 (0.5)). 38.3% of the nurses considered leaving their job several times a month or more frequently, 30.6% to change their employers. Predicting factors were WAI (OR 0.881, 95%-CI 0.866; 0.897 and 0.923, 95%-CI 0.908; 0.938) and ERI ratio (OR 4.076, 95%-CI 3.224; 5.149 and 4.203, 95%-CI 3.312; 5.334). CONCLUSION: The ability to work and, in particular, the perception of professional effort and the reward received becomes apparent as having an influence on the idea of leaving the profession. The present results show that the ERI is of particular importance. Accordingly, it is important to find out which reward factors have a positive effect on remaining in the profession.

Investing in characterising the SARS-CoV2 will help plan and improve the response to the pandemic. Furthermore, it will help identify the most efficient ways of managing the pandemic, avoiding public health policies and interventions that may be unduly restrictive of normal activity or unnecessarily costly. This paper describes the design and reports findings of a population based epidemiological study undertaken to characterise SARS-CoV2 in Qatar using limited resources in a timely manner. METHODS: Asymptomatic individuals 10 years registered with Qatars publicly funded primary health provider were eligible. A stratified random sampling technique was utilized to identify the study sample. Participants were invited to an appointment where they completed a questionnaire and provided samples for polymerase chain reaction and Immunoglobulin M and G immunoassay tests. Data collected were analyzed to calculate point and period prevalence by sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of 18,918 individuals invited for the study, 2084 participated (response rate 10.8%). The overall point prevalence and period prevalence were estimated to be 1.6% (95% CI 1.1C2.2) and 14.6% (95% CI 13.1C16.2) respectively. Period prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection was not considerably different across age groups (9.7C19.8%). It was higher in males compared to females (16.2 and 12.7% respectively). A significant variation was observed by nationality (7.1 to 22.2%) and municipalities (6.9C35.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides an example of a methodologically robust approach that can be undertaken in a timely manner with limited resources. It reports much-needed epidemiological data about the spread of SARS-CoV2. Given the low prevalence rates, majority of the population in Qatar remains susceptible.

The article also explores how the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic affected farming operations, the financial viability of farms, and how farmers responded to the challenges posed by the pandemic. The study found that People of Color farm owners/operators were younger than White farm owners/operators. The People of Color farm owners/operators tended to manage smaller farms for shorter periods than White farm owners/operators. Though two-thirds of the Farmers of Color owned their farms, they were more financially vulnerable than White farm owners/operators. The farmers studied had difficulty obtaining loans to finance their farms. Farmers reported increasing requests from people for food assistance during the pandemic. Farmers responded to the pandemic by participating in government programs such as the Farm to Families Food Box Program that purchased their produce. It allowed farmers to supply emergency food assistance programs with products from their farms.

The human microbiome project led to continuing interest in the ocular microbiome. Typically, ocular microflorae are commensals of low diversity that colonize the external and internal sites of the eye, without instigating any disorders. Ocular commensals modulate immunity and optimally regulate host defense against pathogenic invasion, both on the ocular surface and neuroretina. Yet, any alteration in this symbiotic relationship culminates in the perturbation of ocular homeostasis and shifts the equilibrium toward local or systemic inflammation and, in turn, impaired visual function. A compositional variation in the ocular microbiota is associated with surface disorders such as keratitis, blepharitis, and conjunctivitis. Nevertheless, innovative studies now implicate non-ocular microbial dysbiosis in glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), uveitis, and diabetic retinopathy. Accordingly, prompt identification of the extra-ocular etiology and a methodical understanding of the mechanisms of invasion and host-microbial interaction is of paramount importance for preventative and therapeutic interventions for vision-threatening conditions.

METHODS: This study evaluated the association of underlying CV conditions with disease progression in patients with mild COVID-19. The primary outcome was the need to be transferred to the designated hospital for intensive care due to COVID-19 disease progression. The patients were divided into with and without CV conditions as well as stable and intensive care groups. RESULTS: Of the 332 patients with mild COVID-19, the median age was 51 years (IQR, 40-59 years), and 200 (61.2%) were female. Of the 48 (14.5%) patients with CV conditions, 23 (47.9%) progressed to severe disease status and required intensive care. Compared with patients without CV conditions, patients with CV conditions were older and more likely to have fatigue, chest tightness, and myalgia. The rate of requiring intensive care was significantly higher among patients with CV conditions than in patients without CV conditions (47.92% vs. 12.4%; P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the rate of requiring intensive care was also higher among patients with either hypertension or coronary heart disease (CHD) than in patients without hypertension or CHD. The multivariable regression model showed that CV condition served as an independent risk factor for intensive care (odds ratio (OR), 2.652 (95% CI, 1.019-6.899)) after adjustment for various cofounders.

Abstract Doing research in psychology in the medical field represents a true challenge for the psychologists and clinicians who practice in somatic services.

The body that the doctor treats, cuts, or heals has, indeed, barely anything in common with the patient subjectivity that interests the psychologist. The doctor and the nursing staff in general must, in order to bear the intrusive and sometimes aggressive acts that their work requires, defend themselves mentally, via sometimes massive strategies that stand in the way of psychologists work of untangling and comprehending psychic and emotional phenomena.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of proteases in these alterations by subjecting rat hearts to different times of global ischemia, as well as reperfusion after 45 min of ischemia. Decreases in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity at 30-60 min of global ischemia were accompanied by augmented activities of both calpain and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and depressed protein content of (1)- and (2)-subunits, without changes in (1)- and (2)-subunits of the enzyme. Compared with control values, the activities of both calpain and MMP-2 were increased, whereas the activity and protein content for all subunits of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were decreased upon reperfusion for 5-40 min, except that (1)- and (2)-subunit content was not depressed in 5 min I/R hearts. MDL28170, a calpain inhibitor, was more effective in attenuating the I/R-induced alterations in cardiac contracture, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity, and (2)-subunit than doxycycline, an MMP inhibitor. Incubation of control sarcolemma preparation with calpain, unlike MMP-2, depressed Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity and decreased (1)-, (2)-, and (2)-subunits, without changes in the (1)-subunit.

The authors implemented an electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical pathway that could be accessed by clinicians within existing workflows when caring for patients under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19. The objective was to examine the association between clinical pathway utilization and adherence to institutional best practice treatment recommendations for COVID-19. METHODS The authors conducted an observational analysis of all ED patients seen in a health system inclusive of seven EDs between March 18, 2020, and April 20, 2021. They implemented the pathway as an interactive flow chart that allowed clinicians to place orders while viewing the most up-to-date institutional guidance. Primary outcomes were proportion of admitted PUIs receiving dexamethasone and aspirin in the ED, and secondary outcome was time to delivering treatment. RESULTS A total of 13 269 patients were admitted PUIs. The pathway was used by 40.6% of ED clinicians. When clinicians used the pathway, patients were more likely to be prescribed aspirin (OR, 7.15; 95% CI, 6.2-8.26) and dexamethasone (10.4; 8.85-12.2). For secondary outcomes, clinicians using the pathway had statistically significant (P < 0.0001) improvement in timeliness of ordering medications and admission to the hospital. Aspirin, dexamethasone, and admission order time were improved by 103.89, 94.34, and 121.94 minutes, respectively.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional prevalence study at three maternity hospitals (one tertiary referral hospital and two secondary maternities) in Melbourne, Australia. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered to all pregnant women attending face-to-face antenatal visits and to those attending the hospital with symptoms of possible coronavirus disease, between 6th and 19th of May 2020. Testing was performed by multiplex-tandem polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs. The primary outcome was the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in 350 women, of whom 19 had symptoms of possible COVID-19. The median maternal age was 32 years (IQR 28-35 years), and the median gestational age at testing was 33 weeks and four days (IQR 28 weeks to 36 weeks and two days).

Recurrent infection is especially challenging, with each recurrence increasing the likelihood of a successive recurrence, leading to cycles of prolonged symptoms, frequent antimicrobial use, and decreased quality of life. Fecal microbiota transplantation to prevent recurrent infection is a promising intervention with a large effect size in observational studies, but with conflicting results from randomized controlled trials. We are conducting a Veterans Affairs-wide randomized controlled trial utilizing centralized case identification, with enrollment and fecal microbiota transplant administration occurring at the participant's home. This type of trial design significantly improves trial efficiency, greatly decreases trial cost, increases consistency of trial administration, and most importantly makes nationwide clinical trials in less-common diseases possible. METHODS: This is a randomized comparison of capsule-delivered fecal microbiota transplant for the prevention of recurrent Clostridiodes difficile infection, administered after successful initial treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection with standard therapy. The primary endpoint is the incidence of recurrent C. difficile infection or death. Cases are identified by searching the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse, with central study coordinators then reaching out to potential participants. Individuals meeting inclusion criteria and interested in participation are scheduled for in-home consent, randomization, and capsule administration, followed by telephone follow-up for 6 months. To mitigate risks of COVID-19, enrollment via video visits has been implemented. RESULTS: A total of 102 participants have been enrolled through January 2021.

How the concerted action of T and B cell clones is associated with the development and clinical evolution of immune-mediated diseases is still not known. Using a new immunosequencing technology that allows the unbiased amplification of the seven receptor chains, we conducted an in-depth quantitative analysis of the seven-receptor chain variability in RA. Compared to healthy controls, the AIRR in RA was found to be characterized by a lower BCR diversity, the depletion of highly similar BCR clones, an isotype-specific signature as well as a skewed IGL chain and gene segment usage. A predictor based on quantitative multi-chain AIRR information was able to accurately predict disease, including the elusive seronegative subset of RA patients. AIRR features of the seven immune receptor chains were also different between patients with distinct clinically relevant phenotypes. Incorporating HLA variation data, we were able to identify the TCR clones that are specifically associated with disease risk variants. The longitudinal analysis of the AIRR revealed that treatment with Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitors selectively restores the diversity of B cell clones in RA patients by reducing the frequency of clones with a similar biochemical profile. The biochemical properties of the TNFi-modulated clones were also found to differ between responders and non-responders, supporting a different antigenic reactivity in the B cell compartment of these two groups of RA patients.

RPE lesions on OCT images showed RPE detachment in 17 eyes (61.5%), small protrusion of the RPE layer in 5 eyes (7.5%), and a rough RPE layer in 4 eyes (31%). After laser treatment, 9 points (35%) showed retinal detachment, and 10 (38.5%) regions showed an irregular RPE layer. An irregularly protruded RPE layer was also observed in different regions of the leakage spot in 5 (19%) eyes, and RPE defects were seen in 2 (7.5%) eyes. Navigated laser photocoagulation for chronic CSCR can achieve substantial anatomical and visual improvement. OCT outcomes may provide new information to facilitate understanding of the mechanism of chronic CSCR. Navigated laser photocoagulation should be chosen as an optimal treatment option in patients with chronic CSCR who cannot afford photodynamic therapy.","output":"Efficacy of Navigated Laser Photocoagulation for Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy: A Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) affects several organs including the kidneys. When examining patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) due to COVID-19, it is important to consider the circadian rhythm because in addition to its biological clock function, disruption of the circadian rhythm has been reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of several disorders, including AKI. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), displays circadian rhythmicity. Studies have shown that over-expression of human ACE2 increases the replication of SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to disruptions and tissue damage due to the suppression of the brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1(Bmal1) gene and high pro-inflammatory cytokines expressions in the tissues. Therefore, understanding and regulating the circadian rhythm and expression pattern of the key components of RAAS can prevent or reduce the severity of acute kidney injury that may occur with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Acute kidney injury due to COVID-19 and the circadian rhythm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, an ultra-portable ultrasound smart probe has proven to be one of the few practical diagnostic and monitoring tools for doctors who are fully covered with personal protective equipment.

We aimed to study the potential role of lung ultrasound score (LUS) in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational, prospective pilot study, including consecutive subjects admitted to an intermediate care unit due to COVID-19 pneumonia. LUS is a 12-zone examination method for lung parenchyma assessment. LUS was performed with a portable convex transducer, scores from 0 to 36 points. Clinical and demographic data were collected at LUS evaluation. Survival analysis was performed using a composite outcome including ICU admission or death. Subjects were followed for 30 d from LUS assessment. RESULTS: Of 36 subjects included, 69.4% were male, and mean age was 60.19  12.75 y. A cutoff LUS &#8805; 24 points showed 100% sensitivity, 69.2% specificity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 for predicting worse prognosis. The composite outcome was present in 10 subjects (55.6%) with LUS &#8805; 24 points, but not in the group with lower LUS scores (P < .001). Subjects with LUS &#8805; 24 points had a higher risk of ICU admission or death (hazard ratio 9.97 [95% CI 2.75-36.14], P < .001).

Although adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using lymphocytes isolated from TDLNs were reported, characterization of immune activity of lymphocytes in TDLNs to tumor cells was not comprehensively performed. Here, we demonstrate TDLNs to have very high potential as cell sources for immunotherapy. METHODS: Lymphocytes from TDLNs resected during surgical operation were cultured with autologous-tumor cells for 2 weeks and evaluated tumor-reactivity by IFN ELISPOT assay. We investigated the commonality of T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes expanded by the co-culture with tumor cells with those of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). RESULTS: We found that that TCR clonotypes of PD-1-expressing CD8(+) T cells in lymph nodes commonly shared with those of TILs in primary tumors and lymphocytes having tumor-reactivity and TCR clonotypes shared with TILs could be induced from non-metastatic lymph nodes when they were co-cultured with autologous tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that tumor-reactive effector T cells were present even in pathologically non-metastatic lymph nodes and could be expanded in vitro in the presence of autologous tumor cells and possibly be applied for ACT.

We present a longitudinal case study of non-invasive auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) in a patient diagnosed with chronic unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (previously known as vegetative state). Over a period of 6 months we applied taVNS daily and regularly evaluated the patients behavioral outcomes using Coma Recovery Scale C Revised. We also took electrophysiological measures: resting state electroencephalography (EEG), heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). All these methods revealed signs of improvement in the patients condition. The total CRS-R scores fluctuated but rose from 4 and 6 at initial stages to the heights of 12 and 13 in the 3rd and 5th month, which would warrant a change in diagnosis to a Minimally Conscious State. Scores obtained in a 2 months follow-up period, though, suggest this may not have been a lasting improvement. Behavioral signs of recovery are triangulated by EEG frequency spectrum profiles with re-emergence of a second oscillatory peak in the alpha range, which has been shown to characterize aware people. However, sustained spontaneous theta oscillations did not predictably diminish, which most likely reflects structural brain damage. ECG measures revealed a steady decrease in pre-stimulation HR combined with an increase in HRV-HR. This suggests a gradual withdrawal of sympathetic and an increase in parasympathetic control of the heart, which the previous literature has also linked with DoC improvements.

In comparison to 2019, the German mosses have higher contents of almost all elements and the Slovenian are enriched in Cr and Hg in 2020. Comparison of the PTE contents, their ratios to Sc, and the enrichment factors show that the COVID-19 lockdown led to a decrease in long-range pollutants bound to finest particles and increased the influence of local soil dusting.

However, the recent outcomes of this technology in terms of viability, fertilizing ability, embryo development and pregnancy remain poor. The high sensitivity of the oocytes to freezing has been correlated with the profound dynamics of oocyte structures and functions. As a result, cryoinjury inevitably occurs at several cellular levels, which is indeed detrimental to cell viability and subsequent development. Advancement in the improvement of freezing technology via modifications to freezing technique and development of novel cryodevices plays a central role in mitigating cryoinjury and efficiently empowering the outcomes of oocyte cryopreservation. However, empirical study and optimizations of the techniques are generally required for cryopreservation of oocytes from particular species. ABSTRACT: Oocyte cryopreservation plays important roles in basic research and the application of models for genetic preservation and in clinical situations. This technology provides long-term storage of gametes for genetic banking and subsequent use with other assisted reproductive technologies. Until recently, oocytes have remained the most difficult cell type to freeze, as the oocytes per se are large with limited surface area to cytoplasm ratio. They are also highly sensitive to damage during cryopreservation, and therefore the success rate of oocyte cryopreservation is generally poor when compared to noncryopreserved oocytes. Although advancement in oocyte cryopreservation has progressed rapidly for decades, the improvement of cryosurvival and clinical outcomes is still required. This review focuses on the principles, techniques, outcomes and prospects of oocyte cryopreservation in domestic animals and humans.","output":"Oocyte Cryopreservation in Domestic Animals and Humans: Principles, Techniques and Updated Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is unknown if patients with cancer and acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 have different clinical or cancer-related characteristics, decisions to forgo life-sustaining therapies (LST), and mortality compared to patients with cancer and acute respiratory failure due to other causes. In a cohort study, we tested the hypothesis that COVID-19 was associated with increased in-hospital mortality and decreased decisions to forgo LST in patients with cancer and acute respiratory failure. We employed two multivariate logistic regression models. Propensity score matching was employed as sensitivity analysis. We compared 382 patients without COVID-19 with 65 with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 had better performance status, less metastatic tumors, and progressive cancer. In-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was lower compared with patients without COVID-19 (46.2 vs. 74.6%; p < 0.01). However, the cause of acute respiratory failure (COVID-19 or other causes) was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.27 (0.55C2.93; 95% confidence interval, CI)] in the adjusted model.

While previous studies have demonstrated high predictive power of incorporating air travel data and governmental policy responses in global disease transmission modelling, factors influencing the decision to implement travel and border restriction policies have attracted relatively less attention. This paper examines the role of globalization on the pace of adoption of international travel-related non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the coronavirus pandemic. This study aims to offer advice on how to improve the global planning, preparation, and coordination of actions and policy responses during future infectious disease outbreaks with empirical evidence. METHODS AND DATA: We analyzed data on international travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 of 185 countries from January to October 2020. We applied time-to-event analysis to examine the relationship between globalization and the timing of travel restrictions implementation. RESULTS: The results of our survival analysis suggest that, in general, more globalized countries, accounting for the country-specific timing of the virus outbreak and other factors, are more likely to adopt international travel restrictions policies. However, countries with high government effectiveness and globalization were more cautious in implementing travel restrictions, particularly if through formal political and trade policy integration. This finding is supported by a placebo analysis of domestic NPIs, where such a relationship is absent. Additionally, we find that globalized countries with high state capacity are more likely to have higher numbers of confirmed cases by the time a first restriction policy measure was taken. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the dynamic relationship between globalization and protectionism when governments respond to significant global events such as a public health crisis. We suggest that the observed caution of policy implementation by countries with high government efficiency and globalization is a by-product of commitment to existing trade agreements, a greater desire to 'learn from others' and also perhaps of 'confidence' in a government's ability to deal with a pandemic through its health system and state capacity. Our results suggest further research is warranted to explore whether global infectious disease forecasting could be improved by including the globalization index and in particular, the de jure economic and political, and de facto social dimensions of globalization, while accounting for the mediating role of government effectiveness. By acting as proxies for a countries' likelihood and speed of implementation for international travel restriction policies, such measures may predict the likely time delays in disease emergence and transmission across national borders.","output":"How does globalization affect COVID-19 responses?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Watching the world come together to fight the coronavirus has been an eye opener This is the first time in living memory, at least for those born after World War II and after many colonies achieved independence, that a single issue has bothered so much of the world The Spanish flu, a century ago, is believed to have killed between 17 and 50 million people, and those figures tell us the scale of what may happen this time, too ? 2020, Current Science All Rights Reserved","output":"Breaking all the rules, at lightning speed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The original version of this article unfortunately contained a mistake.","output":"Correction to: 2019 Novel coronavirus: where we are and what we know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis can decrease new cases of HIV by up to 99%, many patients who could benefit from pre-exposure prophylaxis never receive prescriptions for it. Because pre-exposure prophylaxis is indicated for patients who do not have an infectious disease, increasing pre-exposure prophylaxis prescribing by primary care and generalist clinicians represents a key element of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative. This review provides an overview of academic detailing and how it is currently being used to increase pre-exposure prophylaxis prescribing. Academic detailing is outreach education that engages with clinicians in 1-to-1 or small group interactions focused on identifying and addressing an individual clinician's needs to increase their use of evidence-based practices. Academic detailing has been proven in multiple previous research studies, and the principles required for successful implementation include interactivity, clinical relevance of content, and focus on defined behavior change objectives. Clinician barriers to pre-exposure prophylaxis prescribing may occur in the domains of knowledge, attitudes, or behavior, and academic detailing has the potential to address all of these areas. State and local health departments have developed academic detailing programs focused on pre-exposure prophylaxis prescribing and other elements of HIV prevention-sometimes describing the approach as public health detailing. Few studies of academic detailing for pre-exposure prophylaxis have been published to date; rigorous evaluation of HIV-specific adaptations and innovations of the approach would represent an important contribution. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in virtual delivery of academic detailing has grown, which could inform efforts to implement academic detailing in rural communities and other underserved areas.

Numerous methods have been developed to calculate YLL. OBJECTIVE: Prototypical methods for calculating YLL are presented and critically appraised. An improved method is proposed that is based on cause-elimination life tables (CELTs). METHODS: The different methods are applied to deaths in Germany in 2018. Changes in comparison to 1998 are presented using the modified method. RESULTS: While in 2018 cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death by number of cases, cancer was responsible for most YLL. Different methods of calculating YLL lead to divergent ranks for less frequent causes of death. YLL on the basis of general life tables underestimate CELT-based YLL by up to 18.4% (cardiovascular diseases). Measured by CELT-based YLL, cardiovascular diseases were the most important cause of death in 1998. CONCLUSION: The calculation of YLL on the basis of CELTs avoids inconsistencies of established methods and leads to relevantly different results. Characteristics of the proposed method (violation of the egalitarian principle, lack of additivity) do not affect its usefulness as a tool for health planning.","output":"Verlorene Lebensjahre: Bekanntes und Neues zur Methodik am Beispiel der h?ufigsten Todesursachen in Deutschland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Time and place are central concepts to the dynamic system and phenomenon of fashion.

We conducted a systematic review and searched for all published cases until July 20th 2020. We included 73 patients reported in 52 publications. A broad age range was affected (mean 55, min 11Cmax 94 years) with male predominance (68.5%). Most patients showed respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, and developed GBS manifestations after COVID-19. However, asymptomatic cases for COVID-19 were also described. The distributions of clinical variants and electrophysiological subtypes resemble those of classic GBS, with a higher prevalence of the classic sensorimotor form and the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, although rare variants like Miller Fisher syndrome were also reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albuminocytological dissociation was present in around 71% cases, and CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in all tested cases. More than 70% of patients showed a good prognosis, mostly after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Patients with less favorable outcome were associated with a significantly older age in accordance with previous findings regarding both classic GBS and COVID-19.

Using a smooth generalized additive model with quasipoisson counts for total infections and deaths, we developed a county-level predictive model that included population demographics, social characteristics, social distancing, and testing data. This model strongly predicted the actual US distribution of Covid-19, accounting for 94.8% of spatial-temporal variation in total infections and 99.3% in Covid-19 related fatalities from March 15, 2020. US counties with higher population density, poverty index, civilian population, and minorities, especially African Americans had a higher number of confirmed infections adjusted for county population. Social distancing measured by the change in the rate of human encounter per km2 relative to pre-covid-19 national average was associated with slower rate of Covid-19 infections, whereas higher testing was associated with higher number of infections. The number of people infected was increasing, however, the rate of increase in new infections was starting to show signs of plateauing starting from the second week of April. Our model projects 2.11 million people to test positive for Covid-19 and 122,951 fatalities by June 1, 2020. Importantly, our model suggests strong social differences in the infections and deaths across US communities, and inequities in areas with larger African American minorities and higher poverty index expected to show higher rates of Covid-19 infections and deaths.

It contributes to host defense by interference with bacterial iron uptake and exerts immunomodulatory functions in various diseases. Here, we aimed to characterize the function of LCN2 in lung macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) using Lcn2-/- mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed strong LCN2-related effects in CD103+ DCs during homeostasis, with differential regulation of antigen processing and presentation and antiviral immunity pathways. We next validated the relevance of LCN2 in a mouse model of influenza infection, wherein LCN2 protected from excessive weight loss and improved survival. LCN2-deficiency was associated with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and increased lung T cell numbers, indicating a dysregulated immune response to influenza infection. Depletion of CD8+ T cells equalized weight loss between WT and Lcn2-/- mice, proving that LCN2 protects from excessive disease morbidity by dampening CD8+ T cell responses. In vivo T cell chimerism and in vitro T cell proliferation assays indicated that improved antigen processing by CD103+ DCs, rather than T cell intrinsic effects of LCN2, contribute to the exacerbated T cell response. Considering the antibacterial potential of LCN2 and that commensal microbes can modulate antiviral immune responses, we speculated that LCN2 might cause the observed influenza phenotype via the microbiome. Comparing the lung and gut microbiome of WT and Lcn2-/- mice by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we observed profound effects of LCN2 on gut microbial composition. Interestingly, antibiotic treatment or co-housing of WT and Lcn2-/- mice prior to influenza infection equalized lung CD8+ T cell counts, suggesting that the LCN2-related effects are mediated by the microbiome.

Steroid hormones often exert their effects indirectly via regulation of neuromodulators, which in turn can coordinate the modulation of sensory input with appropriate motor output. Female plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) undergo increased peripheral auditory sensitivity in time for the summer breeding season, improving their ability to detect mates, which is regulated by steroid hormones. Reproductive females also show differences in catecholaminergic innervation of auditory circuitry compared to winter, non-reproductive females as measured by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholaminergic synthesis. Importantly, catecholaminergic input to the inner ear from a dopaminergic-specific forebrain nucleus is decreased in the summer and dopamine inhibits the sensitivity of the inner ear, suggesting that gonadal steroids may alter auditory sensitivity by regulating dopamine innervation. In this study, we gonadectomized non-reproductive females, implanted them with estradiol (E2) or testosterone (T), and measured TH immunoreactive (-ir) fibers in auditory nuclei where catecholaminergic innervation was previously shown to be seasonally plastic. We found that treatment with T, but not E2, reduced TH-ir innervation in the auditory hindbrain. T-treatment also reduced TH-ir fiber density in the forebrain dopaminergic cell group that projects to the inner ear, and likely to the auditory hindbrain. Higher T plasma in the treatment group was correlated with reduced-ir TH terminals in the inner ear. These T-treatment induced changes in TH-ir fibers mimic the seasonal downregulation of dopamine in the midshipman inner ear and provide evidence that steroid hormone regulation of peripheral auditory sensitivity is mediated by dopamine.","output":"Testosterone treatment mimics seasonal downregulation of dopamine innervation in the auditory system of female midshipman fish."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to explore associations between physical activity, cardiovascular risk factors, mobility, mood, fatigue and cognition over 2 years following stroke rehabilitation discharge.

RESULTS Seventy-nine participants (68.4% men) with a mean age of 65 years (SD = 14) and a median gait speed of 1.2 m/s (interquartile range = 0.8-1.4) were included at baseline. Associations were found between higher physical activity (MVPA duration, number and duration of MVPA bouts) and lower body mass index. Better gait speed, endurance, and cognition at baseline were associated with higher MVPA and step count at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS Duration and bouts of MVPA are associated with body mass index. Increasing MVPA and bouts of MVPA may be a valuable treatment goal to reduce cardiovascular risk in survivors of stroke. IMPACT This 2-year study found that moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with important cardiovascular risk factors in people who have survived stroke. Understanding these associations could be useful for developing effective treatments to prevent recurrent stroke.","output":"A 2-Year Longitudinal Study of Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Risk in Survivors of Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Treatment options for metastatic colon cancer (mCC) are widening. We prospectively evaluated serial 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and measurements of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and liberated domain I of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR(I)) for early assessment of treatment response in mCC patients. METHODS Thirty-three mCC patients scheduled for first-line chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) and bevacizumab participated; 27 were evaluated by PET/CT before treatment, after one and four treatment series. Morphological and metabolic response was independently assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer PET criteria. Plasma TIMP-1, plasma uPAR(I), and serum CEA were determined. RESULTS Metabolic response after one treatment course predicted the ability of CAPOX and bevacizumab to induce morphological response after four treatment series with a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 69%, and odds ratio of 13.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9; 182). Early metabolically stable or progressive disease was associated with shorter progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.2 [CI 1.3; 7.8]). Biomarker levels at early evaluation were associated with shorter OS (TIMP-1 per unit increase on a log-2-transformed ng/mL scale: HR = 2.6 [CI 1.4; 4.9]; uPAR(I) per 25 fmol/mL increase: HR = 1.5 [CI 1.1; 2.1]). CONCLUSION This monocentric study demonstrated predictive value of early metabolic PET response and prognostic value of TIMP-1 and uPAR(I) levels in mCC treated with CAPOX and bevacizumab.

Based on the data from the China Household Finance Survey (CFPS), this paper constructs the Gini coefficient and household credit index, and aims to research the impact of income inequality, borrowing level on consumption in different regions, urban and rural areas. The results indicate that the increasing of income inequality significantly restrained the increase of household consumption, while the moderate increase of household leverage can promote household consumption to a certain extent. According to the conclusion of this article, in order to realize the sustainable growth of consumption and upgrade of structure, the government should take measures to stimulate domestic demand: (1) For the central and western regions, the overall wealth level of households should be improved and the borrowing level of residents should be appropriately increased; (2) For the eastern region, the income inequality should be controlled and reduced the negative effects of income inequality on sustainable consumption growth.

The aim of this study was to map and quantify the biological contamination of a dental operatory environment using a biological tracer. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans suspension was infused into the mouth of a manikin, and an operator performed standardized dental procedures using an air turbine, a contra-angle handpiece, or an ultrasonic scaler. The presence of the tracer was measured at 90 sites on the dental unit and the surrounding surfaces of the operatory environment. RESULTS: All tested instruments spread the tracer over the entire dental unit and the surrounding environment, including the walls and ceiling. The pattern and degree of contamination were related to the distance from the infection source. The maximum distance of tracer detection was 360 centimeters for air turbine, 300 cm for contra-angle handpiece, and 240 cm for ultrasonic scaler. No surface of the operative environment was free from the tracer after the use of the air turbine. CONCLUSIONS: Attention should be paid to minimize or avoid the use of rotary and ultrasonic instruments when concerns for the airborne spreading of pandemic disease agents are present.

However, in Malaysia, acute care surgery is yet to be recognized as a specific subspecialty service. Due to high demands of limited ICU beds, some patients have to be ventilated in the wards. This study aims to describe the outcomes of acute surgical patients that required mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of all mechanically ventilated surgical patients in the wards, in a tertiary hospital, in 2020. Sixty-two patients out of 116 patients ventilated in surgical wards fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Demography, surgical diagnosis and procedures and physiologic, biochemical and survival data were analyzed to explore the outcomes and predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Twenty-two out of 62 patients eventually gained ICU admission. Mean time from intubation to ICU entry and mean length of ICU stay were 48 h (0 to 312) and 10 days (1 to 33), respectively. Survival for patients admitted to ICU compared to ventilation in the acute surgery wards was 54.5% (12/22) vs 17.5% (7/40). Thirty-four patients underwent surgery, and the majority were bowel-related emergency operations. SAPS2 score validation revealed AUC of 0.701. More than half of patients with mortality risk < 50% eventually were not admitted to ICU. CONCLUSIONS: ICU care for critically ill surgical patients provides better survival.

To aid in patient selection before therapy with EGFR-TKIs, this study aimed to develop a 125I-labeled derivative of CO-1686, N-{3-[(2-{[4-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-methoxyphenyl]amino}-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine-4-yl] amino}-5-([125I]iodophenyl)acrylamide ([125I]ICO1686) and evaluate its selectivity toward EGFR L858R/T790M. Radiosynthesis was performed by iododestannylation of the corresponding tributylstannyl precursor with [125I]NaI and N-chlorosuccinimide. The selectivity of the tracer for detecting EGFR L858R/T790M was evaluated using three relevant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines-H1975, H3255 and H441 overexpressing the dual mutation EGFR L858R/T790M, active mutant EGFR L858R and wild-type EGFR, respectively. The nonradioactive ICO1686 and the precursor compound were successfully synthesized. A novel radiolabeled probe, [125I]ICO1686, was prepared with high radiochemical yield (77%) and purity (>99%). ICO1686 exhibited high cytotoxicity toward H1975 (IC50 0.20  0.05 M) and H3255 (IC50 0.50  0.21 M), which is comparable to that of CO-1686. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of ICO1686 toward H441 was 10-fold lower than that toward H1975. In the cell uptake study, the radioactivity uptake of [125I]ICO1686 in H1975 was 101.52% dose/mg, whereas the uptakes in H3255 and H441 were 33.52 and 8.95% dose/mg, respectively.

Dural suture watertightness is a decisive issue, and neurosurgeons routinely use different products to reinforce their dural closure. We have designed an experimental system capable of testing CSF leak pressure levels in order to compare two types of sutures in vitro and particularly four different sealants. METHODS Twenty-five fresh human cadaveric dural samples were removed and prepared for testing in a pressure chamber system connected to a hydraulic pressure motor. CSF leak levels were objectively registered. First, simple interrupted stitches were compared to running simple closure on 50-mm linear suture. Secondly, four sealants (two sealants/glues, Bioglue?, Duraseal?; two haemostatics, Tachosil?, Tissucol?) were tested. Statistical analysis was performed with paired Student's t-test. RESULTS No significant difference between interrupted closure and running suture was observed (p = 0.079). All sealants increased the watertightness of the suture significatively. However, comparison of the means of the differences for each product revealed large variations. In the conditions of our experiment, one sealant (Duraseal?) and one haemostatic (Tachosil?) seemed to show better results. We observed two different types of leakage: at the dura-sealant interface and through the sealant itself. CONCLUSIONS We have developed an experimental device capable of testing dural closure watertightness. Interrupted stitch suturing seemed no different from running simple closure.

The production of recombinant DmUCH by Mut(s) strain was much higher than that by Mut(+) strain, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis. When expression was induced at pH 6.0 in a BMMY/methanol medium, the concentration of recombinant DmUCH reached 210 mg l(?1).

UbiquitinCmagainin fusion protein was efficiently cleaved by DmUCH, yielding recombinant magainin with high antimicrobial activity. After removing the contaminants by Ni-NTA chromatography, recombinant magainin was purified to homogeneity easily by reversed-phase HPLC. Analysis of the recombinant magainin by ESI-MS showed that the molecular weight of the purified recombinant magainin was 2465 Da, which perfectly matches the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence.

Following treatments, reversibility tests, after inhaling 400 mcg of Salbutamol, were performed. FEV1 > 12% or &#8804;12% changes differentiated RAO+ from RAO- subjects. Blood eosinophil (BE) counts after treatment were considered. RESULTS: Pre-/post-treatment bronchodilator FEV1 % and ACT were lower (61% [50-71], 74.4% [62.5-83.7] and 20[18-22]), whereas BE were higher (380 cells/l [170-590]) in RAO+ compared to RAO- subjects (77% [64-88], p = 0.0001, 81.8% [66.1-94.3], p = 0.0001, 21[18-23], p = 0.045 and 230 cells/l [80-360], p = 0.003). A negative relationship between SABA-induced FEV1 % changes and pre-bronchodilator FEV1 % (? = -0.551%; p = 0.0001) and ACT (? = -0.059; p = 0.038) was found. Conversely, post-treatment BE levels were positively related (? = 145.565 cells/l; p = 0.003) to FEV1 > 12% increases. A rising trend of pre-/post-bronchodilator FEV1 % in time was observed in RAO- subjects with BE < 300 cells/l. Conversely, we highlighted significant declining tendencies of pre/post-bronchodilator FEV1 % in RAO+ patients with BE > 300 cells/l reaching lower values after more than 36 months of step-5 treatment (59.6% [39.9-72.1] vs 74[66.5-89.2] of RAO+ individuals with BE < 300 cells/l [p = 0.026] and 81.6% [66.1-91.8] of RAO-subjects with BE > 300 cells/l [p = 0.009]).

The study examines the selection preferences by considering pair-wise non-bonded interaction energies of adjacent and interacting amino acids present at the interacting site, along with their evolutionary history. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the study, variations in the interacting residues of spike protein (S-Protein) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different coronaviruses were examined. The MD simulation trajectory analysis revealed that, though all the variants studied were structurally stable at their native and bound confirmations, the RBD of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 was found to be more flexible and more dynamic. Furthermore, a noticeable change observed in the non-bonded interaction energies of the amino acids interacting with the receptor corroborated their selection at respective positions. KEY FINDINGS: The conformational changes exerted by the altered amino acids could be the reason for a broader range of interacting receptors among the selected proteins. SIGNIFICANCE: The results envisage a strong indication that the residue selection at certain positions is governed by a well-orchestrated feedback mechanism, which follows increased stability and flexibility in the folded structure compared to its evolutionary predecessor.","output":"Evolutionary selectivity of amino acid is inspired from the enhanced structural stability and flexibility of the folded protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nepal was under a severe lockdown for several months in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were concerns regarding misinformation circulating on social media. This study aimed to analyse the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 amongst eye care professionals in Nepal during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODOLOGY: We invited 600 participants from 12 ophthalmic centres across Nepal to complete a qualitative, anonymous online survey. Altogether, 25 questions (both open and closed-ended) were used. An overall performance score was calculated from the average of the 12 Knowledge questions for all the participants. RESULTS: Of the 600 eye care professionals invited, 310 (51%) participated in the survey. The symptoms of COVID-19 were known to 94%, whilst only 49% of the participants were aware how the disease was transmitted, with 54% aware that anyone can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Almost 98% of participants recognized the World Health Organizations (WHO) awareness message, but surprisingly, 41% of participants felt that consumption of hot drinks helps to destroy the virus, in contradiction to WHO information. Importantly, 95% of the participants were aware of personal protective equipment (PPE) and what the acronym stands for. Social distancing was felt to be key to limiting the disease spread; whilst 41% disagreed that PPE should be mandatory for eye care practitioners. The mean overall Knowledge performance score was 69.65% (SD  22.81). CONCLUSION: There is still considerable scope to improve the knowledge of COVID-19 amongst ophthalmic professionals in Nepal. Opinion is also split on measures to prevent transmission, with misinformation potentially fuelling confusion.

Methods: An epidemic model based on probabilistic cellular automaton is introduced. By using a genetic algorithm, the values of three parameters of this model are determined from data of prevalence of varicella in Belgium and Italy, in a pre-vaccination period. Results: This methodology can predict the varicella prevalence (with average relative error of [Formula: see text]) in these two European countries. Belgium data can be explained by ignoring the role of immune individuals in the infection propagation; however, Italy data can be explained by considering contagion exclusively mediated by immune individuals.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in acute situations where it is linked with more complications and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic information of AF in this population. METHODS: retrospective analysis of a cohort of 517 patients consecutively admitted in a tertiary hospital due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We divided the patients in two groups according the development of AF and compared the main features of both groups. An univariable and multivariable analysis of mortality were also performed. RESULTS: among 517 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in a tertiary center, 54 (10.4%) developed AF. These patients are older (81.6 vs 66.5 years old, p < 0.001) and present more hypertension (74% vs 47%, p < 0.001), cardiomyopathy (9% vs 1%, p = 0.002), previous heart failure admission (9% vs 0.4%, p < 0.001), previous episodes of AF (83% vs 1%, p < 0.001) and bigger left atrium (47.8 vs 39.9 mm, p < 0.001).

If effectively implemented, these measures may have led to a reduction of the spread of other respiratory infectious diseases at community level. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the indirect impact of COVID-19 large-scale containment measures on the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the elderly during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Tuscany, Italy. METHODS: A population based study was carried out on data from the Tuscany healthcare system. Hospitalization rate for CAP, severity of CAP hospitalizations, and outpatient consumptions of antibacterials for CAP in people aged 65 years and older were considered as outcome measures. Percentage changes in the outcome measures were calculated considering corresponding periods of the 2020 and 2017-19. 95% confidence intervals and the statistical significance of the percentage changes were calculated using the Poisson model. RESULTS: A total of 3,346 new CAP hospitalizations occurred in people aged 65 years and older in the whole study time-frame. Significant reductions in the weekly hospitalization rates for CAP were observed starting from the week in which the national containment measures were imposed, this negative deviation continued even after the lift of the national lock-down until the end of the first wave of COVID-19 in July (maximum weekly decrease of 46%). All the antibacterial classes for CAP showed a significant decrease in their outpatient consumptions during the COVID-19 epidemic period. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of large-scale COVID-19 containment measures likely reduced the incidence of CAP in the elderly during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, findings suggests that individual prevention measures that remained mandatory after the lift of the national lock-down also had a relevant role in the reducing CAP incidence.

Prior to January 2021 standard ward level care included IV antibiotics, IV remdesivir, oral dexamethasone and non-invasive ventilation. Continuous positive airway pressure was used first line (commenced when FiO2 requirements exceeded 4L/min via nasal cannula). After the release of the Department of Healths position statement regarding tocilizumab for COVID-19 patients on respiratory support, a decision was taken to use tocilizumab off license in a non-critical care setting.Our hypothesis was that COVID-19 positive patients on non-invasive ventilation who received tocilizumab in addition to standard care would have reduced hospital mortality compared with standard care alone. The REMAP-CAP trial administered tocilizumab to COVID-19 patients in a critical care setting, however we postulated that those less unwell patients requiring ward level respiratory support but not critical care could still benefit.MethodsPatients commenced on tocilizumab in a non-critical care setting were identified and followed up prospectively.

For that purpose, we have conducted a qualitative investigation to inspect 12 off-the-shelf Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures in classifying COVID-19 from CT scan images. Furthermore, a segmentation algorithm for biomedical images - U-Net, is analyzed to evaluate the performance of the CNN models. A publicly available dataset (SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan) containing a total of 2481 CT scan images is employed for the performance evaluation. In terms of feature extraction by excluding the segmentation technique, a performance of 88.60% as the F1 Score and 89.31% as accuracy is achieved by training DenseNet169 architecture. Adopting the U-Net segmentation method, we accomplished the most optimal accuracy and F1 Scores as 89.92% and 89.67% respectively on DenseNet201 model.

METHODS All rheumatology patients attending a large suburban health network were invited to participate in an anonymized online survey. The primary outcome of interest was SARS-COV-2 vaccine acceptance. RESULTS The mean (SD) age of respondents (n = 641) was 52.7 (15.1) years and 74.4% (n = 474) were female. Sixty-five percent were willing to have a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, while 34.4% were vaccine-hesitant (unwilling or undecided). On multivariate analysis, vaccine acceptance was associated with smoking (OR: 2.25 [95% CI: 1.22-4.15; p = .009]), history of malignancy (OR: 2.51 [95% CI: 1.19-5.26; p = .015]), influenza or pneumococcal vaccination in the preceding year (OR: 2.69 [95% CI: 1.78-4.05; p < .001]) and number of COVID-Safe measures practiced (OR: 1.54 [95% CI: 1.05-2.26; p = .027]). Vaccine acceptance correlated with positive beliefs regarding vaccine efficacy (r = 0.40; p < .001) and safety (r = 0.36; p < .001). Vaccine acceptance correlated negatively with concerns regarding side-effects (r = -0.30; p < .001) and vaccine-associated RMD flare (r = -0.21; p < .001). In vaccine-hesitant respondents, 39.2% were more likely to accept vaccination if given a choice of which vaccine they receive and 54.5% if their rheumatologist recommended it. Twenty-seven percent of patients on immunomodulators were willing to withhold medications while 42.1% were willing if advised by their rheumatologist. CONCLUSION SARS-COV-2 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent amongst RMD patients and associated with concerns regarding vaccine safety, efficacy, side effects and RMD flare. Clinician recommendation, vaccine choice and communications targeting patient concerns could facilitate vaccine acceptance.Significance and Innovations Vaccine hesitancy is prevalent in RMD patientsVaccine acceptance is associated with beliefs regarding vaccine safety and efficacy and concerns regarding RMD flare and vaccine-associated side effectsVaccine choice and clinician recommendation have the potential to improve vaccine acceptance in patients who are hesitant.","output":"SARS-COV-2 vaccine acceptance in patients with rheumatic diseases: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical devices such as orthopedic and dental implants may get infected by bacteria, which results in treatment using antibiotics.

Biofilm formation was studied in vitro using a safranine biofilm assay and LIVE/DEAD staining. Moreover, we investigated what effect the AMP had on osseointegration of commercially available titanium implants in vivo, using a rabbit tibia model. The results showed a sustained release of AMP with equal or even better antibiofilm properties than the traditionally used antibiotic Cloxacillin.

We searched for randomized trials and non-randomized studies evaluating the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies, according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data using a predesigned standardized form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Our search strategy yielded 862 references. Finally, we identified 12 studies, including two randomized trials, evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir, in addition to standard care versus standard care alone in 250 adult inpatients with COVID-19. The evidence from randomized trials shows lopinavir/ritonavir may reduce mortality (relative risk: 0.77; 95% confidence interval: 0.45 to 1.3; low certainty evidence), but the anticipated magnitude of the absolute reduction in mortality, varies across different risk groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir also had a slight reduction in the risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, developing respiratory failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, it did not lead to any difference in the duration of hospitalization and may lead to an increase in the number of total adverse effects. The overall certainty of the evidence was low or very low.

Children can contract the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) but most are asymptomatic. Little is known, however, about the subset of children at risk for symptomatic illness. We sought to identify the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with symptomatic COVID-19 disease in children, with and without asthma, exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic in New York City (NYC). Methods: Data from an ongoing prospective observational cohort of 103 children, aged 2-20 years, enrolled from New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medicine outpatient clinics across the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC were included in this analysis. Participants had baseline determination of body mass index percentile. A comprehensive survey was administered. COVID-19 illness was ascertained by positive SARS-CoV-2-specific serologies and/or the presence of symptoms with known positive contact. Symptom severity was assessed using a novel COVID-19 symptom grading system. Descriptive analysis was used for comparisons across symptom severity categories. Results: Of 103 children enrolled to date, 24 (23.4%) had COVID-19 illness. Of these, 11 were asymptomatic, 8 mild, 4 moderate, and 1 had severe symptoms. Those with greater symptoms tended to be older. All children with moderate-severe symptoms were female. A higher percentage of Hispanic children were seen in all categories: no symptoms (64%), mild (62.5%), moderate (75%), severe (100%). SARS-CoV-2 household exposure was present in 100% of positive symptom categories (N=13) but in only 55% of the asymptomatic category (N=6). A higher percentage of obese children were seen in all symptom categories: no symptoms(73%), mild(62.5%), moderate(50%), severe(100%). Thirteen (54%) children with COVID-19 illness had asthma. There were no demonstrable COVID-19 symptom differences appreciated between asthma severity classifications. However, of those treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (N=6), 50% were asymptomatic. Other atopic conditions (food allergy, allergic rhinitis, eczema) were present in all symptom severity categories. Conclusion: Older age, female gender, and positive household exposure were higher in those with more symptomatic COVID-19 disease. The majority of children with COVID-19 illness were Hispanic and/or obese. At least half of our cohort had asthma;moderate-severe persistent asthmatics did not endorse greater COVID-19 symptoms but higher ICS use seemed to be protective against severe COVID-19 illness.

METHODS: Totally 75 COVID-19 patients admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 22, 2020 to February 29, 2020 were recruited and grouped based on whether or not LPV/r and ARB were jointly used and whether or not Methylprednisolone was used. Indexes including body temperature, time for nucleic acid negative conversion, hospital stays and laboratory indexes were examined and compared. RESULTS: For all patients, there were no significant differences in the change of body temperature, the time for negative conversion and hospital stays whether LPV/r and ARB were jointly used or not. While for severe and critically severe patients, Methylprednisolone noticeably reduced the time for negative conversion. Meanwhile, the clinical efficacy was superior on patients receiving Methylprednisolone within 3 days upon admission, and the duration of hospital stays was much shorter when Methylprednisolone was given at a total dose of 0-400 mg than a higher dose of >400 mg if all patients received a similar dose per day. Nonetheless, no significant changes across hepatic, renal and myocardial function indexes were observed. CONCLUSION: LPV/r combined with ARB produced no noticeably better effect on COVID-19 patients relative to the single agent treatment.

In total, 243 responses were obtained via online survey from nurses. The results revealed that public health education can reduce one's fear of COVID-19. Psychological capital emerged as a strong explanatory mechanism for the phenomenon. Drawing on spillover theory, public health education seems to reduce fear of COVID-19 with the mediating role of psychological capital. Limitations and future directions are at the end of this paper. The study outcomes revealed that organizations should focus on educating nursing staff to overcome fear of COVID-19. One way to induce positivity among nursing staff is by holding trainings.","output":"Impact of public health education on undue fear of COVID-19 among nurses: The mediating role of psychological capital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic overwhelmed healthcare systems, highlighting the need to better understand predictors of mortality and the impact of medical interventions. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined data from every patient who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to White Plains Hospital between March 9, 2020, and June 3, 2020. We used binomial logistic regression to analyze data for all patients, and propensity score matching for those treated with hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). The primary outcome of interest was inpatient mortality. RESULTS: 1,108 admitted patients with COVID-19 were available for analysis, of which 124 (11.2%) were excluded due to incomplete data. Of the 984 patients included, 225 (22.9%) died. Risk for death decreased for each day later a patient was admitted [OR 0.970, CI 0.955 to 0.985; p < 0.001]. Elevated initial C-reactive protein (CRP) value was associated with a higher risk for death at 96 hours [OR 1.007, 1.002 to 1.012; p = 0.006]. Hydroxychloroquine and CP administration were each associated with increased mortality [OR 3.4, CI 1.614 to 7.396; p = 0.002, OR 2.8560, CI 1.361 to 6.160; p = 0.006 respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CRP carried significant odds of early death. Hydroxychloroquine and CP were each associated with higher risk for death, although CP was without titers and was administered at a median of five days from admission. Randomized or controlled studies will better describe the impact of CP. Mortality decreased as the pandemic progressed, suggesting that institutional capacity for dynamic evaluation of process and outcome measures may benefit COVID-19 survival.","output":"Predictors for inpatient mortality during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: A retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ebola virus  one of the deadliest viral diseases, with a mortality rate around 90%  damages the immune system and organs, with symptoms including episodic fever, chills, malaise and myalgia. The Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-based candidate vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) has demonstrated clinical efficacy against Ebola in ring-vaccination clinical trials. In order to evaluate the potential effect of this candidate vaccine, we developed risk equations for the daily risk of Ebola infection both currently and after vaccination. The risk equations account for the basic transmission probability of Ebola and the lowered risk due to various protection protocols: vaccination, hazmat suits, reduced contact with the infected living and dead bodies. Parameter space was sampled using Latin Hypercube Sampling, a statistical method for generating a near-random sample of parameter values. We found that at a high transmission rate of Ebola (i.e., if the transmission rate is greater than 90%), a large fraction of the population must be vaccinated ( 80%) to achieve a 50% decrease in the daily risk of infection. If a vaccine is introduced, it must have at least 50% efficacy, and almost everyone in the affected areas must receive it to effectively control outbreaks of Ebola. These results indicate that a low-efficacy Ebola vaccine runs the risk of having vaccinated people be overconfident in a weak vaccine and hence the possibility that the vaccine could make the situation worse, unless the population can be sufficiently educated about the necessity for high vaccine uptake.","output":"Modelling the daily risk of ebola in the presence and absence of a potential vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Episodic future thinking, defined as the ability to project oneself into the future, has proven useful to pre-experience the future consequences of present actions We investigate how episodic future thinking influences the food choices of normal weight, overweight, and obese individuals In doing so, we conduct a controlled laboratory experiment in which participants are presented with representations of weight-increased and weight-reduced modified images of themselves before performing a food choice task This allows subjects to vividly imagine the future consequences of their actions We also test the effect of providing health-related information on food choices to compare with the episodic future thinking effect Our results suggest that while providing health-related information increases the number of lite snack choices of overweight and obese individuals, engaging in episodic future thinking has a positive impact on the food choices of the obese only These findings are supported by eye-tracking data showing how visual attention and emotional arousal (measured by pupil size) impact individuals food choices","output":"Can episodic future thinking affect food choices?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Les premiers mois de lanne 2020 sont marqus en France par une situation de crise sanitaire exceptionnelle.

Abstract Introduction: Humanity is facing a global pandemic at the start of 2020. The health systems of each country are reorganizing to cope with an influx of patients. This crisis reorganization is the source of psychological tension that can lead to symptomatic manifestations in many caregivers. This situation is similar in many points to that encountered by soldiers on external operations (loss of usual bearings, feeling of threat, focusing of attention on the crisis, deterioration of living conditions with limitation of the possibility of taking breaks). The aim of this work is to describe at the hospital level the changes in the professional and personal environment linked to the crisis likely to cause stress and then to describe the clinical manifestations observed both on an individual and collective level. Analysis of the situation: In this chapter, after having described the reorganization of the hospital in which we operate, we try to identify various factors likely to have psychological repercussions such as: the perceived urgency of the situation, the achievement of privacy, the reorganization of the work tool and the exercise of unusual tasks in newly formed teams, but also the fear of lack, the anxiety linked to contamination, the uncertainties linked to the threat. Clinical Description: In this chapter, we describe the clinical manifestations observed in the caregivers of the hospital in reaction to the crisis. Rather than decompensations, they are mainly anxious manifestations characterized by an increase in somatic concerns, an accentuation of verification rituals, an increase in snacking and the consumption of certain psychoactive substances (coffee, tobacco) and for certain people a character stiffening. On a collective level, it was mainly the misuse of social networks reflecting the group's anxieties (search for meaning and responsibility, need for certainty) that was observed. Conclusion: We then conclude with a description of the approach that led to the establishment of a support system by offering a graduated response, re-assessable over time, compatible with the maintenance of usual activity while maintaining a therapeutic distance.","output":"Psychopathologie de crise : chronique des tensions ordinaires en situation sanitaire extraordinaire.

Messenger and non-coding RNAs contain highly structured elements, and evidence suggests that many of these structures are important for function. Targeting these RNAs with small molecules offers opportunities to therapeutically modulate numerous cellular processes, including those linked to undruggable protein targets. Despite this promise, there is currently only a single class of human-designed small molecules that target RNA used clinically C the linezolid antibiotics. A growing number of small-molecule RNA ligands are being identified, however, leading to burgeoning interest in the field. Here, we discuss principles for discovering small-molecule drugs that target RNA and argue that the overarching challenge is to identify appropriate target structures C namely in disease-causing RNAs that have high information content, and consequently appropriate ligand binding pockets. If focus is placed on such druggable binding sites in RNA, extensive knowledge of the kinds of molecules that comprise conventional drugs could then enable small-molecule drug discovery for RNA targets to become (only) roughly as difficult as for protein targets.","output":"Principles for targeting RNA with drug-like small molecules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus outbreak is an ongoing pandemic that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Considering the clinical impact of the new outbreak, it is highly important to study the potential responses of the human immune system during the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the role of virus-specific T cells and by B-lymphocytes. Moreover, specific data on the production of IgG and IgM is crucial to allow the rapid identification of the infection. In this paper we also described the importance of sensitive and specific rapid test for SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, this test represents an important immunological tool aimed at identifying the precise phase of the infection in order to undertake a more appropriate pharmacological treatment. Lastly, we provided an overview of pharmacological treatments aimed to reduce inflammatory processes underlying the infection and the need for the discovery of a new vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-Cov-2 infection: Response of human immune system and possible implications for the rapid test and treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The wide access to varied, attractive, and aggressively promoted information can induce pregnant women to think that any form of complementary therapy can be a saving solution for a medical problem because these therapies are natural, therefore, harmless.

PURPOSE: Nearly half of intensive care unit (ICU) patients will develop delirium. Antipsychotics are used routinely for the management of ICU delirium despite limited reliable data supporting this approach. The unwarranted continuation of antipsychotics initiated for ICU delirium is an emerging transitions of care concern, especially considering the adverse event profile of these agents. We sought to evaluate the magnitude of this issue across 6 centers in New Jersey and describe risk factors for continuation. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study examined adult ICU patients who developed ICU delirium from June 2016 to June 2018. Patients were included in the study if they received at least 3 doses of antipsychotics while in the ICU with presence of either a clinical diagnosis of delirium or a positive Confusion Assessment Method score. Patients were excluded if they were on an antipsychotic before ICU admission. RESULTS: Of the 300 patients included and initiated on antipsychotics for ICU delirium, 157 (52.3%) were continued on therapy upon transfer from the ICU to another level of inpatient care. The number of patients continued on newly initiated antipsychotics further increased to 183 (61%) upon discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION: The continuation of antipsychotics for the management of delirium during transitions of care was a common practice across ICUs in New Jersey. Several risk factors for continuation of antipsychotics were identified. Efforts to reduce unnecessary continuation of antipsychotics at transitions of care are warranted.","output":"Descriptive analysis of the unwarranted continuation of antipsychotics for the management of ICU delirium during transitions of care: A multicenter evaluation across New Jersey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 scams promise to alleviate the physical and financial risks associated with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic but in fact expose consumers to additional risk.

Herein, we report the behavior of carbohydrate-decorated amphiphilic nanoparticles in a plasma environment with regard to the formation and biological consequences of the protein corona. Naked amphiphilic nanoparticles were produced through the self-assembly of azido-PEO900-docosanoate molecules, and the coupling of N-acetylglucosamine via click chemistry enabled the fabrication of the corresponding bioactive glyco-nanostructures. Light scattering measurements, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the Pierce BCA protein assay all confirmed the presence of protein coronas around the self-assembled nanoparticles, regardless of the presence of the sugar residues, although it reduces the amount of adsorbed proteins. The protein coronas were formed mainly by human serum albumin, complement proteins, apolipoproteins, immunoglobulins, and proteins involved in the coagulation cascade (fibrinogen and prothrombin). While the presence of these protein coronas significantly reduced cellular uptake of the amphiphilic assemblies, they also notably reduced the cytotoxic and hemolytic effects that result from the contact of the nanoparticles with living cells. Accordingly, we highlight that protein coronas should not always be treated as artifacts that have to be avoided because they can also provide beneficial effects.","output":"The Protein Corona Conundrum: Exploring the Advantages and Drawbacks of its Presence around Amphiphilic Nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present review, we consider technology-based methods for training and monitoring counseling skills in behavioral health (i.e., addictions, mental health, and behavioral medicine).

Swift and timely diagnosis might be a potential approach to improving patient prognosis and survival. The microRNA (miRNA) signatures are emerging nowadays for their promising diagnostic potential. MiRNA levels from bone marrow can be used as prognostic biomarkers. METHODS: The current study was designed to evaluate if the microRNAs and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) profiling of hematopoietic bone marrow could help in acute leukemia early detection. Also, we assessed the DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) expression and its possible epigenetic effects on miRNAs plus TSGs expression levels. The expression levels of ten miRNAs and four TSGs involved in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were quantified in 43 and 40 bone marrow samples of ALL and AML patients in comparison with cancer-free subjects via real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis of miRNAs was performed in the study groups. Further, the correlation between the DNMT3A and TSGs was calculated. RESULTS: Significant differences were detected in the bone marrow expression of miRNAs and TSGs (P < 0.05) between acute leukemia patients and healthy group. ROC analysis confirmed the ability of miR-30a, miR-101, miR-132, miR-129, miR-124, and miR-143 to discriminate both ALL and AML patients with an area under the ROC curve of  0.80 (P < 0.001) and high accuracy. The correlation between DNMT3A and P15/P16 TSGs revealed that DNMT3A plays a vital role in epigenetic control of TSGs expression.

Here, we conducted a nationwide study to assess the outcome of SCID patients after HCT in Japan. METHODS: A cohort of 181 SCID patients undergoing their first allogeneic HCT in 1974C2016 was studied by using the Japanese national database (Transplant Registry Unified Management Program, TRUMP). RESULTS: The 10-year overall survival (OS) of the patients who received HCT in 2006C2016 was 67%. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation was performed in 81 patients (45%). The outcomes of HCT from HLA-matched UCB (n = 21) and matched sibling donors (n = 22) were comparable, including 10-year OS (91% vs. 91%), neutrophil recovery (cumulative incidence at 30 days, 89% vs. 100%), and platelet recovery (cumulative incidence at 60 days, 89% vs. 100%). Multivariate analysis of the patients who received HCT in 2006C2016 demonstrated that the following factors were associated with poor OS: bacterial or fungal infection at HCT (hazard ratio (HR): 3.8, P = 0.006), cytomegalovirus infection prior to HCT (HR: 9.4, P = 0.03),  4 months of age at HCT (HR: 25.5, P = 0.009), and mismatched UCB (HR: 19.8, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: We showed the potential of HLA-matched UCB as a donor source with higher priority for SCID patients. We also demonstrated that early age at HCT without active infection is critical for a better prognosis, highlighting the importance of newborn screening for SCID.

At the present time, elective laparoscopic repair is the first choice for treatment of ITS. There is a lack of evidence in the long-term quality of life after a hiatal hernia repair for an intrathoracic stomach. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients undergoing a hiatal hernia repair for an intrathoracic stomach between January 2004 and January 2015. Additionally, to a hiatal closure, the patients received an antireflux procedure. Outcome measures included patient characteristics, operative details, complications, and postoperative morbidity and mortality. All patients were sent a quality of life questionnaire to assess long-term quality of life and patient satisfaction. A higher quality of life score represents a better quality of life. RESULTS Eighty-six patients underwent laparoscopic repair for ITS, from which, one patient died during surgery. Eighty-five patients were contacted and 81 completed the questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 95.3 %. At a median follow-up of 2.7 years (range 0.1-9.6), the mean quality of life score was 13.5 (standard deviation 2.8). The mean overall satisfaction was 8.4. There were four recurrences: three in the first 12 days after surgery and one in 2.4 years.

Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in May 2020 during the outbreak of coronavirus in some industries under Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences' supervision. During the present study, 70 industries included 24 industries active in chemical products, 6 industries of automotive parts manufacturing, 14 industries of home appliance manufacturing, 16 industries of health and cosmetics products, 4 industries of metal products, and six service companies were studied. The studied population included two industries with an occupational health management system (33 industries) and industries without an occupational health management system (37 industries). In this study, a checklist was designed to collect study data based on the requirements and parameters of occupational health management systems, as well as information related to infectious diseases such as COVID-19, which included information on COVID-19 disease in two groups of studied industry, occupational medicine, biological hazards risk management, occupational health information management system, training, and employee participation, as well as the management parameters of COVID-19 outbreak. Statistical analysis of the study data was performed using the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test by SPSS. 23 software. Results: The number of workers working in the two groups of industries with and without occupational health management systems was 673 and 708, respectively. Among 33 industries with occupational health management systems, 12.1% industries had health, safety, and environment management system (HSE-MS), 66.7% industries had OHSAS 18001:2007 standard, and 21.2% industries also had ISO 45001:2018 certification. It was found that the prevalence of Covid-19 disease in those industries without occupational health management systems was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05). It has been found that Covid-19 outbreak in industries without occupational health management systems was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05). The findings also showed that there was a significant difference between the parameters of occupational medicine, risk management of biological hazards, occupational health information management system, training and employee participation, as well as the management parameters of COVID-19 disease in the two groups of studied industries (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The findings of the present study indicated that there was a significant relationship between the scores of occupational medicine parameters and occupational health information management system, risk management of biological hazards, training and employee participation, management of COVID-19 and finally the prevalence of the disease among industries with or without occupational health management system.

These tools can tackle the disparities in healthcare access as the technology can be implemented on smartphones. We present the first, large-scale study on patients with skin-of-color, in which the feasibility of a novel mobile health application (mHealth app) was investigated in actual clinical workflows. OBJECTIVE To develop a mHealth app to diagnose 40 common skin diseases and test it in clinical settings. METHODS A convolutional neural network-based algorithm was trained with clinical images of 40 skin diseases. A smartphone app was generated and validated on 5,014 patients, attending rural and urban outpatient dermatology departments in India. The results of this mHealth app were compared against the dermatologists' diagnoses. RESULTS The machine-learning model, in an in silico validation study, demonstrated an overall top-1 accuracy of 76.930.88% and mean area-under-curve of 0.950.02 on a set of clinical images. In the clinical study, on patients with skin of color, the app achieved an overall top-1 accuracy of 75.07% (95% CI=73.75-76.36), top-3 accuracy of 89.62% (95% CI=88.67-90.52) and mean area-under-curve of 0.900.07.

Cost and availability of large-scale testing capacity has led to a lag in turnaround time and hindered contact tracing efforts, resulting in a further spread of SARS-CoV-2. To increase the speed and frequency of testing, we developed a cost-effective single-tube approach for collection, denaturation, and analysis of clinical samples. The approach utilizes 1 L microbiological inoculation loops to collect saliva, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to inactivate and release viral genomic RNA, and a diagnostic reaction mix containing polysorbate 80 (Tween 80). In the same tube, the SDS-denatured clinical samples are introduced to the mixtures containing all components for nucleic acids detection and Tween 80 micelles to absorb the SDS and allow enzymatic reactions to proceed, obviating the need for further handling of the samples. The samples can be collected by the tested individuals, further decreasing the need for trained personnel to administer the test. We validated this single-tube sample-to-assay method with reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and discovered little-to-no difference between Tween- and SDS-containing reaction mixtures, compared to control reactions. This approach reduces the logistical burden of traditional large-scale testing and provides a method of deployable point-of-care diagnostics to increase testing frequency.","output":"Single-tube collection and nucleic acid analysis of clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 saliva testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exhaled breath analysis has a high potential for early non-invasive diagnosis of lung inflammatory diseases, such as asthma. The characterization and understanding of the inflammatory metabolic pathways involved into volatile organic compounds (VOCs) production could bring exhaled breath analysis into clinical practice and thus open new therapeutic routes for inflammatory diseases. In this study, lung inflammation was simulated in vitro using A549 epithelial cells. We compared the VOC production from A549 epithelial cells after a chemically induced oxidative stress in vitro, exposing the cells to H2O2, and a biological stress, exposing the cells to an inflammatory pool of sputum supernatants. Special attention was devoted to define proper negative and positive controls (8 different types) for our in vitro models, including healthy sputum co-culture. Sputum from 25 asthmatic and 8 healthy patients were collected to create each pool of supernatants. Each sample type was analyzed in 4 replicates using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography hyphenated to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCGC-TOFMS). This approach offers high resolving power for complex VOC mixtures. According to the type of inflammation induced, significantly different VOCs were produced by the epithelial cells compared to all controls. For both chemical and biological challenges, an increase of carbonyl compounds (54%) and hydrocarbons (31%) was observed.

The downstream complications resulting from this infection are not well characterized. There have been case reports of patients with COVID-19 infection presenting with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) Here, we present a case of one such patient, who failed initial management with intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG), requiring plasmapheresis as a treatment modality. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with a four day history of progressive paresthesias and weakness. This began in his bilateral lower extremities and ascended to the bilateral upper limb and face. Concurrent mild dysarthria and dysphagia were noted. On this encounter, he had a first time positive test for COVID-19 via nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On physical exam he had reduced dorsiflexion of the right ankle, with normal power throughout the rest of the body. He had graded sensory loss in the lower extremities, without a sensory level and diminished reflexes throughout. Lumbar puncture and MRI imaging were suggestive of demyelinating neuropathy. Due to the clinical history and albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF, he was assessed with GBS and commenced on IVIG 0.4g/kg for 5 days. On day 4 of hospitalization, worsening dysarthria and dysphagia was noted and he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Subsequently, due to lack of adequate improvement in the patient's symptoms, plasmapheresis was initiated. The patient completed 7 additional sessions of plasmapheresis and had symptom resolution. DISCUSSION: There have been several case reports of GBS in the setting of COVID-19, which has been thought to be a para-infectious in origin. According to a systematic review, 96.6% of patients affected with COVID-19 GBS experienced typical COVID-19 symptoms prior to being diagnosed with GBS. This syndrome has been seen in other viral illnesses, such as West Nile virus and the Zika virus. Most of these cases have been treated successfully with IVIG, but in this report, the patient required plasmapheresis to achieve successful resolution of his symptoms. At this time, there have been approximately three published cases of GBS in the setting of COVID-19 in the USA which required plasmapheresis as a treatment modality. Additionally, all of these cases presented with typical clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: This patient's findings highlight one of the first cases of GBS in the setting of sub-clinical COVID-19 infection. This adds to the growing set of literature establishing a neurological component of the disease. It also demonstrates the use of plasmapheresis as an additional tool in the treatment of COVID-19 associated GBS.

Whereas RBD or cytokine exposure caused a pro-inflammatory cellular environment and injurious signaling, impairing alveolar-capillary barrier function, and inducing cell death, MSC-EVs reduced inflammation and reestablished target cell health. Importantly, MSC-EV treatment increased active ACE2 surface protein compared to RBD injury, identifying a previously unknown role for MSC-EV treatment in COVID-19 signaling and pathogenesis. The beneficial effect of MSC-EV treatment was confirmed in an LPS-induced rat model of ALI wherein MSC-EVs reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and respiratory dysfunction associated with disease.

In this study, the impact of such a training was investigated for rehearsal of patient-specific cases as well as for a structured simulation curriculum to teach angiographer novices. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 40 patients undergoing a diagnostic neuroangiography were randomized in a training and control group. In all training group patients, the angiographer received a patient-anatomy-specific rehearsal on a high-fidelity simulator prior to the real angiography. Radiation exposure, total duration, fluoroscopy time and amount of contrast agent of the real angiography were recorded. Silent cerebral ischemia was counted by magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Additionally, the first 30 diagnostic neuroangiographies of six novices were compared (ntotal = 180). Three novices had undergone a structured simulation curriculum; three had acquired angiographic skills without simulation. RESULTS No differences were found in the number of DWI lesions or in other quality measures of the angiographies performed with and without patient-specific rehearsal. A structured simulation curriculum for angiographer novices reduced fluoroscopy time significantly and radiation exposure. The curriculum had no influence on the total duration of the examination, the amount of contrast medium or the number of catheters used. CONCLUSION There was no measurable benefit of patient-anatomy-specific rehearsal for an unselected patient cohort.

Co-ordinated bouts of rhythmic activity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC), in particular, are important for mnemonic processes. This is true during awake behavior, as well as during offline states like sleep. We have recently shown that the anatomically interposed thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) has a role in coordinating slow-wave activity between the PFC and HPC. Here, we took advantage of spontaneous brain state changes occurring during urethane anesthesia in order to assess if PFC-HPC communication was modified during activated (theta) vs. deactivated (slow oscillation: SO) states. These forebrain states are highly similar to those expressed during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM stages of natural sleep, respectively. Evoked potentials and excitatory current sinks in the HPC were consistently larger during SO states, regardless of whether PFC or RE afferents were stimulated. Interestingly, PFC stimulation during theta appeared to preferentially use a cortico-cortical pathway, presumably involving the entorhinal cortex as opposed to the more direct RE to HPC conduit. Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations of the RE suggested that this state-dependent biasing was mediated by responding in the RE itself. Finally, the phase of both ongoing rhythms also appeared to be an important factor in modulating HPC responses, with maximal field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) occurring during the negative-going phase of both rhythms.

We simulate stochastic infection curves that incorporate core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models, and statistical relational event models. Our models demonstrate that while social distancing measures clearly do flatten the curve, strategic reduction of contact can strongly increase their efficiency, introducing the possibility of allowing some social contact while keeping risks low. Limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts emerges as the most effective strategy. Maintaining similarity across contacts and the strengthening of communities via triadic strategies are also highly effective.

This study aims to assess the willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and the factors associated with this willingness among healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers in Lebanon. Methods: : A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among Lebanese adults aged 18 years and above during November 2020 among Lebanese adults from all Lebanese provinces using a snowball sampling technique. Data were collected using an anonymous Arabic questionnaire that included sociodemographic, health-related variables, intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine, and the Health Belief Model covariates. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among the 2 groups. Results: : A total number of 2802 participants completed the survey. The overall intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among the Lebanese adult population was 51.5%. HCWs expressed a higher willingness of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 than non HCWs (65.8% vs. 47%, p< 0.001). The factors that are positively associated with the willingness to vaccinate among the general population, non HCWs and HCWs were: older age, being married, living in urban areas, receiving influenza vaccine for this season, higher perception of susceptibility and benefits, concerns related to availability and accessibility of vaccines and recommendation of vaccine from health authorities. However, the previous refusal of any vaccine, concerns about vaccine safety, and side effects impacted negatively this intention. Female gender, importance accounted to religiosity, and concerns about the reliability of the manufacturer were negatively associated with vaccine acceptance among non HCWs. Conversely, good knowledge, vaccine intake by the public, and self-motivation were positively associated with this willingness. Of note, these factors were not significantly associated with such willingness among HCWs. Conclusion: To control COVID-19 effectively, efforts targeting modifiable factors driving COVID-19 vaccine acceptance are required to increase the acceptance rate among the Lebanese population.","output":"Integrating Health Belief model to determine factors associated with COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance in Lebanon: Differences between health care workers and non-healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a COVID-19 patient who presented with persistent headache and anosmia that was related to viral encephalomyelitis with acute lesions on MRI in both the brain and upper cervical cord.","output":"Encephalomyelitis associated with Covid-19 infection: case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The first clinical trial on remdesivir for treatment of severe COVID-19 conducted in China was terminated prematurely due to limited patient enrollment, which rendered the findings inconclusive. We re-analyzed the efficacy with a statistically more powerful and clinically meaningful method based on published data using the 6-point ordinal scale of patients disease severity. Methods: We defined response as patients point reached, either 2 (hospitalized, no require-ment for supplementary oxygen therapy) or 1 (discharged or met discharge criterion), and then analyzed with logistic regression with baseline score, day of assessment, treatment group, baseline by treatment interaction, and day by treatment interaction as covariates. The binary endpoint was supported by the recent FDAs guidance on COVID-19. Results: Eighty-two percent (82%) of the patients were in the disease severity point=3 (hospitalized, required supplemental oxygen (but not NIV/HFNC)) C the moderately severe category. The response rate was 85% for remdesivir-treated patients with baseline disease point=3 versus 70% response rate for likewise placebo-treated patients on Day 28 (OR=2.38, P=0.0012).

Conclusion and Discussion: The Chinese trial was not really under-powered as previously perceived or portrayed by many opinions.

METHODS: After NAFLD screening in an outpatient Infectious Diseases Clinic, NAFLD patients were randomly allocated to general dietary recommendations (SC group) or to a structured dietary intervention based on the Mediterranean diet (intervention group). During lockdown, follow-up consultations in the intervention group were done by video and/or phone. After 3 months of lockdown, all patients (intervention and SC group) consented to a telephone interview which aimed to characterize eating habits and lifestyle changes and evaluate stress and depression. Biochemical data when available, was compared between the peri-period of confinement. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients were screened. From the 55 NAFDL identified, 27 were allocated to dietary intervention and 28 to SC and were followed before lockdown for a mean period of 5.0  1.5 months in which SC group gained a median of 0.65 kg vs. a median loss of 1.5 kg in the intervention group (p < 0.001).

We propose a modified difference-in-difference regression design, based on contiguous-county triplets. This approach compares treated counties, which adopted the SHO, and neighbors, to the neighbor's neighbors, which we term hinterland, counties. We find that mobility in neighboring counties declined by a third to a half as much as in the treated locations. These spillover effects are concentrated in neighbors that share media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we decompose the spillover decline in mobility into reductions in external visits coming from the treated county and an even stronger voluntary decline in the neighbor county's own traffic. Together, our results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and illustrate the quantitative importance of voluntary social distancing. The finding that the estimated spillovers are in the same direction as the direct effects casts doubt on the prevailing narrative that a more nationally coordinated policy response would have accomplished a greater reduction in mobility and contacts.","output":"Direct and Spillover Effects from Staggered Adoption of Health Policies: Evidence from COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, blockchain technology and industry has developed rapidly all over the world, which is inseparable from continuous innovation and improvement on smart contract technology.

The priority assignment of MELD-sodium score resulted in LT and prevented mortality on waitlist. MELD-Sodium score was implemented for liver allocation policy in 2016. Prior to the current and most recent policy, livers from adult donors were matched first to the status 1A/1B patients located within the boundaries of the UNOS regions and donor-service areas (DSA). We reviewed the disadvantages of the DSA-based allocation policies and the advantages of the newest acuity circle allocation model. We then reviewed the standard and non-standard indications for MELD exceptions and the decision-making process of the National Review Liver Review Board.

While researchers are working on vaccine development and elucidating the mechanism of action and evolution of the harmful SARS-CoV-2, the current most important public health measure, second only to social distancing, is the obligatory wearing of facial protection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended in April 2020 that the public wear face coverings in areas with high rates of transmission based on epidemiological evidence on the strong relationship between mask wearing and pandemic control. This protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne pathogens, boost the design and production of innovative solutions by industry stakeholders. Nanoparticles, nanofibers, and other pioneering technologies based on nanomaterials have been introduced in mask production chains to improve performance and confer antiviral properties. During an emergency like COVID-19, these products directly available to the public should be carefully analyzed in terms of efficacy and possible long-term effects on the wearers skin and lungs as well as on the environment.

Waning antibody levels lead to reduced sensitivity of serological diagnostic tests over time. This undermines the utility of serological surveillance as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progresses into its second year. Here we develop a multiplex serological test for measuring antibodies of three isotypes (IgG, IgM, IgA) to five SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Spike (S), receptor binding domain (RBD), Nucleocapsid (N), Spike subunit 2, Membrane-Envelope fusion) and the Spike proteins of four seasonal coronaviruses. We measure antibody responses in several cohorts of French and Irish hospitalized patients and healthcare workers followed for up to eleven months after symptom onset. The data are analysed with a mathematical model of antibody kinetics to quantify the duration of antibody responses accounting for inter-individual variation. One year after symptoms, we estimate that 36% (95% range: 11%, 94%) of anti-S IgG remains, 31% (9%, 89%) anti-RBD IgG remains, and 7% (1%, 31%) anti-N IgG remains. Antibodies of the IgM isotype waned more rapidly, with 9% (2%, 32%) anti-RBD IgM remaining after one year. Antibodies of the IgA isotype also waned rapidly, with 10% (3%, 38%) anti-RBD IgA remaining after one year. Quantitative measurements of antibody responses were used to train machine learning algorithms for classification of previous infection and estimation of time since infection. The resulting diagnostic test classified previous infections with 99% specificity and 98% (95% confidence interval: 94%, 99%) sensitivity, with no evidence for declining sensitivity over the time scale considered. The diagnostic test also provided accurate classification of time since infection into intervals of 0 - 3 months, 3 - 6 months, and 6 - 12 months. Finally, we present a computational method for serological reconstruction of past SARS-CoV-2 transmission using the data from this test when applied to samples from a single cross-sectional sero-prevalence survey.","output":"Serological reconstruction of COVID-19 epidemics through analysis of antibody kinetics to SARS-CoV-2 proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly in China and the Chinese government took a series of policies to control the epidemic.

The non-hibernating small mammals increase metabolic rate including obligatory thermogenesis (basal/resting metabolic rate, BMR/RMR) and regulatory thermogenesis (mainly nonshivering thermogenesis, NST, in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) to maintain thermal homeostasis in cold conditions. A substantial amount of evidence indicates that the symbiotic gut microbiota are sensitive to air temperature, and play an important function in cold-induced thermoregulation, via bacterial metabolites and byproducts such as short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids. Cold signal is sensed by specific thermosensitive transient receptor potential channels (thermo-TRPs), and then norepinephrine (NE) is released from sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and thyroid hormones also increase to induce NST. Meanwhile, these neurotransmitters and hormones can regulate the diversity and compositions of the gut microbiota. Therefore, cold-induced NST is controlled by both Thermo-TRPs-SNS-gut microbiota axis and thyroid-gut microbiota axis. Besides physiological thermoregulation, small mammals also rely on behavioral regulation, such as huddling and coprophagy, to maintain energy and thermal homeostasis, and the gut microbial community is involved in these processes. The present review summarized the recent progress in the gut microbiota and host physiological and behavioral thermoregulation in small mammals for better understanding the evolution and adaption of holobionts (host and symbiotic microorganism).

Given that the format of medical education is not fixed, but malleable and in fact must be adaptable to societal needs through ongoing reflexivity, we find ourselves in a potentially transformative learning phase for the field. An Association for Medical Education in Europe ASPIRE Academy group of 18 medical educators from seven countries was formed to consider this opportunity, and identified critical questions for collective reflection on current medical education practices and assumptions, with the attendant challenge to envision the future of medical education. This was achieved through online discussion as well as asynchronous collective reflections by group members. Four major themes and related conclusions arose from this conversation: Why we teach: the humanitarian mission of medicine should be reinforced; what we teach: disaster management, social accountability and embracing an environment of complexity and uncertainty should be the core; how we teach: open pathways to lean medical education and learning by developing learners embedded in a community context; and whom we teach: those willing to take professional responsibility.

We have previously developed and tested a screening tool combining machine-learning algorithms, to help primary care physicians assess patients presenting with arthritis affecting the hands. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the screening tool among a number of different Rheumatologists. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-eight consecutive new patients presenting to 7 private Rheumatology practices across Australia were enrolled. Using a smartphone application, each patient had photographs taken of their hands, completed a brief 9-part questionnaire, and had a single examination result (wrist irritability) recorded. The Rheumatologist diagnosis was entered following a 45-minute consultation. Multiple machine learning models were applied to both the photographic and survey/examination results, to generate a screening outcome for the primary diagnoses of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. RESULTS: The combined algorithms in the application performed well in identifying and discriminating between different forms of hand arthritis. The algorithms were able to predict rheumatoid arthritis with accuracy, precision, recall and specificity of 85.1, 80.0, 88.1 and 82.7% respectively. The corresponding results for psoriatic arthritis were 95.2, 76.9, 90.9 and 95.8%, and for osteoarthritis were 77.4, 78.3, 80.6 and 73.7%. The results were maintained when each contributor was excluded from the analysis. The median time to capture all data across the group was 2 minutes and 59 seconds. CONCLUSIONS: This multicentre study confirms the results of the pilot study, and indicates that the performance of the screening tool is maintained across a group of different Rheumatologists. The smartphone application can provide a screening result from a combination of machine-learning algorithms applied to hand images and patient symptom responses. This could be used to assist primary care physicians in the assessment of patients presenting with hand arthritis, and has the potential to improve the clinical assessment and management of such patients.

However, the public's hesitation has created major difficulties to the promotion of the vaccine. By investigating the relationship between health literacy and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, as well as the potential moderating role of stress, the present study would provide critical insights for tailoring vaccine-promotion strategies. Objective The two-fold research purpose is: i) address the effect of health literacy on people's attitude toward COVID-19 vaccine, ii) clarify the role of stress in this effect. Method With structured questionnaires, an online survey was conducted to evaluate general public's COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, health literacy, and perceived stress. In total, 560 responses were collected, and moderated regression analysis was conducted to test the effect of health literacy on vaccine hesitancy among people with different levels of stress. Results A total of 560 participants aged over 18 years were included in this study. About 39.8% of the respondents reported vaccine hesitancy, and this rate is higher among those aged 20-30 years old (83%) and female (71.3%). The results showed people with higher level of health literacy are less likely to have vaccine hesitancy . However, this effect was only among those with lower to moderate level of stress , among the people with high stress, no significant effect of health literacy was found . Conclusions By focusing on the effect of health literacy on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, the findings showed education program increasing individual's health literacy may also effectively reduce the public's vaccine hesitancy and promote accepting attitude. However, for people with high level of stress, other health programs need to be developed to enhance their positive attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine. In conclusion, promotion strategies should be tailored for different populations, with considering individual factors such as health literacy and stress.

Endoscopic detection of postoperative, ileo-colonic inflammation is well established, but the potential of pan-intestinal endoscopy is yet unknown. METHODS This prospective multicenter pilot study assessed the value of pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy using a colon capsule endoscope for the detection of inflammatory recurrence of Crohns disease. Patients who had been operatively treated for Crohns disease were included. Colon capsule endoscopy was performed 4-8 weeks (d1) and 4-8 months (d2) postoperatively together with ileo-colonoscopy at d2 using a modified Ruttgeerts index for evaluating disease activity. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were included into this study. At d1, significant disease activity (Ruttgeerts index 2) was detected in 3/16 (19%) of the patients. At d2, half of the patients (6/12) showed active disease, whereas ileo-colonoscopy revealed significant inflammation in 5/15 (33%). All patients rated as having active disease by ileo-colonoscopy had been revealed by PICE as well. These findings influenced the medical treatment in every case. CONCLUSION Pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy seems to be feasible in the postoperative surveillance of Crohn's disease. Disease activity is reliably detected. Especially, the findings in the small bowl might be a significant advantage in comparison to ileo-colonoscopy, as they can have significant impact on clinical management. Further studies with a larger number of patients are needed to confirm these findings and might lead to a replacement of the flexible ileo-colonoscopy with pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy in this indication in the future.","output":"Pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy in patients with postoperative Crohn's disease: a pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims Serious incidents according to NHS England (2015) are incidents where the consequences to patients, families and carers, staff or organisations are so significant or potential for learning are so great that a heightened response is justified.

Our aim was to evaluate junior doctors perspective of serious incident reviews. A secondary aim was to organise local and regional workshops based on the outcome of our findings to address misconceptions around serious incident investigations. Method A survey was developed using survey monkey and distributed to all trainees across the Mersey region through the Medical Education teams. The junior doctors range from core trainees to higher trainees. The survey encouraged the use of free texting if necessary. Results from the survey were then analysed Result 18 junior doctors across the 3 mental health Trusts in the Mersey region responded. 12 respondents have been involved in a serious incident investigation in the past and 9 of the respondents stated that they did not recieve any support during the process. Out of the 3 that were supported, one rated the support as poor and frightening. 55.56% af all respondents found the process of serious incident reviews hard to understand. 66% of all respondents admitted that they are aware that the purpose of the review is for learning purposes. 100% of respondents agreed that a workshop to discuss the purpose and process of serious incidents investigation to aid their understanding would be useful. Conclusion From the survey, we concluded that junior doctors do have some understanding of incident reviews process but they still do not feel comfortable with the idea of being under investigation'. It is also important that formal support is made available during the process.

Clinical evidence of enhanced illness by preexisting antibodies from vaccination, infection or maternal passive immunity is available for several viruses and is presumptively proposed for other viruses. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. It has been confirmed that certain infection- and/or vaccine-induced immunity could exacerbate viral infectivity in Fc receptor- or complement bearing cells- mediated mechanisms. Considering that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) is a major obstacle in vaccine development, there are continues efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms through identification of the epitopes and antibodies responsible for disease enhancement or protection.

We investigated the psycho-social burden of the pandemic and self-perceived risk and harm in a large IBD cohort. METHODS: In this monocentric prospective observational study, pediatric (pIBD) and adult patients completed questionnaires related to their IBD (phenotype, disease activity, treatment), comorbidities, demographic and socioeconomic factors, validated tools on Perceived Stress (PSQ) and quality of life (sIBDQ). They judged perception of harm in case of acquiring COVID-19 using ratings from 1 to 7. We used number and type of established conditions for severe COVID-19 outcome to categorize patients in 5 risk groups. SARS-CoV2 antibodies were determined by Elecsys Roche anti-N pan-Ig. All comparisons were made by using t-test, Mann-Whitney-U-test or Chi-square-test where applicable with 2-sided significance levels of 5%. Univariate and multiple logistic regression was performed to determine associations between factors and perceived harm. RESULTS: Between mid-July to mid-October, 504 (62%) of 820 invited IBD patients and 86 pIBD parents completed the survey. Age ranged from 6-85 years, 80% received mono- or combo-therapy with immunomodulator, biologic, JAK-inhibitor or corticosteroids. Remission, mild, moderate and severe disease activity were reported by 46, 39, 12 and 3%, respectively. High harm of potential COVID-19 (>3) was perceived by 75.4%, rates increased with age (p=0.0019). After adjusting for age and gender, high perceived harm was significantly associated with immunosuppressive drugs, number/type of comorbidities, sleep disturbance, unintended gain or loss of weight, higher PSQ and lower sIBDQ scores. PSQ scored lower in males >60 years vs age matched females or younger adults, and in patients in remission vs active disease. PIBD mothers total PSQ was similar with even higher subscores for demands (P=0.0004) as adults with moderate/severe disease. Compared to pre-pandemic, 58-93% of pIBD decreased physical activities (at home, sports, outdoor) with minor changes in adults. SARS-CoV-2 serology was positive in 0.4% of IBD patients compared to 2% of our city population. CONCLUSION: Prior to 2nd infection wave, even IBD patients aged <40 years suffer from a high degree of worries, stress and perceived harm for potential COVID-19. Most elderly patients and those with comorbidities adequately estimate their risks. In pIBD, pandemic restrictions substantially impacted on physical activity. The low seropositivity rate indicates high adherence to social distancing or altered immune response due to IBD drugs.

Our results indicate that R/S is predictive of the frequency of prophylactic behaviors (p = 0.0222, R(2) = 0.025) and the perception of risk of vulnerability (p < 0.05, R(2) = 0.07). We argue that the effect of R/S on health occurs through the promotion of salutogenic mechanisms promoted by socialization in religious environments. This can help understand social dynamics in epidemiological crises and mitigate the influence of these diseases.","output":"Influence of Religiosity and Spirituality on the Adoption of Behaviors of Epidemiological Relevance in Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases: The Case of Dengue Fever"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Companion animals and pets can be helpful during the novel coronavirus-19 pandemic.

The presence or absence of such antibodies can potentially lead to considerations regarding immunity and infection. Issue: How reliable are inferences from positive or negative test results regarding the actual presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies? Methods: Calculation of the probability that, depending on the pretest probability (prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection) and test properties, antibodies are present or absent in the case of positive or negative test results. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of different SARS-CoV-2 AB test systems vary between 53 % and 94 % and between 91 % and 99.5 %, respectively. When using a test with high test quality, the positive predictive value (PPV) is 42 % and 7 9%, respectively, with a pre-test probability of 1 % to 5 %, as can currently be assumed for the general population in Austria or Germany. For persons with an increased pre-test probability of 20 %, e. g. persons from high-risk professions, the PPW is 95 %, with a pre-test probability of 80 % the PPW is almost 100 %. The negative predictive value (NPV) is at least 99.7 % for persons with a low pre-test probability of up to 5 % and 79.1 % for persons with a pre-test probability of 80 %. When using test systems with lower sensitivity and specificity, the reliability of the results decreases considerably. The PPV is 5.9 % with a pre-test probability of 1 %. Conclusions: A sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity are prerequisites for the application of antibody test systems. Positive test results are often false if the pre-test probability is low. Depending on the assumed prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are substantial differences in the significance of a concrete test result for the respective affected persons.","output":"Antik?rpertests bei COVID-19 - Was uns die Ergebnisse sagen./ [Antibody tests for COVID-19: What the results tell us]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To summarize the findings of recent psychogeriatric research conducted in emerging countries. RECENT FINDINGS During the review period there have been new reports on the prevalence, clinical characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of dementia in its various forms, epidemiological findings on depression, and psychological autopsy analyses of suicidal behaviors and psychiatric morbidities. New studies in social psychiatry have been conducted, especially on the trends of transgenerational support of the elderly and of interventions that may reduce psychiatric disease burdens and promote mental health in later life. SUMMARY These research findings support a better understanding of the prevalence, nature, and underlying risk and protective factors of the major psychiatric morbidities in the studied regions. Further exploration of the epidemiological profile of mental disorders in rural areas, research on the direct and indirect costs of psychogeriatric conditions, and evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability of early detection programs, treatment and rehabilitation models are warranted.","output":"Studies from emerging countries: an encouraging development."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has increased the generalized anxiety among nursing staff. This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study aimed to determine the generalized anxiety disorders among the nursing staff working in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Punjab province, Pakistan. A GAD-7 scale was used to assess anxiety. Non-parametric statistics were applied to estimate the difference among the groups. Multiple regression model was adopted to explore the impact of covariates on the GAD-7 score. A total of 133 nurses responded to this survey. It was revealed that being female (7.38 +/- 4.20, p=0.032) and having an age of &gt;= 31 years (7.68 +/- 5.14) might lead to a higher GAD-7 score. 19.6% of the respondents had a high level of generalized anxiety (GAD-7 score &gt;= 10), and about 49.6% were falling in the range of mild anxiety. Female nursing staff have the probability of higher GAD-7 score up to 15% [0.148(-0.450 - 4.697), p= 0.049]. Job experience, especially being new to the field (&lt;= 3 years) might increase the likelihood of having a higher GAD-7 score by 14%. In conclusion, 19.6% of the respondents were meeting the GAD-7 criteria of moderate-severe level of generalized anxiety and depressive disorder. Being female, having less job experience, and no training on how to handle COVID patients were revealed to the main factors influencing the GAD-7 score.

Viruses utilize elegant strategies to attach to one or multiple receptors, overcome the plasma membrane barrier, enter, and access the necessary host cell machinery. The viral attachment protein can be viewed as the key that unlocks host cells by interacting with the lock C the receptor C on the cell surface, and these lock-and-key interactions are critical for viruses to successfully invade host cells. Many common themes have emerged in virus receptor utilization within and across virus families demonstrating that viruses often target particular classes of molecules in order to mediate these events. Common viral receptors include sialylated glycans, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) such as immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) members and integrins, and phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) receptors. The redundancy in receptor usage suggests that viruses target particular receptors or common locks to take advantage of their cellular function and also suggests evolutionary conservation. Due to the importance of initial virus interactions with host cells in viral pathogenesis and the redundancy in viral receptor usage, exploitation o f these strategies would be an attractive target for new antiviral therapeutics.","output":"Virus-Receptor Interactions: The Key to Cellular Invasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The response to the COVID-19 pandemic is a tragic aberration gripping the world As the disease evolves, uncertainty and fear of harm rise, which can significantly diminish community health and wellbeing This article stresses the importance of public health preparedness in overcoming social and health risks associated with public panic Since the COVID-19 outbreak began in late 2019, the numbers of people affected and fatalities continue to mount, causing panic and crippling vital economic and social activities Authorities have failed to prevent inaccurate and misleading headlines that agitate the public and impinge on public communication Fake news and rumors about magical products claiming to cure the virus abound Additionally, people assumed emergency preparation meant stockpiling resources Amid growing fears, consumers raided supermarkets and pharmacies for supplies, from masks to hygiene products, and people have fought over protective gear as tensions flared among anxious customers When general panic starts driving political decision-making, public health professionals may be unable to implement strategies based on informed decisions Researchers argue that government secrecy and non-transparency diminish people?s confidence and trust, creating panic (Wilson et al , 2007) Even naming the disease possibly triggered epidemic-related trauma and the ensuing public mistrust and disbelief of authorities;the panic has also sparked a wave of racial prejudice (Titanji, 2020) Although a series of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, from Avian flu to Zika virus, may have created more public awareness, whether leaders can translate this newfound awareness into meaningful policies and action is debatable Globally, attention is growing on responses from state leaders, as some try to downplay the epidemic?s severity to maintain ?business as usual?

Using three-color immunofluorescence combined with [3H]thymidine autoradiography, we have analyzed the antigenic phenotype and mitotic potential of individual glial cells. We identified oligodendrocytes with an antibody to galactocerebroside, astrocytes with an antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein, and oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells with the O4 antibody. Cultures from demyelinated tissue differed in several ways from those of age-matched controls: first, the total number of O-2A lineage cells was strikingly increased; second, the O-2A population consisted of a higher proportion of O4-positive astrocytes and cells of mixed oligodendrocyte-astrocyte phenotype; and third, all the cell types within the O-2A lineage showed enhanced proliferation. This proliferation was not further enhanced by adding PDGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to the defined medium. However, bFGF and IGF-I seemed to influence the fate of O-2A lineage cells in cultures of demyelinated tissue. Basic FGF decreased the percentage of cells expressing galactocerebroside. In contrast, IGF-I increased the relative proportion of oligodendrocytes. Thus, O-2A lineage cells from adult mice display greater phenotypic plasticity and enhanced mitotic potential in response to an episode of demyelination.

The most common clinical manifestation of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory failure. Respiratory rehabilitation can be a crucial part of treatment but data lack for patients with COVID-19. This study investigates the effects of short-term respiratory rehabilitation (i.e., breathing exercises) on respiratory recovery among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Methods: : This quasi-experimental, pre-post-test study recruited 110 patients hospitalised with COVID-19. All patented received standardised care, and 65 patients also received the intervention (i.e., breathing exercises). Data on peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), respiratory rate (breaths/minute) and heart rate (beats/minute) and oxygen therapy requirement (litre/min) were collected at baseline and 4-5 days after the baseline assessment. Analysis of variance on repeated measures was applied to compare the outcomes of two-time points. Results: The mean (Standard deviation, SD) age of the intervention group was 49.5 (10.4) years and 73.8% were men. The mean (SD) age of the control group was 49.3 (7.9) years and 62.2% were men. After 4-5 days of respiratory rehabilitation SpO2 (96.7% 2.1 vs 90.4% 1.5), P<0.01), respiratory rate (20.5 2.4 vs 23.0 2.2) breaths/minute, P<0.01), heart rate (80.5 9.2 vs 91.2 8.6) beats/minute, P<0.01), and oxygen therapy requirement (0.4 0.98 vs 1.4 2.0) litre/min, P<0.01) improved in the intervention group compared to the control group. The mean days of hospitalisation for the intervention group and the control group were 7.1 days vs. 14.6 days, respectively. Conclusions: : Our results indicate that breathing exercise, even for a short period, is effective in improving certain respiratory parameters in patients with COVID-19. As a non-invasive and cost-effective respiratory rehabilitation intervention, breathing exercise can be a useful tool for a health care system overwhelmed by COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: C A retrospective multicentre ecological analysis was undertaken evaluating all blood cultures taken from adults from 01 April 2017 to 30 April 2020 across six acute hospitals in London. Linear trend analysis and ARIMA models allowing for seasonality were used to look for significant variation. Results: C119,584 blood cultures were included. At the height of the UK SARS-CoV-2 first wave in April 2020, Enterobacterales bacteraemias were at an historic low across two London trusts (63/3814, 1.65%), whilst CoNS were at an historic high (173/3814, 4.25%). This differed significantly for both Enterobacterales (p=0.013) and CoNS (p<0.01), when compared with prior periods, even allowing for seasonal variation.

However, a carefully selected mask of known pixels that yield a high quality inpainting can also act as a sparse image representation. This challenging spatial optimisation problem is essential for practical applications such as compression. So far, it has been almost exclusively addressed by model-based approaches. First attempts with neural networks seem promising, but are tailored towards specific inpainting operators or require postprocessing. To address this issue, we propose the first generative adversarial network for spatial inpainting data optimisation. In contrast to previous approaches, it allows joint training of an inpainting generator and a corresponding mask optimisation network. With a Wasserstein distance, we ensure that our inpainting results accurately reflect the statistics of natural images. This yields significant improvements in visual quality and speed over conventional stochastic models and also outperforms current spatial optimisation networks.","output":"A Wasserstein GAN for Joint Learning of Inpainting and its Spatial Optimisation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disproportionally affects frail, elderly patients and those with multiple chronic comorbidities Whether patients on RRT have an additional risk because of their specific exposure and complex immune dysregulation is controversial METHODS: To describe the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, region-wide registry study in adult patients on RRT versus the general population from March 2 to May 25, 2020 This study comprised all patients undergoing RRT in the Flanders region of Belgium, a country that has been severely affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) RESULTS: At the end of the epidemic wave, crude and age-standardized cumulative incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 5 3% versus 2 5%, respectively, among 4297 patients on hemodialysis, and 1 4% versus 1 6%, respectively, among 3293 patients with kidney transplants (compared with 0 6% in the general population) Crude and age-standardized cumulative mortality rates were 29 6% versus 19 9%, respectively, among patients on hemodialysis, and 14 0% versus 23 0%, respectively, among patients with transplants (compared with 15 3% in the general population) We found no excess mortality in the hemodialysis population when compared with mean mortality rates during the same 12-week period in 2015-2019 because COVID-19 mortality was balanced by lower than expected mortality among uninfected patients Only 0 18% of the kidney transplant population died of SARS-CoV-2 infection CONCLUSIONS: Mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is high in patients on RRT Nevertheless, the epidemic's overall effect on the RRT population remained remarkably limited in Flanders Calculation of excess mortality and age standardization provide a more reliable picture of the mortality burden of COVID-19 among patients on RRT","output":"Incidence, Characteristics, and Outcome of COVID-19 in Adults on Kidney Replacement Therapy: A Regionwide Registry Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent findings indicate that thrombosis is one of the underlying pathophysiology and complication of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the prognosis of the disease may be more favourable in people who were under oral anticoagulant treatment before the COVID-19 diagnosis.

METHOD: Between 1 September and 30 November 2020, 2760 patients hospitalized in our hospital due to COVID-19 were screened. A total of 1710 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups as those who use DOAC due to any cardiovascular disease before the COVID-19 infection and those who do not. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the DOAC group and 1631 patients in the non-DOAC group. Median age of all study patient was 62 (52-71 IQR) and 860 (50.5%) of them were female. The need for intensive care, in-hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation were observed at higher rates in the DOAC group. Mortality was observed in 23 patients (29%) in the DOAC group, and it was statistically higher in the DOAC group (P = .002).

Generally, an insect vector can use autophagy as an intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism against viral infection. Whether viruses can evolve to exploit autophagy to promote their transmission by insect vectors is still unknown. Here, we show that the autophagic process is triggered by the persistent replication of a plant reovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) in cultured leafhopper vector cells and in intact insects, as demonstrated by the appearance of obvious virus-containing double-membrane autophagosomes, conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II and increased level of autophagic flux. Such virus-containing autophagosomes seem able to mediate nonlytic viral release from cultured cells or facilitate viral spread in the leafhopper intestine. Applying the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or silencing the expression of Atg5 significantly decrease viral spread in vitro and in vivo, whereas applying the autophagy inducer rapamycin or silencing the expression of Torc1 facilitate such viral spread. Furthermore, we find that activation of autophagy facilitates efficient viral transmission, whereas inhibiting autophagy blocks viral transmission by its insect vector. Together, these results indicate a plant virus can induce the formation of autophagosomes for carrying virions, thus facilitating viral spread and transmission by its insect vector. We believe that such a role for virus-induced autophagy is common for vector-borne persistent viruses during their transmission by insect vectors.","output":"Autophagy pathway induced by a plant virus facilitates viral spread and transmission by its insect vector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant number of changes to elective and emergency neurosurgical practice.Materials and Methods: This paper reports the results of an online survey of Society of British Neurological Surgeons (SBNS) members undertaken between 10th and 24th of June 2020 regarding changes in consent practice in response to COVID-19, as well as the physical challenges experienced while operating under higher levels of personal protective equipment (PPE).Results: Despite the real and substantial risks associated with COVID-19, 23% of surgeons reported they were not made any changes to their usual consent process, and 54% of surgeons indicated that they made reference to COVID-19-associated risks in their written consent documentation. 93% of neurosurgeons reported physical difficulties operating using PPE; 62% reported visors/goggles fogging up, 55% experienced 'overheating', 62% reported fatigue, and 82% of surgeons reported difficulty communicating with the theatre staff.Conclusions: This survey highlights discrepancies in the consent practice between neurosurgeons which needs to be addressed at both local and national levels.

The association between moderate-severe liver injury and more severe clinical course of COVID-19 has suggested that liver injury is prevalent in severe than in mild cases of COVID-19, while no difference in liver involvement has been reported between survivors and non-survivors. The spectrum of liver involvement during COVID-19 ranges from an asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to severe hepatitis. Only rarely, cases with acute hepatitis have been reported in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Both epithelial and biliary cells possess the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors that SARS-CoV-2 uses to be internalized. However, to our knowledge, no ultrastructural identification of the virus in liver cells has been reported to date. Here we provide evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the liver of two patients, a 34-year-old woman and a 60-year-old man with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated two patients with COVID-19 showing several virions within cytoplasmic vacuoles of cholangiocytes and in endothelial cells of hepatic sinusoids. In both patients, we performed histological and ultrastructural examinations by liver biopsy. After two months, both patients were free of symptoms, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection had resolved. RESULTS: Liver biopsy histological and ultrastructural examination showed liver injury and several virions within cytoplasmic vacuoles of cholangiocytes and in endothelial cells of hepatic sinusoids. CONCLUSIONS: Although most studies in COVID-19 have been focused on the lungs, recently, cholestatic liver pathology has been introduced in the spectrum of pathological changes related to COVID-19.

The American Heart Association suggests switching of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) provider every 2 min to prevent any decrease in resuscitation quality. High quality CPR is associated with improved outcomes. Previous studies have highlighted the difficulties in providing high quality CPR particularly while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) use on CPR quality in prehospital cardiac arrest situations. METHODS: In this prospective simulation study, we compared the cardiac compression qualities and fatigue rates among prehospital health care professionals (HCPs) who were or were not using PPE. RESULTS: A total of 76 prehospital HCPs comprising 38 compression teams participated in this study. The mean compression rate was 117.71  8.27/min without PPE and 115.58  9.02/min with PPE (p = 0.191). Overall compression score was 86.95  4.39 without PPE and 61.89  14.43 with PPE (p < 0.001). Post-cardiac compression fatigue score was 4.42  0.5 among HCPs who used their standard uniform and 7.74  0.92 among those who used PPE (p < 0.001). The overall compression score difference between the two conditions was 25.05  11.74 and the fatigue score difference was 3.31  0.98. DISCUSSION: PPE use is associated with decreased cardiac compression quality and significantly higher fatigue rates than those associated with the use of standard uniforms.

Despite the paucity of evidence, various complementary, alternative and integrative medicines (CAIMs) have been being touted as both preventative and curative. We conducted sentiment and emotion analysis with the intent of understanding CAIM content related to COVID-19 being generated on Twitter across 9 months. METHODS: Tweets relating to CAIM and COVID-19 were extracted from the George Washington University Libraries Dataverse Coronavirus tweets dataset from March 03 to November 30, 2020. We trained and tested a machine learning classifier using a large, pre-labelled Twitter dataset, which was applied to predict the sentiment of each CAIM-related tweet, and we used a natural language processing package to identify the emotions based on the words contained in the tweets. RESULTS: Our dataset included 28 713 English-language Tweets. The number of CAIM-related tweets during the study period peaked in May 2020, then dropped off sharply over the subsequent three months; the fewest CAIM-related tweets were collected during August 2020 and remained low for the remainder of the collection period. Most tweets (n = 15 612, 54%) were classified as positive, 31% were neutral (n = 8803) and 15% were classified as negative (n = 4298). The most frequent emotions expressed across tweets were trust, followed by fear, while surprise and disgust were the least frequent. Though volume of tweets decreased over the 9 months of the study, the expressed sentiments and emotions remained constant. CONCLUSION: The results of this sentiment analysis enabled us to establish key CAIMs being discussed at the intersection of COVID-19 across a 9-month period on Twitter. Overall, the majority of our subset of tweets were positive, as were the emotions associated with the words found within them. This may be interpreted as public support for CAIM, however, further qualitative investigation is warranted.

The effect of the conversion from belatacept to another immunosuppressive regimen is underreported. The aim of the present retrospective study was to assess the effect on kidney function and the clinical outcome of the conversion from belatacept to another regimen. METHODS: We have identified 44 maintenance kidney transplantation patients from five French kidney transplantation centers who were converted from belatacept to another regimen either because of a complication (n = 28) or another reason (patients request or belatacept shortage, n = 13). The follow-up after the conversion from belatacept was 27.5  25.3 months. RESULTS: Overall, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from 44.2  16 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at conversion from belatacept to 35.7  18.4 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at last follow-up (P = 0.0002). eGFR significantly decreased in patients who had been given belatacept at transplantation as well as in those who had been converted to belatacept earlier. The decrease was less significant in patients who had stopped belatacept without having experienced any complications. Finally, eGFR decreased more severely in patients who were converted to calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), compared to those who received mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi).

A direct effect of SARS-COV-2 on the central nervous system (CNS) has been hypothesized. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of delirium in older patients admitted for a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 and its impact on in-hospital mortality. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: 91 patients, aged 70-years and older, admitted to an acute geriatric ward in Northern Italy from March 8th to April 17th, 2020. METHODS: COVID-19 cases were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-Cov-2 RNA from nasal and pharyngeal swabs. Delirium was diagnosed by two geriatricians according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DMS V) criteria. The number of chronic diseases was calculated among a pre-defined list of 60. The pre-disease Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was assessed at hospital admission. RESULTS: Of the total sample, 39 patients died, 49 were discharged and 3 were transferred to ICU. Twenty-five patients (27.5%) had delirium. Seventy-two percent of patients with delirium died during hospitalization compared to 31.8% of those without delirium. In a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders, patients with delirium were four times more likely to die during hospital stay compared to those without delirium (OR = 3.98;95%CI = 1.05-17.28; p = 0.047).

There is a need for improved designs for clinical trials to enable rapid, efficient and better evaluation of treatments;both a need to identify effective treatments, and equally important, to identify ineffective ones early, in order to direct resources to the most promising interventions. It is increasingly recognised that efficiencies could be gained by asking multiple questions in a single protocol.

However, the interaction mechanism between avian metapneumovirus subgroup C (aMPV/C) infection and MAVS remains unclear. Here, we confirmed that aMPV/C infection induced a reduction in MAVS expression in Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner, and active aMPV/C replication was required for MAVS decrease. We also found that the reduction in MAVS occurred at the post-translational level rather than at the transcriptional level. Different inhibitors were used to examine the effect of proteasome or autophagy on the regulation of MAVS. Treatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 effectively blocked MAVS degradation. Moreover, we demonstrated that MAVS mainly underwent K48-linked ubiquitination in the presence of MG132 in aMPV/C-infected cells, with amino acids 363, 462, and 501 of MAVS being pivotal sites in the formation of polyubiquitin chains. Finally, E3 ubiquitin ligases for MAVS degradation were screened and identified and RNF5 targeting MAVS at Lysine 363 and 462 was shown to involve in MAVS degradation in aMPV/C-infected Vero cells.

The evolutionary conservation and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts implicates a key role of s2m in the viral infection cycle. Our findings indicate that the element, while stably folded, can nonetheless be invaded and remodelled spontaneously by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that initiate pairing in exposed loops and trigger efficient sequence-specific RNA cleavage in reporter assays. ASOs also act to inhibit replication in an astrovirus replicon model system in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. Our results thus permit us to suggest that the s2m element is readily targeted by ASOs, which show promise as anti-viral agents.IMPORTANCEThe highly conserved stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is found in the genomes of many RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

Largely caused by the rapid growth of the population, industrialization, and urbanization, air pollution can adversely affect human health and environment. To mitigate such adverse impacts, the Indian government launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in January 2019. Meanwhile, the unexpected city-lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 in India greatly reduced human activities and thus anthropogenic emissions of gaseous and aerosol pollutants. The NCAP and the lockdown could provide an ideal field experiment for quantifying the extent to which various levels of human activity reduction impact air quality in the Indian subcontinent. Here, we study the improvement in air quality due to COVID-19 and the NCAP in the India subcontinent by employing multiple satellite products and surface observations. Satellite data shows significant reductions in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by 17% and aerosol optical depth (AOD) by 20% during the 2020 lockdown with reference to the mean levels between 2005C2019. No persistent reduction in NO2 nor AOD is detectable during the NCAP period (2019). Surface observations show consistent reductions in PM2.5 and NO2 during the 2020 lockdown in seven cities across the Indian subcontinent, except Mumbai in Central India. The increase in relative humidity and the decrease in the planetary boundary layer also play an important role in influencing air quality during the 2020 lockdown. With the decrease in aerosols during the lockdown, net radiation fluxes show positive anomalies at the surface and negative anomalies at the top of the atmosphere over most parts of the Indian subcontinent.

We provide a detailed overview of the distribution of UGS in CABA, along with socio-economic analysis and visitors' profile and perception before and during the restrictive measures adopted by the national authorities to contain the COVID-19 outbreak (July to December of 2020). We conducted a series of surveys based on open and closed questions. Before the pandemic, surveys were carried out in situ in eight parks of six districts, randomly chosen. During the confinement, online surveys were conducted. According to our results, the mean UGS density in CABA is 6.09 m(2) /person, but marked differences between districts exist, ranging from 0.02 m(2) /person to 17.68 m(2) /person. This uneven distribution causes differences in the quality of life of CABA inhabitants, perhaps more pronounced during reduced-mobility situations like COVID-19 confinement. Socio economic analysis were done linking multidimensional poverty, COVID-19 positive cases and urban mobility in CABA. Regarding UGS visitors, before the confinement, the majority of respondents were employees or students; during the confinement, employees and retirees predominated. When asked to choose important attributes to describe their perception about the UGS from a given list, respondents selected calm, green, and sounds of nature, without differences before and during the confinement. However, when asked about the UGS role, the main answer was a place to be with nature before the confinement and an important place in the city during it.

Methods: A comprehensive sample of very old (75 years) people insured at a large Northeastern statutory insurer was followed over 6 years (2012C2017). We assessed dental services costs for: (1) examination, assessments and advice, (2) operative, (3) surgical, (4) prosthetic, (5) periodontal, (6) preventive and (7) outreach services. Association of utilization with: (1) sex, (2) age, (3) region, (4) social hardship status, (5) International Disease Classification (ICD-10) diagnoses and (6) Diagnoses Related Groups (DRGs) was explored. Results: 404,610 individuals with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age 81.9 (5.4 years) were followed, 173,733 did not survive follow-up. Total mean costs were 129.61 (310.97) euro per capita; the highest costs were for prosthetic (54.40, SD 242.89 euro) and operative services (28.40, SD 68.38 euro), examination/advice (21.15, SD 28.77 euro), prevention (13.31, SD 49.79 euro), surgery (5.91, SD 23.91 euro), outreach (4.81, SD 28.56 euro) and periodontal services (1.64, SD 7.39 euro).

These parasites have a complex, multi-host life cycle, with mammalian definitive hosts and larval stages cycling through two intermediate hosts (snails and freshwater decapod crustaceans). In Africa, paragonimiasis is particularly neglected, and remains the only human parasitic disease without a fully characterised life cycle. However paragonimiasis has potentially significant impacts on public health in Africa, and prevalence has likely been underestimated through under-reporting and misdiagnosis as tuberculosis due to a similar clinical presentation. We identified the need to synthesise current knowledge and map endemic foci for African Paragonimus spp. together with Poikilorchis congolensis, a rare, taxonomically distant trematode with a similar distribution and morphology. We present the first systematic review of the literature relating to African paragonimiasis, combined with mapping of all reported occurrences of Paragonimus spp. throughout Africa, from the 1910s to the present. In human surveys, numerous reports of significant recent transmission in Southeast Nigeria were uncovered, with high prevalence and intensity of infection. Overall prevalence was significantly higher for P. uterobilateralis compared to P. africanus across studies. The potential endemicity of P. africanus in C?te dIvoire is also reported. In freshwater crab intermediate hosts, differences in prevalence and intensity of either P. uterobilateralis or P. africanus were evident across genera and species, suggesting differences in susceptibility. Mapping showed temporal stability of endemic foci, with the majority of known occurrences of Paragonimus found in the rainforest zone of West and Central Africa, but with several outliers elsewhere on the continent. This suggests substantial under sampling and localised infection where potential host distributions overlap. Our review highlights the urgent need for increased sampling in active disease foci in Africa, particularly using molecular analysis to fully characterise Paragonimus species and their hosts.","output":"Endemicity of Paragonimus and paragonimiasis in Sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review and mapping reveals stability of transmission in endemic foci for a multi-host parasite system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Stroke nurse is functioning as a vital member of the stroke team She/he provides care to the stroke patients in acute as well as post-acute periods She/he coordinates among other team members to facilitate the stroke care continuum Post-stroke care is always a challenge for health care professional as well as caregivers During current pandemic conditions, it is essential to provide quality care at their home Purpose: To develop a mobile application to provide home based care for prevention and management of post stroke complications among survivors Methods: Survey was carried out among 170 bedridden stroke survivors and their caregivers to assess problems faced like aspiration pneumonia, bedsore, urinary tract infection, deep vein thrombosis, frozen shoulder, contractures, and caregiver burden On the basis of findings 'Stroke home care' a bilingual (in Hindi and English) mobile application was developed which contains step by step nursing-care-procedural videos to prevent bedsore, bedsore dressing, positioning change, Ryle's tube feeding, Foley's catheter care, active and passive range of motion exercises, hand washing with soap-water as well with sanitizer, psychological support to patients Results: Through this intervention, caregivers of bedridden stroke patients get trained for care procedures so that they can provide best possible nursing care to their patients at home and can prevent post stroke complications and ultimately enhances quality of life of survivors and reduce caregivers' burden Conclusion: 'Stroke Home Care' is a novel intervention developed by a stroke nurse which has been developed and tested not just for its feasibility and acceptability but also proven for its clinical applicability through PROBE designed study This web based intervention can provide rehabilitation services to bedridden stroke survivors at their home in this pandemic (Figure Presented)","output":"'stroke home care'-a mobile application: Home based innovative nursing care intervention developed by stroke nurse: A need of the time in COVID-19 pandemic like situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a significant number of mortalities worldwide.

A loss in lung function and pulmonary fibrosis are the main manifestations of patients with the severe form of the disease. The lung function is affected, even after recovery, thereby greatly affecting the psychology and well-being of patients, and significantly reducing their quality of life. METHODS: Participants must meet the following simultaneous inclusion criteria: over 18 years of age, should have recovered from severe or critical COVID-19 cases, should exhibit pulmonary fibrosis after recovery, and should exhibit Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome as indicated in the system of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The eligible candidates will be randomized into treatment or control groups. The treatment group will receive modern medicine (pirfenidone) plus TCM whereas the control group will be administered modern medicine plus TCM placebo. The lung function index will be continuously surveyed and recorded. By comparing the treatment effect between the two groups, the study intend to explore whether TCM can improve the effectiveness of modern medicine in patients with pulmonary fibrosis arising as a sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection. DISCUSSION: Pulmonary fibrosis is one of fatal sequelae for some severe or critical COVID-19 cases, some studies reveal that pirfenidone lead to a delay in the decline of forced expiratory vital capacity, thereby reducing the mortality partly. Additionally, although TCM has been proven to be efficacious in treating pulmonary fibrosis, its role in treating pulmonary fibrosis related COVID-19 has not been explored. Hence, a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized controlled, interventional, prospective clinical trial has been designed and will be conducted to determine if a new comprehensive treatment for pulmonary fibrosis related to COVID-19 is feasible and if it can improve the quality of life of patients.

Agreement was evaluated using Cohens kappa index, diagnostic accuracy was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, efficiency or global accuracy and positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for the prevalence in the study population. RESULTS: The concordance rates between the interpretations of the clinicians and the ABG-a for acid-base disorders were an observed global agreement of 84,3% with a Cohens kappa coefficient 0.81; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.86; p < 0.001. For detecting accuracy normal acid-base status the algorithm has a sensitivity of 90.0% (95% CI 79.9 to 95.3), a specificity 97.2% (95% CI 94.5 to 98.6) and a global accuracy of 95.9% (95% CI 93.3 to 97.6). For the four simple acid-base disorders, respiratory alkalosis: sensitivity of 91.2 (77.0 to 97.0), a specificity 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 99.1 (97.5 to 99.7); respiratory acidosis: sensitivity of 61.1 (38.6 to 79.7), a specificity of 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 98.0 (95.9 to 99.0); metabolic acidosis: sensitivity of 75.8 (59.0 to 87.2), a specificity of 99.7 (98.2 to 99.9) and a global accuracy of 97.4 (95.1 to 98.6); metabolic alkalosis sensitivity of 72.2 (56.0 to 84.2), a specificity of 95.5 (92.5 to 97.3) and a global accuracy of 93.0 (88.8 to 95.3); the four complex acid-base disorders, respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, the sensitivity, specificity and global accuracy was also high. For normal acid-base status the algorithm has PPV 87.1 (95% CI 76.6 to 93.3) %, and NPV 97.9 (95% CI 95.4 to 99.0) for a prevalence of 17.4 (95% CI 13.8 to 21.8). For the four-simple acid-base disorders and the four complex acid-base disorders the PPV and NPV were also statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The ABG-a showed very high agreement and diagnostic accuracy with experienced senior clinicians in the acid-base disorders in a clinical context. The method also provides refinement and deep complex analysis at the point-of-care that a clinician could have at the bedside on a day-to-day basis. The ABG-a method could also have the potential to reduce human errors by checking for imminent life-threatening situations, analysing the internal consistency of the results, the oxygenation and renal status of the patient.","output":"Automatic real-time analysis and interpretation of arterial blood gas sample for Point-of-care testing: Clinical validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on microbiological tests such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or sequencing.

Patients with underlying respiratory disease are considered at increased risk of contracting severe COVID-19. Many respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis, have elevated inflammation driven by recruitment of neutrophils, known as neutrophilia, and contributes to disease pathogenesis. In response to viral infection, neutrophils are the first, and predominant, leukocyte recruited to the respiratory tract. Neutrophils release inflammatory mediators as part of the acute inflammatory response and contribute to pathogen clearance through virus internalization and killing, secretion of antimicrobial peptides and extracellular traps. It remains uncertain how critical the neutrophil response is in SARS-CoV-2 and to what extent this contributes to the cytokine response of the airways in COVID-19. We hypothesized that neutrophils are responsible for elevated inflammatory responses in patients who progress to severe COVID-19. Methods: To investigate, we developed a co-culture model of neutrophilic airways to study SARS-CoV-2 infection, combining primary human neutrophils and airway epithelial cells differentiated at the air-liquid interface. These cultures, with and without neutrophils, were infected with live SARS-CoV-2 and the inflammatory responses analyzed. In addition, extensive analysis of ACE2, neutrophils and inflammatory response, was performed comparing our models and COVID-19 patient and non-infected lung tissues. Results: ACE2 protein, the receptor binding to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, was predominantly expressed in submucosal glands, ciliated cells and in alveolar type 2 cells in human lung tissues. Surprisingly, substantial co-localization of ACE2 was also observed with neutrophil elastase and CD15 expressing neutrophils infiltrating the airways. Analysis of mono-and co-cultures of airway epithelial cells and neutrophils in the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated significant increases in the expression of squamous epithelium associated cytokeratins, damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) and a downregulation of interleukin 8 (IL-8) specifically in the co-culture models. Airway supernatants from the basolateral and apical surfaces were profiled. In the neutrophil co-cultures significant increases in IFN, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF were observed in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: In conclusion, we demonstrate that co-culture with neutrophils has a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection, changing the inflammatory response and upregulating gene expression patterns associated with tissue remodeling and tissue damage. This study highlights the need to study SARS-CoV-2 infection in more complex, tissue-level models to fully understand the mechanisms driving the severe inflammatory response and the long-term consequences of infection.","output":"Neutrophils significantly enhance pro-inflammatory cytokine release from airway epithelial cells in response to sars-COV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HIV stigmatizing attitudes are embedded in social context, making it important to develop culturally specific tools for accurate measurement. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of the HIV Stigmatizing Attitudes Scale (HSAS) in Moshi, Tanzania. Items were adapted based on a scale developed by Visser et al. which was one of the first to measure HIV stigmatizing attitudes in the general population (i.e., people not living with HIV). Items were translated into Swahili and modified with iterative feedback. The HSAS was administered to participants (N = 1494) in an HIV stigma reduction intervention study at two antenatal care clinics in Moshi, Tanzania. The HSAS was found to have strong domain coherence and high reliability based on Cronbachs alpha, Omega 6 coefficient values, and the composite reliability coefficient, and high validity based on content-oriented evidence, relations to other variables, and response process. Factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure (Moral Judgment and Interpersonal Distancing), consistent with the original Visser scale. The HSAS provides a robust way to measure HIV stigma in the Tanzanian context and can be culturally adapted to other settings.

In our serosurveillance on an industrial workforce of randomly selected 3296 subjects, COVID-19 IgG antibody positivity was reported in 7.37% (243) subjects. However, when 30 days later, eight of the 243 COVID-19 IgG antibody-positive individuals complained of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection and were confirmed as COVID-19 infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), their COVID-19 IgG antibodies were retested. Seven of the eight previously IgG positive individuals had lost their protective antibodies. Methods Subsequently, a prospective clinical trial was planned by repeating the test for IgG antibodies on the remaining earlier positive 235 individuals at 45-65 days after their initial test. Only 201 of the 235 individuals consented and participated in the non-randomized single-arm observational trial. Results Only 28.36% (57/201) retained their IgG antibodies and 70.15% (141/201) had lost their IgG antibodies. Three cases reported equivocal results on retesting. Conclusions Our findings show that the protective COVID-19 IgG antibodies rapidly decline over one to three months. Further studies are needed with a quantitative assay over a period with neutralizing antibodies to establish if its decay can potentially lead to reinfections.

One of the known nonpharmacological methods to eliminate these disorders is music therapy. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of instrumental music on state depression and anxiety in hemodialysis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was a clinical trial. The population was hemodialysis patients in Hamedan in 2017 and 50 patients were selected and randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The duration each time of the instrumental music intervention for the experimental group was 3 weeks, 3 times a week for 20 min. Data were measured by beck depression inventory and SpeilBerger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y1 before the intervention and immediately after the last intervention and analyzed using Yates correction, Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, independent t-test, and Wilcoxon test. RESULTS No significant difference between the intervention and control groups was observed before the study in terms of demographic variables (P > 0.05). In the intervention group, the mean and standard deviation of the depression score before the intervention was 8.99  23.68 and after the intervention reached 7.54  14.88, which shows that the variable was significant (P = 0.001); however, no significant difference was observed in the control group. In the intervention group, the mean of state anxiety before the intervention was 10.05  53.76 and after the intervention reached 9.76  42.48, which was statistically significant (P = 0.004), while no significant difference was observed in the control group.

Molecular diagnostics via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been key in the rapid diagnosis of most of these viral infections. However, a high index of suspicion and early institution of appropriate isolation measures remain as the mainstay in the control and containment of the spread of these viral infections. Although treatment for most of the viral infections remains supportive, efficacious antiviral agents against influenza infections exist. The infections discussed in this chapter include those first described in the 2000s: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and metapneumovirus and rhinovirus C as well as those that have been described in the past but have reemerged in the last decade in outbreaks resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, including adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).","output":"28 New and Emerging Infections of the Lung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (ax-SpA) have not been explored in detail. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are commonly used for ax-SpA patients, and how they influence outcomes may have implications on COVID-19 management. METHODS: A nationwide multi-centric research network was queried for patients with ax-SpA, including ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic SpA (nr-SpA) who had developed COVID-19. An equal number of propensity score(PS) matched controls were extracted from the database amongst patients with COVID-19 who did not have any inflammatory arthritis. Outcomes included mortality and others including hospitalization, intensive care unit, ventilation, acute kidney injury (AKI), renal replacement therapy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral infarction, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and sepsis. RESULTS: We identified 9766 patients with ax-SpA (924 AS and 8842 nr-SpA) and 691,862 without SpA who had COVID-19. In the unmatched comparison, patients with ax-SpA had higher risk ratios (RR) for all outcomes. After matching for demographics and comorbidities, patients with ax-SpA had lower RR for mortality [RR: 0.707 (95% CI: 0.598C0.836), p < 0.0001], severe COVID-19 [RR: 0.791 (0.69C0.906), p = 0.0007], hospitalization [RR: 0.872 (0.826C0.921), p < 0.0001], and AKI [RR: 0.902 (0.816C0.997), p = 0.044]. Only the risk of VTE was higher in ax-SpA patients [RR: 1.219 (1.037C1.433), p = 0.016]. Amongst the ax-SpA group, males had worse outcomes in 9 out of the 11 domains except for VTE and cerebral infarction, while blacks had worse outcomes in all except for mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy. AS had similar risk ratios for all outcomes compared with nr-SpA except hospitalization [RR: 1.457 (1.03C2.06), p = 0.0318]. There was no difference in outcomes in patients who had received TNFi in the year previous to COVID-19 infection. Ax-SpA patients who had been prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the 3 months prior to COVID-19 had poorer outcomes. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, COVID-19 outcomes were better in patients with ax-SpA as compared with PS matched controls except for increased risk for VTE. The use of TNFi is not associated with better or worse outcomes.

The extent to which dietary fibre can further reduce risk for those with CVD and treated with cardioprotective drugs has not been clearly established. We have examined the evidence for dietary fibre as adjunct therapy in those with CVD or hypertension. METHODS Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and CENTRAL were searched to June 2021. Prospective observational studies reporting on fibre intakes and mortality in those with pre-existing CVD and controlled trials of increasing fibre intakes on cardiometabolic risk factors in those with CVD or hypertension were eligible. Outcomes were mortality (studies) and cardiometabolic risk factors (trials). Data synthesis was with random effects and dose response. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS Three prospective studies including 7469 adults with CVD, and 12 trials of 878 adults with CVD or hypertension were identified. Moderate certainty evidence indicates reduced all-cause mortality (relative risk, RR0.75 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.58-0.97)) when comparing higher with lower fibre intakes. Low certainty evidence from trials of adults with cardiovascular disease indicates increasing fibre intakes reduced total (mean difference, MD - 0.42 mmol/L (95%CI - 0.78 to - 0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD - 0.47mmol/L (95%CI - 0.85 to - 0.10)). High certainty evidence from trials of adults with hypertension indicates increasing fibre intakes reduces systolic (MD 4.3 mmHg (95% CI 2.2 to 5.8)) and diastolic blood pressure (MD 3.1 mmHg (95% CI 1.7 to 4.4)). Moderate and low certainty evidence indicated improvements in fasting blood glucose (MD 0.48 mmol/L (- 0.91 to - 0.05)) and LDL cholesterol (MD 0.29 mmol/L (95% CI 0.17 to 0.40)).

Additionally, paired samples from 25 individuals with evidence of repeat HCoV-NL63 infection were selected for whole-genome virus sequencing. RESULTS: HCoV-NL63 was detected in 1.3% (75/5573) of child pneumonia admissions. Two HCoV-NL63 genotypes circulated in Kilifi between 2008 and 2014. Full genome sequences formed a monophyletic clade closely related to contemporary HCoV-NL63 from other global locations. An unexpected pattern of repeat infections was observed with some individuals showing higher viral titers during their second infection. Similar patterns for 2 other endemic coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were observed. Repeat infections by HCoV-NL63 were not accompanied by detectable genotype switching.

Studies have shown that COVID 19 is hypercoagulative prothrombotic state. The innate tropism of SARS CoV-2 for vascular endothelial cells and their consequent damage, together with the intense activation of inflammatory responses and of coagulation pathways, may explain the intense pro-coagulative state. It ultimately predisposes to systemic micro-thrombotic alterations and gives rise to the consistent rate of multi-organ failure, DIC and ARDS in severe COVID-19 patients. Purpose: Aims of this retrospective study were to determine the correlation between a CT-based semi-quantitative score of pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia with D-dimer and CRP levels. Materials and methods: 174 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients were enrolled from August 4 to October 12, 2020, for this single-center analysis in rural India and chest CT examinations were retrospectively evaluated. The COVID 19 positivity was defined on the basis of RTPCR done at ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) approved laboratory. A semiquantitative CT score was calculated based on the extent of lobar involvement (0:0%;1: <5%;2: 5-25%;3: 26-50%;4: 51-75%;5: >75%;range 0-5;global score 0-25). D-dimer and CRP were done at the time of admission. One way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey test were performed to compare the variables of Chest CT score in percentage to various other variables. Results: CT score had significant positive correlation with D-dimer levels (p=0.002, r: 0.237). CT score was significantly correlated with CRP (p<0.001, r: 0.392) levels. Subgroup analysis by post hoc Tukey test further showed that D-dimer levels were significantly elevated in 51-75% and >75% lobar involvement groups on Chest CT with statistically significant p value of <0.001. Conclusions: This study data suggests that CT score has significant positive correlation with D-dimer and CRP. D-dimer is significantly elevated in the group where lobar involvement is more significant on Chest CT. Ddimer is an indirect marker of active coagulation and thrombin formation. Elevated D-dimer represents activation of endovascular thrombotic processes. This hypercoagulative infection-induced state is systemic, and may lead to various clinical manifestations such as myocardial infarction, stroke, limb ischemia and DIC. Monitoring of pro-thrombotic activity of SARS-CoV- 2 with tests such as D-dimer, with consequent labelled administration of adjusted doses of anticoagulants are of paramount importance in order to prevent worsening of global conditions due to vascular parenchymal or systemic thrombotic dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Correlation of chest CT severity score with D-dimer levels in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 20-year-old woman with previous COVID-19 diagnosis presented with abdominal pain and colitis on CT scan.

A microarray-based transcriptome analysis in LN229 GBM cells revealed that cellular dormancy entry was characterized by an increased expression of CCL2 and SAA2, while THSD4, FSTL3, and VEGFC were upregulated during dormancy exit. Co-stimulation with the chemokine cocktail reduced upregulation of identified genes. After verifying the appearance of identified genes in human GBM primary cultures and ex vivo samples, we clarified whether each chemokine alone impacts cellular dormancy mechanisms using specific antagonists and selective CRISPR/Cas9 clones. While expression of CCL2 and SAA2 in LN229 cells was altered by the CXCL12-CXCR4-CXCR7 axis, CXCL16 and CX3CL1 contributed to reduced upregulation of THSD4 and, to a weaker extent, of VEGFC. The influence on FSTL3 expression depended on the entire chemokine cocktail. Effects of chemokines on dormancy entry and exit-associated genes were detectable in human GBM primary cells, too, even if in a more complex, cell-specific manner. Thus, chemokines play a significant role in the regulation of TMZ-promoted cellular dormancy in GBMs.","output":"Entry and exit of chemotherapeutically-promoted cellular dormancy in glioblastoma cells is differentially affected by the chemokines CXCL12, CXCL16, and CX3CL1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we examined the role of the eastern bent-winged bat (Miniopterus fuliginosus) in the dispersion of bat adenovirus and bat alphacoronavirus in east Asia, considering their gene flows and divergence times (based on deep-sequencing data), using bat fecal guano samples. Bats in China moved to Jeju Island and/or Taiwan in the last 20,000 years via the Korean Peninsula and/or Japan. The phylogenies of host mitochondrial D-loop DNA was not significantly congruent with those of bat adenovirus (m(2)(XY) = 0.07, p = 0.08), and bat alphacoronavirus (m(2)(XY) = 0.48, p = 0.20). We estimate that the first divergence time of bats carrying bat adenovirus in five caves studied (designated as K1, K2, JJ, N2, and F3) occurred approximately 3.17 million years ago. In contrast, the first divergence time of bat adenovirus among bats in the 5 caves was estimated to be approximately 224.32 years ago. The first divergence time of bats in caves CH, JJ, WY, N2, F1, F2, and F3 harboring bat alphacoronavirus was estimated to be 1.59 million years ago. The first divergence time of bat alphacoronavirus among the 7 caves was estimated to be approximately 2,596.92 years ago. The origin of bat adenovirus remains unclear, whereas our findings suggest that bat alphacoronavirus originated in Japan.

These questions are intended to identify people who experience a long-term disability, and data from these questions are frequently interpreted as capturing discrete groups of individuals. Recent research has shown that a significant proportion of individuals respond to these questions inconsistently over time, possibly indicating that the six-question set also identifies transitory disability. However, it is unclear if these inconsistent responses are associated with changes in health status. We begin to test the validity of these observations by exploring how changes in health related quality of life correspond to changes in disability status. METHODS We recruited 525 participants to complete a longitudinal paper and pencil survey four times over 18 months that included the six disability questions, measures of health related quality of life, and mobility equipment use. We computed within person changes in health related quality of life variables to investigate how changes in disability status are associated with changes in health status. RESULTS Among respondents who reported disability, half or less consistently reported the same disability. Additionally, respondents who changed disability responses also reported changes in health related quality of life. For example, when individuals transition into walking disability, their health-related quality of life index decreases by, on average, 0.18 s.d. (p<0.05), and when individuals transition out of walking disability their health-related quality of life index increases by, on average, 0.27 s.d. (p<0.001). CONCLUSION The six-question set identifies people who experience both enduring and transitory disability. Changes in health related characteristics correlate with changes in disability status. This suggests that observed transitions in disability reflect real changes in perceived health and impairment.","output":"Health status changes with transitory disability over time."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To determine the effect of low-intensity, long-wavelength red light therapy (LLRT) on the inhibition of myopia progression in children. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. One hundred and five myopic children (spherical equivalent refractive error [SER] -3.09  1.74 dioptres [D]; mean age, 9.19  2.40 years) who underwent LLRT treatment (power 0.4 mW, wavelength 635 nm) twice per day for 3 min each session, with at least a 4-h interval between sessions, and a control group of 56 myopic children (SER -3.04  1.66 D; mean age, 8.62  2.45 years) were evaluated. Both groups wore single-vision distance spectacles. Each child returned for a follow-up examination every 3 months after the initial measurements for a total of 9 months. RESULTS At 9 months, the mean SER in the LLRT group was -2.87  1.89 D, significantly greater than that of the control group (-3.57  1.49 D, p < 0.001). Axial length (AL) changes were -0.06  0.19 mm and 0.26  0.15 mm in the LLRT group and control group (p < 0.001), respectively. The subfoveal choroidal thickness changed by 45.32  30.88 m for children treated with LLRT at the 9-month examination (p < 0.001). Specifically, a substantial hyperopic shift (0.31  0.24 D and 0.20  0.14 D, respectively, p = 0.02) was found in the 8-14 year olds compared with 4-7 year old children.

There is a need to determine the optimal pediatric neurosurgical outreach model through which resources are efficiently utilized while imparting the largest possible impact on global health. This study evaluates the efficacy of an international pediatric neurosurgery outreach model at transferring operative skill in a sustainable and scalable manner in Lima, Peru over a 15-year duration. METHODS: Three 1-week neurosurgical missions were carried out (2004C2006) in Lima, Peru to teach neuroendoscopic techniques and to provide equipment to host neurosurgeons, equipping the hosts to provide care to indigent citizens beyond the duration of the missions. Follow-up data were obtained over a 15 year span, with collaboration maintained over email, two in-person visits, and video-conferencing services. RESULTS: Since the outreach missions in 2004C2006, the host neurosurgeons demonstrated sustainability of the neuroendoscopic instruction by independently performing neuroendoscopic operations on a growing caseload: at baseline, 0 cases were performed in 2003, but since 2012 and onwards, 40C45 cases have been performed annually. Scalability is illustrated by the fact that the institution established a rigorous neuroendoscopy training program to independently pass on the techniques to resident physicians. CONCLUSION: The described international pediatric neurosurgical outreach model, centered around teaching operative technique as opposed to solely providing care to citizens, allowed operative skill to be sustainably transferred to surgeons in Lima, Peru. Having served the neuroendoscopic needs of hundreds of citizens, the strategic design is replicable and should be mirrored by future medical endeavors seeking to substantially impact the deficit in global surgical care.","output":"Optimizing international neurosurgical outreach missions: 15-year appraisal of operative skill transfer in Lima, Peru"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the influences of the prosocial and antisocial tendency of Weibo users on post transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We use SnowNLP to construct semantic dictionaries and training models. Our major findings include the following. First, through correlation analysis and negative binomial regression, we find that user posts with high intensity and prosocial emotion can trigger comments or forwarding behaviour. Second, the influence of antisocial emotion on Weibo comments, likes, and retweets are insignificant. Third, the general emotion about prosocial comments in Weibo also shows the emotion trend of prosocial comments.

Machine learning algorithms represent a novel approach for the data-driven prediction of clinical outcomes with advantages over statistical modeling. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a machine learningCbased scorethe Piacenza scorefor 30-day mortality prediction in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The study comprised 852 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, admitted to the Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital in Italy from February to November 2020. Patients medical history, demographics, and clinical data were collected using an electronic health record. The overall patient data set was randomly split into derivation and test cohorts. The score was obtained through the na?ve Bayes classifier and externally validated on 86 patients admitted to Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Italy) in February 2020. Using a forward-search algorithm, 6 features were identified: age, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, temperature, previous stroke, and gender. The Brier index was used to evaluate the ability of the machine learning model to stratify and predict the observed outcomes. A user-friendly website was designed and developed to enable fast and easy use of the tool by physicians. Regarding the customization properties of the Piacenza score, we added a tailored version of the algorithm to the website, which enables an optimized computation of the mortality risk score for a patient when some of the variables used by the Piacenza score are not available. In this case, the na?ve Bayes classifier is retrained over the same derivation cohort but using a different set of patient characteristics. We also compared the Piacenza score with the 4C score and with a na?ve Bayes algorithm with 14 features chosen a priori. RESULTS: The Piacenza score exhibited an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.84, Brier score=0.19) in the internal validation cohort and 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.89, Brier score=0.16) in the external validation cohort, showing a comparable accuracy with respect to the 4C score and to the na?ve Bayes model with a priori chosen features; this achieved an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83, Brier score=0.26) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.86, Brier score=0.17), respectively.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of interest to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN BODY: Stem cell-based therapies have been verified for prospective benefits in copious preclinical and clinical studies. MSCs confer potential benefits to develop various cell types and organoids for studying virus-human interaction, drug testing, regenerative medicine, and immunomodulatory effects in COVID-19 patients. Apart from paving the ways to augment stem cell research and therapies, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) holds unique ability for a wide range of health applications such as patient-specific or isogenic cells for regenerative medicine and breeding transgenic animals for biomedical applications.

In this study, we found that acteoside, a natural phenylpropanoid glycoside from Kuding Tea, enhanced IFN- production in mouse lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, particularly in the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of T lymphocytes. To this end, we suggest that the antiviral activity of acteoside was highly correlated to its inducing ability of IFN- production. Mechanistically, the activation of T-bet enhanced the promoter of IFN- and subsequently resulted in an increased IFN- production in T cells.

METHODS: The prospective observational multicentre study carried out from 1 March till 30 June 2020 included adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support or high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO). RESULTS: Seventy-four patients, 46 males and 28 females, median age 67.5 (Q1-Q3: 56-75) years, were included. Sixty-four patients (86.5%) had comorbidity. Sixty-six patients (89.2%) were mechanically ventilated, four of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. Eight patients (10.8%) were treated with non-invasive ventilation and HFNO only. The median of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 22.5 days. Eighteen patients (24.3%) needed continuous renal replacement therapy. Thirty patients (40.5%) died. Age and acute kidney injury were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital death, and chronic kidney disease showed trend towards statistical significance for poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient number of intensive care beds, organ support equipment and well-trained staff is a decisive factor in managing the COVID-19 epidemic. The study focused on the needs of intensive care in the COVID-19 patients. Advanced age and acute kidney injury were identified as independent predictors for in-hospital mortality. When compared to clinical course and ICU management of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by other pathogens, we observed prolonged need for ventilatory support, high rate of progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and significant mortality in studied population.","output":"COVID-19 severe pneumonia: Prospective multicentre study on demands on intensive care capacities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early detection of fibrosis progression is of major relevance for the diagnosis and management of patients with liver disease. This study was designed to find non-invasive biomarkers for fibrosis in a clinical context where this process occurs rapidly, HCV-positive patients who underwent liver transplantation (LT). We analyzed 93 LT patients with HCV recurrence, 41 non-LT patients with liver disease showing a fibrosis stage F1 and 9 patients without HCV recurrence who received antiviral treatment before LT, as control group. Blood obtained from 16 healthy subjects was also analyzed. Serum samples were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography and their proteomic profile was analyzed by SELDI-TOF-MS. Characterization of the peptide of interest was performed by ion chromatography and electrophoresis, followed by tandem mass spectrometry identification. Marked differences were observed between the serum proteome profile of LT patients with early fibrosis recurrence and non-recurrent LT patients. A robust peak intensity located at 5905 m/z was the distinguishing feature of non-recurrent LT patients. However, the same peak was barely detected in recurrent LT patients. Similar results were found when comparing samples of healthy subjects with those of non-LT fibrotic patients, indicating that our findings were not related to either LT or HCV infection. Using tandem mass-spectrometry, we identified the protein peak as a C-terminal fragment of the fibrinogen  chain. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that TGF- reduces -fibrinogen mRNA expression and 5905 m/z peak intensity in HepG2 cells, suggesting that TGF- activity regulates the circulating levels of this protein fragment. In conclusion, we identified a 5.9 kDa C-terminal fragment of the fibrinogen  chain as an early serum biomarker of fibrogenic processes in patients with liver disease.","output":"Lack of a 5.9 kDa Peptide C-Terminal Fragment of Fibrinogen  Chain Precedes Fibrosis Progression in Patients with Liver Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Stroke is a public health concern, and the emergence of the COVID-19 virus has made the continuation of social support/rehabilitation groups for stroke survivors difficult. Many stroke survivors have been required to self-isolate for 12 weeks or more, according to government rules and regulations. This has led to the use of innovative technological platforms (eg Zoom) for delivering rehabilitation activities through 'life after stroke' group sessions, such as choir practice for stroke survivors. Aims: The purpose of this study was to explore stroke survivors' experiences and perceptions of engaging, or choosing not to engage, in a virtual choir (VC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Eight participants were recruited from the Stroke Association Strike a Chord VC. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and the verbatim transcriptions were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: Three main themes were identified: experience of singing in a choir;VCs and me;and yearning to sing face-to-face, with respective subthemes. The experience and perceptions presented here are intertwined. While most stroke survivors perceived the VC as a positive platform for providing a sense of belonging (community), there was a sense of yearning for face-to-face singing.

However, the important point is that their possible association with medium-vessel vasculitis involving the celiac trunk and its branches with acute anterior uveitis in the same patient has not been reported before. CASE PRESENTATION: In this manuscript, we are reporting a case of a middle-aged gentleman who developed vasculitis involving the celiac trunk and its branches, and acute anterior uveitis one week and three weeks after the second dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, respectively. The patient showed significant clinical and radiographic improvement after receiving corticosteroids and azathioprine. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Previously reported cases of vasculitis following COVID-19 vaccines included both renal-limited and more generalized vasculitis with some being positive and others negative for ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies). Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that most cases responded to immunosuppressive treatment. Post-COVID-19 vaccine uveitis was reported in patients with different age spans including both anterior and posterior uveitis, with remission being achieved after the use of corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple cases of vasculitis and acute anterior uveitis were reported following COVID-19 vaccines; however, it is important to mention that more research is needed to establish an association between the COVID-19 vaccine and both vasculitis and acute anterior uveitis.

Effective treatments are needed to minimize death, maximize welfare, and maintain growth and productivity. The objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy of a commercially available nutritional supplement (Diaque, Boehringer-Ingelheim Vetmedica Inc., St. Joseph, MO) and i.v. lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) in rehydrating, preventing acidemia, and correcting electrolyte imbalances in an experimental model for calf scours. Twenty-four colostrum-fed suckling dairy calves were used in a modified crossover design. An osmotic diarrhea was induced by orally feeding commercial milk replacer modified with high level of sucrose to create a hypertonic milk solution, and administering oral hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone for 48 h. The intention was to create a challenge sufficient to result in moderately dehydrated, standing calves without producing severe depression or loss of suckle. The efficacy of i.v. fluid therapy and a commercial nutritional supplement were subsequently compared for reversing the effects of the diarrheal disease. Treatment A consisted of administering the nutritional supplement according to label directions (100 g in 1.9 L of warm water, 3 times a day), and treatment B consisted of i.v. LRS (2 L, once a day). Clinical signs and laboratory results were obtained once daily by a blinded observer. The induction method was effective in creating the desired effect, as demonstrated by weight loss and subjective health and hydration scores. Both treatment groups experienced increases in body weight, base excess, and bicarbonate, and decreases in total protein and packed cell volume following treatment. Both i.v. LRS and Diaque are effective methods to correct hypovolemia and control derangements in acid-base status in calves with diarrhea and dehydration.","output":"Comparison of a commercially available oral nutritional supplement and intravenous fluid therapy for dehydration in dairy calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to explore the cyber-deception-based approach and to design a novel conceptual model of hybrid threats that includes deception methods. Security programs primarily focus on prevention-based strategies aimed at stopping attackers from getting into the network. These programs attempt to use hardened perimeters and endpoint defenses by recognizing and blocking malicious activities to detect and stop attackers before they can get in. Most organizations implement such a strategy by fortifying their networks with defense-in-depth through layered prevention controls. Detection controls are usually placed to augment prevention at the perimeter, and not as consistently deployed for in-network threat detection. This architecture leaves detection gaps that are difficult to fill with existing security controls not specifically designed for that role. Rather than using prevention alone, a strategy that attackers have consistently succeeded against, defenders are adopting a more balanced strategy that includes detection and response. Most organizations deploy an intrusion detection system (IDS) or next-generation firewall that picks up known attacks or attempts to pattern match for identification. Other detection tools use monitoring, traffic, or behavioral analysis. These reactive defenses are designed to detect once they are attacked yet often fail. They also have some limitations because they are not designed to catch credential harvesting or attacks based on what appears as authorized access. They are also often seen as complex and prone to false positives, adding to analyst alert fatigue. The security industry has focused recent innovation on finding more accurate ways to recognize malicious activity with technologies such as user and entity behavioral analytics (UEBA), big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and deception.","output":"Threat Defense: Cyber Deception Approach and Education for Resilience in Hybrid Threats Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While countries are in a hurry to obtain SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we are concerned with the availability of vaccine and whether a vaccine will be available to all in need.

CKD diagnoses can have overlapping, non-specific clinical symptoms and histology findings, and the underlying etiology can remain unknown. Recent studies have shown that 1 in 10 adults with CKD has a genetic component to their disease. However, genetic services are limited in this patient population and disproportionally impact those from medically underserved communities. Therefore, an adult kidney genetics clinic was developed within the Division of Nephrology at a large urban academic medical center to increase access to genetic services and testing in adults with kidney disease. Methods: In June 2019, the Division of Nephrology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center created a Kidney Genetics Clinic staffed by genetic counselors (GC) and nephrologists. Initially, appointments were held in-person but transitioned to telemedicine beginning in May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The clinic utilized two appointment types: full genetic consults (staffed by a GC and nephrologist) and genetic counseling visits (staffed by a GC only). Genetic counselors implemented several genetic education initiatives to increase clinic referrals and increase provider interest. These included bi-monthly genetic case seminars, monthly genetic research sign-out rounds, a continuing education course focusing on clinical genetics, and genetic counseling student rotations. Results: Between June 2019 and June 2021, the clinic received 277 referrals, averaging 11 per month. Of those referred, 83% were scheduled, and 212 patients underwent genetic evaluation. The median wait time from referral to appointment was 37 days, and the no-show rate was 8%. The majority (89%) of appointments were via telehealth, either by phone or video, while the rest occurred in person. Genetic counseling visits accounted for 21% of patient appointments, and the remaining ones were full genetic consults. Most patients who attended their genetics appointment were in the NY tri-state area (87%), but 12% resided in nine additional states, three other countries, and one US territory. The primary insurance was Medicare in 10% of patients and Medicaid in 17%. Most patients described themselves as white (n=126), while 47 patients reported Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, 36 identified as Black, 15 Asian, and 4 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. The average age of the patient population was 44 years old (ranging from 18 to 87). Patients seen in the genetics clinic were referred for a variety of indications and included several different kidney diagnoses, including: CAKUT (n=6), tubulointerstitial disease (n=26), suspected or clinical diagnosis of a collagenopathy (n=38), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (n=28), tubulopathy or electrolyte disorder (n=16), cystic kidney disease (including PKD) (n=24), hematuria and/or proteinuria (n=31), complement dysregulation (n=8), tumor or cancer (n=4), and CKD of unknown etiology (n=23). Six patients had a known genetic diagnosis, and 23 were healthy relatives of individuals with a known genetic diagnosis or potential kidney donors. Of patients seen in the kidney genetics clinic, 42% reported a family history of CKD or a personal or family history of a genetic diagnosis. A total of 186 clinical genetic tests were ordered on 174 patients;nine tests still have results pending, and ten were canceled. Genetic tests that were ordered included: small (>50) and large gene panels (n=146), exome sequencing (n=6), microarrays (n=4), and single gene and targeted variant testing (n=20). In patients that did not undergo genetic testing, reasons included: not clinically indicated, testing already ordered, and financial concerns. A diagnostic or candidate diagnostic positive result was reported in 29% of patients, involving 18 different genes. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were most common in COL4A4 (n=11), followed by PKD1 (n=8). Similarly, the highest diagnostic yield was in patients with a referral ndication of a suspected collagenopathy (diagnosis in 50%) or cystic disease (diagnosis in 50%). A non-diagnostic positive finding was identified in 9% of patients and included results such as secondary findings (n=1), carrier status (n=5), and risk factors, such as an APOL1 high-risk genotype (n=9). The identification of a genetic diagnosis in patients impacted several areas of clinical care, including referrals to specialists, kidney donor selection, clinical trial eligibility (for example, in patients with a genetic Alport diagnosis), and increased access to medications (such as tolvaptan in patients with PKD1 variants). In addition, those with non-diagnostic findings were referred to ongoing research studies at the medical center to elucidate the genetics of kidney disease. Conclusion: Here, we describe the successful creation and implementation of an adult kidney genetics clinic at a large medical center. By utilizing a combination of in-person appointments and telemedicine, the clinic was able to provide access to genomic services across a broad geographic region and to a diverse patient population of adults with kidney disease. Genetic education efforts were an integral component of the clinic's success, as it increased visibility and helped providers identify patients who would benefit from genetic services, as evidenced by the high percentage of referred patients scheduling appointments and high diagnostic yield in patients undergoing testing. Identifying genetic diagnoses in this patient population has several clinical implications, including changes in management, eligibility for genetically stratified clinical trials, and treatment decisions. Continued and ongoing access to genomic services is a fundamental component of patient care in adults with kidney disease.","output":"eP270: Incorporating genetic services into adult kidney disease care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The characterization of clinical outcomes and prognostic factors in COVID-19-infected cancer patients is important for health care authorities, policy makers and oncologists. We collected extensive data on COVID-19-infected cancer patients from 1 March 2020 over a one-year period. Among 455 patients included, death from COVID-19 infection occurred in 98 patients, resulting in a mortality rate of 21.5%. Age  65 years, non-curative disease, intensive care unit admission and oxygen requirement were particular and independent negative prognostic factors for death from COVID-19. COVID-19 severity and mortality in cancer patients remained high in a country (Switzerland) with a decentralized, high-quality, universal-acess health care system. ABSTRACT: Purpose: These are the final results of a national registry on cancer patients with COVID-19 in Switzerland. Methods: We collected data on symptomatic COVID-19-infected cancer patients from 23 Swiss sites over a one-year period starting on 1 March 2020. The main objective was to assess the outcome (i.e., mortality, rate of hospitalization, ICU admission) of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients; the main secondary objective was to define prognostic factors. Results: From 455 patients included, 205 patients (45%) had non-curative disease, 241 patients (53%) were hospitalized for COVID-19, 213 (47%) required oxygen, 43 (9%) invasive ventilation and 62 (14%) were admitted to the ICU. Death from COVID-19 infection occurred in 98 patients, resulting in a mortality rate of 21.5%. Age 65 years versus <65 years (OR 3.14, p = 0.003), non-curative versus curative disease (OR 2.42, p = 0.012), ICU admission (OR 4.45, p < 0.001) and oxygen requirement (OR 20.28, p < 0.001) were independently associated with increased mortality. Conclusions: We confirmed high COVID-19 severity and mortality in real-world cancer patients during the first and second wave of the pandemic in a country with a decentralized, high-quality, universal-access health care system. COVID-19-associated mortality was particularly high for those of older age in a non-curative disease setting, requiring oxygen or ICU care.","output":"Outcome and Prognostic Factors of COVID-19 Infection in Swiss Cancer Patients: Final Results of SAKK 80/20 (CaSA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on human health and the world economy.

There will most likely be significant oscillations in numbers of cases for the foreseeable future, based on the regional epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Less affected hospitals and facilities will attempt to progressively resume elective procedures and surgery. Ramping up elective care in hospitals that deliberately curtailed elective care to focus on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients will present unique and serious challenges. Among the challenges will be protecting patients and providers from recurrent outbreaks of disease while increasing procedure throughput. Anesthesia providers will inevitably be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by patients who have not been diagnosed with infection. This is particularly concerning in consideration that aerosols produced during airway management may be infective. In this article, we recommend an approach to routine anesthesia care in the setting of persistent but variable prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We make specific recommendations for personal protective equipment and for the conduct of anesthesia procedures and workflow based on evidence and expert opinion. We propose practical, relatively inexpensive precautions that can be applied to all patients undergoing anesthesia. Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is spread primarily by respiratory droplets and aerosols, effective masking of anesthesia providers is of paramount importance. Hospitals should follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for universal masking of all providers and patients within their facilities. Anesthesia providers should perform anesthetic care in respirator masks (such as N-95 and FFP-2) whenever possible, even when the SARS-CoV-2 test status of patients is negative. Attempting to screen patients for infection with SARS-CoV-2, while valuable, is not a substitute for respiratory protection of providers, as false-negative tests are possible and infected persons can be asymptomatic or presymptomatic. Provision of adequate supplies of respirator masks and other respiratory protection equipment such as powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) should be a high priority for health care facilities and for government agencies. Eye protection is also necessary because of the possibility of infection from virus coming into contact with the conjunctiva. Because SARS-CoV-2 persists on surfaces and may cause infection by contact with fomites, hand hygiene and surface cleaning are also of paramount importance.","output":"Infection Prevention Precautions for Routine Anesthesia Care During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latent dangers of waterborne viral transmission have become a major public health concern.

Both the pandemic and these measures have the potential to cause mental health problems among individuals. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate and estimate the prevalence of psychological well-being, particularly from an Indian perspective using systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature. METHODS: We searched in the PubMed database, starting from the onset of the current pandemic and until 10th October 2020 to synthesize evidence on mental health outcomes from India. DerSimonian and Laird method of the random-effects meta-analysis was employed and heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Chi-square based Cochran's Q statistic and I-squared (I(2)) statistics. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of stress in nine studies was 60.7% (95% CI: 42.3%C77.7%), depression in eight studies was 32.7% (95% CI: 24.6%C41.3%), anxiety in six studies was 34.1% (95% CI: 26.3%C42.3%) and sleep disturbances in six studies was 26.7% (95% CI: 13.9%C41.8%). As expected, high heterogeneity was observed in the above-mentioned outcomes. Sub-group analysis showed that Health Care Workers (HCWs) had a higher prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression & psychological distress in comparison to the general population. CONCLUSION: A significant impact on psychological well-being during COVID-19 was observed in India as common adverse outcomes were stress (61%), psychological distress (43%), anxiety (34%), depression (33%), and sleep disturbances (27%).

The media coverage, however, has been critiqued as stigmatizing. Although this critique is not new, there is limited understanding of how and why new stigmas emerge from exposure to media coverage. Drawing upon the model of stigma communication (Smith et al., 2019) and the attribution model of stigma (Corrigan et al., 2003), we investigated a novel model of stigma emergence that delineates two kinds of longitudinal processes: (a) a message-effects process, in which exposure to mediated messages about COVID-19 leads to public stigma through danger appraisal and (b) a coping process in which stress and rumination shape later perceptions of public stigma. To test the model, we tracked an emerging COVID-19 stigma with a two-wave survey of a prospective, longitudinal cohort living in one county in a mid-Atlantic state (N = 883). The results supported this model.

Few studies focused on characteristics of COVID-19 nonsurvivors. Objective In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of 101 nonsurvivors with COVID-19 and analyze risk factors associated with the rapid disease progress to death after admission. Design Retrospective study using electronic medical records. Participants 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University before February 15, 2020, were included in this study. Main measures We obtained epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data from electronic medical records. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors associated with rapid disease progress to death after admission. Key results Among included nonsurvivors, the median age was 71.0 years (IQR, 59.0-80.0), 60 (59.4%) were men. Eighty-two (79.2%) had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (58.4%), diabetes (21.8%) etc. Respiratory failure (99.0%), acute cardiac injury (52.5%), sepsis (40.6%) and acute kidney injury (22.8%) were most common complications. Patients died within 3 days of admission were more likely to develop sepsis compared with those survived 3 days of admission. Higher heart rate and respiration rate, increased white blood cell count and neutrophil count, elevated myoglobin level and depressed oxygen saturation on admission were associated with rapid disease progress to death within 3 days of admission. The AUCs for white blood cell count and neutrophil count were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.60-0.80) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59-0.79), respectively. Conclusions Older patients with underlying comorbidities suffering COVID-19 were at increased risks of death. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury played crucial roles in the death of COVID-19 patients. Of importance, early development of sepsis, increased white blood cell count and neutrophil count on admission were associated with the rapid disease progress to death.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 101 COVID-19 nonsurvivors in Wuhan, China: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Current diagnostic tests are inadequate to detect typhoid cases, as well as the chronic carrier state, the sole reservoir of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. The current study was conducted to find new molecular signatures of pathogen/disease to understand the mechanism behind the hostCpathogen interaction in enteric fever. METHODS: Proteomics-based studies were done to determine the expression of differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of controls, acute typhoid cases, and chronic typhoid carriers. Further, transcriptome-based analysis using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was done in controls, acute typhoid cases, and chronic typhoid carriers. RESULTS: Results showed the upregulation of proprotein convertase subtilisin, furin, haptoglobin, and albumin in the plasma of chronic typhoid carriers. The elevation in mRNA expression of four differentially expressed proteins confirms the changes at the transcriptional level. Further, the increase in albumin and haptoglobin in chronic typhoid carriers shows their role in free radical generation, inflammation, and monocyte cell signaling.

A possible solution to this problem was additive manufacturing (AM) technology - allowing for a quick start of the production of PPE and potentially able to meet the demand until the production is restored. In addition, AM allows for the production of PPE prototypes with potentially greater comfort of use or degree of protection. In order to assess the production of PPE in AM during the COVID-19 pandemic, previously published articles in this field were analyzed. After analyzing abstracts and full texts, 30 original works were selected from the initially collected 487 articles. Based on the analyzed literature, it was found that there are not enough studies comparing traditional and AM PPE as well as not enough comparisons of the different types of AM PPE with each other. In many cases, researchers focused only on the subjective assessment of the comfort of using PPE, without assessing their effectiveness in preventing infections. Despite that, AM has a great potential to quickly produce lacking PPE. Respirators and shields made by AM were rated by the vast majority of users as comfortable to wear. Some of the respirators could be adapted to a specific user, by designing on the basis of a face scan or after warming up the finished print and modeling the shape.","output":"Is additive manufacturing a magic bullet to resupply lacking PPE?

In this paper, we analyze the differential changes in rural and urban restaurant visits by the restaurants NAICS codes following the COVID-19 lockdowns. Our analysis contributes to the public policy literature and helps operational planning for food distribution during a pandemic. METHODS: Since urban and rural consumer behavior and food resources are significantly different, it is crucial to conduct a comparative analysis. Our study applies a difference-in-differences model to capture the differential effects lockdowns have on urban and rural restaurants. RESULTS: We find that restaurant visits declined significantly in both rural and urban counties after shelter-at-home orders. The decrease in total restaurant visits was almost twice as high in urban counties as in rural counties. We also find that visits to fast-food restaurants increased in rural counties during shelter-at-home orders.

Although two members of the RLR family, RIG-I and MDA5, have been implicated in host control of virus infection, the relative role of each RLR in restricting pathogenesis in vivo remains unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that MAVS, the adaptor central to RLR signaling, is required to trigger innate immune defenses and program adaptive immune responses, which together restrict West Nile virus (WNV) infection in vivo. In this study, we examined the specific contribution of MDA5 in controlling WNV in animals. MDA5(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility, as characterized by reduced survival and elevated viral burden in the central nervous system (CNS) at late times after infection, even though small effects on systemic type I interferon response or viral replication were observed in peripheral tissues. Intracranial inoculation studies and infection experiments with primary neurons ex vivo revealed that an absence of MDA5 did not impact viral infection in neurons directly. Rather, subtle defects were observed in CNS-specific CD8(+) T cells in MDA5(-/-) mice. Adoptive transfer into recipient MDA5(+/+) mice established that a non-cell-autonomous deficiency of MDA5 was associated with functional defects in CD8(+) T cells, which resulted in a failure to clear WNV efficiently from CNS tissues. Our studies suggest that MDA5 in the immune priming environment shapes optimal CD8(+) T cell activation and subsequent clearance of WNV from the CNS.","output":"Pattern recognition receptor MDA5 modulates CD8+ T cell-dependent clearance of West Nile virus from the central nervous system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection, is still extending across the world affecting millions of lives to the date.

METHODS A case note review of all ED patients assessed for suspected COVID-19 between March and May 2020 at Monklands University Hospital was conducted. Demographic characteristics, clinical parameters, baseline blood tests and radiographic findings, hospital length of stay, intensive care and maximum oxygen requirement were obtained for those admitted. Using logistic regression, the association between EIH at admission triage and COVID-19 diagnosis was explored adjusting for confounding clinical parameters. RESULTS Of 127 ED patients admitted for possible COVID-19, 37 were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19. 36.4% of patients with COVID-19 and EIH had a normal admission chest radiograph.

A substantial body of evidence for health systems strengthening is generated in SA, and this informs national and international health system guidelines and guidance. In this manuscript, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the SA Medical Research Council, we apply an evidence ecosystem lens to the SA health system, and discuss its current functioning in support of the achievement of a high-quality health system that is able to achieve universal health coverage. We use three case studies to describe successes, challenges and gaps in the functioning of the evidence ecosystem. The first case study focuses on using evidence to strengthen health-system governance and support for community health worker programmes. The second case focuses on managing the growing epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis, while the third case focuses on social protection, the child support grant and its impact on health. SA scientists are part of global initiatives to strengthen the health-systems evidence ecosystem, specifically through pioneering methods to synthesise evidence and produce evidence-informed guidelines to facilitate evidence use in health-system decision-making.

In this context, it is necessary to identify and describe Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide opportunities for health education, promotion, and prevention aimed at the general population. The study is a systematic review of MOOCs on health education, health promotion, and prevention for the general population in a pandemic context. Methods: We developed a search for MOOC courses aimed at the general population on health education, health promotion, and prevention in different MOOC available platforms. We executed a descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs. Results: There were 117 MOOCs chosen on Health education, promotion, and prevention for the general population. Coursera (40.3%) was the platform that offered the highest quantity of MOOCs; more than half of MOOCs language was in English (52.9%). The median duration time in hours of the selected MOOCs was 11 (IR 6-15). The predominant themes were \\"Health promotion\\" (43%) and \\"Food and nutrition\\" (31%), and the origin was mainly from Europe (37.8%). Conclusions: MOOCs offerings in Health Education (HE) is diverse, predominantly in English, of European origin, and in health promotion issues.

While research on the structures and effects of networks abound, this paper examines the far less studied process of networking among LTU jobseekers. Exploring the networking process is imperative for understanding the emotional toll and structural obstacles facing LTU workers in the post?COVID-19 pandemic period. Going beyond individualizing explanations, I use in-depth interviews to uncover the structural conditions that make networking challenging for all LTU jobseekers. Contrary to static conceptualizations of ties as social capital, a metaphor implying that ties are static resources, this paper argues that more attention needs to be paid to the processes and structural conditions that facilitate or hinder the activation or formation of socialties. Specifically, it shows that, under conditions of precarity and stigma, networking can undermine workers? identities as valued and moral, leaving them feeling discouraged and ethically challenged in a way similar to used car salespeople.","output":"Networking While Long-Term Unemployed: Why Long-Term Unemployment Will Likely Persist Long after the COVID-19 Pandemic Recedes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Therapies that improve survival in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are needed. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin 6 receptor, may counteract the inflammatory cytokine release syndrome in patients with severe COVID-19 illness. Objective: To test whether tocilizumab decreases mortality in this population. Design, Setting, and Participants: The data for this study were derived from a multicenter cohort study of 4485 adults with COVID-19 admitted to participating intensive care units (ICUs) at 68 hospitals across the US from March 4 to May 10, 2020. Critically ill adults with COVID-19 were categorized according to whether they received or did not receive tocilizumab in the first 2 days of admission to the ICU. Data were collected retrospectively until June 12, 2020. A Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for confounding. Exposures: Treatment with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to death, compared via hazard ratios (HRs), and 30-day mortality, compared via risk differences. Results: Among the 3924 patients included in the analysis (2464 male [62.8%]; median age, 62 [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-71] years), 433 (11.0%) received tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Patients treated with tocilizumab were younger (median age, 58 [IQR, 48-65] vs 63 [IQR, 52-72] years) and had a higher prevalence of hypoxemia on ICU admission (205 of 433 [47.3%] vs 1322 of 3491 [37.9%] with mechanical ventilation and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of <200 mm Hg) than patients not treated with tocilizumab. After applying inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity-of-illness characteristics were well balanced between groups. A total of 1544 patients (39.3%) died, including 125 (28.9%) treated with tocilizumab and 1419 (40.6%) not treated with tocilizumab. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 (IQR, 14-37) days, patients treated with tocilizumab had a lower risk of death compared with those not treated with tocilizumab (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.92). The estimated 30-day mortality was 27.5% (95% CI, 21.2%-33.8%) in the tocilizumab-treated patients and 37.1% (95% CI, 35.5%-38.7%) in the non-tocilizumab-treated patients (risk difference, 9.6%; 95% CI, 3.1%-16.0%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this cohort study, the risk of in-hospital mortality in this study was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission compared with patients whose treatment did not include early use of tocilizumab. However, the findings may be susceptible to unmeasured confounding, and further research from randomized clinical trials is needed.","output":"Association Between Early Treatment With Tocilizumab and Mortality Among Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In an effort to mitigate COVID-19 related challenges for clinical research, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new guidance for the conduct of 'virtual' clinical trials in late March 2020. This study documents trends in the use of connected digital products (CDPs), tools that enable remote patient monitoring and telehealth consultation, in clinical trials both before and after the onset of the pandemic. DESIGN: We applied a comprehensive text search algorithm to clinical trial registry data to identify trials that use CDPs for remote monitoring or telehealth. We compared CDP use in the months before and after the issuance of FDA guidance facilitating virtual clinical trials. SETTING: All trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with start dates from May 2019 through February 2021. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the overall percentage of CDP use in clinical trials started in the 10 months prior to the pandemic onset (May 2019-February 2020) compared with the 10 months following (May 2020-February 2021). Secondary outcome measures included CDP usage by trial type (interventional, observational), funder type (industry, non-industry) and diagnoses (COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 participants). RESULTS: CDP usage in clinical trials increased by only 1.65 percentage points, from 14.19% (n=23 473) of all trials initiated in the 10 months prior to the pandemic onset to 15.84% (n=26 009) of those started in the 10 months following (p<0.01). The increase occurred primarily in observational studies and non-industry funded trials and was driven entirely by CDP usage in trials for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in the short-term, new options created by regulatory guidance to stimulate telehealth and remote monitoring were not widely incorporated into clinical research. In the months immediately following the pandemic onset, CDP adoption increased primarily in observational and non-industry funded studies where virtual protocols are likely medically necessary due to the participants' COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Use of connected digital products in clinical research following the COVID-19 pandemic: a comprehensive analysis of clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Testing has played a crucial role in reducing the spread of COVID. Although COVID symptoms tend to be less severe in children and adolescents, a key concern is young peoples role in the transmission of the virus given their highly social lifestyles. In this study, we aimed to identify the predictors associated with COVID testing in Australian youth using data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Methods We used the latest wave 9C1 of the LSAC, where data were collected from 16 to 21 year olds Australians via an online survey between October and December 2021. In total, 2291 Australian youths responded to the questions about COVID testing and COVID symptom severity. Data were stratified by living with/without parents, and bivariate and logistic regression analyses examined predictor variables (age, sex, country of birth, remoteness, education level, employment, relationship status, number of household members, living with parents, receiving the COVID financial supplement from government and index of relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage) and their distributions over the outcome variable COVID testing. Results Youths aged between 16 to 17 years were more likely to live at home than youths aged between 20 and 21 years. The strongest predictor of COVID testing was living in major cities (regardless of living with or without parents). The changed household composition was significantly associated with COVID testing among the youths living in the parental home. While among the respondents living without their parents, living with multiple household members and low or no cohesion among household members was associated with higher rates of COVID testing. Conclusion Our study revealed young people have been very good at getting tested for COVID. To further incentivise testing in this age group, we should consider providing this age group with continued financial and social support while awaiting the outcome of the test and during any isolation.","output":"Predictors of COVID testing among Australian youth: Insights from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary There are as yet no licenced therapeutics for the COVID-19 pandemic. The causal coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds host cells via a trimeric Spike whose receptor binding domain (RBD) recognises angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), initiating conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. We find that the monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds the RBD tightly, neutralising SARS-CoV-2 and report the crystal structure at 2.4 ? of the Fab/RBD complex. Some crystals are suitable for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors. The highly conserved, structure-stabilising, CR3022 epitope is inaccessible in the prefusion Spike, suggesting that CR3022 binding facilitates conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state. Cryo-EM analysis confirms that incubation of Spike with CR3022 Fab leads to destruction of the prefusion trimer. Presentation of this cryptic epitope in an RBD-based vaccine might advantageously focus immune responses. Binders at this epitope may be useful therapeutically, possibly in synergy with an antibody blocking receptor attachment.","output":"Neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 by destruction of the prefusion Spike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus pandemic, policy makers need to interpret available public health data to make decisions affecting public health.

Besides damage caused by feeding, it transmits several tospoviruses. Identification of T. palmi at an early stage is crucial in implementing appropriate pest management strategies. Morpho-taxonomic identification of T. palmi based on the adult stage is time-consuming and needs taxonomic expertise. Here, we report a rapid, on-site, field-based assay for identification of T. palmi based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), its first application in insects. RPA primers designed based on 3 polymorphisms of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 region efficiently discriminated T. palmi without any cross-reactivity to other predominant thrips species. RPA was performed with crude DNA, extracted from single T. palmi simply by crushing in sterile distilled water and could be completed within 20 min by holding the reaction tubes in the hand. The assay was further simplified by using fluorescent as well as colorimetric dyes thus eliminating the gel-electrophoresis steps. The presence of T. palmi was visualized by a change in color from dark blue to sky blue. The assay was validated with known thrips specimens and found to be effective in diagnosing the presence of T. palmi in natural vegetation. This on-site, rapid assay for diagnosis of T. palmi can be used by non-expert personnel in the field of quarantine and pest management.","output":"A rapid field-based assay using recombinase polymerase amplification for identification of Thrips palmi, a vector of tospoviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic causes an overwhelming number of hospitalization and deaths with a significant socioeconomic impact. The vast majority of studies indicate that asthma and allergic diseases do not represent a risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility nor cause a more severe course of disease. This raises the opportunity to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the interaction between an allergic background and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The majority of patients with asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, food allergies and drug allergies exhibit an over-expression of type 2 immune and inflammatory pathways with the contribution of epithelial cells, innate lymphoid cells, dendritic cells, T cells, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and the type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, and IL-31. The potential impact of type 2 inflammation-related allergic diseases on susceptibility to COVID-19 and severity of its course have been reported. In this review, the prevalence of asthma and other common allergic diseases in COVID-19 patients is addressed. Moreover, the impact of allergic and non-allergic asthma with different severity and control status, currently available asthma treatments such as inhaled and oral corticosteroids, short- and long-acting 2 agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists and biologicals on the outcome of COVID-19 patients is reviewed. In addition, possible protective mechanisms of asthma and type 2 inflammation on COVID-19 infection, such as the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors, antiviral activity of eosinophils and cross-reactive T-cell epitopes, are discussed.

Self-reported mentoring improved for FMTP participants with mentoring quality (p = 0.009) and meeting mentees expectations (p = 0.01) continuing to improve for up to 2 years after training. However, participants were unsure if they were meeting UR mentees expectations. FMTP participants were significantly more satisfied with mentoring quality (p < 0.001) compared to non-participants, with the greatest increase in satisfaction reported by UR faculty (38C61%). UR faculty reported improved overall morale (51C61%) and a perception that the environment was supportive for UR faculty (48C70%). CONCLUSION: The implementation of a system-wide formal structured FMTP was associated with improved faculty satisfaction, quality of mentoring, and institutional climate, especially for UR faculty.","output":"A system-wide health sciences faculty mentor training program is associated with improved effective mentoring and institutional climate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 ARDS is associated with release of biologically active neutrophil elastase-related proteinases to the airways and blood at a comparable level to non-COVID ARDS https://bit.ly/3nihveh","output":"Proteinase release from activated neutrophils in mechanically ventilated patients with non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If you are worried about coronavirus--good;you should be Small things are likely to have a big impact, and the measures that are being put in place--reducing congregation and increasing hygiene--are likely to have a large impact in the control of the disease A phrase that has gotten a lot of attention in both social and real media is flattening the curve Here, Schramm focuses on analytics and the notion of flattening the curve","output":"Coronavirus and Analytics: Flattening the Curve"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ENT department at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital introduced the use of 'Attend anywhere' which is a virtual platform that is used by medical professionals to carry out clinics remotely. It ensures confidentiality between the physician and the patient, as well as practicing social distancing. We assessed the number of patients seen in the virtual clinic, the conversion rate of virtual to face-to-face appointments and technical issues with Attend Anywhere. Method: We carried out a 3-month retrospective data collection on patients seen in the Attend Anywhere clinic. We accessed their clinical records using the Welsh Clinical Portal system. The outcome for each patient was documented. We also assessed any technical issues with the platform. Results: 305 patients were scheduled to be seen on the platform. Of the 305, 264 attended their appointment. 4 of the patients required urgent medical attention and were subsequently scheduled for urgent face-toface appointment within the 24 hours. 19 patients had technical issues with the Attend Anywhere platform, and 14 of them were subsequently converted to telephone consultations. The issues were not specifically documented, but connectivity to webcam was a common recurrence. 70 patients were safely discharged from the ENT department Conclusions: The introduction of the Attend Anywhere virtual clinic has greatly helped prevent a backlog of patients waiting to be seen by the ENT team. 26% of patients were safely discharged back to the GP.

Social vulnerability indices are attempts to create a relative ranking of vulnerability to a natural or anthropogenic hazard across space and have been widely used to quantify community vulnerability to natural disasters. Here, we develop a hierarchical socio-ecological vulnerability index that compares counties in the contiguous United States based on 18 variables grouped into four dimensions (ecological, social, health, and economic) in order to capture a range of factors that might contribute to community vulnerability to Covid-19. Variables were chosen based on a review of the emerging literature about the factors associated with poor health outcomes from Covid-19, information about the economic sectors most at risk from the pandemic and pandemic response, and existing social vulnerability indices. We find that socio-ecological vulnerability to Covid-19 and its related economic effects varies across the contiguous U.S., with especially high vulnerability in the Southeast U.S. and especially low vulnerability in the Upper Midwest, Great Plains, and Mountain West.","output":"Spatial variation in socio-ecological vulnerability to Covid-19 in the contiguous United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research responds to urgent calls to fill knowledge gaps on COVID-19 (new coronavirus) in communicating social distancing messages to the public in the most convincing ways.

While remotely delivering and assessing technology is not new, there are few methods available in the literature that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, and none for older adults specifically. Older adults comprise a very diverse population, including in terms of their experience with and access to technology, making this a challenging endeavor. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to remotely deliver and conduct usability testing for a mobile health technology intervention for older adult participants enrolled in a clinical trial of the technology. This paper describes the methodology used, its successes, and its limitations. METHODS: We developed a conceptual model for remote operations, called the Framework for Agile and Remote Operations (FAR Ops), that combined the general requirements for spaceflight operations with Agile project management processes to quickly respond to this challenge. Using this framework, we iteratively created \\"care packages\\" that differed in their contents based on participant needs and were sent to study participants in order to deliver the study intervention (a medication management app) and assess its usability. Usability data was collected using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and a novel usability questionnaire developed to collect more in-depth data. RESULTS: In the first 6 months of the project, we successfully delivered 21 care packages. We succeeded in designing and deploying a minimum viable product in less than 6 weeks, generally maintained a 2-week sprint cycle, and achieved a 40-50% return rate for both usability assessment instruments. We hypothesize that lack of engagement due to the pandemic and our use of asynchronous communication channels contributed to the return rate of usability assessments being lower than desired. We also provide general recommendations for performing remote usability testing with diverse populations based on the results of our work, including implementing screen-sharing capabilities when possible, and determining participant preference for phone or email communications. CONCLUSIONS: The FAR Ops model allowed our team to adopt remote operations for our mHealth trial, in response to interruptions from COVID-19. This approach can be useful for other research or practical projects, under similar circumstances or to improve efficiency, cost, effectiveness, and participant diversity in general. In addition to offering a replicable approach, this paper tells the often-untold story of practical challenges faced by mobile health projects and practical strategies used to address them.","output":"Going Remote: Demonstration and Evaluation of Remote Technology Delivery and Usability Assessment with Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to identify targets for neuropalliative care interventions in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by examining characteristics of patients and sources of distress and support among former caregivers.

We purposively recruited 12 caregivers for in-depth interviews and extracted associated patient data. We analysed interviews using the constant comparison method and chart data using descriptive statistics. Patients had a median age of 70 (range: 60C86) years and disease duration of 14.5 months (range 4C41 months). Caregivers were interviewed a median of 22 (range 11C39) months after patient death and had a median age of 59 (range 45C73) years. Three major sources of distress included (1) the unique nature of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; (2) clinical care issues such as difficult diagnostic process, lack of expertise in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, gaps in clinical systems, and difficulties with end-of-life care; and (3) caregiving issues, including escalating responsibilities, intensifying stress, declining caregiver well-being, and care needs surpassing resources. Two sources of support were (1) clinical care, including guidance from providers about what to expect and supportive relationships; and (2) caregiving supports, including connection to persons with experience managing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, instrumental support, and social/emotional support.

We generated a modified S glycoprotein of SARS-Cov-2 to pseudotype lentiviral vectors which efficiently transduced ACE2-expressing cells with high specificity and contain minimal off-target transduction of ACE-2 negative cells. By utilizing optimized codons, modifying the S cytoplasmic tail domain, and including a mutant form of the spike protein (D614G), we generated an expression plasmid encoding the optimized protein that produces S pseudotyped lentiviral vectors at an infectious titer (TU/mL) 1000-fold higher than the unmodified S protein. S pseudotyped replication-defective lentiviral vectors eliminate the need for biosafety-level-3 laboratories required when developing therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 with live infectious virus.

Platforms such as YouTube enable easy sharing of attractive, if not always evidence-based, videos with large personal networks and the public. Although much research has focused on characterizing health misinformation on the internet, it has not sufficiently focused on describing and measuring individuals information competencies that build resilience. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess individuals willingness to share a nonCevidence-based YouTube video about strengthening the immune system; to describe types of evidence that individuals view as supportive of the claim by the video; and to relate information-sharing behavior to several information competencies, namely, information literacy, science literacy, knowledge of the immune system, interpersonal trust, and trust in health authority. METHODS: A web-based survey methodology with 150 individuals across the United States was used. Participants were asked to watch a YouTube excerpt from a morning TV show featuring a wellness pharmacy representative promoting an immunity-boosting dietary supplement produced by his company; answer questions about the video and report whether they would share it with a cousin who was frequently sick; and complete instruments pertaining to the information competencies outlined in the objectives. RESULTS: Most participants (105/150, 70%) said that they would share the video with their cousins. Their confidence in the supplement would be further boosted by a friends recommendations, positive reviews on a crowdsourcing website, and statements of uncited effectiveness studies on the producers website. Although all information literacy competencies analyzed in this study had a statistically significant relationship with the outcome, each competency was also highly correlated with the others. Information literacy and interpersonal trust independently predicted the largest amount of variance in the intention to share the video (17% and 16%, respectively). Interpersonal trust was negatively related to the willingness to share the video. Science literacy explained 7% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: People are vulnerable to web-based misinformation and are likely to propagate it on the internet. Information literacy and science literacy are associated with less vulnerability to misinformation and a lower propensity to spread it. Of the two, information literacy holds a greater promise as an intervention target. Understanding the role of different kinds of trust in information sharing merits further research.","output":"Factors Influencing Willingness to Share Health Misinformation Videos on the Internet: Web-Based Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dragon's blood is a natural medicine with hemostatic and blood-activating effects and is used to promote wound healing.

Six serological assays detecting predominantly IgG antibodies targeting either the Spike (S) and/or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were used including also a Luminex based assay using an S protein in its native trimeric form. Antibody responses against the S and/or the N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute infection phase although differences in sensitivity (range 83 to 97% 16-33 days post-initial symptoms) were observed between the different assays and the Luminex S protein trimer assay was the most sensitive. Interestingly, antibody responses against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection phase of the infection while those against the S protein persist over time, as indicated by the drop in sensitivity of the assays targeting the N protein (sensitivity range 71-77%). Assays detecting anti-N IgG antibodies may substantially underestimate the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the groups of patient positive contacts, i.e. 10.9 to 32.2% reduction (P<0.05-<0.0001) and in the random selected general population, i.e. up to 45% reduction (P<0.05).

We evaluated all patients and 79% were hospitalized and 21% were closely monitored as outpatients. None of our patients were hospitalized at outside institutions. Two (14%) required intubation and none required V-V ECMO support. The immunotherapy was modified in all patients: MMF and prednisone were discontinued, tacrolimus dose was reduced. COVID19 treatment was: 71% received hydroxychloroquine, 50% azithromycin, 15% remdesevir, 7% convalescent plasma. All hospitalized patients received anticoagulation. One patient had 2R/3A rejection within 30 days prior to diagnosis. Graft function was maintained in all patients with median LVEF% 65 (59-65%) except one patient who had received thymoglobulin 2 weeks prior to COVID 19 infection (LVEF 30%). The patient had a prolonged intubation but ultimately recovered and was discharged from the hospital. The one death (7.1%) was a heart - kidney recipient who concomitantly presented with pseudomonas sepsis and severe neutropenia. The remaining patients have all been discharged home. Conclusion We present our single center experience in managing COVID 19 infected heart transplant patients. We implemented uniform management strategies by incorporating aggressive reduction of immunosuppression, frequent scheduled contacts with infected outpatients and making sure all infected patients requiring hospitalization were treated at a transplant center.","output":"COVID-19 Impact on Heart Organ Transplantation - New Insights from a Single-Center Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to examine the joint role of the pandemic-induced source of crisis (i.e. health and social crisis) based on Maslows Hierarchy of Needs and message appeal in customer perception of and behavioral intention toward a restaurant.

Most patients have a defect in the cystathionine-beta-synthase, the key enzyme in the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine. Many abnormalities in the connective tissue of patients with homocystinuria resemble those seen in Marfan syndrome, caused by mutations in fibrillin-1. These observations led to the hypothesis that the structure and function of fibrillin-1 is compromised in patients with homocystinuria. To test this hypothesis we produced recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragments spanning the central portion of the molecule (8-Cys/transforming growth factor-beta binding domain 3 to calcium binding EGF domain 22) and extensively analyzed the potential of homocysteine to modify structural and functional properties of these proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed moderate changes of their secondary structures after incubation with homocysteine. Equilibrium dialysis demonstrated a number of high affinity calcium binding sites in the tandemly repeated calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like domains 11-22. Calcium binding of homocysteine-modified fragments was completely abolished. Incubation of the recombinant proteins with homocysteine rendered the analyzed calcium binding EGF domains as well as the 8-Cys/transforming growth factor-beta binding domain 3 significantly more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Furthermore, data were obtained demonstrating that homocysteine can covalently modify fibrillin-1 via disulfide bonds. These data strongly suggest that structural and functional modifications as well as degradation processes of fibrillin-1 in the connective tissues of patients with homocystinuria play a major role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.","output":"Modification of the structure and function of fibrillin-1 by homocysteine suggests a potential pathogenetic mechanism in homocystinuria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) related to SARS-CoV recently emerged in the Middle East causing more than 400 deaths with a mortality rate of about 30%, much higher than SARS-CoV.

We collected a number of different animal species infected with SARS-CoV-2 and its related viruses. Then, we retrieved genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SC2r-CoVs from GISAID and NCBI GenBank for genomic and mutational analysis. Although the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, the diverse SC2r-CoV have been detected in multiple Rhinolophus bat species and in Malayan pangolin. To date, human-to-animal spillover events have been reported in cat, dog, tiger, lion, gorilla, leopard, ferret, puma, cougar, otter, and mink in 25 countries. Phylogeny and genetic recombination events of SC2r-CoVs showed higher similarity to the bat coronavirus RaTG13 and BANAL-103 for most of the genes and to some Malayan pangolin coronavirus (CoV) strains for the N protein from bats and pangolin showed close resemblance to SARS-CoV-2. The clustering of animal and human strains from the same geographical area has proved human-to-animal transmission of the virus. The Alpha, Delta and Mu-variant of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in dog, gorilla, lion, tiger, otter, and cat in the USA, India, Czech Republic, Belgium, and France with momentous genetic similarity with human SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

How they do so in COVID-19 may be revealed by analyzing the epigenetic chromatin accessibility of cis- and trans-regulatory elements and creating transcriptomic immune profiles. We performed single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC) and single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing (seq) on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of severely ill/critical patients (SCPs) infected with COVID-19, moderate patients (MPs), and healthy volunteer controls (HCs). About 76,570 and 107,862 single cells were used, respectively, for analyzing the characteristics of chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic immune profiles by the application of scATAC-seq (nine cases) and scRNA-seq (15 cases). The scATAC-seq detected 28,535 different peaks in the three groups; among these peaks, 41.6 and 10.7% were located in the promoter and enhancer regions, respectively. Compared to HCs, among the peak-located genes in the total T cells and its subsets, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, from SCPs and MPs were enriched with inflammatory pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway. The motifs of TBX21 were less accessible in the CD4+ T cells of SCPs compared with those in MPs. Furthermore, the scRNA-seq showed that the proportion of T cells, especially the CD4+ T cells, was decreased in SCPs and MPs compared with those in HCs. Transcriptomic results revealed that histone-related genes, and inflammatory genes, such as NFKBIA, S100A9, and PIK3R1, were highly expressed in the total T cells, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, both in the cases of SCPs and MPs. In the CD4+ T cells, decreased T helper-1 (Th1) cells were observed in SCPs and MPs. In the CD8+T cells, activation markers, such as CD69 and HLA class II genes (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DRB5), were significantly upregulated in SCPs. An integrated analysis of the data from scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq showed some consistency between the approaches. Cumulatively, we have generated a landscape of chromatin epigenetic status and transcriptomic immune profiles of T cells in patients with COVID-19. This has provided a deeper dissection of the characteristics of the T cells involved at a higher resolution than from previously obtained data merely by the scRNA-seq analysis. Our data led us to suggest that the T-cell inflammatory states accompanied with defective functions in the CD4+ T cells of SCPs may be the key factors for determining the pathogenesis of and recovery from COVID-19.","output":"Epigenetic Landscapes of Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility and Transcriptomic Immune Profiles of T Cells in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM T lymphocytes play a central role during the pathogenesis of periodontitis, and the imbalance between the pathogenic T-helper type 17 (Th17) and protective T-regulatory (Treg) lymphocytes determines the tooth-supporting alveolar bone resorption.

This study aimed to elucidate whether IL-35 inhibits the alveolar bone resorption during periodontitis by modulating the Th17/Treg imbalance. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice with ligature-induced periodontitis were treated with locally or systemically administrated IL-35. As controls, periodontitis-affected mice without IL-35 treatment and non-ligated mice were used. Alveolar bone resorption was measured by micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. The Th17/Treg-pattern of the immune response was analyzed by qPCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry. RESULTS IL-35 inhibited alveolar bone resorption in periodontitis mice. Besides, IL-35 induced less detection of Th17 lymphocytes and production of Th17-related cytokines, together with higher detection of Treg lymphocytes and production of Treg-related cytokines in periodontitis-affected tissues.

Differences in presentation may lead to misdiagnosis and, in part, explain these disparities. We investigated whether there are sex differences in clinical presentation of acute stroke or transient ischemic attack. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Inclusion criteria were (1) cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, or randomized controlled trial design; (2) admission for (suspicion of) ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack; and (3) comparisons possible between sexes in 1 nonfocal or focal acute stroke symptom(s). A random-effects model was used for our analyses. We performed sensitivity and subanalyses to help explain heterogeneity and used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess bias. RESULTS: We included 60 studies (n=582 844; 50% women). In women, headache (pooled odds ratio [OR], 1.24 [95% CI, 1.11C1.39]; I(2)=75.2%; 30 studies) occurred more frequently than in men with any type of stroke, as well as changes in consciousness/mental status (OR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.19C1.61]; I(2)=95.0%; 17 studies) and coma/stupor (OR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.25C1.55]; I(2)=27.0%; 13 studies). Aspecific or other neurological symptoms (nonrotatory dizziness and non-neurological symptoms) occurred less frequently in women (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.94C0.97]; I(2)=0.1%; 5 studies). Overall, the presence of focal symptoms was not associated with sex (pooled OR, 1.03) although dysarthria (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.04C1.24]; I(2)=48.6%; 11 studies) and vertigo (OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.13C1.34]; I(2)=44.0%; 8 studies) occurred more frequently, whereas symptoms of paresis/hemiparesis (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.54C0.97]; I(2)=72.6%; 7 studies) and focal visual disturbances (OR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70C0.99]; I(2)=62.8%; 16 studies) occurred less frequently in women compared with men with any type of stroke.

To fight against the virus, compulsory maintenance of nutritional status is very important. Age, sex, health status, medications and lifestyles are the important factors affecting individuals regarding their nutritional status. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the nutritional status of individuals is destabilized. To survive the current situation, a sustainable nutritional dietary should be maintained for strengthening the immune system. One of the most important ways to maintain the immune system is to supplement enough vitamin C. A spectrum of viruses that belongs to the coronavirus in humans usually causes the common cold, which is recently severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS considered a major threat to public health, which is an emerging infectious disease. According to WHO, COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus, in which most people probably have low immunity. Eighty-five per cent of the immune system has been made by plant-based food supplements, which increase beneficial intestinal bacteria. Minerals like zinc, magnesium, micronutrients, herbal foods and vitamins C, D and E and plenty of water promote health, which is highly helpful to overcome the infection. Many studies revealed that COVID-19 infection prevented by the powerful antioxidant glutathione and bioflavonoid quercetin;to control COVID-19, plant-based foods playing a very important role to increase the immunity of people. Leafy greens and vegetables play a very important role in food and nutritional safety. Green leafy vegetables are an excellent source of vitamins, phenolic compounds and minerals. Calcium and iron are rich in leafy vegetables than that of staple food grains. Folic acid is also present in leafy vegetables. Different leafy greens, especially Moringa oleifera leaves, contain a high amount of folic acid compared to other leafy and non-leafy vegetable plants. This review paper aims to explore the nutritional and antinutritional factors of some important leafy vegetables. The content of nutritional and antinutritional factors varies among the genera and species of most of the edible leafy vegetables. Antinutritional factors are considered the important compound in the plant, in which they determine the absorption capacity of nutrients in human beings. Important dietary factors such as phytates, oxalates, nitrates, glycosides and cyanogenic are fruitful in many health-related problems. This article mainly explores the significance of nutrition and the use of leafy vegetables to boost up the immunity system in human beings and provide reliable dietary strategies about food safety and nutrition to survive COVID-19 pandemic around the world, especially in India.","output":"Healthcare management through mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic with leafy vegetables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding for pneumonia classification is based on causal organism or use of general pneumonia codes, creating challenges for epidemiological evaluations, where pneumonia is standardly subtyped by settings, exposures and time of emergence. Pneumonia subtype classification requires data available in electronic health records (EHR), frequently in non-structured formats including radiological interpretation or clinical notes that complicate electronic classification. OBJECTIVE: The current study undertook development of a rule-based pneumonia subtyping algorithm for stratifying pneumonia by the setting in which it emerged using information documented in the EHR. METHODS: Pneumonia subtype classification was developed by interrogating patient information within the EHR of a large private Health System. ICD coding was mined in the EHR applying requirements for 'rule of two' pneumonia-related codes or one ICD code and radiologically-confirmed pneumonia validated by natural language processing and/or documented antibiotic prescriptions. A rule-based algorithm flow chart was created to support sub-classification based on features including symptomatic patient point of entry into the healthcare system timing of pneumonia emergence and identification of clinical, laboratory or medication orders that informed definition of the pneumonia sub-classification algorithm. RESULTS: Data from 65,904 study-eligible patients with 91,998 episodes of pneumonia diagnoses documented by 380,509 encounters were analyzed, while 8,611 episodes were excluded following NLP classification of pneumonia status as 'negative' or 'unknown'. Subtyping of 83,387 episodes identified: community acquired (54.5%), hospital-acquired (20%), aspiration-related (10.7%), healthcare-acquired (5%), ventilator-associated (0.4%) cases, and 9.4% were not classifiable by the algorithm. CONCLUSION: Study outcome indicated capacity to achieve electronic pneumonia subtype classification based on interrogation of big data available in the EHR. Examination of portability of the algorithm to achieve rule-based pneumonia classification in other health systems remains to be explored.","output":"Identifying Pneumonia Sub-types from Electronic Health Records Using Rule-based Algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and caffeine are the two primary compounds found in green tea. While EGCG has anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory effects, its acute effects on cognition are not well understood. Furthermore, despite widespread green tea consumption, little is known about how EGCG and caffeine co-administration impacts behavior. Here, we investigated the effects of multiple doses of either EGCG or caffeine on a rat model of risk-taking. This was assessed using the risky decision-making task (RDT), in which rats choose between a small, well-tolerated reward and a large reward with escalating risk of mild footshock. Rats were tested in RDT after acute systemic administration of EGCG, caffeine or joint EGCG and caffeine. EGCG caused a dose-dependent reduction in risk-taking without affecting reward discrimination or task engagement. Caffeine did not impact risk-taking, but elevated locomotor activity and reduced task engagement at high doses. Finally, exposure to both EGCG and caffeine had no effect on risk-taking, suggesting that low-dose caffeine is sufficient to mask the risk-aversion caused by EGCG. These data suggest EGCG as a potential therapeutic treatment for psychological disorders that induce compulsive risky decision-making.","output":"Effects of the psychoactive compounds in green tea on risky decision-making."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The meddling of foreign players into the Indian hotel industry has triggered fervent competitiveness, and therefore, consumers' attitude, intention and behavior have been the epicenter of all activities.

Direct and indirect associations were explored using mediation and moderation. Findings The results manifest that hotel website credibility, perceived website interactivity and perceived ease of use (PEU) aggrandize perceived usefulness (PU), which, in turn, considerably magnifies travelers' OHBI. PEU and PU partially mediate the relationship in the model. Into the bargain, service affordability reinforces the relationship, while perceived pandemic risk enfeebles the relationship between PU and OHBI.

Methods: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data until April 20, 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after April 20, 2020). For the research strategy, combinations of the following keywords and MeSH terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation, maternal, mothers, vertical transmission, maternal-fetal transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, infant, delivery. Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient was pregnant on admission, availability of clinical characteristics, including maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcomes. Exclusion criteria were unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied. Results: We identified several case-reports and case-series but only 19 studies, including a total of 266 pregnant women with COVID-19, met eligibility criteria and were finally included in the review. In the combined data from seven case-series, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 41 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath and fatigue. The rate of severe pneumonia was relatively low, with the majority of the cases requiring intensive care unit admission. Almost all cases from the case-series had positive computer tomography chest findings. There were six and 22 cases that had nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, which were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Only a few cases had spontaneous miscarriage or abortion. 177 cases had delivered, of which the majority by Cesarean section. The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes ranged from 7 to 10 and 8 to 10, respectively. A few neonates had birthweight less than 2500 grams and over one-third of cases were transferred to neonatal intensive care unit. There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death. There were 113 neonates that had nucleic-acid testing in throat swab, which was negative for SARS-CoV-2. From the case-reports, two maternal deaths among pregnant women with COVID-19 were reported. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of nonpregnant adults with COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more prone to develop severe pneumonia, in comparison to nonpregnant patients. The subject of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial and more data is needed to investigate this possibility. Most importantly, in order to collect meaningful pregnancy and perinatal outcome data, we urge researchers and investigators to reference previously published cases in their publications and to record such reporting when the data of a case is being entered into a registry or several registries.","output":"Effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on Maternal, Perinatal and Neonatal Outcomes: a Systematic Review of 266 Pregnancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic requires numerous measures to protect against infection, such as contact reduction and adherence to hygiene and social distancing rules. The former leads to mental disorders (possibly requiring treatment) due to social isolation, the latter require adaptation in the implementation of medical therapies. With overall limited therapy capacities, the use of digital (health) applications can be of particular importance in the therapy of chronic and psychological diseases in particular. The present study investigates which health apps are being used by people with mental health problems. METHODS 1,060 insured persons in preparation for psychosomatic rehabilitation measures were surveyed by means of an online questionnaire. Descriptive analyses, frequency analyses, and analyses of variance with post-hoc tests and correlation analyses were used for evaluation. RESULTS Participants used on average three apps; the most common topics were \\"nutrition\\" (n=313), \\"self-diagnosis\\" (n=244) and \\"relaxation\\" (n=234). Female participants were more likely to use apps than male participants, and younger participants were more likely to use apps than older participants. Symptoms of anxiety were correlated to the use of digital applications, especially concerning heart rate and blood pressure monitoring, while depressive symptoms were not associated with a more frequent use of apps. DISCUSSION Digital apps are being frequently used by people with mental health problems. Increasing acceptance of digital (health) apps has significant potential in the treatment of chronic mental illness in particular. The focus should be on individual applications with integration into the regular care process.

However, even for expert radiologists, it is a challenge to accurately diagnose diseases from CXR samples. Furthermore, there remains an acute shortage of trained radiologists worldwide. In the present study, a range of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and transfer learning (TL) approaches have been evaluated to classify diseases in an openly available CXR image dataset. A combination of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and weighted class balancing is used to alleviate the effects of class imbalance. A hybrid Inception-ResNet-v2 transfer learning model coupled with data augmentation and image enhancement gives the best accuracy. The model is deployed in an edge environment using Amazon IoT Core to automate the task of disease detection in CXR images with three categories, namely pneumonia, COVID-19, and normal. Comparative analysis has been given in various metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, AUC-ROC score, etc. The proposed technique gives an average accuracy of 98.66%.

RESULTS: The total number of responses received was 153. Barring duplicates, 148 were analysed. There was a significant drop in gynaecologic oncology patients attending government hospitals as compared to the non-government sector. The drop was not significantly different in areas having low versus high COVID-19 case volumes. The treatment of endometrial cancers remained the same although there was a marked shift from minimal access surgery to conventional surgery. Advanced ovarian cancer was mostly managed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cervical and vulval cancer management remained the same, but radiotherapy protocols were modified by most. CONCLUSION: Based on clinician responses, it appears that most practices across India have suffered a fall in patient volumes. The responses from government sectors point towards a bigger hit in this segment of practice. While the management of endometrial cancers and cervical cancers was mostly unchanged, most cases of advanced ovarian cancer received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: RCTs will be eligible if they compare patients with COVID-19 randomised to ACEi/ARB continuation or commencement versuss no ACEi/ARB therapy; study duration &#8805;14 days; recruitment completed between March 2020 and May 2021. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at &#8804;30 days. Secondary outcomes will include mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care or cardiovascular events at short-term follow-up (&#8804;30 days) and all-cause mortality at longer-term follow-up (>1 month). Prespecified subgroup analyses will assess the effect of sex; age; comorbidities; smoking status; ethnicity; country of origin on all-cause mortality. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov has been performed, which will be followed by a formal search of trial registers, preprint servers, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify RCTs that meet inclusion criteria. To date, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov identified 21 potentially eligible trials for this meta-analysis. We will request trial investigators/sponsors to contribute standardised grouped tabular outcome data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval and informed consent will be the responsibility of the individual RCTs. Dissemination of results will occur by peer-reviewed publication. The results of our analysis can inform public health policy and clinical decision making regarding ACEi/ARB use in patients with COVID-19 on a global scale.","output":"Prospective meta-analysis protocol on randomised trials of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients with COVID-19: an initiative of the International Society of Hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are natural reservoirs of the largest proportion of viral zoonoses among mammals, thus understanding the conditions for pathogen persistence in bats is essential to reduce human risk. Focusing on the European Bat Lyssavirus subtype 1 (EBLV-1), causing rabies disease, we develop a data-driven spatially explicit metapopulation model to investigate EBLV-1 persistence in Myotis myotis and Miniopterus schreibersii bat species in Catalonia. We find that persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of M. schreibersii, on cross-species mixing with M. myotis, and on survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity. The virus would not persist in the single colony of M. myotis. Our study provides for the first time epidemiological estimates for EBLV-1 progression in M. schreibersii. Our approach can be readily adapted to other zoonoses of public health concern where long-range migration and habitat sharing may play an important role.","output":"Mechanisms for lyssavirus persistence in non-synanthropic bats in Europe: insights from a modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current situation of COVID-19 highlights the paramount importance of infectious disease surveillance, which necessitates early monitoring for effective response. Policymakers are interested in data insights identifying high-risk areas as well as individuals to be quarantined, especially as the public gets back to their normal routine. We investigate both requirements by the implementation of disease outbreak modeling and exploring its induced dynamic spatial risk in form of risk assessment, along with its real-time integration back into the disease model. This paper implements a contact tracing-based stochastic compartment model as a baseline, to further modify the existing setup to include the spatial risk. This modification of each individual-level contacts intensity to be dependent on its spatial location has been termed as Contextual Contact Tracing. The results highlight that the inclusion of spatial context tends to send more individuals into quarantine which reduces the overall spread of infection. With a simulated example of an induced spatial high-risk, it is highlighted that the new spatio-SIR model can act as a tool to empower the analyst with a capability to explore disease dynamics from a spatial perspective. We conclude that the proposed spatio-SIR tool can be of great help for policymakers to know the consequences of their decision prior to their implementation.","output":"Contextual contact tracing based on stochastic compartment modeling and spatial risk assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first detection of a cluster of COVID-19 patients in China in late 2019, it becomes a global concern due to its transmissibility and ability to progress patients in severe respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which need intensive care unit support for a long time We observed the repurposing use of remdesivir and favipiravir whether considered as a therapeutic option or not through survival rate and changes in biomarker during 10-day treatment stay in ICU The retrospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital dedicated to COVID-19 at Dhaka, Bangladesh was done at the peak of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh The mortality rate, length of ICU stays and eight prognostic biomarkers of patients treated with remdesivir and favipiravir was observed as one of the first ever reported experience in Bangladesh Among the critically ill patients in ICU, 26 (44 8%) died and 32 (55 2%) were cured during the study period and highest mean duration of stay in ICU was observed (14 33 days and 18 13 days) in FPV-treated patients Mean of means for all biomarkers CRP (26 0) and d-Dimer (2 64) was recorded higher in favipiravir treated patients in death cases, but NLR, d-NLR, platelet, PLR was much higher in remdesivir treated patient of both death and improved cases Though overall outcome variables between death and improved cases were not statistically significant (p&lt;0 39) The severity of disease progression in critically ill COVID-19 patients in ICU depends on comorbidities and hyper-responsive inflammatory or immunological biomarkers to predict Though the emergency use authorization and repurposing use of different antivirals are still on trial, but remdesivir and favipiravir revealed not much hope in improving prognostic biomarkers, survival rate and disease progression at the peak of pandemic in Bangladesh","output":"Survival and Biomarkers of COVID-19 Patients Treated with Remdesivir and Favipiravir in ICU during the Peak of Pandemic: A Single Center Study in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are highly prescribed as medications for COVID-19 infection, although no robust or convincing data has yet been published about their efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, risk and benefit assessment is necessary for deciding to prescribe these drugs in COVID-19 patients in hospital settings. We systematically searched from the MEDLINE Database, investigating the benefits and risks of HCQ and CQ among COVID-19 patients. All records were searched using the search terms Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine, COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2. The selection criteria include all clinical trials and observational studies. We found 11 records on benefits and 7 records on risks of HCQ and CQ in COVID-19 patients after following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Clinical trial and observational studies have shown that HCQ is very limited, particularly in reducing mortality or proving clinical improvement. Similarly, seven observational studies have estimated the cardiac event in the use of HCQ or CQ in COVID-19. Even though there was no increase in death, these studies reported an increased risk of prolonging QT-interval in high proportion and other cardiac events such as arrhythmia, torsade de pointes, and conduction block. We conclude that the beneficial effect of HCQ and CQ in COVID-19 remains very limited.

However, data on curfew-related efficacy to control the epidemic are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects on COVID-19 spread in France of curfew combined to local and/or nationwide restrictions from late summer 2020 to mid-February 2021. DESIGN: We conducted a comparative evaluation using a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-based model completed with epidemiokinetic tools. MAIN MEASURES: We analyzed the time-course of epidemic progression rate under curfew in French Guyana and five metropolitan regions where additional restrictions were implemented at different times. Using linear regressions of the decay/increase rates in daily contaminations, we calculated the epidemic regression half-lives (t1/2?) for each identified period. KEY RESULTS: In French Guyana, two decay periods with rapid regression (t1/2? of ~10 days) were observed under curfew, with slowing (t1/2? of ~43 days) when curfew was lightened. During the 2-week pre-lockdown curfew (2020/10/17-2020/11/02) in Provence-Alpes-C?te-d'Azur, Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes, and Ile-de-France, the epidemic progression was unchanged. During the post-lockdown curfew (2020/12/15-2020/02/14), the epidemic slowly regressed in Grand-Est (t1/2? of ~37 days), whereas its progression rate plateaued in Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes and increased immediately in Provence-Alpes-C?te-d'Azur, Ile-de-France, and Nouvelle-Aquitaine, whatever the curfew starting time was (06:00 or 08:00 pm). Interestingly, a delayed slow decay (17 days < t1/2? < 64 days) occurred under curfew in all regions except Ile-de-France. CONCLUSIONS: Curfew allowed the temporary control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, however variably in the French regions, without preventing lockdown necessity. To accelerate the epidemic regression such as observed in French Guyana, curfew should be implemented timely with additional restrictions.","output":"Is Curfew Effective in Limiting SARS-CoV-2 Progression?

Schools were closed, and examinations were postponed indefinitely. Students of private schools were able to resume academic activities online. However, most public schools could not do so, due to lack of infrastructure. This study aimed to qualitatively investigate the impacts of the novel coronavirus on final-year students of social work, at the University of Nigeria. Data was collected from 20 undergraduates using in-depth interviews. Findings showed that the pandemic had negative effects on different aspects of the students lives. It was also revealed that some of the students were resilient and were able to use various coping strategies to avoid being overwhelmed by the situation. A policy implication of this study is the need for revitalization of Nigerian public universities, as the continued lockdown of schools shows how public universities are poorly managed in the country. This poor management of public schools has made it impossible for a switch to virtual learning.

Because of variable evolution ranging from asymptomatic cases to the need for invasive ventilation, COVID-19 outcomes cannot be precisely predicted on admission. The aim of this study was to provide a simple tool able to predict the outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia on admission to a low-intensity ward in order to better plan management strategies for these patients. Methods The clinical records of 123 eligible patients were reviewed. The following variables were analyzed on admission: chest computed tomography severity score (CTSS), PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin. The main outcome was the intensity of respiratory support (RS). To simplify the statistical analysis, patients were split into two main groups: those requiring no or low/moderate oxygen support (group 1); and those needing subintensive/intensive RS up to mechanical ventilation (group 2). Results The RS intensity was significantly associated with higher CTSS and NLR scores; lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios; and higher serum levels of LDH, CRP, D-dimer, and AST. After multivariate logistic regression and ROC curve analysis, CTSS and LDH were shown to be the best predictors of respiratory function worsening. Conclusions Two easy-to-obtain parameters (CTSS and LDH) were able to reliably predict a worse evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia with values of >7 and >328 U/L, respectively.","output":"Prediction of SARS-CoV-2-Related Lung Inflammation Spreading by V:ERITAS (Vanvitelli Early Recognition of Inflamed Thoracic Areas Spreading)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is associated with hematological abnormalities of variable severity.

Therefore, the main intent of this study was to estimate the prevalence of trauma among young adults exposed to violent and stressful events of armed conflict. Method: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on the prevalence of trauma in all the 10 districts of Kashmir Valley using multistage sampling technique. Data were collected from 693 students by means of the Demographic Information Questionnaire and Kashmir Conflict Exposure Checklist (KCEC). Results: Findings revealed that one third of the respondents were exposed to high traumatic exposure (33.3%), close to quarter of the participants reported extremely high traumatic exposure (23.7%), over one third of the respondents were exposed to moderate traumatic exposure (33.5%), and about one tenth of the sample were exposed to low traumatic exposure (9.5%) in the context of the Kashmir conflict. The prevalence of trauma was 100% in both males and females. The traumatic events with highest rate of prevalence were \\"feeling stressed\\" (97.3%), followed by \\"fear of search operations, crackdowns or curfews\\" (89.2%); \\"witnessing a protest or being part of it\\" (88.3%); \\"a family member, relative or friend being hit with a bullet, pellet, or any other explosive\\" (76.5%); and \\"exposure to violent media portrayals\\" (74.3%). Thirteen of 17 traumatic events were significantly associated with gender wherein males reported significantly higher prevalence in all of these events than females, except one. Conclusions: The findings of the current study revealed a very disturbing picture regarding the prevalence of traumatic experience of Kashmiri young adults and recommends that educational institutions and nongovernment organizations in Kashmir should pay attention toward guiding the young adults of Kashmir in the right direction for their growth, safety, and welfare, in addition to providing mental health support services, to enhance psychological competence, prevent the development of psychiatric disorders, and utilize the potentials of youth for nation building.

Next-generation DES now utilizes lower profiles, thinner struts, and other technological advances to help extend their safety and efficacy. Importantly, studies of next-generation devices have now gone beyond controlled clinical trials with selected populations to registries and studies with all-comer populations, where more diverse and complex sets of patients and lesions have been managed. Thus, a large body of evidence and comparative data about the safety and efficacy of these devices has accumulated. The Resolute? zotarolimus-eluting stent (R-ZES; Medtronic Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA) is a next-generation DES that uses a novel biocompatible polymer on a cobalt alloy stent platform to extend the duration of drug elution and improve the stent's efficacy. The Integrity? platform (Medtronic, Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA) used in the most recent iteration of the R-ZES stent further enhances the flexibility and deliverability of the stent in complex lesions by incorporation of a continuous sinusoidal design.

Whether this delay contributes to meaningful short-term outcome differences in these patients warranted further exploration. METHODS: We conducted a nested observational cohort study of adult acute ischemic stroke patients receiving IVT from 9 comprehensive stroke centers across 7 U.S states. Patients admitted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (1/1/2019C02/29/2020) were compared to patients admitted during the early pandemic (3/1/2020C7/31/2020). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of IVT delay on discharge to hospice or death, with treatment delay on admission during COVID-19 included as an interaction term. RESULTS: Of the 676 thrombolysed patients, the median age was 70 (IQR 58C81) years, 313 were female (46.3%), and the median NIHSS was 8 (IQR 4C16). Longer treatment delays were observed during COVID-19 (median 46 vs 38 min, p = 0.01) and were associated with higher in-hospital death/hospice discharge irrespective of admission period (OR per hour 1.08, 95% CI 1.01C1.17, p = 0.03). This effect was strengthened after multivariable adjustment (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07C1.24, p < 0.001). There was no interaction of treatment delay on admission during COVID-19 (p(interaction) = 0.65). Every one-hour delay in IVT was also associated with 7% lower odds of being discharged to home or acute inpatient rehabilitation facility (aOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89C0.97, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Treatment delays observed during the COVID-19 pandemic led to greater early mortality and hospice care, with a lower probability of discharge to home/rehabilitation facility. There was no effect modification of treatment delay on admission during the pandemic, indicating that treatment delay at any time contributes similarly to these short-term outcomes.","output":"Delays in thrombolysis during COVID-19 are associated with worse neurological outcomes: the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology Multicenter Collaboration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article interrogates the politics of the COVID-19 pandemic from a postcolonial perspective.

Stanfords cue-centered therapy (CCT) was designed to address this gap by offering a flexible, integrative, and insight-oriented treatment approach that is grounded in principles of neuroscience, developmental trauma, client empowerment, and allostasis. This article reviews the CCT rationale, treatment components, evidence base, and training approach. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies demonstrate promising outcomes indicating CCT effectiveness in reducing child and caregiver posttraumatic stress, and in improving child functioning. Further research, however, is needed to identify which clients are best-suited for CCT (versus other available child trauma treatments) and to identify which components of CCT are most critical for addressing complex developmental trauma. SUMMARY: CCT advances the field of child trauma treatment by offering an intervention approach focused on addressing complex developmental trauma. Positive treatment and training outcomes indicate utility of CCT for clients and clinicians. Innovations in research and training approaches are needed to further dissemination and implementation of CCT and other related child trauma interventions for complex developmental trauma.","output":"Cue-Centered Therapy for Youth Experiencing Posttraumatic Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a commonly occurring endocrine disorder characterized by hirsutism, anovulation, and polycystic ovaries. Often comorbid with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and obesity, it also carries significant risk for the development of cardiovascular and metabolic sequelae, including diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The relationship between central obesity and the development of insulin resistance is widely verified. Adipose tissue excess and the coexistent dysregulation of adipocyte functions directly contribute to the pathogenesis of the metabolic complications observed in women with PCOS. In the light of these evidence, the most therapeutic option prescribed to obese women with PCOS, regardless of the phenotype e from the severity of clinical expression, is lifestyle correction by diet and physical activity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the beneficial effects of ketogenic diet in 17 obese women with PCOS. Our results showed that the ketogenic diet inducing therapeutic ketosis, improves the anthropometric and many biochemical parameters such as LH, FSH, SHBG, insulin sensitivity and HOMA index. In addition, it induces a reduction in androgenic production, whereas the contextual reduction of fat mass reduced the acyclic production of estrogens deriving from the aromatization in the adipose tissue of the androgenic excess, with an improvement of the LH/FSH ratio. This is the first study on the effects of the ketogenic diet on PCOS, however, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism underlying ketogenic diet effects.","output":"Effects of Mixed of a Ketogenic Diet in Overweight and Obese Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Estimation of the epidemiology curve for the COVID-19 pandemic can be a very computationally challenging task. Thus far, there have been some implementations of artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to develop epidemiology curve for a specific country. However, most applied AI methods generated models that are almost impossible to translate into a mathematical equation. In this paper, the AI method called genetic programming (GP) algorithm is utilized to develop a symbolic expression (mathematical equation) which can be used for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. with high accuracy. The GP algorithm is utilized on the publicly available dataset that contains the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for each U.S. state to obtain the symbolic expression for the estimation of the number of the aforementioned patient groups. The dataset consists of the latitude and longitude of the central location for each state and the number of patients in each of the goal groups for each day in the period of 22 January 2020C3 December 2020. The obtained symbolic expressions for each state are summed up to obtain symbolic expressions for estimation of each of the patient groups (confirmed, deceased and recovered). These symbolic expressions are combined to obtain the symbolic expression for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. The obtained symbolic expressions for the estimation of the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for each state achieved [Formula: see text] score in the ranges 0.9406C0.9992, 0.9404C0.9998 and 0.9797C0.99955, respectively.

Using these symbolic expressions, the equation for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. is formulated which achieved [Formula: see text] score of 0.9933. Investigation showed that GP algorithm can produce symbolic expressions for the estimation of the number of confirmed, recovered and deceased patients as well as the epidemiology curve not only for the states but for the entire U.S. with very high accuracy.","output":"Estimation of COVID-19 Epidemiology Curve of the United States Using Genetic Programming Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of Coronavirus disease 19 is not abating since the outbreak began in December 2019 Africa is currently experiencing a surge after an initial low incidence and nosocomial infections could be contributing to this A dominant factor responsible for this is a weak healthcare system because of many years of neglect due to abysmal budgetary allocation to the sector The testing capacity for COVID-19 diagnosis in Africa is grossly inadequate coupled with a severe shortage of personal protective equipment and inadequate infectious diseases expert These factors exposed the frontline health workers and patients to the hazard of nosocomial infection with the attendants' morbidity and mortality Deliberate efforts need to be made toward reducing nosocomial COVID-19 infection","output":"A critical appraisal of COVID-19 as a nosocomial infection: an African perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practice of teledentistry during COVID-19 among dentists in Southern Saudi Arabia.

Additionally, hierarchical regressions were performed to investigate predictors of parental stress and child externalizing behaviors during the lockdown. Results showed that parental stress (especially in mothers) and child externalizing behaviors increased during the lockdown period. Coparenting was a strong predictor of parental stress, together with being a mother, younger child age, less time dedicated to the child, and scarce feasibility of remote working. Besides, child externalizing behaviors were predicted by male gender, less parental time dedicated to the child, higher parental stress, and child distance learning workload.

Bed occupancy rates often surpass the good hospital bed management threshold of 85%, which can result in poor conditions in the workplace. This study explores how QoC-scores could be improved by investing in additional beds and/or better vaccination programs against vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. METHODS: The CobbCDouglas model was selected to define the improvement in QoC (%) as a function of two strategies (rotavirus vaccination coverage [%] and addition of extra hospital beds [% of existing beds]), allowing improvement-isocurves to be produced. Subsequently, budget minimization was applied to determine the combination of the two strategies needed to reach a given QoC improvement at the lowest cost. Data from Jessa Hospital (Hasselt, Belgium) were chosen as an example. The annual population in the catchment area to be vaccinated was 7000 children; the winter period was 90 days with 34 pediatric beds available. Rotavirus vaccination cost per course was 118.26 and the daily cost of a pediatric bed was 436.53. The target QoC increase was fixed at 50%. The model was first built with baseline parameter values. RESULTS: The model predicted that a combination of 64% vaccine coverage and 39% extra hospital beds ( 13 extra beds) in winter would improve QoC-scores by 50% for the minimum budget allocation.

Because closures are costly and damaging, many jurisdictions have since reopened schools with control measures in place. Early evidence indicated that schools were low risk and children were unlikely to be very infectious, but it is becoming clear that children and youth can acquire and transmit COVID-19 in school settings and that transmission clusters and outbreaks can be large. We describe the contrasting literature on school transmission, and argue that the apparent discrepancy can be reconciled by heterogeneity, or overdispersion in transmission, with many exposures yielding little to no risk of onward transmission, but some unfortunate exposures causing sizeable onward transmission. In addition, respiratory viral loads are as high in children and youth as in adults, pre- and asymptomatic transmission occur, and the possibility of aerosol transmission has been established. We use a stochastic individual-based model to find the implications of these combined observations for cluster sizes and control measures. We consider both individual and environment/activity contributions to the transmission rate, as both are known to contribute to variability in transmission. We find that even small heterogeneities in these contributions result in highly variable transmission cluster sizes in the classroom setting, with clusters ranging from 1 to 20 individuals in a class of 25. None of the mitigation protocols we modeled, initiated by a positive test in a symptomatic individual, are able to prevent large transmission clusters unless the transmission rate is low (in which case large clusters do not occur in any case). Among the measures we modeled, only rapid universal monitoring (for example by regular, onsite, pooled testing) accomplished this prevention.

We also used Phage-DMS to determine antibody escape pathways within each epitope, enabling a granular comparison of antibody binding specificities at the locus level. Overall, we identified some common epitope targets in both macaques and humans, including in the fusion peptide (FP) and stem helix-heptad repeat 2 (SH-H) regions. Differences between groups included a response to epitopes in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) in vaccinated humans but not vaccinated macaques, as well as recognition of a CTD epitope and epitopes flanking the FP in convalescent macaques but not convalescent humans. There was also considerable variability in the escape pathways among individuals within each group. Sera from convalescent macaques showed the least variability in escape overall and converged on a common response with vaccinated humans in the SH-H epitope region, suggesting highly similar antibodies were elicited.

It also helped bolster a parallel tradition of teaching symbolism and syntax in artificial language systems to great apes.

Now 40-years on, the original vervet alarm call findings have been revised and claims of semanticity recanted; while other evidence for semantics and syntax in the natural communications of non-humans is sparse and weak.

Moreover, the share of energy derived from renewable and low-carbon sources (nuclear, hydro-energy, wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) exceeded that from coal and oil for the first time in history in May of 2020. The decrease in global net energy demand (-1.3% in the first half of 2020 relative to the average of the period in 2016-2019) masks a large down-regulation of fossil-fuel-burning power plants supply (-6.1%) coincident with a surge of low-carbon sources (+6.2%). Concomitant changes in the diurnal cycle of electricity demand also favored low-carbon generators, including a flattening of the morning ramp, a lower midday peak, and delays in both the morning and midday load peaks in most countries. However, emission intensities in the power sector have since rebounded in many countries, and a key question for climate mitigation is thus to what extent countries can achieve and maintain lower, pandemic-level carbon intensities of electricity as part of a green recovery.","output":"De-carbonization of global energy use during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the global coronavirus pandemic Iceland is facing the largest economic crisis for half a century. But after the pandemic is over, the economy is expected to quickly recover and continue its further growth. In this article, the author intends to explore how well these expectations are justified and which industry sectors could contribute to Iceland's economic growth. The analysis shows that the country's current key export sectors (tourism, seafood production and aluminum industry) have a limited growth potential, mainly related to the ongoing development of aquaculture. The paper also considers key economic projects, linked to utilization of Iceland's resource and innovative potential. The abundance of cheap renewable energy enables the country to develop new energy-intensive projects (silicon smelters and data centers), as well as to consider the possibility to directly transmit electricity to the UK (project IceLink). These initiatives could significantly contribute to the future economic growth, although the Icelandic energy industry is not limitless. However, the biggest economic growth is expected in innovative industry sectors. A number of projects in bioengineering, biomedicine, pharmacology, and high-tech equipment production have been started in Iceland. In the long-term perspective, their potential profits could exceed the ones of the resource sector of the country's economy. ? 2021 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

We summarize the current techniques for lung volume assessment selected according to their possible usage in the ICU and discuss the recent findings obtained with implementation of these techniques in patients with ARDS. RECENT FINDINGS Computed tomography technique remains irreplaceable in terms of quantitative aeration of different lung regions, but the commonly used cut-offs for classification may be questioned with recent findings on nonpathological lungs. Monitoring end expiratory lung volume using nitrogen washout technique enhanced our understanding on lung volume change during positioning, pleural effusion drainage, intra-abdominal hypertension, and recruitment maneuver. Recent studies supported that tidal volume could not surrogate tidal strain, which needs measurement of functional residual capacity and which is correlated with pro-inflammatory lung response. SUMMARY Although lung volume measurements are still limited to research area of ARDS, recent progress in technology provides clinicians more opportunities to evaluate lung volumes noninvasively at the bedside and may facilitate individualization of ventilator settings based on the specific physiological understandings of a given patient.","output":"Lung volume assessment in acute respiratory distress syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Italian legal system has always struggled when confronted with the task of ensuring the compliance with the EU principles of competition and freedom of establishment, as well as the balancing of those principles with the protection of legal certainty and the investments made by private actors in crucial sectors. A stark example of this issue is given by the legal framework for the granting of concessions of State-owned maritime property used for touristic and recreational purposes, which has been for several years at the center of a heated debate. The topic was the subject of several landmark judgements from the Court of Justice of the European Union, which stigmatized the long-standing national habit of automatic extending existing concessions of State-owned property for tourist activities having cross-border interest. Notwithstanding those judgements, provisions of such nature have still been put in place both at regional and national level, such as with the Regional law no. 26/2017 of the Regione Liguria that was declared to be unconstitutional by the Italian Constitutional Court with its first judgement of 2019, which this article aims at describing. In this context, where what appears to be an overwhelming convergence of national and European courts has urged the national legislator to adopt a comprehensive regulation on the matter, the emergency rules adopted by the Italian Government in connection to the Covid-19 pandemic present obvious shortcomings, in that they once again consolidate the status quo by postponing the establishment of a competitive environment, to the final detriment of environmental protection, social cohesion and the optimization of State resources. ? 2020 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

This increased risk has been linked to distinct polymorphisms in both ERAPs and MHC class I receptors that affect the way cell-generated peptides are screened for antigenicity. The incidence of cancer, infectious disease and autoimmune disorders differ greatly among pure breeds of dogs as it does in humans and it is possible that this heightened susceptibility is also due to specific polymorphisms in ERAP1 and ERAP2. In order to determine if such polymorphisms exist, the ERAP1 and ERAP2 genes of 10 dogs of nine diverse breeds were sequenced and SNPs causing synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid changes, deletions or insertions were identified. Eight ERAP1 and 10 ERAP2 SNPs were used to create a Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX based test panel which defined 24 ERAP1, 36 ERAP2 and 128 ERAP1/2 haplotypes. The prevalence of these haplotypes was then measured among dog, wolf, coyote, jackal and red fox populations. Some haplotypes were species specific, while others were shared across species, especially between dog, wolf, coyote and jackal. The prevalence of these haplotypes was then compared among various canid populations, and in particular between various populations of random- and pure-bred dogs. Human-directed positive selection has led to loss of ERAP diversity and segregation of certain haplotypes among various dog breeds. A phylogenetic tree generated from 45 of the most common ERAP1/2 haplotypes demonstrated three distinct clades, all of which were rooted with haplotypes either shared among species or specific to contemporary dogs, coyote and wolf.","output":"Polymorphisms in ERAP1 and ERAP2 are shared by Caninae and segregate within and between random- and pure-breeds of dogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty in all areas of life, including supply chains (SCs).

We collected three-wave data from remote workers (n = 329 observations) and tested our hypotheses using multilevel analyses. Results differed by level of analysis. Specifically, at the between level, comparing behaviors between participants, social expansion mediated the relationship between self-goal setting and task significance. In contrast, at the within level (analyzing differences in behavior within the same person), social expansion mediated the relationship between self-goal setting and work engagement. Overall, these findings suggest that self-leadership allows higher availability of resources enabling the proactive initiation of social interactions, which, at the within level enhance work engagement, and at the between level improve task significance during remote work.

METHODS: Participants of a 1-year open-label phase 1b study of IT delivered rituximab to patients with PMS were offered extended treatment with follow-up for an additional 2 years. During the extension phase, treatment with 25 mg rituximab was administered every 6 months via a subcutaneous Ommaya reservoir connected to the right frontal horn with a ventricular catheter. RESULTS: Mild to moderate vertigo and nausea occurred in 4 out of 14 participants as temporary adverse events associated with IT rituximab infusion. During the entire 3-year period, two cases of low-virulent bacterial meningitis occurred, which were successfully treated. Walking speed deteriorated significantly during the study.

The study targeted medical doctors, dentists, medical students, and dental students from the GCC region. Participants were at least 18 years old, voluntarily consented to complete the questionnaire, and were assured that their responses would remain anonymous. Permission was obtained using a previously validated and applied questionnaire to assess their level of awareness and knowledge regarding COVID-19. To compare the proportional responses between groups in descriptive statistics, a proportion Z-test was used to find any significant differences, with a statistical significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 1621 participants responded to our questionnaire. Almost two-thirds of the respondents were female (64.4%), and the majority were less than 25 years old (67.2%). Dentists accounted for 12.6% of the total population, and their clinical experience ranged from 0.25 to 52 years (median: 3 years, IQR: 1C10 years).

However, prior research has found that the degree to which EF fluctuates was more predictive of self-reported cognitive and IADL lapses than was average EF performance. One source of such EF fluctuations is engagement in an emotion regulation strategy known as expressive suppression (ES). Importantly, ES has also been shown to relate to IADL performance, presumably due to its impact on EF. However, past research is limited due to assessing IADLs only in the laboratory or via self-report. The present study examined (a) the association of daily EF and ES fluctuations with performance of actual IADL tasks in participants' homes, and (b) whether any significant association between ES fluctuations and daily IADLs would be mediated by daily EF variability. METHOD Participants were 52 older adults aged 60 to 95. Over the course of 18 days while at home, participants completed daily IADL tasks as well as daily measures of EF and ES via ecological momentary assessment. RESULTS Contrary to our hypothesis, average EF across days predicted at-home IADLs above and beyond daily EF variability, which itself was also predictive. ES variability also predicted daily IADLs, and this association was fully mediated by average daily EF. CONCLUSIONS Daily fluctuations in ES appear to have a deleterious impact on performance of IADLs at home, likely due to the impact of such fluctuations on EF, although the average level of EF capacity is also important.","output":"Daily Assessment of Executive Functioning and Expressive Suppression Predict Daily Functioning among Community-Dwelling Older Adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently overwhelmed with the perils of the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world economy are more grievous than many natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis in history.

Most of the modeling and predictions were based on compartmental epidemiologic models and a few used advanced machine learning techniques. While some models have accurately predicted the end of the epidemic in some countries, other predictions strongly deviate from reality. Interestingly, some studies showed that combining artificial intelligence with classical compartmental models provides a better prediction of the disease spread. Assumptions made when parameterizing the models might be wrong and might not suit the local contexts and might partly explain the observed deviation from the reality on the ground.

This study aimed to evaluate TMS to functionally assess target engagement in a study of perampanel in ALS. METHOD: We studied the MT of ALS patients randomized to a single dose of perampanel or placebo 5:1 hourly for 4 h. Twelve patients participated at 4 mg and 7 returned for dosing and retesting at 8 mg.

METHODS Serum samples from 251 dogs of varying age, breed and clinical histories were tested for the presence of antibodies to CRCoV and CIV, using indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) analysis. The population sampled represented a wide geographic area but principally encompassed the central and lower North Island of New Zealand. RESULTS Seventy-three of the 251 samples (29%) were seropositive for CRCoV. Dogs <2 years old were less likely to be seropositive for CRCoV than older dogs. None was seropositive for CIV. CONCLUSIONS This study revealed the presence of antibodies to CRCoV in dogs in New Zealand. Young dogs are less likely to be seropositive than older dogs, probably due to increased opportunity for exposure to CRCoV over time. Serum antibodies to CIV were not detected in any of the dogs sampled, suggesting that this virus is unlikely to be present in dogs in New Zealand.

In the United States, COVID-19 cases and deaths have markedly declined since their peak in early January 2021, due in part to increased vaccination coverage (1). However, during June 19-July 23, 2021, COVID-19 cases increased approximately 300% nationally, followed by increases in hospitalizations and deaths, driven by the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant* of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Available data indicate that the vaccines authorized in the United States (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) offer high levels of protection against severe illness and death from infection with the Delta variant and other currently circulating variants of the virus (2). Despite widespread availability, vaccine uptake has slowed nationally with wide variation in coverage by state (range = 33.9%-67.2%) and by county (range = 8.8%-89.0%).? Unvaccinated persons, as well as persons with certain immunocompromising conditions (3), remain at substantial risk for infection, severe illness, and death, especially in areas where the level of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission is high. The Delta variant is more than two times as transmissible as the original strains circulating at the start of the pandemic and is causing large, rapid increases in infections, which could compromise the capacity of some local and regional health care systems to provide medical care for the communities they serve. Until vaccination coverage is high and community transmission is low, public health practitioners, as well as schools, businesses, and institutions (organizations) need to regularly assess the need for prevention strategies to avoid stressing health care capacity and imperiling adequate care for both COVID-19 and other non-COVID-19 conditions. CDC recommends five critical factors be considered to inform local decision-making: 1) level of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission; 2) health system capacity; 3) COVID-19 vaccination coverage; 4) capacity for early detection of increases in COVID-19 cases; and 5) populations at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. Among strategies to prevent COVID-19, CDC recommends all unvaccinated persons wear masks in public indoor settings. Based on emerging evidence on the Delta variant (2), CDC also recommends that fully vaccinated persons wear masks in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission. Fully vaccinated persons might consider wearing a mask in public indoor settings, regardless of transmission level, if they or someone in their household is immunocompromised or is at increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in their household is unvaccinated (including children aged <12 years who are currently ineligible for vaccination).","output":"Guidance for Implementing COVID-19 Prevention Strategies in the Context of Varying Community Transmission Levels and Vaccination Coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Last week, Congress passed its fourth (actually, it was 3.5) stimulus coronavirus relief bill.

We take into account of attention mechanism for virus locating and classification from digital images. In order to generate the most reliable estimate of bounding boxes and classification for a virus as visual object, we train and test five deep learning models: R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and SSD, based on our dataset of virus electron microscopy. Additionally, we explicate the evaluation approaches. The conclusion reveals SSD and Faster R-CNN outperform in the virus identification.","output":"Deep Learning Methods for Virus Identification from Digital Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lungs are vulnerable to toxins because of their large surface area and act as a metabolic site for some substances. Drugs may induce specific respiratory reactions, or the lungs may be affected as part of a generalized response. Drug-induced lung injury (DLI) can involve the airways, lung parenchyma, mediastinum, pleura, pulmonary vasculature, and/or the neuromuscular system. The most common form of DLI is drug-induced interstitial lung disease. There are no disease types specific to DLI, and DLIs are diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings, chest CT images, and histopathologic findings. The first principle of management of DLI is early detection and cessation of treatment with the suspected drug. Response to corticosteroid therapy depends on the histopathologic pattern of drug-induced interstitial lung disease. Prognosis depends on the specific drug and underlying clinical, physiologic, and pathologic severity of lung disease. To minimize DLI morbidity and mortality, all health-care providers should be familiar with the possible adverse effects of medications they prescribe. Individual variability in drug response is an important concern in clinical practice and drug development. Such variability is multifactorial and includes extrinsic factors such as environmental features and genetic and intrinsic factors that affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs.","output":"Therapeutic Strategies for DLI: How Should DLI Be Treated?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School nurses are advocates, caregivers, and teachers.

In the leadup to widespread vaccine deployment, testing and surveillance are critical for detecting and stopping possible routes of transmission. Contact tracing has become an important surveillance measure to control COVID-19 in the United States, and mobile health interventions have found increased prominence in this space. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the use and usability of MyCOVIDKey, a mobile-based web app to assist COVID-19 contact tracing efforts, during the 6-week pilot period. METHODS: A 6-week study was conducted on the Vanderbilt University campus in Nashville, Tennessee. The study participants, consisting primarily of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty in the Chemistry Department at Vanderbilt University, were asked to use the MyCOVIDKey web app during the course of the study period. Paradata were collected as users engaged with the MyCOVIDKey web app. At the end of the study, all participants were asked to report on their user experience in a survey, and the results were analyzed in the context of the user paradata. RESULTS: During the pilot period, 45 users enrolled in MyCOVIDKey. An analysis of their enrollment suggests that initial recruiting efforts were effective; however, participant recruitment and engagement efforts at the midpoint of the study were less effective. App use paralleled the number of users, indicating that incentives were useful for recruiting new users to sign up but did not result in users attempting to artificially inflate their use as a result of prize offers. Times to completion of key tasks were low, indicating that the main features of the app could be used quickly. Of the 45 users, 30 provided feedback through a postpilot survey, with 26 (58%) completing it in its entirety. The MyCOVIDKey app as a whole was rated 70.0 on the System Usability Scale, indicating that it performed above the accepted threshold for usability. When the key-in and self-assessment features were examined on their own, it was found that they individually crossed the same thresholds for acceptable usability but that the key-in feature had a higher margin for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The MyCOVIDKey app was found overall to be a useful tool for COVID-19 contact tracing in a university setting. Most users suggested simple-to-implement improvements, such as replacing the web app framework with a native app format or changing the placement of the scanner within the app workflow. After these updates, this tool could be readily deployed and easily adapted to other settings across the country. The need for digital contact tracing tools is becoming increasingly apparent, particularly as COVID-19 case numbers continue to increase while more businesses begin to reopen.","output":"App Use and Usability of a Barcode-Based Digital Platform to Augment COVID-19 Contact Tracing: Postpilot Survey and Paradata Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ground-glass opacity is a CT sign that is currently experiencing renewed interest since it is very common in patients with COVID-19.

Recently introduced mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have demonstrated extraordinary efficacy across all ages. Immunosuppressed patients were excluded from phase III trials with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. AIMS: To fully characterise B-cell and T-cell immune responses elicited by mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with rheumatic diseases under immunotherapies, and to identify which drugs reduce vaccines immunogenicity. METHODS: Humoral, CD4 and CD8 immune responses were investigated in 100 na?ve patients with SARS-CoV-2 with selected rheumatic diseases under immunosuppression after a two-dose regimen of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Responses were compared with age, gender and disease-matched patients with IMRD not receiving immunosuppressors and with healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients with IMRD showed decreased seroconversion rates (80% vs 100%, p=0.03) and cellular immune responses (75% vs 100%, p=0.02). Patients on methotrexate achieved seroconversion in 62% of cases and cellular responses in 80% of cases. Abatacept decreased humoral and cellular responses. Rituximab (31% responders) and belimumab (50% responders) showed impaired humoral responses, but cellular responses were often preserved. Antibody titres were reduced with mycophenolate and azathioprine but preserved with leflunomide and anticytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IMRD exhibit impaired SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity, variably reduced with immunosuppressors. Among commonly used therapies, abatacept and B-cell depleting therapies show deleterious effects, while anticytokines preserved immunogenicity. The effects of cumulative methotrexate and glucocorticoid doses on immunogenicity should be considered. Humoral and cellular responses are weakly correlated, but CD4 and CD8 tightly correlate.

The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of antibody test to RNA test needs to be demonstrated. Method A patient cohort study was conducted at the first affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Serial sera of COVID-19 patients were collected and total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected. The antibody dynamics during the infection were described. Results The seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients was 98.8% (79/80), 93.8% (75/80) and 93.8% (75/80), respectively. The first detectible serology marker is total antibody and followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 day post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset, separately. The antibody levels increased rapidly since 6 d.p.o and accompanied with the decline of viral load. For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7d.p.o),Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to the IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p<0.001). The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG detection increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% two weeks later, respectively. Conclusions Typical acute antibody response is induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The development of a new step test based on the characteristics of the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) is an important study to explore. We aimed to develop a new IST based on the ISWT in people with COPD, and assess its validity (construct validity) and reliability, according to Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) recommendations. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in participants recruited from hospitals/clinics. During the recruitment, the participants who presented a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) report in the previous month were also identified and the respective data was collected. Subsequently, participants attended two sessions at their homes. IST was conducted on the first visit, along with the 1 min sit-to-stand (1MSTS) test. IST was repeated on a second visit, performed 5C7 days after the first one. Spearmans correlations were used for construct validity, by comparing the IST with the 6MWT and the 1MSTS. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC(2,1)), SE of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change at 95% CI (MDC95) were used for reliability. The learning effect was explored with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: 50 participants (70.87.5 years) were enrolled. IST was significant and moderate correlated with the 6MWT (=0.50, p=0.020), and with the 1MSTS (=0.46, p=0.001). IST presented an ICC(2,1)=0.96, SEM=10.1 (16.6%) and MDC95=27.9 (45.8%) for the number of steps. There was a statistically significant difference between the two attempts of the IST (p=0.030). CONCLUSION: Despite the significant and moderate correlations with the 6MWT and 1MSTS, the inability to full compliance with the COSMIN recommendations does not yet allow the IST to be considered valid in people with COPD. On the other hand, the IST is a reliable test based on its high ICC, but a learning effect and an indeterminate measurement error were shown.

Gnotobiotic pigs and calves serve as useful models to evaluate induction of active immunity by candidate animal or human rotavirus vaccines. However, live attenuated rotavirus vaccines lacked efficacy when administered orally to calves and pigs in the field, presumably because colostral antibodies inhibited vaccine virus replication. The widespread occurrence of rotavirus antibodies in colostrum led to strategies for maternal rotavirus vaccination to boost lactogenic immunity and transfer passive antibodies to the neonate via colostrum and milk. The variable success of maternal rotavirus vaccines in the field is influenced by vaccine dose, strain, inactivating agent, adjuvant, route of administration, and environmental rotavirus exposure levels.

Our model employs the electricity-consumption data ranging from 2019 to 2020 of 96 counties in the Eastern China region, which covers three main economic sectors and their 53 sub-sectors. The results indicate that electricity demand of all industries (other than information transfer industry) rebounded after the initial shock, and is back to pre-pandemic trends after easing the control measures at the end of May 2020. Emergency response, the combination of all countermeasures to COVID-19 in a certain period, affected all industries, and the higher level of emergency response with stricter movement control resulted in a greater decrease in electricity consumption and production.

The insights of the present review indicate how metals and metal-bound activities impact on various aspects of ecological complexities like prey predator cues, growth, embryonic development, and reproduction. Plankton and benthos are used more often over fish and microbes owing to their smaller size, faster reproduction, amenability, and repeatability during mesocosm experiments. The results of ocean acidification reveal calcification of plankton, corals, alteration of pelagic structures, and plankton blooms. The subtle effect of oil spills is amplified on sediment microorganisms, primary producers, and crustaceans. An overview of the mesocosm designs over the years indicates that gradual changes have evolved in the type, size, design, composition, parameters, methodology employed, and the outputs obtained. Most of the pelagic and benthic mesocosm designs involve consideration of interactions within the water columns, between water and sediments, trophic levels, and nutrient rivalry. Mesocosm structures are built considering physical processes (tidal currents, turbulence, inner cycling of nutrients, thermal stratification, and mixing), biological complexities (population, community, and ecosystem) using appropriate filling containers, and sampling facilities that employ inert materials.

The optical properties of Cu-In-S and Ag-In-S (AIS) QDs vary over a broad range depending on the QD composition and size. The implementation of ternary QDs as emitters in bio-sensing applications can be boosted by the development of mild and reproducible syntheses directly in aqueous solutions as well as the methods of shifting the photoluminescence (PL) bands of such QDs as far as possible into the near IR spectral range. In the present work, the copper-doping of aqueous non-stoichiometric AIS QDs was found to result in a red shift of the PL band maximum from around 630 nm to a??780 nm and PL quenching. The deposition of a ZnS shell results in PL intensity recovery with the highest quantum yield of 15%, with almost not change in the PL band position, opposite to the undoped AIS QDs. Size-selective precipitation using 2-propanol as a non-solvent allows discrimination of up to 9 fractions of Cu-doped AIS/ZnS QDs with the average sizes in the fractions varying from around 3 to 2 nm and smaller and with reasonably the same composition irrespective of the QD size.

Using a partial-report technique, a central arrow presented at varying delays after the images was pointing to the location of the to-be-recalled target. In the direct replication (experiment 1, n = 41), participants were asked to verbally report the cued image (note that the entire planned sample size could not be reached owing to the COVID-19 pandemic), and in an extension experiment (experiment 2, n = 55), iconic memory was tested using a visual recognition test. Both experiments demonstrated prioritized selection of emotional targets from iconic memory, with higher verbal recall and visual recognition accuracy for negative and positive targets compared to neutral targets. In addition, we found that the presence of emotional distractors in the set interfered with the selection of neutral targets, thus confirming a trend that was observed in the original study. Exponential decay curves further revealed that both target and distractor valence primarily affected initial availability (in case of verbal recall) and attentional selection, whereas the decay of iconic memory with increasing cue delay was less sensitive to the emotional meaning.","output":"Revisiting the prioritization of emotional information in iconic memory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A total number of 3080 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from all continents are considered from the NCBI database.

Women seeking IVF have a wide range of subfertility causes including unexplained subfertility. A growing subgroup of women seek treatment for other reasons than fertility problems, for example, women in same sex relationships and single women. This study aims to better understand the contraceptive needs of women after successful IVF pregnancy in order to improve service delivery and prevent unplanned and rapid-repeat pregnancies. METHODS: A qualitative study of views of women who have had spontaneous pregnancies after successful IVF. Participants were recruited using purposive and snowballing sampling methods from social media and peer networks. The framework method was used for analysis using NVivo12. RESULTS: The sample comprised 21 interviewees from the United Kingdom (UK), having a range of spontaneous pregnancy outcomes, including single and multiple livebirths, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy and termination of pregnancy. Contraceptive choices were subject to a complex and dynamic interaction of influencing factors including beliefs regarding subfertility, desire for children and views on contraception. None of the women recalled receiving any information or useful counselling about contraception during fertility or maternity care. After IVF pregnancy, most women (n = 16) used no or ineffective contraception. Spontaneous pregnancy was not universally welcomed in this group and inter-pregnancy intervals were often short (n = 16, less than 18 months). Even after subsequent spontaneous pregnancy, use of contraception and the most effective methods remained low. Women held persistent beliefs regarding their subfertility despite subsequent spontaneous pregnancy. They associated aspects of the IVF process with a sense of personal failure, despite an ultimately successful outcome of livebirth. These aspects may reinforce their self-belief in subfertility. Other barriers to contraception use in women having IVF included: lack of knowledge of likelihood of spontaneous pregnancy, lack of contraceptive experience and inherent incentives towards shorter inter-pregnancy intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The contraceptive needs of women having IVF pregnancies are real and are being overlooked. Fertility services should take responsibility for providing information on the risks of subsequent spontaneous pregnancy. Maternity and community healthcare professionals must address womens perceptions of their fertility in order to engage them in contraception counselling.","output":"Contraception after in vitro fertilisation (IVF): a qualitative study of the views of women who have had spontaneous pregnancies after successful IVF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the healthcare system in the United States. The redistribution of resources and suspension of elective procedures and other services has placed a financial stress across all service lines. The financial impact on the practice of vascular surgery has not yet been quantified. This study hypothesized that vascular surgery divisions have experienced losses affecting the hospital and professional side that will not be recoupable without significant productivity increases. Administrative claims data for clinical services performed by the vascular surgery division at a tertiary medical center from March-April 2019 and March-April 2020 were analyzed. These claims were separated into two categories: Hospital claims (Inpatient and Outpatient) and Professional claims (professional reimbursement for all services provided). Medicare reimbursement methodologies were utilized to assign financial value: Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) for inpatient services, Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) for outpatient services, and Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) for professional reimbursement and work relative value units (wRVU). Reimbursements and productivity (wRVU) were compared between the two time periods. A financial model was created to determine the increase in future productivity over baseline required to mitigate losses incurred during the pandemic. A total of 11,317 vascular surgery claims were reviewed. Hospital reimbursement during the pandemic decreased from $4,982,114 to $2,649,521, -47% (inpatient: $3,505,775 to $2,128,133, -39%; outpatient $1,476,339 to $521,388, -65%) while professional reimbursement decreased from $933,897 to $430,967, -54% when compared to the same time period in 2019. Professional productivity as measured by wRVUs sustained a similar decline from 10478 wRVU to 5386 wRVU, -51%. Modeling sensitivity analyses demonstrated that if a vascular division were able to increase Inpatient and Outpatient revenue, above pre-pandemic levels, by 10%, 5%, or 3%, it would take 9 months, 19 months, or 31 months, respectively, for the hospital to recover pandemic-associated losses. Similarly, professional reimbursement recovery would require 11 months, 20 months, or 36 months for a similar increase in productivity. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and lasting impact on the world in terms of lives lost and financial hardships. The financial impact on a vascular surgery division has resulted in losses ranging from 39% to 65% when compared to pre-pandemic period the previous year. Because complete mitigation of losses is not feasible in the short-term, alternative and novel strategies are needed to financially sustain the vascular division and hospital during a prolonged recovery period.","output":"Financial Implications of COVID-19 on a Tertiary Academic Vascular Surgery Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic that shake the world even harder and faster than tsunami tides Covid-19 is a contagious disease caused by the virus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) It started off from Wuhan city of Hubei province china in December 2019 Initially it was known as 2019 novel coronovirus (2019 nCoV) On 11 march WHO declared COVID-19 as pandemic India reported its first patient on January 30 from Thrissur Kerala, a student from Wuhan In this paper we did a survey of the outbreak and its spread in a short span and its impact on the people both physically and mentally Also we tried to justify our survey with enough facts and statistical data","output":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) in India- Statistics & Facts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Non-febrile illness seizures may present in previously healthy children as afebrile seizures associated with minor infections, such as mild gastroenteritis or respiratory tract infections, and are linked to a genetic predisposition. For the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19, fever, cough, and gastrointestinal complaints are the most common symptoms in children, and a hyperimmune response may be present. No detailed temporally associated neurological complications have been documented in pediatric case series so far. Case description: We present the case of a 3-months-old girl with non-febrile repeated seizures in a COVID-19 family setting. The infant started with a mild fever and cough that lasted for 2 days. At day 6 from onset, the girl presented with two focal motor seizures with impaired consciousness and awareness. All investigations ruled out signs of meningo-encephalitis or active epilepsy, including normal electroencephalogram and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. PCR from nasal and throat swabs was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, blood ferritin and D-dimer levels were increased. At day 9, the infant presented another afebrile motor seizure, and levetiracetam dose was modified there was a favorable response within 3 months of the follow-up. Much interest has been raised with regards to host genetic determinants to disease severity and susceptibility to COVID-19. We thus performed whole exome sequencing, revealing a pathogenic frameshift mutation in the PRRT2 gene in both the mother and the infant. The mother had presented two late infantile febrile convulsions with normal outcome afterwards. Discussion: The hyperimmune response described in adult cases with COVID-19 can be seen in infants, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Moreover, COVID-19 may present in infants as non-febrile seizures, triggering early onset seizures in infants with a genetic predisposition.

The complex (i.e. additive, antagonistic, or synergistic) interactions between multiple extrinsic (exposome) and intrinsic (biological) factors are important determinants of skin health outcomes. Here, we review the role of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) as an emerging component of the skin exposome serving molecular functions as an innate immune factor, environmental toxicant, and topical chemopreventive agent targeting solar UV-induced skin cancer. HOCl [and its corresponding anion (OCl-; hypochlorite)], a weak halogen-based acid and powerful oxidant, serves two seemingly unrelated molecular roles: (i) as an innate immune factor [acting as a myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived microbicidal factor] and (ii) as a chemical disinfectant used in freshwater processing on a global scale, both in the context of drinking water safety and recreational freshwater use. Physicochemical properties (including redox potential and photon absorptivity) determine chemical reactivity of HOCl towards select biochemical targets [i.e. proteins (e.g. IKK, GRP78, HSA, Keap1/NRF2), lipids, and nucleic acids], essential to its role in innate immunity, antimicrobial disinfection, and therapeutic anti-inflammatory use. Recent studies have explored the interaction between solar UV and HOCl-related environmental co-exposures identifying a heretofore unrecognized photo-chemopreventive activity of topical HOCl and chlorination stress that blocks tumorigenic inflammatory progression in UV-induced high-risk SKH-1 mouse skin, a finding with potential implications for the prevention of human nonmelanoma skin photocarcinogenesis.","output":"Hypochlorous Acid: From Innate Immune Factor and Environmental Toxicant to Chemopreventive Agent Targeting Solar UV-Induced Skin Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of DOTA-conjugated monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric [Tyr(3)]octreotide-based analogues as a tool for tumor imaging and/or radionuclide therapy.

A spectrum of histological patterns consistent with acute to subacute lung injury has been seen in biopsies; however, autopsy findings have not been systematically characterised. We describe the pathological findings in autopsy and biopsy tissues submitted to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the evaluation of suspected EVALI. METHODS Between Aug 1, 2019, and Nov 30, 2019, we examined lung biopsy (n=10 individuals) and autopsy (n=13 individuals) tissue samples received by the CDC, submitted by 16 US states, from individuals with: a history of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use; respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms; and either pulmonary infiltrates or opacities on chest imaging, or sudden death from an undetermined cause. We also reviewed medical records, evaluated histopathology, and performed infectious disease testing when indicated by histopathology and clinical history. FINDINGS 21 cases met surveillance case definitions for EVALI, with a further two cases of clinically suspected EVALI evaluated. All ten lung biopsies showed histological evidence of acute to subacute lung injury, including diffuse alveolar damage or organising pneumonia. These patterns were also seen in nine of 13 (69%) autopsy cases, most frequently diffuse alveolar damage (eight autopsies), but also acute and organising fibrinous pneumonia (one autopsy). Additional pulmonary pathology not necessarily consistent with EVALI was seen in the remaining autopsies, including bronchopneumonia, bronchoaspiration, and chronic interstitial lung disease. Three of the five autopsy cases with no evidence of, or a plausible alternative cause for acute lung injury, had been classified as confirmed or probable EVALI according to surveillance case definitions. INTERPRETATION Acute to subacute lung injury patterns were seen in all ten biopsies and most autopsy lung tissues from individuals with suspected EVALI. Acute to subacute lung injury can have numerous causes; however, if it is identified in an individual with a history of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use, and no alternative cause is apparent, a diagnosis of EVALI should be strongly considered. A review of autopsy tissue pathology in suspected EVALI deaths can also identify alternative diagnoses, which can enhance the specificity of public health surveillance efforts.

During Phase II, lasting until about July 11, COVID-19 cases continued to rise at a slower rate, and became increasingly concentrated in four geographic foci of infection across the county. Those communities with larger reductions in social mobility during April - as measured by the proportion of smartphones staying at home and number of smartphones visiting a gym - reported fewer COVID-19 cases in May. During Phase III, COVID-19 incidence only gradually declined, remaining as high as the incidence seen at the end of Phase I.

TB patients had a baseline visit before treatment (month 0) and visits at month 2 and 6 (or at the end of TB treatment). Smear microscopy, and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) were performed at TB diagnosis and during follow-up. Complete blood counts were measured at baseline. Treatment outcome was defined as either unfavorable (death, treatment failure or TB recurrence) or favorable (cure or treatment completion). We performed multivariable logistic regression, with propensity score regression adjustment, to estimate the association between neutrophil count with MTB culture result at month 2 and unfavorable treatment outcome. We used a propensity score adjustment instead of a fully adjusted regression model due to the relatively low number of outcomes. RESULTS: Among 682 patients who had MTB culture results at month 2, 40 (5.9%) had a positive result. After regression with propensity score adjustment, no significant association between baseline neutrophil count (10(3)/mm(3)) and positive MTB culture at month 2 was found among either HIV-seronegative (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = [0.95;1.19] or HIV-seropositive patients (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = [0.51; 1.20]).

Methods: : College students were selected as subjects from Guangzhou Baiyun Technician College Business using convenience sampling. The inclusion criteria was informed consent, current college students who voluntarily participated in this survey. Exclusion criteria were students with chronic diseases or mental disorders. General data questionnaire, daily lifestyle questionnaire, and SHS measurement scale were used to survey college students. The SHS measurement scale consists of three subscales covering the physiological (1-14 items), psychological (16-27 items), and social (29-37 items) dimensions, with 39 items in total. The items 15, 28, 38 and 39 were used for the overall evaluation of the health status within each dimension and would not be taken into account for the score rating. A commonly used 5-point Likert scale was developed to incorporate the positive items, including questions 1-3, 13-19, and 26-39 with a scaled score equal to the raw score at 1-5;while negative items including questions 4-12 and 20-25 with a scaled score equal to 6 minus the raw score. For each subscale, the sum of all item scores was the raw score. The total raw score was calculated as the sum of raw scores derived from all 3 sub-scales.

Multiple linear regression analysis showed that eating irregular meals, exercising fewer times per week, sleeping fewer hours per night, sleeping after 11 PM more often, spending more time on electronic devices, exercising for fewer minutes each time, and skipping breakfast had the significant negative impact on the SHS scores of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic (P<0.05), while being the only child had a significant positive impact on the SHS scores of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic (P<0.05). Conclusions: : During the COVID-19 pandemic, the detected prevalence of sub-health was high among college students. Society and schools should pay more attention to the health of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic and take pertinence action to solve the problem base on influencing factors.","output":"Prevalence of Sub-health Status among College Students in Guangzhou Baiyun Technician College Business during the Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The vascular and gastrointestinal effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tNSAIDs), are not well characterised, particularly in patients at increased risk of vascular disease. We aimed to provide such information through meta-analyses of randomised trials. METHODS We undertook meta-analyses of 280 trials of NSAIDs versus placebo (124,513 participants, 68,342 person-years) and 474 trials of one NSAID versus another NSAID (229,296 participants, 165,456 person-years). The main outcomes were major vascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death); major coronary events (non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death); stroke; mortality; heart failure; and upper gastrointestinal complications (perforation, obstruction, or bleed). FINDINGS Major vascular events were increased by about a third by a coxib (rate ratio [RR] 137, 95% CI 114-166; p=00009) or diclofenac (141, 112-178; p=00036), chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events (coxibs 176, 131-237; p=00001; diclofenac 170, 119-241; p=00032). Ibuprofen also significantly increased major coronary events (222, 110-448; p=00253), but not major vascular events (144, 089-233). Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to a coxib or diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Naproxen did not significantly increase major vascular events (093, 069-127). Vascular death was increased significantly by coxibs (158, 99% CI 100-249; p=00103) and diclofenac (165, 095-285, p=00187), non-significantly by ibuprofen (190, 056-641; p=017), but not by naproxen (108, 048-247, p=080). The proportional effects on major vascular events were independent of baseline characteristics, including vascular risk. Heart failure risk was roughly doubled by all NSAIDs. All NSAID regimens increased upper gastrointestinal complications (coxibs 181, 117-281, p=00070; diclofenac 189, 116-309, p=00106; ibuprofen 397, 222-710, p<00001; and naproxen 422, 271-656, p<00001). INTERPRETATION The vascular risks of high-dose diclofenac, and possibly ibuprofen, are comparable to coxibs, whereas high-dose naproxen is associated with less vascular risk than other NSAIDs. Although NSAIDs increase vascular and gastrointestinal risks, the size of these risks can be predicted, which could help guide clinical decision making.

Here, we report a comprehensive epidemiological and genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from 63 patients in Niigata City, a medium-sized Japanese city, during the early phase of the pandemic, between February and May 2020. Among the 63 patients, 32 (51%) were female, with a mean (standard deviation) age of 47.9  22.3 years. Fever (65%, 41/63), malaise (51%, 32/63), and cough (35%, 22/63) were the most common clinical symptoms. The median C(t) value after the onset of symptoms lowered within 9 days at 20.9 cycles (interquartile range, 17C26 cycles), but after 10 days, the median C(t) value exceeded 30 cycles (p < 0.001). Of the 63 cases, 27 were distributed in the first epidemic wave and 33 in the second, and between the two waves, three cases from abroad were identified. The first wave was epidemiologically characterized by a single cluster related to indoor sports activity spread in closed settings, which included mixing indoors with families, relatives, and colleagues. The second wave showed more epidemiologically diversified events, with most index cases not related to each other. Almost all secondary cases were infected by droplets or aerosols from closed indoor settings, but at least two cases in the first wave were suspected to be contact infections. Results of the genomic analysis identified two possible clusters in Niigata City, the first of which was attributed to clade S (19B by Nexstrain clade) with a monophyletic group derived from the Wuhan prototype strain but that of the second wave was polyphyletic suggesting multiple introductions, and the clade was changed to GR (20B), which mainly spread in Europe in early 2020. These findings depict characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the early stages in local community settings during February to May 2020 in Japan, and this integrated approach of epidemiological and genomic analysis may provide valuable information for public health policy decision-making for successful containment of chains of infection.","output":"Genomic Epidemiology Reveals Multiple Introductions of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Niigata City, Japan, Between February and May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus disease has emerged (later named COVID-19) and caused the world to enter a new reality, with many direct and indirect factors influencing it.

We have sought to test how a change in these human-controllable factors might influence two measures: the number of daily cases against economic impact. If applied at the right level and with up-to-date data to measure, policymakers would be able to make targeted interventions and measure their cost. This study aims to provide a predictive analytics framework to model, predict and simulate COVID-19 propagation and the socio-economic impact of interventions intended to reduce the spread of the disease such as policy and/or vaccine. It allows policymakers, government representatives and business leaders to make better-informed decisions about the potential effect of various interventions with forward-looking views via scenario planning.

The highest keratinase activity was obtained at 40C45 C, pH 8C9, feather concentration 0.5C1%, and using white chicken feather as keratin substrate for 72 h. Enhancement of keratinase activity through physical mutagen UV radiation and/or chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) resulted in five mutants with 1.51C3.73-fold increased activity over the wild type. When compared with the wild type, scanning electron microscopy validated the mutants effectiveness in feather degradation. Bacterial isolates are classified as members of the S8 family peptidase Bacillus cereus group based on sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and keratinase genes. Interestingly, keratinase KerS gene shared 95.5C100% identity to keratinase, thermitase alkaline serine protease, and thermophilic serine protease of the B. cereus group. D(137)N substitution was observed in the keratinase KerS gene of the mutant strain S13 (KerS13uv+ems), and also seven substitution variations in KerS26 and KerS26uv of strain S26 and its mutant S26uv. Functional analysis revealed that the subtilisin-like serine protease domain containing the Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad of KerS gene was not affected by the predicted substitutions. Prediction of physicochemical properties of KerS gene showed instability index between 17.5C19.3 and aliphatic index between 74.7C75.7, which imply keratinase stability and significant thermostability. The docking studies revealed the impact of substitutions on the superimposed structure and an increase in binding of mutant D(137)N of KerS13uv+ems (affinity: ?7.17; S score: ?6.54 kcal/mol) and seven mutants of KerS26uv (affinity: ?7.43; S score: ?7.17 kcal/mol) compared to the wild predicted structure (affinity: ?6.57; S score: ?6.68 kcal/mol). Together, the keratinolytic activity, similarity to thermostable keratinases, and binding affinity suggest that keratinases KerS13uv+ems and KerS26uv could be used for feather processing in the industry.","output":"Novel Feather Degrading Keratinases from Bacillus cereus Group: Biochemical, Genetic and Bioinformatics Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Insomnia is highly prevalent in outpatients receiving treatment for mental disorders. CognitiveCbehavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a recommended first-line intervention. However, access is limited and most patients with insomnia who are receiving mental healthcare services are treated using medication. This multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) examines additional benefits of a digital adaptation of CBT-I (dCBT-I), compared with an online control intervention of patient education about insomnia (PE), in individuals referred to secondary mental health clinics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A parallel group, superiority RCT with a target sample of 800 participants recruited from treatment waiting lists at Norwegian psychiatric services. Individuals awaiting treatment will receive an invitation to the RCT, with potential participants undertaking online screening and consent procedures. Eligible outpatients will be randomised to dCBT-I or PE in a 1:1 ratio. Assessments will be performed at baseline, 9 weeks after completion of baseline assessments (post-intervention assessment), 33 weeks after baseline (6 months after the post-intervention assessment) and 61 weeks after baseline (12 months after the post-intervention assessment). The primary outcome is between-group difference in insomnia severity 9 weeks after baseline. Secondary outcomes include between-group differences in levels of psychopathology, and measures of health and functioning 9 weeks after baseline. Additionally, we will test between-group differences at 6-month and 12-month follow-up, and examine any negative effects of the intervention, any changes in mental health resource use, and/or in functioning and prescription of medications across the duration of the study. Other exploratory analyses are planned. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Norway (Ref: 125068).

Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibody responses. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human monocyte and murine macrophage cultures.

Half of the QIs are implemented in clinical settings by course attendees more than 90% of the time, and 15 QIs are implemented between 70 and 89.9%. Colleagues within the same healthcare system applied palliative care practices less frequently than those who attended the training course. When asked if quality indicators were always implemented by colleagues, the average difference in scores was 36% lower. Qualitative analyses resulted in three themes that addressed changes in clinical practice, and four themes that summarized barriers in practice. Conclusion: There is high frequency of implementation of QIs by professionals who attended an evidence based PNPC training course.

We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis in order to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19-induced liver injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, for studies reporting laboratory data about COVID-19 patients, with last update on 25th March 2020. The primary outcome was the pooled prevalence of COVID- 19-induced liver damage, mainly represented by increase in serum transaminases and bilirubin. The secondary outcome was the description of abnormalities in serum albumin and prothrombin time (PT). We focused on laboratory data only on hospital admission, and adopted random-effects model for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies were eligible for meta-analysis. Out of 793 included patients, the pooled prevalence of COVID-19-related liver damage was 22.17% (95% CI 17.64 to 27.07), mostly indicated by hypertransaminasemia. Serum bilirubin was increased in 5.53% (95% CI 3.60 to 7.85) of cases. Abnormal serum albumin was observed in 78.92% (95% CI 39.82 to 99.56), and increased PT value in 19.98% (95% CI 2.49 to 78.23), but these results derived from significantly heterogeneous studies.

A significant portion of this is attributable to widespread access to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, alone or in combination with heroin or psychostimulants, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) offer prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against opioid overdose by binding opioids in serum, reducing distribution of drug to the brain and other organs. Here, we investigated the efficacy of a leading antifentanyl mAb, clone HY6-F9, in reversal and prevention of fentanyl-induced toxicity compared with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (NLX) in rats. In postexposure models, rats were challenged with fentanyl, followed by HY6-F9, NLX, or both. HY6-F9 reversed fentanyl-induced antinociception, respiratory depression, and bradycardia, and rats retained protection against additional challenges for at least 1 week. Although intravenous NLX reversed fentanyl-induced respiratory depression more rapidly than mAb alone, kinetics of reversal by intravenous mAb were similar to subcutaneous NLX. Coadministration of mAb and NLX provided greater protection than individual treatments against high doses of fentanyl. Prophylactic administration of mAb reduced the ED50 of NLX approximately twofold against 2.25 mg/kg of fentanyl. Finally, mAb sequestered fentanyl and its metabolite norfentanyl in serum and reduced brain concentrations of fentanyl. These results support the translation of mAb as medical interventions alone or in combination with NLX to prevent and reverse fentanyl-related overdose. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Fentanyl-related overdoses have increased dramatically in the US and worldwide. Currently, approved pharmacotherapies for treatment of opioid use disorder and reversal of overdose are not sufficient to curb the incidence of opioid-related deaths. Additionally, fentanyl and its potent analogs present a potential risk from use in deliberate poisoning or chemical attacks. This study demonstrates the use of monoclonal antibodies as a countermeasure to fentanyl-induced toxicity in pre- and postexposure scenarios, supporting their use in combination with the opioid antagonist naloxone.","output":"Pharmacological Profiling of Antifentanyl Monoclonal Antibodies in Combination with Naloxone in Pre- and Postexposure Models of Fentanyl Toxicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]it describes the problems that the University itself faces in a problematic context where it is in crisis From the absorption of the same in the mercantile logic to its negation: the complacency with the business logic;disregard for context;police positions of discipline Subsequently, we argue that these positions, even those intended to be more critical, cooperate in their way in processes of discipline and production of bodies that are docile to the demands of mercantile and domination logic [ ]with the risks that this implies, we propose an autonomous, belligerent, politicized, and disobedient University","output":"Universidad autnoma, universidad desobediente: riesgos, tensiones, paradojas y posibilidades"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper authors are presenting results of sentiment analysis of tweets - textual posts generated by users of Twitter in April 2020 in 6 selected countries: USA, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Germany There are two datasets formed in this research: first containing tweets about COVID-19 in selected countries, and second, containing tweets from top 10 politicians, users of Twitter in selected countries Results show that most tweets from both data sources share similar positive sentiments, with minor differences between countries Top emotions include 'trust', 'fear' and 'anticipation' ? 2020 Croatian Society MIPRO","output":"Sentiment analysis of tweets about COVID-19 disease during pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To analyze core processes of the MRI workflow and to evaluate efficiency for improved patient throughput and capacity utilization.

We identified adults hospitalized with COVID-19, where cohort entry was the date of hospitalization. NSAIDs users were those prescribed NSAIDs in the 7 days before and including cohort entry and non-users were those not prescribed NSAIDs during this period. Our primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation use, and sepsis; our secondary outcomes were cardiovascular complications and acute renal failure. We conducted logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using inverse probability of treatment weighting to minimize confounding.

Given the high morbidity and mortality and prolonged duration of illness experienced by patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19, shortages of ventilators are expected. In New York State, the Crisis Standards of Care guidelines were codified by the New York State Taskforce on Life and the Law in the 2015 Ventilator Triage Guidelines (NYS guidelines). These guidelines outline clinical criteria for triage, including exclusion criteria and stratification of patients using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. We aimed to estimate the excess mortality that would be associated with implementation of triage processes using this protocol. Methods: We included all 5,028 patients who were admitted with COVID-19 in three acute care hospitals at a single academic medical center in the Bronx from March 1, 2020 to May 27, 2020 during the peak of the pandemic surge in New York City. Importance sampling was used to estimate the likelihood of patient trajectories under the NYS guidelines and estimate survival rates. Pessimistic and optimistic estimations were derived to account for potential unobserved confounders. Overall estimated survival was then calculated over a range of hypothetical ventilator shortages (e.g. if it has not been possible to acquire the additional ventilators that were procured in the Spring) from 85-100% availability of the total ventilator capacity of these facilities. Results: The average age of the sample was 64.2 (SD 16.2) and 47% were female. The observed survival rate was 74.16%. A total of 721 patients (14%) required mechanical ventilation during admission. If there has been a ventilator shortfall with ventilator capacity at 85% and the NYS guidelines were enacted in this setting, the estimated survival would be between 70.3% (pessimistic estimation) and 71.5% (optimistic estimation) (Figure 1). Conclusions: A shortfall of ventilators at 85% ventilator capacity requiring implementation of the NYS guidelines triage protocol would have resulted in 2.7-3.9% excess mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic surge, or 134-194 additional deaths. This study is limited by the exclusion of COVID-19 negative patients, who would be in the triage pool in an actual triage situation. Future directions include using this data set to compare NYS guideline performance to other triage strategies including first-come first-served and random allocation to better understand the utility of SOFA score-based triage strategies.","output":"Estimation of excess mortality resulting from use of a ventilator triage protocol under SARS-CoV-2 pandemic surge conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] A series of tricyclic and polycyclic pyrido[1,2-e]purine derivatives were designed and synthesized via a two-step, one-pot reaction of 2,4-dichloro-5-amino-6-methylpyrimidine with pyridine under reflux conditions.

Calcium is accumulated in the ER by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCA enzymes) that generate by active, ATP-dependent transport, a several thousand-fold calcium ion concentration gradient between the cytosol (low nanomolar) and the ER lumen (high micromolar). SERCA enzymes are coded by three genes that by alternative splicing give rise to several isoforms, which can display isoform-specific calcium transport characteristics. SERCA expression levels and isoenzyme composition vary according to cell type, and this constitutes a mechanism whereby ER calcium homeostasis is adapted to the signaling and metabolic needs of the cell, depending on its phenotype, its state of activation and differentiation. As reviewed here, in several normal epithelial cell types including bronchial, mammary, gastric, colonic and choroid plexus epithelium, as well as in mature cells of hematopoietic origin such as pumps are simultaneously expressed, whereas in corresponding tumors and leukemias SERCA3 expression is selectively down-regulated. SERCA3 expression is restored during the pharmacologically induced differentiation of various cancer and leukemia cell types. SERCA3 is a useful marker for the study of cell differentiation, and the loss of SERCA3 expression constitutes a previously unrecognized example of the remodeling of calcium homeostasis in tumors.","output":"Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Pumps and Tumor Cell Differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim is to find predictors for a prolonged LOHS after MitraClip implantation.

A total of 41 consecutive patients with MitraClip implantation (76  9 years, 59% men) were included. Median hospital stay was 7 days. Hospitalization lasting longer than 7 days was considered prolonged. RESULTS Procedural success was achieved in 88% of the cases. In-hospital death occurred in 4 of 41 patients (10%). Patients with a prolonged hospital stay (46%) had a higher EuroSCORE I (22.7% [IQR 10.3-28.3] vs. 6.7% [IQR 3.5-18.3], P = 0.017), a higher STS mortality score (6.1%[(IQR 3.7-7.5] vs. 2.6% [IQR 1.4-4.8]; P = 0.043) and a higher STS long-length-of-stay score (18.9% [IQR 11.3-22.5] vs. 9.6% [IQR 6.2-16.1]; P = 0.039) as well as a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (41 ml/min/1.73 m(2) [IQR 19-52] vs. 56 ml/min/1.73 m(2) [IQR 49-62]; P = 0.008) than those whose did not.

BACKGROUND At present, COVID-19 is prevalent in the world, seriously endangering the property and life safety of people around the world. Currently, there are many reports on the clinical features, complications and risk factors of death of COVID-19, but there are few reports on the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19. DESIGN Case-control Study. METHODS Patients with COVID-19 were recruited from four designated hospitals for novel coronavirus pneumonia in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province from January to April, 2020. The patients were divided into disease exacerbation group (n = 53) and disease stabilization group (n = 265) according to the disease progression during hospitalization. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19. The research was reported according to STROBE statement. RESULTS Univariate analysis showed there were significant differences in gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, albumin, creatinine, calcium ion, rate of erythrocyte sedimentation, cough, expectoration, chest tightness, gastrointestinal discomfort and dyspnea between the two groups. The variables with P < 0.05 in the aforementioned difference analysis were included in binary logistic regression analysis, which showed that age, hypertension history, chest tightness, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine were independent factors associated with COVID-19 disease exacerbation. CONCLUSION Clinicians may warn the exacerbation of COVID-19 facing above risk factors and associated characteristics, and adjust the diagnosis and treatment plan to delay the disease progression, reduce complications and mortality and improve the prognosis of patients.

An evaluation model, which has been previously generated using human skin obtained from forensic autopsy samples, accurately mimics in vivo skin conditions for evaluating the effectiveness of disinfection against the virus. Using this model, we evaluated disinfection effectiveness against viruses on human skin. METHODS: Ethanol (EA), isopropanol (IPA), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and benzalkonium chloride (BAC) were used as target disinfectants. First, disinfectant effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) was evaluated in vitro. Disinfectant effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and IAV on human skin was then evaluated by titrating viruses present on the skin after applying each disinfectant on the skin for 5-60 seconds. RESULTS: Both, SARS-CoV-2 and IAV on human skin were completely inactivated within 5 seconds by 40%-80% EA and 70% IPA (log reduction values (LRVs) were >4). However, SARS-CoV-2 and IAV were barely inactivated by 20% EA (LRVs were <1). In vitro evaluation showed that, compared with EA and IPA, CHG and BAC were significantly inferior in terms of disinfection effectiveness. Conversely, the disinfection effectiveness of CHG and BAC against SARS-CoV-2 was higher on human skin than in vitro, and increased with increases in their concentration and reaction time (LRVs of 0.2% CHG/0.05% BAC were >2, and LRVs of 1.0% CHG/0.2% BAC were >2.5).

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether children with CIs use language knowledge via semantic prediction to facilitate recognition of upcoming words and help compensate for uncertainties in the acoustic signal. Method Five- to 10-year-old children with CIs heard sentences with an informative verb (draws) or a neutral verb (gets) preceding a target word (picture). The target referent was presented on a screen, along with a phonologically similar competitor (pickle). Children's eye gaze was recorded to quantify efficiency of access of the target word and suppression of phonological competition. Performance was compared to both an age-matched group and vocabulary-matched group of children with NH. Results Children with CIs, like their peers with NH, demonstrated use of informative verbs to look more quickly to the target word and look less to the phonological competitor. However, children with CIs demonstrated less efficient use of semantic cues relative to their peers with NH, even when matched for vocabulary ability. Conclusions Children with CIs use semantic prediction to facilitate spoken word recognition but do so to a lesser extent than children with NH.

Grievance politics is defined by the fuelling and funneling of negative emotions and various blame-based political strategies which explicitly challenge and confound many of the core principles and values that have traditionally underpinned conventional conceptions of party politics. It is the tension between party politics and grievance politicsand their contemporary co-existence as competing modes of political representationwhich this article seeks to underline and through this, to develop a clearer understanding of possible futures for representative democracy.","output":"Party Politics vs. Grievance Politics: Competing Modes of Representative Democracy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe a laparoscopically assisted ovariectomy (LAO) technique in the cat with a bipolar vessel sealing device (BVSD) or suture ligation and to compare the outcomes to open ovariohysterectomy (OO). STUDY DESIGN Randomized prospective study ANIMALS: Healthy, adult, sexually intact female cats (n = 30). METHODS Ten cats were assigned to each group: LAO with BVSD (group A), LAO with ligation (group B), and OO with ligation (group C). Surgical times and complications were assessed. Serum glucose and cortisol were measured prior to surgery and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. Pain was scored by using an interactive visual analog scale (IVAS) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours after surgery. Rescue analgesia was provided when IVAS score was 4 or more. Physiological and serum values and IVAS scores were compared among groups with area under the curve (AUC) by using a 1-way ANOVA. RESULTS Surgical time was shortest for group C (19.1  5.2 minutes; P < .0002); there was no significant difference between groups A (27.7  6.6 minutes) and B (33.2  8.2 minutes). All procedures were completed successfully. No significant differences among groups were found in IVAS scores (P = .36), rescue analgesia (P = .22), glucose AUC (P = .53), or cortisol AUC (P = .27). CONCLUSION The LAO technique was accomplished as described in all cats with no complications or failures. Pain scores were not different from cats undergoing OO. LAO can be performed efficiently to maximize the benefits of minimally invasive surgery and is amenable to clinical practice.","output":"Evaluation of a laparoscopically assisted ovariectomy technique in cats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding how human genetics influence infectious disease susceptibility offers the opportunity for new insights into pathogenesis, potential drug targets, risk stratification, response to therapy and vaccination.

These drugs may also be effective in modulating testicular function. In fact, they increase serum testosterone levels in diabetic and/or obese patients with functional hypogonadism on a dysmetabolic basis. Although part of this effect can be ascribed to weight loss, some evidence suggests that there is a direct effect at the testicular level. Indeed, human Leydig, Sertoli, and germ cells express GLP1 receptors. GLP1-RAs improve sperm metabolism, motility, and insulin secretion in-vitro. Likewise, GLP1-RAs exert positive effects on the metabolism of human Sertoli cells in-vitro. Finally, GLP1 is secreted by mouse Leydig cells and this suggests the presence of a paracrine mechanism by which these cells could support the metabolism of Sertoli cells. Therefore, the widespread use of GLP1-RAs in clinical practice may reveal an important role in the management of male infertility in obese and/or diabetic patients given the negative impact of these diseases on testicular steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. This should suggest the design of randomized controlled studies aimed at evaluating the effects of these drugs on testicular function.","output":"Is there a role for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in the treatment of male infertility?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Scleromyxedema (rare cutaneous mucinosis), is characterized by the formation of lichenoid papules and presence of Serum monoclonal IgG in most cases, or all; after repeated testing.

One way to understand why people differ in their attitudes is to examine how personality traits predict the degree to which people hold different attitudes. METHODS: We collected data (N = 1420) from Portugal and Spain using Facebook advertising. We measured the Dark Triad and Big Five traits, and negative affect, along with ad hoc items for religiousness, and attitudes towards and fear of COVID. RESULTS: Neuroticism and Negative affect was linked to various domains of insecurity or fear and provides insights into how personality predicts concerns and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Religious people were less trusting in science, thought prayer was answer, and attributed the existence of the virus to an act of God. Women reported more fear of COVID-19 than men did, and this was enabled by womens greater tendency to have Negative Affect and higher Neuroticism than men. CONCLUSIONS: Neurotic people and those with more Negative Affect appear to be more fearful, more trusting in others and systems likely to protect them (e.g., scientists), and less likely to trust in systems shown to not help them (e.g., prayer). We found other effects for the Dark Triad traits and the Big Five traits.

With the global pandemic caused by the new coronavirus, there was an increase in the prescription of these drugs, which led to a major concern regarding their ototoxic effects. Objectives The objective of the present study was to assess existing scientific evidence about the toxic effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on the peripheral and/or central auditory system. Data Synthesis A systematic literature review was performed by searching the PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, and SciELO electronic databases, in a search of articles that fullfiled the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review was conducted in three phases and, in all of them, analyses were performed by two independent researchers. Disagreements were discussed with a third researcher until a consensus was reached. A total of 437 articles were found and 8 were included in this review. Seven of the included studies reported hearing loss in their samples and presented a diagnostic hypothesis of ototoxicity induced by chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. The most common type of hearing loss was sensorineural, with varying laterality and degrees of severity. The most frequently used audiological test was pure tone audiometry, and only two studies assessed brainstem evoked responses. Conclusion The scientific evidence compiled in this research showed that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have an ototoxic effect in the peripheral auditory system.

This study seeks to identify factors, including characteristics of patients and referring clinicians, that influence LDCT screening completion following participation in SDM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of n = 171 patients eligible for LDCT screening and who participated in SDM between 2016 and 2017 in one of two sites in Prisma Health, an academic health care delivery system in South Carolina. Patient characteristics included age, sex, race, body mass index, marital status, insurance, smoking status and history, family history of lung cancer, SDM site, and distance to screening site. Characteristics of referred clinicians included age, sex, race, specialty, years of practice, education, and residency. Descriptive statistics and multivariable generalized linear mixed models were used to compare effects of patient and referring clinician characteristics on LDCT completion. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients (89%) completed LDCT screening after participation in SDM. SDM site (p = 0.02), longer distances to the screening site (p = 0.03), referrals from internal medicine clinicians (p = 0.03), and referrals from younger clinicians (p = 0.01) and from those with less years of experience (p = 0.02) were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of screening completion.

We found that global connections, represented by countries importance in the global air transportation network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19 in different countries.

Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize almost every corner on Earth. Based on our global analysis, the global network of air transportation could lead to a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic if board control measures in international airports were not taken and are not sustained during this pandemic.

Methods: We searched medical databases up to 15 September 2020 for epidemiological studies that investigated the impact of COVID-19 on HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in terms of morbidity, mortality, or healthcare accessibility, covering African countries. We consulted global health and government sources for population surveys providing relevant primary data. We employed meta-study to assess evidence. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42020209265. Results: Of the 128 records screened, 14 epidemiological studies were included in the analysis. We identified 5 population surveys. The largest effect of COVID-19 related disruption of HIV, TB, and malaria services is projected to result from interruption of ART, decline in TB case detection, and interruption of insecticide treated bed nets distribution campaigns, respectively. However, most modelling studies substantially underestimated the potential implications of COVID-19 on HIV, TB, and malaria in Africa and focused on the disruption of healthcare resulting from reduction in the capacity of healthcare provider. Reduced capacity of patients to use health services and adhere to treatment may also contribute to poor outcomes even when health systems capabilities are restored or unaffected. Moreover, these models do not account for any potential interaction of HIV, TB, and malaria with COVID-19, although empirical evidence shows that coinfection between HIV and TB with COVID-19 is significantly associated with increased mortality risk in Africa.

Importantly, COVID-19 can place PWDs at a higher risk of infection since some may already have compromised immune and respiratory systems and policy responses, such as social distancing, can lead to life-threatening disruptions in care for those that rely on home heath or personal assistants. Living in cities may already present health-damaging challenges for PWDs, such as through lack of access to services and employment, physical barriers on streets and transportation, and smart-city technologies that are not made universally accessible.

There is great uncertainty regarding how countries characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal. METHODS: We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia). RESULTS: In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Compared with Europe, Africas younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.","output":"The relatively young and rural population may limit the spread and severity of COVID-19 in Africa: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peptides are fragments of proteins that carry out biological functions.

DESIGN & SETTING: Systematic review of studies published in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to 1 April 2020. METHOD: A systematic review will be conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Inclusion criteria will be: (1) assesses the effect of drug exposure on ACE2 level of expression or activity; (2) the drug is included in the British National Formulary (BNF) and, therefore, available to prescribe in the UK; and (3) a control, placebo, or sham group is included as comparator. Exclusion criteria will be: (1) ACE2 measurement in utero; (2) ACE2 measurement in children aged <18 years; (3) drug not in the BNF; and (4) review article. Quality will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for human studies, and the SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool for animal studies. RESULTS: Data will be reported in summary tables and narrative synthesis. CONCLUSION: This systematic review will identify drug therapies that may increase or decrease ACE2 expression. This might identify medications increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission, or as targets for intervention in mitigating transmission.","output":"Drug treatments affecting ACE2 in COVID-19 infection: a systematic review protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the health emergence, no such potent prophylactic therapy is available to control the deadly emerged Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, existing antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial drugs is the only option against SARS-CoV-2, but it may be harmful to patients without more clinical evidence. As an alternative solution, we proposed a newer hypothesis using the selective 10 potent anti-HIV drugs and flavonoid class of phytochemicals from previous reports to use in combination against SARS-CoV-2. Primarily, 10 anti-HIV protease inhibitor drugs and 10 phyto-flavonoids as ligands in molecular docking study against the putative target, the SARS-CoV-2-main protease (Mpro) ID: 6Y2E), as an essential enzyme in viral genome replication. According to molecular docking and drug-ability scores of each ligand, the anti-HIV drug, the darunavir (with a docking score, -10.25 kcal/mol and drug-likeness rating, 0.60) and the quercetin-3-rhamnoside (with a docking score, -10.90 kcal/mol and drug-likeness rating, 0.82) were selected for further analysis in combined effect.

Effects that arise long after the primary infection can also increase the propensity for chronic conditions or lead to the development of cancer. Recent advances in the fields of virology and pathology have been fundamental in improving our understanding of viral pathogenesis, in providing improved vaccination strategies and in developing newer, more effective treatments for patients worldwide. The reviews assembled here focus on the interface between virology and pathology and encompass aspects of both the clinical pathology of viral disease and the underlying disease mechanisms. Articles on emerging diseases caused by Ebola virus, Marburg virus, coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, Nipah virus and noroviruses are followed by reviews of enteroviruses, HIV infection, measles, mumps, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The issue concludes with a series of articles reviewing the relationship between viruses and cancer, including the role played by EpsteinCBarr virus (EBV) in the pathogenesis of lymphoma and carcinoma; how human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are involved in the development of skin cancer; the involvement of hepatitis B virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma; and the mechanisms by which Kaposi's sarcoma\\\\associated herpesvirus (KSHV) leads to Kaposi's sarcoma. We hope that this collection of articles will be of interest to a wide range of scientists and clinicians at a time when there is a renaissance in the appreciation of the power of pathology as virologists dissect the processes of disease.

METHOD 222 PLWH (mean age = 50.2  11.2, 50.9 % female, 14.5 % Hispanic, 64.7 % Black, 15.8 % White, 5 % other, 80.2 % persons using marijuana [at least weekly use], 19.8 % persons not using marijuana) completed a baseline survey on demographics and behavioral/health characteristics between 2018 and 2020 and a brief phone survey between May and October 2020 that assessed changes in marijuana use and overall/mental health, and perceived risks/benefits of marijuana use during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS During the pandemic, 64/222(28.8 %) of the whole sample reported increased marijuana use, 36(16.2 %) reported decreased use, and 122(55 %) reported no change. Multinomial logistic regression results indicated that: Compared to those reporting no change, increased marijuana use during the pandemic was associated with more frequent marijuana use and PTSD symptoms at baseline, worsened mental health during the pandemic, and not perceiving marijuana use as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection. More frequent marijuana use at baseline was the only factor significantly associated with decreased marijuana use during the pandemic. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in marijuana use among a considerable proportion (45 %) of PLWH.

Therefore, one of the objectives of the health systems should implement safety practices to minimize the risk of contagion among these health professionals. Monitoring environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 may help to determine the potential of the environment as a transmission medium in an area highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2, such as an intensive care unit. The objective of the study was to analyze the environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces collected in an intensive care unit, which is dedicated exclusively to the care of patients with COVID-19 and equipped with negative pressure of C 10 Pa and an air change rate of 20 cycles per hour. Furthermore, all ICU workers were tested for COVID-19 by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA methods. RESULTS: A total of 102 samples (72 collected with pre-moistened swabs used for collection of nasopharyngeal exudates and 30 with moistened wipes used in the environmental microbiological control of the food industry) were obtained from ventilators, monitors, perfusion pumps, bed rails, lab benches, containers of personal protective equipment, computer keyboards and mice, telephones, workers shoes, floor, and other areas of close contact with COVID-19 patients and healthcare professionals who cared for them. The analysis by quantitative RT-PCR showed no detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome in environmental samples collected by any of the two methods described. Furthermore, none of the 237 ICU workers was infected by the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the ICU surfaces could not be determined supporting that a strict cleaning protocol with sodium hypochlorite, a high air change rate, and a negative pressure in the ICU are effective in preventing environmental contamination.

The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of regular gargling using 7.5% sodium bicarbonate to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 in the oropharynx and nasopharynx. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This pilot, open-labeled, nonrandomized, parallel single-center study. The effect of 30 seconds, three times per day gargling using 7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution25 mL on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance among coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients in a dedicated COVID hospital at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India. We monitored the progress on by days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 by observing variables like clinical category, P/F ratio, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ratio, platelet count, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), CRP, procalcitonin, d-dimer, INR, APTT, and sequential organ function assessment (SOFA) score. We have also done repeat reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on day 5 and day 7. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients (7 males and 3 females) were included in our study after confirmed COVID positivity. The age range was from 30 to 61 years. Based on clinical severity and P/F ratio, 7 patients were included in the milder group as their ratio was more than 200 and the rest 3 patients were included in the moderate group as P/F ratio was less than 200. Two respondents had comorbidities, which were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and ovarian carcinoma. Viral clearance was achieved at day 7 in 3 of 10 patients. However, the analysis of using 7.5% sodium bicarbonate 25 mL gargle statistically showed nonsignificant p-value for all of our studied variables. However, the PCR results were negative on 24 hours apart, i.e., on day 5 and day 7. CONCLUSIONS: This is only a preliminary study which showed that gargling with 7.5% sodium bicarbonate may not be effective in achieving early SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance among mild COVID-19 patients. However, still larger studies are required to ascertain the benefit of gargling for different stages of COVID-19 patients with keeping in mind the important variables suggestive of viremia clearance.

By conducting high-resolution CFD simulations, this paper investigates the evaporation and transport of solid-liquid mixed droplets (initial diameter 10 m and 50 m, solid to liquid ratio is 1:9) exhaled in a coach bus with 14 thermal manikins. Five air-conditioning supply directions and ambient relative humidity (RH = 35% and 95%) are considered. Results show that ventilation effectiveness, RH and initial droplet size significantly influence droplet transmissions in coach bus. 50 m droplets tend to evaporate completely within 1.8 s and 7 s as RH = 35% and 95% respectively, while 0.2 s or less for 10 m droplets. Thus 10 m droplets diffuse farther with wider range than 50 m droplets which tend to deposit more on surfaces. Droplet dispersion pattern differs due to various interactions of gravity, ventilation flows and the upward thermal body plume. The fractions of droplets suspended in air, deposited on wall surfaces are quantified. This study implies high RH, backward supply direction and passengers sitting at nonadjacent seats can effectively reduce infection risk of droplet transmission in buses. Besides taking masks, regular cleaning is also recommended since 85%-100% of droplets deposit on object surfaces.","output":"Transmission of pathogen-laden expiratory droplets in a coach bus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Review focuses on the changing epidemiology of infections among patients with end-stage renal disease who are undergoing dialysis.

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting select genes of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been the main diagnostic tool in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test has not been studied systematically outside of the laboratory setting. The aim of this study is to provide estimates of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR test developed by China CDC. Methods. The study design is a secondary analysis of published findings on 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, of whom 601 tested positive and 413 were negative for COVID-19. Sensitivity and specificity were reconstructed using a Bayesian approach from probabilistic knowledge of the diagnostic errors. Predictive values of the test were calculated, resulting in estimates for the number of confirmatory tests that are needed for establishing the presence or absence of COVID-19, depending on the prior probability of a patient having the disease. Results. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR diagnostic test was estimated to be 0.777 (95% CI: 0.715, 0.849), while the specificity was 0.988 (95% CI: 0.933, 1.000). The confidence intervals include sampling error in addition to the error due to probabilistic knowledge of the data. Discussion. The Chinese version of the RT-PCR test had a conspicuous rate of false negative results, likely missing between 15% and 29% of patients with COVID-19. For a patient with a prior probability of COVID-19 greater than 18%, at least two negative test results would be needed to lower the chances of COVID-19 below 5%.

Neutrophilia and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators of inflammation are common finds in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to COVID-19. By its action on leukocytes, we propose colchicine as an intervention worthy of being tested. Objective. To evaluate whether the addition of colchicine to standard treatment for COVID-19 results in better outcomes. Methods. We present the interim analysis of a single-center randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial of colchicine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, with 38 patients allocated 1:1 from April 11 to July 06, 2020. Colchicine regimen was 0.5 mg thrice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 days. The first dose was 1.0 mg whether body weight was [] 80 kg. Endpoints. The primary endpoints were the need for supplemental oxygen; time of hospitalization; need for admission and length of stay in intensive care units; and death rate and causes of mortality. As secondary endpoints, we assessed: serum C-reactive protein, serum Lactate dehydrogenase and relation neutrophil to lymphocyte of peripheral blood samples from day zero to day 7; the number, type, and severity of adverse events; frequency of interruption of the study protocol due to adverse events; and frequency of QT interval above 450 ms. Results. Thirty-five patients (18 for Placebo and 17 for Colchicine) completed the study. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic, clinical and laboratory data at baseline. Median (and interquartile range) time of need for supplemental oxygen was 3.0 (1.5-6.5) days for the Colchicine group and 7.0 (3.0-8.5) days for Placebo group (p = 0.02). Median (IQR) time of hospitalization was 6.0 (4.0-8.5) days for the Colchicine group and 8.5 (5.5-11.0) days for Placebo group (p = 0.03). At day 2, 53% vs 83% of patients maintained the need for supplemental oxygen, while at day 7 the values were 6% vs 39%, in the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). Hospitalization was maintained for 53% vs 78% of patients at day 5 and 6% vs 17% at day 10, for the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). One patient per group needed admission to ICU. No recruited patient died. At day 4, patients of Colchicine group presented significant reduction of serum C-reactive protein compared to baseline (p < 0.001). The majority of adverse events were mild and did not lead to patient withdrawal. Diarrhea was more frequent in the Colchicine group (p = 0.17). Cardiac adverse events were absent. Discussion. The use of colchicine reduced the length of supplemental oxygen therapy and the length of hospitalization. Clinical improvement was in parallel with a reduction on serum levels of C-reactive protein. The drug was safe and well tolerated. Colchicine may be considered a beneficial and not expensive option for COVID-19 treatment.

In order to allow for in-person learning, a fundamental part of medical education, some medical schools grappled with how to safely move students into shared on-campus housing. The authors describe a behavior-based strategy to safely move students from all parts of the United States to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, New York. This strategy included a school-organized phased move-in that included 14-day quarantines for students coming from states with high COVID prevalence;requiring students to sign a COVID-agreement;the use of a phone-based daily COVID risk assessment;and facilitation of safe in-person social activities with peer monitoring of adherence to behavior guidelines. This strategy resulted in no known transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in student housing between July and October of the 2020 to 2021 academic year. The authors share this strategy in the hope that colleagues at other medical schools will find it useful in utilizing similar behavior-based strategies to keep students safe in shared housing.","output":"Moving Medical Students into Shared Housing During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Compound liquorice tablet (CLT) is a herbal compound preparation and is used as a classic antitussive and expectorant in China. It is composed of liquorice extract powder, opioid powder, star anise oil, camphor, and sodium benzoate. The complexity of herbal materials brings a huge challenge in producing compound preparations with stable and uniform quality consistency. OBJECTIVE To establish a new intelligent model for predicting the quality of CLT. METHODS The HPLC fingerprints of raw materials including liquorice extract powder, powdered opium, star anise oil, and sodium benzoate were tested and merged to generate the intelligent mergence fingerprints, whose correlation with the raw materials and the CLT samples was studied. The consistency of the intelligently merged fingerprints with the standard fingerprints was observed by using the systematic quantitative fingerprint method in order to calculate quality evaluation results. RESULTS The intelligent mergence fingerprints covered all the main fingerprint peaks of four raw materials and had a good correlation with the CLT sample fingerprint. There were no significant quality differences either among the six intelligent mergence models obtained by combining different batches of raw materials or between the reference fingerprint of the intelligent mergence connection fingerprints (RFPIMFC ) and the theoretical standard preparation (RFPS ). CONCLUSION The computer-aided model of intelligent mergence fingerprints could be used to predict the quality of herbal compound preparations based on raw materials. In this way, preproduction quality prediction can be realised in order to avoid low-quality medicinal materials and improve the quality consistency among different batches.","output":"Predictive quality control for compound liquorice tablets by the intelligent mergence fingerprint method combined with the systematic quantitative fingerprint method."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mental health of frontline workers is critical to a community's ability to manage crises and disasters. This study assessed risks for mental health problems (traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, insomnia) in association with pandemic-related stressors in a sample of emergency and hospital personnel (N = 571). Respondents completed self-report surveys online from April 1st to May 7th, 2020 in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Results showed that roughly fifteen to thirty percent of respondents screened positive for each disorder. Odds of screening positive were similar between groups for probable acute traumatic stress, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder; emergency personnel reported significantly higher rates of insufficient sleep than healthcare workers. Logistic regressions showed that respondents who reported having an immunocompromised condition had higher odds of acute traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. Having an immunocompromised household member was associated with higher odds of insufficient sleep and anxiety. Being in a direct care provision role was associated with higher odds of screening positive for risky alcohol use. Being in a management role over direct care providers was associated with higher odds of screening positive for anxiety, risky alcohol use, and insufficient sleep. There was an inverse relationship between number of positive COVID-19 cases and anxiety, such that as positive cases went up, anxiety decreased. Overall, the mental health risks that we observed early in the COVID-19 pandemic are elevated above previous viral outbreaks (SARS) and comparable to rates shown in disasters (9/11 attacks; Hurricane Katrina).","output":"Pandemic-related mental health risk among front line personnel."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The utilization rate of herbal and dietary supplements among the Saudi population is reported to be high. However, the utilization rate and types of herbal and dietary supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic are largely unknown. Methods: This was an online questionnaire-based cross-sectional study that used convenience sampling and social media platforms (Telegram(?), Twitter(?), and WhatsApp(?)) to disseminate a 12-item questionnaire across the Saudi general public aged 18 years and above. The questionnaire inquired about the sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education, geographical location), presence of chronic health conditions and the use of prescription medications, awareness of the viral nature of COVID-19 infection and its common symptoms, and the commonly utilized herbal and/or dietary supplements. Results: Sixty-four percent of the 1473 participants reported using herbal and/or dietary supplements for the purpose of boosting their immune system to prevent COVID-19 infection. In addition, 88.2% of the respondents were misinformed about the manifestation of COVID-19 symptoms. Most of the participants were Saudi (91.9%), aged 49 years and younger (83%), female (52%), and healthy (81%). Honey (46%), lemon (45%), ginger (36%), vitamin C (32%), black seed (26%), garlic (26%), and turmeric (19%) were the most commonly used herbal and/or dietary supplements by the participants. Saudi nationals (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.6, p = 0.02), older adults (OR = 1.30, 95% CI:1.10 to 1.55, p = 0.002), and those taking prescription medications had higher odds of using dietary and/or herbal supplements (OR = 3.31, 95% CI: 2.61 to 4.18, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The utilization rate of herbal and dietary supplements among the Saudi public during the COVID-19 pandemic is high.

This study characterized the ocular lesions of FIP including the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and proliferating cell nuclear antigen by Mller cells in the retina in cases of FIP and to what extent macrophages are involved in ocular inflammation in FIP. Immunohistochemistry for FCoV, CD3, CD79a, glial fibrillary acidic protein, calprotectin, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was performed on paraffin sections from 15 naturally occurring cases of FIP and from controls. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression was increased in the retina in cases of FIP. Mller cell proliferation was present within lesions of retinal detachment. Macrophages were present in FIP-associated ocular lesions, but they were the most numerous inflammatory cells only within granulomas (2/15 cats, 13%). In cases of severe inflammation of the ciliary body with damage to blood vessel walls and ciliary epithelium (3/15, 20%), some macrophages expressed FCoV antigens, and immunolabeling for calprotectin on consecutive sections suggested that these FCoV-positive macrophages were likely to be recently derived from blood. In cases of severe and massive inflammation of most ocular structures (4/15, 26%), B cells and plasma cells predominated over T cells and macrophages. These results indicate that gliosis can be present in FIP-affected retinas and suggest that breakdown of the blood-ocular barrier can allow FCoV-bearing macrophages to access the eye.","output":"Feline Infectious Peritonitis: Immunohistochemical Features of Ocular Inflammation and the Distribution of Viral Antigens in Structures of the Eye."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US has experienced a series of epidemics during the past five decades.

Adult zebrafish can regenerate many structures that show limited or no healing capacity in mammals, including the jawbone. To test whether zebrafish can also regenerate damaged joints, we developed a surgical injury model in which the zebrafish jaw joint is destabilized via transection of the major jaw joint ligament, the interopercular-mandibular (IOM). Unilateral transection of the IOM ligament in 1-year-old fish resulted in an initial reduction of jaw joint cartilage by 14 days, with full regeneration of joint cartilage by 28 days. Joint cartilage regeneration involves the re-entry of articular chondrocytes into the cell cycle and the upregulated expression of sox10, a marker of developing chondrocytes in the embryo that becomes restricted to a subset of joint chondrocytes in adults. Genetic ablation of these sox10-expressing chondrocytes shows that they are essential for joint cartilage regeneration. To uncover the potential source of new chondrocytes during joint regeneration, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of the uninjured adult jaw joint and identified multiple skeletal, connective tissue, and fibroblast subtypes. In particular, we uncovered a joint-specific periosteal population expressing coch and grem1a, with the jaw joint chondrocytes marked by grem1a expression during regeneration. Our findings demonstrate the capacity of zebrafish to regenerate adult joint cartilage and identify candidate cell types that can be tested for their roles in regenerative response.","output":"Regeneration of Jaw Joint Cartilage in Adult Zebrafish."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since July 2013, Syrianpresidency, the official Instagram account for the Presidency of the Syrian Arab Republic has featured a high percentage of photos of President Bashar al-Assad and of his wife, Asma.

We examined factors associated with final malignant pathology and evaluated the postoperative course of patients with DA versus pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with DA who underwent PD from 2008 to 2018 and assessed the accuracy rate of preoperative biopsy and factors associated with final malignant pathology. Complications for DA patients were compared with those of matched PDAC patients. RESULTS: Forty-five consecutive patients who underwent PD for DA were identified, and the preoperative biopsy false negative rate was 29. Factors associated with final malignant pathology included age over 70 years, preoperative biliary obstruction, and common bile duct diameter > 8 mm (p < 0.05). Compared with patients with PDAC (n = 302), DA patients experienced more major complications (31% vs. 15%, p < 0.01), more grade C postoperative pancreatic fistulas (9% vs. 1%, p < 0.01), and greater mortality (7% vs. 2%, p < 0.05). Propensity score matched patients with DA had more major complications following PD (32% vs. 12%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative biopsy of duodenal adenomas is associated with a high false-negative rate for malignancy, and PD for DA is associated with higher complication rates than PD for PDAC. These results aid discussion among patients and surgeons who are considering observation versus PD for DA, especially in younger patients without biliary obstruction, who are less likely to harbor malignancy.","output":"Relationship between Cancer Diagnosis and Complications Following Pancreatoduodenectomy for Duodenal Adenoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public compliance with social distancing is key to containing COVID-19, yet there is a lack of knowledge on which communication &lsquo;messages&rsquo;drive compliance Respondents (224 Canadians and Americans) rated combinations of messages about compliance, systematically varied by an experimental design Independent variables were perceived risk;the agent communicating the policy;specific social distancing practices;and methods to enforce compliance Response patterns to each message suggest three mindset segments in each country reflecting how a person thinks Two mindsets, the same in Canada and the US, were &lsquo;tell me exactly what to do,&rsquo;and &lsquo;pandemic onlookers &rsquo;The third was &lsquo;bow to authority&rsquo;in Canada, and &lsquo;tell me how&rsquo;in the US Each mindset showed different messages strongly driving compliance To effectively use messaging about compliance, policy makers may assign any person or group in the population to the appropriate mindset segment by using a Personal Viewpoint Identifier that we developed","output":"Containing COVID-19 by Matching Messages on Social Distancing to Emergent MindsetsThe Case of North America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, a novel virus called COVID-19 has pervasive worldwide, starting from China and moving to all the world to eliminate a lot of persons. Many attempts have been experimented to identify the infection with COVID-19. The X-ray images were one of the attempts to detect the influence of COVID-19 on the infected persons from involving those experiments. According to the X-ray analysis, bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities can be caused by COVID-19 - sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. But unfortunately, the specification or if the person infected with COVID-19 or not is so hard under the X-ray images. X-ray images could be classified using the machine learning techniques to specify if the person infected severely, mild, or not infected. To improve the classification accuracy of the machine learning, the region of interest within the image that contains the features of COVID-19 must be extracted. This problem is called the image segmentation problem (ISP). Many techniques have been proposed to overcome ISP. The most commonly used technique due to its simplicity, speed, and accuracy are threshold-based segmentation. This paper proposes a new hybrid approach based on the thresholding technique to overcome ISP for COVID-19 chest X-ray images by integrating a novel meta-heuristic algorithm known as a slime mould algorithm (SMA) with the whale optimization algorithm to maximize the Kapurs entropy. The performance of integrated SMA has been evaluated on 12 chest X-ray images with threshold levels up to 30 and compared with five algorithms: Lshade algorithm, whale optimization algorithm (WOA), FireFly algorithm (FFA), Harris-hawks algorithm (HHA), salp swarm algorithms (SSA), and the standard SMA. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms SMA under Kapurs entropy for all the metrics used and the standard SMA could perform better than the other algorithms in the comparison under all the metrics.","output":"HSMA_WOA: A hybrid novel Slime mould algorithm with whale optimization algorithm for tackling the image segmentation problem of chest X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has demanded an unprecedented scientific response, with researchers collaborating on a global scale to better understand how host genetics can influence susceptibility to coronavirus infection and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.

The RNA genome is the template for synthesis of additional RNA strands. During replication of RNA viruses, there are at least three types of RNA that must be synthesized: the genome, a copy of the genome (copy genome), and mRNAs. Some RNA viruses also synthesize copies of subgenomic mRNAs. RdRp is the key player for all of these processes. RdRps of all RNA viruses probably arose from a common ancestor. The RdRp and other proteins required for viral genome synthesis are often called the replicase complex. The replicase complex consists of the set of proteins required to produce infectious genomes. In addition to the RdRp, the replicase complex may contain RNA-helicases (to unwind highly base-paired regions of the RNA genome) and NTPases (to supply energy for the polymerization process). The number of proteins in the replicase complex differs among virus families. There may also be a requirement for host cell proteins. The RNA virus group can be subdivided based on the type of RNA that serves as the genome. Positive or plus (+)-strand RNA viruses have genomes that are functional mRNAs. Their genomes are translated shortly after penetration into the host cell to produce the RdRp (and other viral proteins) required for synthesis of additional viral RNAs. Positive-strand RNA viruses often use large complexes of cellular membranes for genome replication. They actively modify host cell membranes to construct viral replication scaffolds. There are three groups of RNA viruses whose genomes are not mRNAs. They are the negative- or minus-strand RNA viruses, the closely related ambisense RNA viruses, and double-stranded RNA viruses. For each of these groups of viruses, the first synthetic event after genome penetration is transcription. This is accomplished by viral proteins (including the RdRp) that enter cell with the genome.","output":"Chapter 10 Introduction to RNA Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to monitor the current situation of confinement in Spanish society motivated by COVID-19 crisis For this, a study of its socio-family, psychological and educational impact is conducted The sample (N = 165 families, 89 1% nuclear families with children living in the same household and 20 5% with a relative in a risk group) comes from the Aragonese region (Spain) The instruments used are: Beck-II Depression Inventory (BDI-II);Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright's Empathy Quotient (EQ) with its cognitive empathy subscale, as well as an ad-hoc questionnaire, reviewed by a panel of experts, to learn about socio-personal, family and housing conditions, use of technology, involvement in school tasks and household, and working condition The multiple regression analysis results show that the anxiety derived from the current situation is explained in 23 1% (p &lt; 0 001) by the variables: gender (t = -2 31, p = 0 022), level of Internet consumption (t = 2 139, p = 0 034), increase of family conflicts (t = 2 980, p = 0 003) and help with school tasks (t = 2 980, p = 0 040) On the other hand, cognitive empathy is explained in 24 6% (p &lt; 0 001) by the variables: gender (t = -4 690, p &lt; 0 001) and mother's hours of teleworking (t = 2 101, p = 0 037) All this leads us to conclusions related to preventive systems of social, psychological, and educational aspects to better serve families These conclusions can be also be transferred to the future with an inclusive care to family settings from those three parameters","output":"Social, Family, and Educational Impacts on Anxiety and Cognitive Empathy Derived From the COVID-19: Study on Families With Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is widely used although its clinical indications are often debated. The aim of this study is to describe our surgical experience in order to establish the safety, efficacy, feasibility of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair and to identify the factors that influence the risk of recurrence in a group of patients treated with only one type of prosthetic mesh and by the same surgical team. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2007 and December 2016, 512 patients were admitted to the General and Urgent Surgery Unit, with diagnosis of ventral hernia. Of these, 244 were operated laparoscopically and 268 in a traditional open surgery. In 244 patients treated by laparoscopy we always used a composite mesh: 185 Parietex? Composite mesh (Medtronic-Covidien, Minneapolis, USA), the remaining other with other types of prosthetic mesh. The type and size of surgical defects, features of surgical technique, length of hospital stay, rate of conversion, morbidity, mortality, and rate of recurrence at 5 years follow-up were retrospective analysed on the 185 patients who underwent surgery with Parietex? Composite mesh. RESULTS We performed 185 laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with Parietex? Composite mesh: 108 (58%) for incisional hernias and 77 (42%) for primary abdominal wall hernias. Mean age was 58 years (19-80). The mean size of abdominal defect was 5 cm (1,5-18), mean BMI was 30,4 kg/m2 (21-47), mean overlap of the mesh was 5 cm (3-6). The mean operative time was 54 min (30-180) and conversion rate was 3,2%. In 61 patients (33%) we performed a transversus abdominis plane block (T.A.P. block) to reduce postoperative pain. The mean length of hospital stay was 5 days (1-26) (2 days, mean value, in patient with preoperative T.A.P. block). The mortality rate was 0%; overall morbidity was 15,6%. At 5-year follow-up we observed 13 (7%) hernia recurrences. The features of patients with recurrence were as follows: mean age 50 years (19-74), mean ASA Score 3 (2-3), mean BMI 31 kg/m2 (21-44), mean size of hernial defect 7,5 cm (larger diameter), mean overlap 4,5 cm (3-6). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic repair of ventral hernia using composite mesh is an effective and safe procedure particularly suitable in the following cases: median and paramedian defects, diameter of defect between 5 and 15 cm, \\"swiss cheese\\" defects, obesity. In our experience the factors related to the patient and the surgical technique that may influence the onset of early or late recurrence as the follows: a defect size >5 cm (W2 of EHS Classification), an overlap of the mesh < 5 cm, a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or superior and the presence of significant comorbidities (ASA score: 3). Finally, we observed that the T.A.P. Block preoperative procedure can lead to reduced the clinical costs through a lower administration of analgesics used and a lower length of stay.","output":"Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with composite mesh: Analysis of risk factors for recurrence in 185 patients with 5 years follow-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The rate of ICU admission among patients with coronavirus varied from 3% to 100% and the mortality was as high as 86% of admitted patients.

We conduct this research via a two-phase design, each of which involves a national consumer panel of U.S. adults (Phase 1 = 840;Phase 2 = 1087) who have participated in shelter-in-place/ stay-at-home ordinances during the national lockdown. Across two phases, we find that perceived isolation leads to compensatory needs and intentions for travel and hospitality consumption. Our study also reveals the dynamics between two-phase models regarding the within and cross-domain compensation pathways and the effect on experiential consumption intentions.

Until widely available vaccines, adherence to preventive behaviours remains the most crucial tool to prevent SARS/COVID-19 virus transmission. Our review focuses on the determinants of adherence behaviours. RECENT FINDINGS: Adherence behaviours include the use of a face mask and protective gloves, personal hygienic behaviours (handwashing or using hand sanitiser), and keeping physical distance and avoiding social gatherings. In almost all studies, males and younger people show less adherence. Risk perception and health beliefs (especially perceived severity of COVID-19 related conditions) can explain the sex and age differences in adherence. Studies covering the impact of mental disorders on adherence are surprisingly missing, with the exception of smoking. SUMMARY: Engaging men and young people in adopting preventive behaviours is crucial in protecting the whole community and specific vulnerable populations. There is a lack of studies investigating preventive behaviours among people living with mental disorders and addiction problems. Furthermore, descriptive and intervention studies are needed to understand and improve the adherence of this population to preventive behaviours.","output":"Who complies with coronavirus disease 2019 precautions and who does not?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 are at risk of deterioration. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) is widely recommended, however it's validity in Covid-19 is not established and indices more specific for respiratory failure may be more appropriate. We aim to describe the physiological antecedents to deterioration, test the predictive validity of NEWS2 and compare this to the ROX index ([SpO(2)/FiO(2)]/respiratory rate). METHOD: A single centre retrospective cohort study of adult patients who were admitted to a medical ward, between 1/3/20 and 30/5/20, with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Physiological observations and the NEWS2 were extracted and analysed. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac arrest, unplanned critical care admission or death within 24 hours. A generalized linear model was used to assess the association of physiological values, NEWS2 and ROX with the outcome. FINDINGS: The primary outcome occurred in 186 patients (26%). In the preceding 24 hours, deterioration was most marked in respiratory parameters, specifically in escalating oxygen requirement; tachypnoea was a late sign, whilst cardiovascular observations remained stable. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.815 (95% CI 0.804C0.826) for NEWS2 and 0.848 (95% CI 0.837C0.858) for ROX. Applying the optimal level of ROX, the majority of patients triggered four hours earlier than with NEWS2 of 5. INTERPRETATION: NEWS2 may under-perform in Covid-19 due to intrinsic limitations of the design and the unique pathophysiology of the disease. A simple index utilising respiratory parameters can outperform NEWS2 in predicting the occurrence of adverse events.","output":"The ROX index has greater predictive validity than NEWS2 for deterioration in Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in patients, causes systemic sequelae, and predisposes patients to long-term cardiovascular disease. To date, studies of the effects of AKI on cardiovascular outcomes have only been performed in male mice. We recently demonstrated that male mice developed diastolic dysfunction, hypertension and reduced cardiac ATP levels versus sham 1 year after AKI. The effects of female sex on long-term cardiac outcomes after AKI are unknown. Therefore, we examined the 1-year cardiorenal outcomes following a single episode of bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in female C57BL/6 mice using a model with similar severity of AKI and performed concomitantly to recently published male cohorts. To match the severity of AKI between male and female mice, females received 34 min of ischemia time compared to 25 min in males. Serial renal function, echocardiograms and blood pressure assessments were performed throughout the 1-year study. Renal histology, and cardiac and plasma metabolomics and mitochondrial function in the heart and kidney were evaluated at 1 year. Measured glomerular filtration rates (GFR) were similar between male and female mice throughout the 1-year study period. One year after AKI, female mice had preserved diastolic function, normal blood pressure, and preserved levels of cardiac ATP. Compared to males, females demonstrated pathway enrichment in arginine metabolism and amino acid related energy production in both the heart and plasma, and glutathione in the plasma. Cardiac mitochondrial respiration in Complex I of the electron transport chain demonstrated improved mitochondrial function in females compared to males, regardless of AKI or sham. This is the first study to examine the long-term cardiac effects of AKI on female mice and indicate that there are important sex-related cardiorenal differences. The role of female sex in cardiovascular outcomes after AKI merits further investigation.","output":"Female and male mice have differential longterm cardiorenal outcomes following a matched degree of ischemia-reperfusion acute kidney injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O objetivo deste estudo  apoiar a gest?o em sade, com informa??es recentes e confiveis, durante a pandemia de COVID-19.

Small studies have suggested inferior outcomes in patients (pts) on active cancer treatment. This finding was not independently validated in our prior report on 928 pts, which included treatments administered within 4 weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis. Here, we examine outcomes related to systemic cancer treatment within one year of lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in an expanded cohort. Method(s): The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) registry (NCT04354701) was queried for pts ever receiving systemic treatment. Treatment type, cancer type, stage, and COVID-19 outcomes were examined. Pts were stratified by time from last treatment administration: <2 wk, 2-4 wk, 1-3 mo, or 3-12 mo. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of mortality by treatment type and timing were calculated. Result(s): As of 31 July 2020, we analyzed 3920 pts;42% received systemic anti-cancer treatment within 12 mo (Table). 159 distinct medications were administered. The highest rate of COVID-19-associated complications were observed in pts treated within 1-3 months prior to COVID-19;all-cause mortality in this group was 26%. 30-day mortality by most recent treatment type was 20% for chemotherapy, 18% for immunotherapy, 17% for chemoradiotherapy, 29% for chemoimmunotherapy, 20% for targeted therapy, and 11% for endocrine therapy. SIR of mortality was highest for chemoimmunotherapy or chemotherapy <2 wks, and lowest for endocrine treatments. A high SIR was also found for targeted agents within 3-12 mo. Pts untreated in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis had a mortality of 14%. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): 30-day mortality was highest amongst cancer pts treated 1-3 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and those treated with chemoimmunotherapy.

RECENT FINDINGS: There is substantial potential for growth in the field of quality improvement in low-resource settings. The extent of quality improvement (QI) research in low-resource settings is limited but expanding. SUMMARY: Patient harm that is attributable to the costs of poor quality is a significant factor in all practice settings but is arguably of greater impact in limited-resource settings. Due to the recognized human, physical, and technological resource limitations in low- and middle-income countries, the delivery of quality healthcare can be variable in many settings, with discrepancies in evidence-based, evidence-informed, and customary care processes. Disparities in training and development of workforce providers exist in addition to limited availability of funding for QI research. Governmental, health ministry, and health system support is also variable. Attention to all of these areas is ultimately necessary to implement affordable and realistic quality improvement initiatives, education, training, and patient safety strategies that can mitigate harms, improve and establish more reliable outcomes, and develop a culture of safety to grow more sustainable and effective workforces and systems.","output":"The Importance of Quality Assurance and Quality Improvement in Low- and Middle-Income Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The author reflects on the need for crisis leadership to resolve the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic successfully Also cited are the positive developments in the fight against the pandemic like the approval of vaccines and use of treatments like monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids and innovative care practices, as well as the need to resolve racism and inequality in society through inspired leadership","output":"Leadership During and After the Pandemic: Starting Over at a New Place"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viruses including Respiratory Syncytial Virus, influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause serious and sometimes fatal disease in thousands of people annually.

This study presents a computational model of virus propagation within the respiratory tract network. The model includes the generation network branch structure of the respiratory tract, biophysical and infectivity properties of the virus, as well as air flow models that aid the circulation of the virus particles. As a proof of principle, the model was applied to SARS-CoV-2 by integrating data about its replication-cycle, as well as the density of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme expressing cells along the respiratory tract network. Using real-world physiological data associated with factors such as the respiratory rate, the immune response and virus load that is inhaled, the model can improve our understanding of the concentration and spatiotemporal dynamics of the virus. We collected experimental data from a number of studies and integrated them with the model in order to show in silico how the virus load propagates along the respiratory network branches.","output":"Virus particle propagation and infectivity along the respiratory tract and a case study for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19, is a new corona virus of the Beta Coronavirus genus which originated in bats The virus first emerged in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread since to other areas worldwide The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore recently declared it as the source of a pandemic The disease caused by the virus manifests in most cases as a lower respiratory tract infection leading to fever, cough and dyspnea, while more severe cases can led to respiratory failure and/or multi organ failure COVID-19 enters the human cell using the ACE2, an enzyme abundant in renal tubular epithelial cells Theoretically, this may be significant in several ways: acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as proteinuria and/or microhematuria could be associated with the penetration of COVID-19 into the cells Moreover, medications based on RAAS inhibition, such and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, upregulate the enzyme ACE2 and could therefore hypothetically explain the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reported as previous diagnoses in severe cases In the setting of chronic kidney disease, the risk of infection with COVID-19 is not clear at this time However, hemodialysis patients represent a unique group of patients, mostly elderly and immunocompromised, for whom dialysis is a life-saving treatment which cannot be stopped Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex medical and logistic challenge for the medical staff in hospital and community based dialysis units","output":"[covid-19, the Kidney and Hypertension]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has put child wellbeing at risk, perhaps especially, for children and youth involved in the foster care system.

This study reports on the rapid development and implementation of an eLearning and structured practice guide for visitation supervisors to help them facilitate virtual visits that promote parent-caregiver collaboration in support of the child. Over a four month period, April to August 2020, 140 people registered for the Supportive Virtual Family Time training.

Overall, participants were satisfied with the training content and delivery, agreed the training helped them develop new skills for interacting with parents and caregivers, and planned to start using the model right away. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the pandemic, there is likely continued need for virtual family time and training and support for supervisors who facilitate these interactions.

It stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, which affects the lungs. The process of replication and progression of the COVID-19 virus causes the formation of an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Many studies have been carried out that have demonstrated that hydrogen has strong anti-inflammatory properties. It reduces hypotension and other symptoms by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxygen mixture, enriched with Hydrogen, - helps to reduce the resistance of the respiratory tract and frees up access to the pulmonary alveolus, which improves the penetration of oxygen into the lungs. Since hydrogen is an antioxidant, it helps to reduce the burden on the immune system, helps to maintain the body's health and its ability to quickly recover. When electrolysers are used to produce an oxygen-hydrogen mixture, alkaline mist and other impurities can enter the patient's lungs and cause poisoning and chemical burns. For this reason, the use of atomic hydrogen obtained from metal hydride sources for ventilation of the lungs will be more effective for treating COVID-19 than a molecular hydrogen-oxygen mixture from an electrolyzer. A functional diagram of a metal hydride source of atomic hydrogen to an artificial lung ventilator is shown.

Comprehensive admission screening and diagnostic tests are important in enabling hospitalists to reliably identify patients with AECOPD, the severity of the episode, and related issues that may prolong patients' hospital length of stay. Recurring exacerbations, especially those that require repeated acute care, can reduce physical activity and accelerate pulmonary decline and risk of death. Recommended pharmacotherapies for AECOPD should include short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and appropriate antibiotics in cases of suspected bacterial infection. Patients with demonstrable hypoxemia or respiratory failure may benefit from oxygen and/or ventilatory support. Long-term disease management with the goal of preventing future exacerbations should include ongoing emphasis toward smoking cessation and up-to-date vaccination, in addition to prescribing maintenance pharmacotherapies in accordance with respiratory treatment guidelines. Additional benefits may be derived from nonpharmacologic therapies, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, weight-loss recommendations, and treatment of obstructive sleep dyspnea when present. Effective communication among members of the inpatient and outpatient health care teams, the patient, and his or her caregivers is an important aspect of care transitions. Hospital discharge summaries should be transmitted to the patient's primary care physician and be readily available at the first follow-up visit. Discharge coaches and other allied health care providers can aid hospitalists in reinforcing self-management skills and patient education, and in emphasizing the importance of follow-up visits.

Cancer cachexia is one of the life-threatening consequences that occurs commonly in patients with cancer, and severely worsens patient survival, prognosis and quality of life. Previous studies have demonstrated that cancer cachexia is closely related to differential metabolites and metabolic pathways based on metabolomics analysis. This scoping review protocol, therefore, aims to provide the strategy for a formal scoping review that will summarise the differential metabolites and related metabolic pathways of cachexia in patients with cancer. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The proposed scoping review will follow the Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework, Levac et al's recommendations for applying this framework, and Peters' enhancements of the framework. The key information from the selected studies will be extracted, including author, year of publication, cachexia definition, country/origin, study design, setting, population and sample size, biological specimens, independent variables, independent variables' measure and statistical analysis. A summary of metabolites will be divided into several sections depending on the biological specimen. Differential metabolites will be compared between paired groups, and the number and names of related metabolic pathways will be counted and described. The reporting of this scoping review will be in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist.

Although no randomized controlled clinical trials have compared the efficacy of interferon (IFN) and NA, we suggest IFN treatment for pediatric patients (IFN- in patients 1 year; pegIFN- in patients 3 years) considering treatment duration and absence of resistance. Novel NAs have brought about promising treatment options involving high efficacy viral suppression and low resistance rates. NAs with a high barrier to resistance (e.g. entecavir) are recommended as first-line therapy of HBV-GN.

This inspires other green zones to consider a more adaptive approach to the ongoing pandemic crisis. However, little is known about the pandemic crisis management and tourism destination recovery. Therefore, this study selected Can Tho city as a case study to explore how a tourism destination as a green zone can recover during pandemic waves. Different methods were utilized in this study, including document analysis, field observation, and semi-structured interview. The findings generally indicate that a green zone could recover their tourism business under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings highlight the critical relationship among key stakeholders and the leading role of the central government toward pandemic prevention and control. The early response to the crisis from the local governments was found to be decisive, and the policy-related measures facilitated the removal of potential barriers and alleviated the crisis consequences. In addition, the involvement of the tourism industry in an adaptive way has contributed to the quick recovery of the green zones' tourism business. Importantly, the adaptive transformation from the tourism enterprises in a visionary way was found to be essential to the empowerment of their organizational resilience during the pandemic crisis. The lessons learnt from this study also bring valuable experiences for other tourism destinations and elicit a new approach to co-living with the ongoing pandemic in a sustainable way. Theoretically, this study provides a better understanding of tourism management and destination recovery during the global pandemic crisis.

We then validate our results against traditional health care-based disease surveillance data. METHODS: Cumulative reported case counts of Zika virus disease in Colombia were acquired via the HealthMap digital disease surveillance system. Linear smoothing was conducted to adjust the shape of the HealthMap cumulative case curve using Google search data. Traditional surveillance data on Zika virus disease were obtained from weekly Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) epidemiological bulletin publications. The Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model was used to estimate R(0) and R(obs) for both data sources. RESULTS: Using the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data, we estimated a mean R(0) of 2.56 (range 1.42-3.83) and a mean R(obs) of 1.80 (range 1.42-2.30). The traditional (INS) data yielded a mean R(0) of 4.82 (range 2.34-8.32) and a mean R(obs) of 2.34 (range 1.60-3.31). CONCLUSIONS: Although modeling using the traditional (INS) data yielded higher R(0) estimates than the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data, modeled ranges for R(obs) were comparable across both data sources. As a result, the narrow range of possible case projections generated by the traditional (INS) data was largely encompassed by the wider range produced by the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data. Thus, in the absence of traditional surveillance data, digital surveillance data can yield similar estimates for key transmission parameters and should be utilized in other Zika virus-affected countries to assess outbreak dynamics in near real time.","output":"Utilizing Nontraditional Data Sources for Near Real-Time Estimation of Transmission Dynamics During the 2015-2016 Colombian Zika Virus Disease Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogenic novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a recently rising infection that causes a high death rate in contaminated individuals.

The strategy encompasses patient-facing resources, professional education, and organisational approaches to embed supported self-management. This paper reports the development of a theoretically informed interprofessional education programme which aims to raise awareness of and enable healthcare professionals to deliver effective supported self-management. METHODS: Aligned with the Medical Research Council (MRC) Complex Intervention Framework, the multidisciplinary team developed educational content in three phases: (1) developmental phase, identifying educational and behaviour change theory to guide development, in consultation with a professional advisory group; (2) feasibility pilot phase, testing the education using a think-aloud method; and (3) pre-pilot phase, delivering the education within the IMP(2)ART strategy. RESULTS: The developmental phase identified educational and behaviour change theory and the need to provide two education modules: (1) a team module to raise awareness of supported asthma self-management for the whole team and (2) an individual study module for those who conduct asthma reviews with patients. The feasibility pilot highlighted content and design features in need of refinement and the pre-pilot identified substantial changes to the delivery strategy for the education modules. CONCLUSIONS: A multi-stage development process, aligned with the MRC Framework, contributed to the module design and delivery. Prior explorative work, multi-disciplinary team discussions, and professional advisory group consultation, informed the initial development, and in-practice testing and pre-pilot stages enabled refinement. In our experience, there were important benefits of working together as an educationalist/researcher team.

Last two decades different parts of the word experienced smaller or bigger outbreak related to human-coronaviruses. The spike-glycoproteins of the COVID-19 (similar to SARS-CoV) attach to the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE-2) and transit over a stabilized open-state for the viral-internalization to the host-cells and propagate with great efficacy. Higher rate of mutability makes this virus unpredictable/less-sensitive to the protein/nucleic-acid based-drugs. In this emergent situation, drug-induced destabilization of spike-binding to RBD could be a good strategy. In the current study we demonstrated by Bioinformatics (CASTp: Computed-Atlas-of-Surface-Topography, PyMol: molecular-visualization) and Molecular docking (PatchDock) experiments that tea flavonoids catechin-products mainly EGCG or other like theaflavin gallate demonstrated higher Atomic Contact Energy (ACE), surface area and more amino-acid interactions than hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during binding in the central channel of the spike-protein. Moreover, out of three distinct binding-sites (I, II and III) of spike core when HCQ binds only with site III (farthest from the vCoV-RBD of ACE2 contact), EGCG and TG bind all three sites.

METHODS: The authors conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. All searches were limited to English-language articles. The quality of each study was appraised using criteria developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine for randomized controlled trials.

Two separate screeners (AG and SAF) evaluated the titles, abstracts, and full text of the eligible articles. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Across all studies, benzodiazepines were associated with decreased anxiety at the end of the study period. The limited tolerability data show mild adverse effects from the benzodiazepines studied. Limitations of the trials included limited data on the long-term use of benzodiazepines for anxiety and a preponderance of trials examining generalized anxiety disorder, with relatively less data on other anxiety disorders.

We focused on potential associations between post-vaccination changes of antibody titers and the severity of long COVID symptoms and factors influencing the state of remission observed in patients with long COVID after vaccination. Methods: The severity of long COVID symptoms and serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-Ig) and nucleocapsid (NC-Ig) levels were assessed in 107 post-COVID subjects at two time points: at baseline, and 17C24 weeks later. Besides, vaccination status was also assessed. Symptoms were evaluated based on the Chalder fatigue scale (CFQ-11) and visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: Serum level of S-Ig and NC-Ig at baseline were significantly higher in the patients with non-severe fatigue than those with severe fatigue, and this difference remained significant at follow-up in the case of NC-Ig. NC-Ig level above median was as an independent predictor for complete remission at follow-up. The difference in NC-Ig levels in subgroup analyses (severe fatigue vs. non-severe fatigue; complete remission vs. incomplete remission or progression) was found to be significant only in patients who received vaccination.

In this paper, two neuropilin-1 (NRP) targeted peptides, CRPPR and ATWLPPR, were conjugated onto the surface of lipid microbubbles (MBs) to evaluate molecular imaging of tumor angiogenesis in a breast cancer model. Development of a molecular imaging agent using CRPPR has particular importance due to the previously demonstrated internalizing capability of this and similar ligands. In vitro, CRPPR MBs bound to an NRP-expressing cell line 2.6 and 15.6 times more than ATWLPPR MBs and non-targeted (NT) MBs, respectively, and the binding was inhibited by pretreating the cells with an NRP antibody. In vivo, the backscattered intensity within the tumor, relative to nearby vasculature, increased over time during the 6 min circulation of the CRPPR-targeted contrast agents providing high contrast images of angiogenic tumors. Approximately 67% of the initial signal from CRPPR MBs remained bound after the majority of circulating MBs had cleared (8 min), 8 and 4.5 times greater than ATWLPPR and NT MBs, respectively. Finally, at 7-21 days after the first injection, we found that CRPPR MBs cleared faster from circulation and tumor accumulation was reduced likely due to a complement-mediated recognition of the targeted microbubble and a decrease in angiogenic vasculature, respectively. In summary, we find that CRPPR MBs specifically bind to NRP-expressing cells and provide an effective new agent for molecular imaging of angiogenesis.","output":"Ultrasound molecular imaging of tumor angiogenesis with a neuropilin-1-targeted microbubble."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19 are wide-spread and have even been propagated by highly ranked state officials and politicians in the U.S. Health authorities have cautioned that such theories, although not questioning the existence of the pandemic, may increase the spread of the virus by reducing peoples efforts to socially distance.

To expand these advantages with those from automation will only drive such enabling technologies further into the faster producing, more efficient 21(st) century chemical world. In this report we present several examples of algorithmic chemical search, along with flow platforms that link hardware and digital chemical operations on software. This enables organic syntheses to be automatically carried out and optimised with as little human intervention as possible. By applying such enabling technologies to the production of small organic molecules and pharmaceutical compounds in end-to-end multistep processes, a range of reaction types can be accessed and, thus, the flexibility of these single, compact flow designs may be revealed. Automated systems can allow several reactions to take place on the same setup, enabling direct comparison of reactions under different conditions. Moreover, the production of new and known target compounds can be made faster and more efficient, the recipes of which can then be stored as digital files. Some of the automating software has employed machine-powered learning to assist the chemist in developing intelligent algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) driven synthetic route planning. This ultimately produces a continuous flow platform that can design its own viable pathway to a particular molecule and then carry it out on its own, allowing the chemists, at the same time, to apply their expertise to other pressing challenges in their fields.","output":"Digitising chemical synthesis in automated and robotic flow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Using data from the monthly Current Population Survey, this paper provides monthly employment and unemployment statistics for people with and without disabilities in the United States before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic to date (January 2021). DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of the Current Population Survey. SETTING: The United States. PARTICIPANTS: People with and without disabilities ages 16-64 years. INTERVENTION: N/A MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage employed, percentage unemployed, percentage not in labor force, percentage on temporary layoff, percentage looking for work. RESULTS: Estimates show that, like workers without disabilities, workers with disabilities experienced increases in unemployment at the beginning of the pandemic but continued to remain engaged in the labor force. Our analysis finds that employment rates dropped from 74.8% to 63.2% for those without disabilities and from 31.1% to 26.4% for those with disabilities between February 2020 and April 2020 but gradually improved in the succeeding months.

It is true that the COVID-19 pandemic makes the feebleness of these approaches, which ignore the spatial aspect, patently clear, but this does not make it any less relevant to examine their theoretical setup, which we will do based on a critical review of the specialized literature and testimonies of specialists collected in a research project on segregation in three Chilean cities that we recently finished We conclude these pages in the need to reinforce empirical research of the city and segregation, just as our attention to their subjective dimensions ? 2020 Universidad del B?-o B?-o All rights reserved","output":"City and segregation shaken by capitalism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid identification of COVID-19 cases, which is crucial to outbreak containment efforts, is challenging due to the lack of pathognomonic symptoms and in settings with limited capacity for specialized nucleic acid-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7-98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening center and tertiary care hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from 26 January to 16 February 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike's information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristic curves, adjusting for overconfidence using leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years, and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (models 1, 2, and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively. In comparison, model 4 had an AUC of 0.65. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly ascertainable clinical and laboratory data could identify individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and enable prioritization of PCR testing and containment efforts.

This study aimed to determine whether puerarin could alleviate intestinal injury in piglets infected with PEDV. A PEDV (Yunnan province strain) infection model was applied to 7-day-old piglets at 10(4.5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose). Piglets were orally administered with puerarin at the dosage of 0.5 mg/kg body weight from day 5 to day 9. On day 9 of the trial, piglets were inoculated orally with PEDV. Three days later, jugular vein blood and intestinal samples were collected. Results showed puerarin reduced morbidity of piglets infected with PEDV. In addition, puerarin reduced the activities of aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, the ratio of serum aspartate aminotransferase to serum alanine aminotransferase, the number of white blood cells and neutrophils, and the plasma concentrations of interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-, as well as protein abundances of heat shock protein-70 in PEDV-infected piglets. Moreover, puerarin increased D-xylose concentration but decreased intestinal fatty acid-binding protein concentration and diamine oxidase activity in the plasma of piglets infected with PEDV. Puerarin increased the activities of total superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, while decreasing the activities of myeloperoxidase and concentration of hydrogen peroxide in both the intestine and plasma of PEDV-infected piglets. Puerarin decreased mRNA levels of glutathione S-transferase omega 2 but increased the levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. Furthermore, puerarin increased the abundance of total eubacteria (16S rRNA), Enterococcus genus, Lactobacillus genus and Enterobacteriaceae family in the intestine, but reduced the abundance of Clostridium coccoides in the caecum. These data indicate puerarin improved intestinal function in piglets infected by PEDV and may be a promising supplement for the prevention of PEDV infection.","output":"Puerarin enhances intestinal function in piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through the analysis of cultural, socioeconomic and academic performance aspects it is possible to map the profile of the students and their motivations to drop out.

Critical Care Medicine ? General and Internal Medicine ? Pathology OBJECTIVE: Rare disease BACKGROUND: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a cardiac syndrome characterized by transient left ventricle (LV) dysfunction, typically showing apical ballooning due to apical akinesis with preserved basal segment contractility. The inverted form is very uncommon and is characterized by basal segment hypokinesis or akinesis and normal LV apical segment contractility. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 49-year-old woman who developed inverted TTC after orthotopic liver transplantation. On day 1 (D1), dyspnea and oliguria suddenly appeared. A chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, and echocardiography showed severe systolic LV dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction of approximately 25% and akinesis of basal and midventricular LV segments, normal apical segment contractility, and mild mitral regurgitation. Elevated troponin T, creatine kinase-MB, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide were found in the blood sample. Suspected inverted takotsubo cardiomyopathy was confirmed by left ventriculography, with normal apical part motion, akinesis in the other LV parts, and negative coronary angiography. The echocardiographic findings returned to normal on D14, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on D19 with normal LV motion and an ejection fraction of 65%. The transplanted liver function was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Organ transplantation is connected with a great emotional stress because the patients life depends on the death of another person. Therefore, we have to think about the possibility of stress cardiomyopathy even after liver transplantation, because early diagnosis and treatment can be life-saving for the patient. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of inverted takotsubo cardiomyopathy after liver transplantation.","output":"Inverted Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy as an Early Complication After Liver Transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, average wholesale electricity prices in the United States fell to $21/MWh, their lowest level since the beginning of the 21st century. Low natural gas prices and the proliferation of low marginal cost resources like wind and solar had already established a trend toward lower wholesale prices, and this trend was exacerbated by declining electricity demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Negative real-time hourly wholesale prices occurred in about 4% of all hours and wholesale market nodes across the United States, but these were not distributed evenly. Regional clusters emerged, for example, in the Permian Basin in western Texas, and in Kansas and western Oklahoma in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), negative prices accounted for more than 25% of all hours. Negative electricity prices result either from local congestion of the transmission system leading supply to exceed demand locally or due to system-wide oversupply. Looking at the latter condition in SPP, we find that all major generator types contribute to this excess supply, because of limited ramping flexibility or self-scheduled out-of-market unit commitments. Additional monetary production incentives such as renewable energy credits or tax credits also enable negative bids;indeed, negative prices predominantly occur when demand levels are low and wind production levels are high. Frequent negative prices can inform the value of additional renewable energy investments at specific locations, the need for transmission and storage development, and opportunities load growth or adaptation.","output":"Plentiful electricity turns wholesale prices negative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Republic of Croatia initiated in 2015 a pilot project named e-School that included, among its aims, the development of a model of digitally mature schools, so that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have a relevant place at all educational levels and are incorporated into the curriculum with a view to improve the technological skills of both teachers and students alike. The implementation of this experimental project, which has been given the title of School for Life, is expected to be carried out this very year, 2020. Given the current situation that many education systems find themselves in as a result of the COVID19 pandemic, the project has proven to be a particularly timely and significant reform. However, classrooms and educational centres, that have normally been the witnesses of such transformations, have been replaced by a completely different scenario: i. e the home and family environment. It is in this new context in which many of the proposals the reform was created and promoted with must be applied today. Among its challenges was developing a comprehensive change in relation to teaching methods, with an increased emphasis to be placed on technological resources. Nowadays, computers and tablets, together with other technological resources, have become the primary means for its application. Facing this reality, the Croatian Ministry of Science and Education has published several reports in which they present guidelines, specific rules and diverse patterns that may be followed by teachers, headmasters, families and also students, in order to achieve an effective online learning model. Considering both circumstances, a running reform and the need of establishing a new virtual education model due to unexpected circumstances, we analyse in this article reports published by the Croatian government outlining the facilitation of this transition in which the value of the technological resources with regard to curricular reform has been shown.","output":"E-learning in 15 days.

It is based on the results of the research project Changing gender relations through digital transformation (Hans B?ckler Foundation). Various effects have been observed: For example, mobile working and home office enable part-time workers to increase their contractual working hours; flexible digital work provides emotional and time relief in the event of spontaneous emergencies such as child illness; however, the extent of invisible and unpaid overtime is also increasing. In most cases, this does not lead to a reorganisation or redistribution of unpaid domestic and care work. Nevertheless, there are signs of shifts in the domestic division of labour. This article presents the central results of the project and discusses them with regard to their implications for gender inequality. Practical Relevance: The text provides information on current experiences with flexible working times and places from a gender perspective. It provides indications of conducive and obstructive conditions for reducing inequalities in the responsibility for care work and in domestic division of labour. The results can be used for the design of conditions and regulations for flexible work in terms of time and place in companies.","output":"Orts- und zeitflexibles Arbeiten: Alte Geschlechterungleichheiten und neue Muster der Arbeitsteilung durch Digitalisierung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism is a frequent complication in immobile patients with acute ischemic stroke. This guideline document presents the European Stroke Organisation guidelines for the prophylaxis of VTE in immobile patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Guidelines for haemorrhagic stroke have already been published. Methods A multidisciplinary group identified related questions and developed its recommendations based on evidence from randomised controlled trials using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. This guideline document was reviewed within the European Stroke Organisation and externally and was approved by the European Stroke Organisation Guidelines Committee and the European Stroke Organisation Executive Committee. Results We found mainly moderate quality evidence comprising randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews evaluating graduated compression stockings (GCS), intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and prophylactic anticoagulation with unfractionated (UFH) and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) and heparinoids, but no randomised trials evaluating neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NES). We recommend that clinicians should use IPC in immobile patients, but that they should not use GCS. Prophylactic anticoagulation with UFH (5000U 2, or 3 daily) or LMWH or heparinoid should be considered in immobile patients with ischaemic stroke in whom the benefits of reducing the risk of VTE is high enough to offset the increased risks of intracranial and extracranial bleeding associated with their use. Where a judgement has been made that prophylactic anticoagulation is indicated LMWH or heparinoid should be considered instead of UFH because of its greater reduction in risk of DVT, the greater convenience, reduced staff costs and patient comfort associated single vs. multiple daily injections but these advantages should be weighed against the higher risk of extracranial bleeding, higher drug costs and risks in elderly patients with poor renal function associated with LMWH and heparinoids. Conclusions IPC, UFH or LMWH and heparinoids can reduce the risk of VTE in immobile patients with acute ischaemic stroke but further research is required to test whether NES is effective. The strongest evidence is for IPC. Better methods are needed to help stratify patients in the first few weeks after stroke onset, by their risk of VTE and their risk of bleeding on anticoagulants.","output":"European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines for prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in immobile patients with acute ischaemic stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has emerged as a global public health emergency, which is characterized by high infection rate and fatal course.

There are still some challenges in the transfer and imaging of fingerprints and the extraction of residues. Here, a facile approach was successfully developed for transferring and recovering the pattern of fingerprints, which is based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and an adhesive Au nanofilm (ANF). The reproducibility of SERS effects and the adhesive quality of the ANF enabled the transfer, recovery of the pattern and extraction of chemical residues from living/latent fingerprints. The results demonstrated that the pattern of living fingerprints, including ridges, furrows and sweat pores, was recovered on the basis of SERS mapping of the vibrational band of amino acids from endogenous protein substances. The dye rhodamine 6G (R6G) was employed as a developing agent to enhance the visualization of fingerprints by SERS mapping of the band at 1360 cm-1. Moreover, exogenous residues, such as cotinine (COT) and methylene blue (MB), were also detected by SERS. Their distribution in fingerprints was also determined, although it was not associated with the pattern of fingerprints. This indicated that the extraction process based on the adhesive ANF could be applied to transfer fingerprints from a crime scene to the laboratory for precise identification via structural information on chemical residues and the pattern image of fingerprints. It is anticipated that the adhesive ANF when combined with an ultrahigh-sensitivity SERS technique could be developed as a promising tool for the visualization of fingerprints and monitoring of trace chemical residues for crime tracking in forensic science.","output":"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic identification in fingerprints based on adhesive Au nanofilm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become one of the most popular surgical weight loss options. Since its inception as a procedure intended to promote durable weight loss, the association between LSG and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been a point of debate. First and foremost, it is known that GERD occurs more frequently in the obese population. With the sleeve gastrectomy growing to be the predominant primary bariatric operation in the United States, it is imperative that we understand the impact of LSG on GERD. OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of LSG on GERD symptoms. METHODS One hundred and ninety-one bariatric surgery candidates completed a Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaire before and after undergoing elective LSG (mean follow-up time of 20.4  2.7 months). Values were stratified by the presence or absence of preoperative GERD, GERD medications, age, gender, crural repair, patient satisfaction with present condition, and percent total weight loss (%TWL). RESULTS For the entire group, mean weight loss, %TWL, and reduction in BMI were 79 pounds, 28.1%, and 12.7 kg/m2 respectively. Within the overall cohort, there was no significant change in GERD symptoms from before to after surgery (mean GERD-HRQL scores were 6.1 before and after surgery, p = 0.981). However, in a subgroup analysis, patients without GERD preoperatively demonstrated a worsening in mean GERD-HRQL scores after surgery (from 2.4 to 4.5, p = 0.0020). The percentage of change in the usage of medications to treat GERD was not statistically significant (from 37 to 32%, p = 0.233). The percent of patients satisfied with their condition postoperatively was significantly increased in those with preoperative GERD, older age, crural repair intraoperatively, and in those with the highest %TWL. CONCLUSION These results suggest that while overall LSG does not significantly affect GERD symptoms, patients without GERD preoperatively may be at risk for developing new or worsening GERD symptoms after surgery. It is important to remark that this is a review of the patient's clinical symptoms of GERD, not related to any endoscopic, pathological, or manometry studies. Such studies are necessary to fully establish the effect of LSG on esophageal health.","output":"The Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown measures to control the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) sharply limited energy consumption and carbon emissions. The lockdown effect on carbon emissions has been studied by many researchers using statistical approaches. However, the lockdown effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on an urban scale remains unclear. Here we present CO2 concentration and carbon isotopic (?13C) measurements to assess the impact of COVID-19 control measures on atmospheric CO2 in Xi'an, China. We find that CO2 concentrations during the lockdown period were 7.5% lower than during the normal period (prior to the Spring Festival, Jan 25 to Feb 4, 2020). The observed CO2excess (total CO2 minus background CO2) during the lockdown period was 52.3% lower than that during the normal period, and 35.7% lower than the estimated CO2excess with the effect of weather removed. A Keeling plot shows that in contrast CO2 concentrations and ?13C were weakly correlated (R2 = 0.18) during the lockdown period, reflecting a change in CO2 sources imposed by the curtailment of traffic and industrial emissions. Our study also show that the sharp reduction in atmospheric CO2 during lockdown were short-lived, and returned to normal levels within months after lockdown measures were lifted.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on atmospheric CO2 in Xi'an, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to determine trends in research on educational technology carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia.

This variation is derived from discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis where the polymerase switches template from a 3 proximal genome body sequence to a 5 untranslated leader sequence. This leads to a fusion between the common 5 leader sequence and a 3 proximal body sequence in the RNA product. This process revolves around a common core sequence (CS) that is present at both the template sites that make up the fusion junction. Base-pairing between the leader CS and the nascent complementary minus strand body CS, and flanking regions (together called the transcription regulating sequence, TRS) is vital for this template switching event.

Here, we model the duplexes formed between the leader and complementary body TRS regions, hypothesising the role of the stability of the TRS duplex in determining the major sites of template switching for the most abundant mRNAs. We indicate that the stability of secondary structures and the speed of transcription play key roles in determining the probability of template switching in the production of subgenomic RNAs.","output":"Duplex formation between the template and the nascent strand in the transcription-regulating sequences determines the site of template switching in SARS C CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI) published several guidelines addressing the medical health services helping to detect SARS CoV-2. Needing an available and specific test strategy regarding SARS-CoV-2, our own test strategy strictly followed these testing criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a retrospective analysis, we verified if such a test strategy was an effective tool in the context of infection prevention control and as reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection. Therefore, we analysed our own test results of suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases between 26 February and 6 April 2020. Additionally, we used a geovisualisation tool to visualise test frequencies and positive test results within different districts of Mannheim based on people's addresses. RESULTS: There were on average 7% positive test results of SARS-CoV-2 within a population with typical symptoms of COVID-19 (na?= 2808). There was no positive test result within an asymptomatic population (na?= 448). However, one positive test result turned out to be a nosocomial infection. Finally, geovisualisation highlighted a shift of test frequencies and local positive rates for SARS-CoV-2 from one district of Mannheim to another. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our test strategy strictly based on testing criteria suggested by the Robert Koch Institute resulted in a steady rate of positive tests and allowed us to increase test capacity without causing numbers of nosocomial infections of COVID-19. Geovisualisation tools can offer support in analysing an ongoing spread of transmissible diseases. In the future, they could be used as helpful tools for infection prevention control, for example in the context of vaccination programs.","output":"[Evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 test strategy in a southwestern university hospital at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic]./ Evaluation einer SARS-CoV-2-Teststrategie zu Beginn der COVID-19-Pandemie in einem sdwestdeutschen Universit?tsklinikum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has had a devastating effect on the health and economy of much of human civilization.

This patent review aims to provide an overview of the patents that present possible treatments for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.Areas covered: To treat SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, researchers have filed patents for a number of therapeutic agents. Most of the treatments found were protease inhibitors aimed at proteases such as PLpro, 3CLpro, RNA helicase, and Spike protein, or used monoclonal antibodies and interferons. In addition, the use of Chinese folk medicine and its multitude of medicinal plants with strong antiviral properties was reinforced. Thus, these therapies used in previous epidemics can serve as an aid in the new pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 and be a starting point for new treatments.Expert opinion: The various antiviral alternatives presented in this review offer therapeutic options to fight coronavirus infections.

Flaviviridae members, including hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses, extensively manipulate host lipid metabolism, underlining the importance of lipid droplets (LDs) in viral infection. LDs are dynamic cytoplasmic organelles that can act as sequestration platforms for a unique subset of host and viral proteins. Transient recruitment and mobilization of proteins to LDs during viral infection impacts host-cell biological properties, LD functionality and canonical protein functions. Notably, recent studies identified LDs in the nucleus and also identified that LDs are transported extracellularly via an autophagy-mediated mechanism, indicating a novel role for autophagy in Flaviviridae infections. These developments underline an unsuspected diversity and localization of LDs and potential moonlighting functions of LD-associated proteins during infection. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs concerning the LD hijacking activities of hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses and potential roles of cytoplasmic, nuclear and extracellular LD-associated viral proteins during infection.","output":"Hijacking of Lipid Droplets by Hepatitis C, Dengue and Zika VirusesFrom Viral Protein Moonlighting to Extracellular Release"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic is currently underway.

Given their toxicities, demonstrating non-inferiority of rituximab to tacrolimus may enable choice between these medications. METHODS: This investigator-initiated, single-center, open-label, pilot randomized controlled trial examined the non-inferiority of two doses of intravenous (IV) rituximab given one-week apart to oral therapy with tacrolimus (1:1 allocation), in maintaining sustained remission over 12 months follow-up, in patients with difficult-to-treat steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, defined as frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent disease that had failed  2 steroid-sparing strategies. Secondary outcomes included frequency of relapses, proportion with frequent relapses, time to relapse and frequent relapses, and adverse events (CTRI/2018/11/016342). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable for 41 patients randomized to receive rituximab (n = 21) or tacrolimus (n = 20). While 55% of patients in each limb were in sustained remission at 1 year, non-inferiority of rituximab to tacrolimus was not demonstrated (mean difference 0%; 95% CI C 30.8%, 30.8%; non-inferiority limit C 20%; P = 0.50). Frequent relapses were more common in patients administered rituximab compared to tacrolimus (risk difference 30%, 95% CI 7.0, 53.0, P = 0.023). Both groups showed similar reductions in relapse rates and prednisolone use. Common adverse events were infusion-related with rituximab and gastrointestinal symptoms with tacrolimus. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with rituximab was not shown to be non-inferior to 12-months treatment with tacrolimus in maintaining remission in patients with difficult-to-treat steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Frequent relapses were more common with rituximab. While effective, both agents require close monitoring for adverse events.

A less recognised attribute of plant-associated beneficial microorganisms is their ability to stimulate the plant immune system, which may provide long-term, systemic self-protection against different types of pathogens. By using conventional antifungal in vitro screening coupled with in planta assays, we found antifungal and non-antifungal Bacillus strains that protected the ornamental plant Kalanchoe against the soil-borne pathogen Fusarium oxysporum in experimental and commercial production settings. Further examination of one antifungal and one non-antifungal strain indicated that high protection efficacy in planta did not correlate with antifungal activity in vitro. Whole-genome sequencing showed that the non-antifungal strain EC9 lacked the biosynthetic gene clusters associated with typical antimicrobial compounds. Instead, this bacterium triggers the expression of marker genes for the jasmonic and salicylic acid defence pathways, but only after pathogen challenge, indicating that this strain may protect Kalanchoe plants by priming immunity.

METHODS: We used national heart failure audit data to identify 36,974 adults who had a hospital admission with a primary diagnosis of heart failure between February and May in either 2018, 2019 or 2020. RESULTS: Hospital admissions for heart failure in 2018/19 averaged 160/day but were much lower in 2020, reaching a nadir of 64/day on 27(th) March-2020 (incidence rate ratio:0.40, 95% CI:0.38-0.42). The proportion discharged on guideline-recommended pharmacotherapies was similar in 2018/19 compared to the same period in 2020.

With public health organisations contesting the possible benefits of e-cigarettes, research is required to explore young adults use of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation and recreational tool. This study examined existing qualitative data to understand how transition into adulthood and issues of identity affect young adults perceptions and experiences of e-cigarette use. METHODS: A meta-ethnography was conducted to examine how young adults perceive and use e-cigarettes. Data were synthesised using Noblit and Hares (1988) meta-ethnographic approach. Bronfenbrenners socio-ecological model (1979) was used to conceptualise themes and map findings. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies were included in the review. Young adults viewed e-cigarettes as a safer alternative to traditional cigarette smoking and perceived e-cigarettes as an effective cessation tool. Users were able to personalise their e-cigarette use due to the variety of flavours and devices available. E-cigarettes were found to be a sociable tool as they allowed users to align themselves with their peers who used e-cigarettes and facilitated use within smoke-free environments. Young adults demonstrated high levels of self-efficacy with regards to obtaining e-cigarettes from various retailers and were active consumers of e-cigarette marketing. CONCLUSION: This meta-ethnography provides an in-depth insight into social norms around e-cigarette use and beliefs that e-cigarettes could be a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes. As young adults increasingly engage with e-cigarettes, there is a need for informed policy decisions regarding appropriate use. Engagement with e-cigarettes is often reflected within social media, so this medium could be a key platform for creating tailored interventions which inform young adults about the appropriate use of these products.

There are limited cases describing the development of NMOSD post SARSCOV- 2. Objectives We present a case of seronegative NMOSD meeting the diagnostic criteria with coronary artery involvement and the probable association of Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (PIMS)/SARS-COV-2. Methods A 13-year-old female of Chinese descent met the diagnostic criteria for sero-negative NMOSD: . Optic neuritis (presented initially with decreased vision right eye, progressed to complete blindness involving both eyes;optic discs swelling bilaterally) + enhancing focus in left parieto-occipital region . Area postrema syndrome (intractable vomiting) + enhancing lesion in the left aspect of the dorsal medulla . Acute brainstem syndrome (autonomic dysfunction, respiratory distress with new-onset squint) + enhancing foci in medulla . Symptomatic cerebral syndrome (left arm weakness, headache, behaviour change) + several enhancing foci within the cerebral hemisphere and sulcal thickening/oedema enhancement in the right fronto-temporal lobe She presented initially with headache and behaviour change x8 days;weakness left arm x6 days;loss of vision right eye x6 days;facial numbness x6 days;vomiting x2 days but no preceding viral illness/vaccine. She was initially managed as ADEM/ADS with steroids (imaging at this time revealed cerebral lesions). However, a protracted illness persisted with intractable nausea/vomiting, and development of new symptoms (squint, autonomic dysfunction, respiratory distress). Repeat imaging showed new involvement of the dorsal and ventral medulla. IVIG and rituximab treatment were then commenced. Results CSF pleocytosis (22 white cells) and elevated protein concentration (131mg/dL) were present. Anti-MOG and Aquaporin-4 antibodies testing post steroids were negative. ESR increased to 82 mm/hr and ANA titre was mildly elevated during her illness. ENA, dsDNA titres normal. COVID-19 IgM antibody level rose to 0.921. Infectious screen negative (Hepatitis studies, HIV, HSV, ASOT). Neoplastic workup negative (Antineuronal antibodies, CEA, CA-125, AFP, Blood film). MRI pelvis was normal. Anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant antibodies negative. Interestingly, ECHO done post steroids, IVIG and during rituximab treatment showed moderately dilated left middle coronary artery and severely dilated left anterior descending artery. Her neurological function has improved post IVIG and rituximab.

This cross-sectional study involved participants (n = 6,841) from several serological surveys conducted in nonhospitalized children and adults throughout 2020 and 2021 in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Analysis used paired DBS and serum samples from a subset of participants (n = 642) prior to vaccination to establish signal thresholds and calculate diagnostic accuracy by logistic regression. Discrimination of the logistic regression model was assessed by receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis in an n = 2,000 bootstrap of the paired sample (n = 642). The model was cross-validated in a subset of vaccinated persons (n = 90). Unpaired DBS samples (n = 6,723) were used to evaluate anti-IgG signal distributions. In comparison to paired serum, DBS samples from an unvaccinated population possessed a sensitivity of 79% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 58 to 91%) and specificity of 97% (95% CI: 95 to 98%). ROC analysis found that DBS samples accurately classify SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion at an 88% percent rate (area under the curve [AUC] = 88% [95% CI: 80 to 95%]). In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine dose one or two recipients, the sensitivity of DBS testing increased to 97% (95% CI: 83 to 99%) and 100% (95% CI: 88 to 100%). Modeling found that DBS testing possesses a high positive predictive value (98% [95% CI: 97 to 98%]) in a population with 75% seroprevalence. We demonstrate that DBS testing should be considered to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity from natural infection or vaccination. IMPORTANCE Dried blood spot samples have comparable diagnostic accuracy to serum collected by venipuncture when tested by an electrochemiluminescent assay for antibodies and should be considered to reliably detect seropositivity following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination.","output":"Performance of Immunoglobulin G Serology on Finger Prick Capillary Dried Blood Spot Samples to Detect a SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The \\"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2\\" (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the infectious agent responsible for the generally mild but sometimes life-threatening communicable disease known as \\"Coronavirus Disease 2019\\" (COVID-19) [...].","output":"Digital Technologies-Enabled Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 in the Post-COVID-19 Era: Lessons Learnt from a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Antibody production is one of the primary mechanisms for recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is speculated that massive clonal expansion of B cells, which can produce clinically meaningful neutralizing antibodies, occurs in patients who recover on the timing of acquiring adaptive immunity. METHODS: To evaluate fluctuations in clonal B cells and the size of the clones, we chronologically assessed the B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire in three patients with COVID-19 who recovered around 10 days after symptom onset. RESULTS: We focused on the three dominant clonotypes (top 3) in each individual. The percentage frequencies of the top 3 clonotypes increased rapidly and accounted for 27.8 % on day 9 in patient 1, 10.4 % on day 12 in patient 2, and 10.8 % on day 11 in patient 3, respectively. The frequencies of these top 3 clonotypes rapidly decreased as the patients clinical symptoms improved. Furthermore, BCR network analysis revealed that accumulation of clusters composed of similar complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences were rapidly formed, grew, and reached their maximum size around 10 days after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: BCR repertoire analysis revealed that a massive surge of some unique BCRs occurs during the acquisition of adaptive immunity and recovery. The peaks were more prominent than expected. These results provide insight into the important role of BCRs in the recovery from COVID-19 and raise the possibility of developing neutralizing antibodies as COVID-19 immunotherapy.","output":"Massive surge of mRNA expression of clonal B-cell receptor in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mean longevity is increasing worldwide, with major consequences for public health worldwide, as the global population of adults aged over 65 years now exceeds the number of children under 5 for the first time in history.

Vaccination is a key player in the healthy ageing process, both at the individual and the community level. We review here the contribution of vaccines to individual and community health. At an individual level, we highlight the prevention of infectious diseases, as well as other, less well-known benefits of vaccination, such as modulation of the inflammatory process. We then underline the importance of vaccination in achieving herd immunity and reducing the transmission of pathogens in the community.

We showed that the pandemic would have failed to establish in the USA if a nationwide mask mandate, based on using respirators with moderately high compliance, had been implemented during the first two months of the pandemic. The other mask types would fail to prevent the pandemic from becoming established. When mask usage compliance is low to moderate, respirators are far more effective in reducing disease burden. Using data from the third wave, we showed that the epidemic could be eliminated in the USA if at least 40% of the population consistently wore respirators in public. Surgical masks can also lead to elimination, but requires compliance of at least 55%. Daily COVID-19 mortality could be eliminated in the USA by June or July 2021 if 95% of the population opted for either respirators or surgical masks from the beginning of the third wave. We showed that the prospect of effective control or elimination of the pandemic using mask-based strategy is greatly enhanced if combined with other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that significantly reduce the baseline community transmission. By slightly modifying the model to include the effect of a vaccine against COVID-19 and waning vaccine-derived and natural immunity, this study shows that the waning of such immunity could trigger multiple new waves of the pandemic in the USA. The number, severity and duration of the projected waves depend on the quality of mask type used and the level of increase in the baseline levels of other NPIs used in the community during the onset of the third wave of the pandemic in the USA. Specifically, no severe fourth or subsequent wave of the pandemic will be recorded in the USA if surgical masks or respirators are used, particularly if the mask use strategy is combined with an increase in the baseline levels of other NPIs. This study further emphasizes the role of human behaviour towards masking on COVID-19 burden, and highlights the urgent need to maintain a healthy stockpile of highly effective respiratory protection, particularly respirators, to be made available to the general public in times of future outbreaks or pandemics of respiratory diseases that inflict severe public health and socio-economic burden on the population.","output":"Assessing the impact of widespread respirator use in curtailing COVID-19 transmission in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systematic reviews were conducted in the nineties and early 2000s on online learning research.

The ability of the plant umbravirus, groundnut rosette virus, to move long distances through the phloem, the specialized plant vascular system, has been shown to strictly depend on the interaction of one of its proteins, the ORF3 protein (protein encoded by open reading frame 3), with fibrillarin. This interaction is essential for several stages in the groundnut rosette virus life cycle such as nucleolar import of the ORF3 protein via Cajal bodies, relocalization of some fibrillarin from the nucleolus to cytoplasm, and assembly of cytoplasmic umbraviral ribonucleoprotein particles that are themselves required for the long-distance spread of the virus and systemic infection.

However, there is limited focus on diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, particularly preventive chemotherapy neglected tropical diseases (PC-NTDs). There are limited strategies to guide strengthening of surveillance and response system functions concerning PC-NTDs. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a framework to improve surveillance and response to PC-NTDs at the sub-national level in Kenya. Methods Framework development adopted a multi-phased approach. The first phase involved a systematic literature review of surveillance assessment studies conducted in Africa to derive generalised recommendations. The second phase utilised primary data surveys to identify disease-specific recommendations to improve PC-NTDs surveillance in Kenya. The third phase utilised a Delphi survey to assess stakeholders consensus on feasible recommendations. The fourth phase drew critical lessons from existing conceptual frameworks. The final validated framework was based on resolutions and inputs from concerned stakeholders. Results Framework components constituted inputs with the first domain combining surveillance tools, equipment and infrastructure while the second domain combined financial, technical and logistical support. Processes were categorised into four sub-domains with activities for strengthening existing surveillance tools, surveillance core, support and attribute functions. The intended results phase comprised of ten distinct outputs with the anticipated outcomes categorised into three sub domains. Lastly, the overall impact alluded to reduced disease burden, halted disease transmission and reduced costs for implementing treatment interventions to achieve PC-NTDs control and elimination. Conclusion In view of the mixed methodological approach used to develop the framework coupled with further inputs and consensus among concerned stakeholders, the validated framework appears to be relevant in guiding decisions by policy makers to strengthen the existing surveillance and response system functions towards achieving PC-NTDs elimination.","output":"Development and validation of a framework to improve neglected tropical diseases surveillance and response at the sub-national level in Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is a cause of upper GI bleeding and chronic anemia. Although upper endoscopy with argon plasma coagulation (APC) is an accepted therapy for GAVE, many patients continue to bleed and remain transfusion dependent after therapy.

OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy and safety of RFA for patients with GAVE who remain transfusion dependent after APC treatment. DESIGN Open-label prospective cohort study of patients with GAVE refractory to APC. SETTING Academic tertiary referral center. PATIENTS GAVE patients with previous failed APC therapy, chronic anemia, and transfusion dependence.

The Dutch Public health Foresight Study-2020 (PHFS-2020) analyses future trends in health status, determinants, prevention and care, in the light of COVID-19. The pandemic impacts health directly through COVID-19 and indirectly through changes in lifestyle, reduced regular care and socio-economic developments. METHODS: The Dutch PHFS-2020 applies a scenario approach which explores short- and long-term trends and their possible effect on health and health care. A Trendscenario is used, in combination with three scenarios for the future course of the pandemic and socio-economic developments. Based on these scenarios, societal challenges for the future are identified. RESULTS: In 2020, COVID-19 was the most important causes of death in 2020, life expectancy was almost a year lower and the disease burden of the first wave was almost five times higher than an average flu season. The increase in overweight and smoking will lead to more health loss in the future, including increased mortality. The negative impacts of reduced health care and mental health are already visible and might worsen in the future. The socio-economic and intergenerational divides might become more prominent. CONCLUSIONS: The PHFS-2020 shows that indirect effects of the crisis might be taken into account when considering future policy interventions targeting COVID-19. Negative impacts on mental health, possible increase of health inequalities and the long term effects of changes in life style are important indirect effects to be considered by policy makers. Next, a further ageing population might increase the vulnerability for possible future outbreaks.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has remained the only cure for -TM in mainland China since 1998. METHODS This multicenter retrospective study provides a comprehensive review of the outcomes of 50 pediatric patients with -TM who received HSCT between 1998 and 2009 at five centers in mainland China. Both related (n = 35) and unrelated donors (n = 15) with complete human leukocyte antigen matches were included. The stem cell sources included bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood stem cells, umbilical cord blood (UCB) and a combination of BM and UCB or a combination of BM and peripheral blood stem cells from a single sibling donor. RESULTS The probabilities of 5-year overall survival (OS) and thalassemia-free survival (TFS) after the first HSCT were 83.1 and 67.3%, respectively. Graft failure (GF) occurred in 17 patients. Univariate analyses showed that umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) was one of the potential risk factors for decreased OS (P = 0.051), and that UCBT (P = 0.002) was potentially related to TFS. GF incidence was distinct between the UCBT and non-UCBT groups (P = 0.004). Four cases of UCB-BM combined transplantation led to decreased risks of mortality and recurrence. In the UCBT group, related donor transplantation produced more favorable results than unrelated donor transplantation in OS (P = 0.009) but not in TFS (P = 0.217). CONCLUSIONS GF was the primary cause of UCBT failure.

SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is believed that the differential response to SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with the differential expression of ACE2. Several reports proposed the use of ACE2 pharmacological inhibitors and ACE2 antibodies to block viral entry. However, ACE2 inhibition is associated with lung and cardiovascular pathology and would probably increase the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Therefore, utilizing ACE2 soluble analogs to block viral entry while rescuing ACE2 activity has been proposed. Despite their protective effects, such analogs can form a circulating reservoir of the virus, thus accelerating its spread in the body. Levels of ACE2 are reduced following viral infection, possibly due to increased viral entry and lysis of ACE2 positive cells. Downregulation of ACE2/Ang (1-7) axis is associated with Ang II upregulation. Of note, while Ang (1-7) exerts protective effects on the lung and cardiovasculature, Ang II elicits pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic detrimental effects by binding to the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R). Indeed, AT1R blockers (ARBs) can alleviate the harmful effects associated with Ang II upregulation while increasing ACE2 expression and thus the risk of viral infection. Therefore, Ang (1-7) agonists seem to be a better treatment option. Another approach is the transfusion of convalescent plasma from recovered patients with deteriorated symptoms. Indeed, this appears to be promising due to the neutralizing capacity of anti-COVID-19 antibodies. In light of these considerations, we encourage the adoption of Ang (1-7) agonists and convalescent plasma conjugated therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This therapeutic regimen is expected to be a safer choice since it possesses the proven ability to neutralize the virus while ensuring lung and cardiovascular protection through modulation of the inflammatory response.","output":"Combination of Angiotensin (1-7) Agonists and Convalescent Plasma as a New Strategy to Overcome Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Inhibition for the Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocardial damage caused by the newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality.

We assessed saliva-based specimens for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the community setting and compared three different collection methods.Method: Prospective study conducted in three primary care centres. RT-PCR was performed in paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples collected from outpatients with a broad clinical spectrum of illness. To assess differences in collection methods, saliva specimens were obtained in a different way in each of the participating centres: supervised collection (SVC), oropharyngeal washing (OPW) and self-collection (SC).Results: NPS and saliva pairs of samples from 577 patients (median age 39 years, 44% men, 42% asymptomatic) were collected and tested, and 120 (20.8%) gave positive results. The overall agreement with NPS and kappa coefficients (??) for SVC, OPW and SC were 95% (??=0.85), 93.4% (??=0.76), and 93.3% (??=0.76), respectively. The sensitivity (95% CI) of the saliva specimens varied from 86% (72.6-93.7) for SVC to 66.7% (50.4-80) for SC samples. The sensitivity was higher in samples with lower cycle threshold (Ct) values. The best performance of RT-PCR was observed for SVC, with sensitivity (95% CI) for Ct values &#8804;30 of 100% (85.9-100) in symptomatic, and 88.9% (50.7-99.4) in asymptomatic individuals.Conclusions: Saliva is an acceptable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the community setting.

However, remdesivir confers only mild benefits to a subset of patients, and additional effective therapeutic options are needed. Drug repurposing and drug combinations may represent practical strategies to address these urgent unmet medical needs. Viruses, including coronaviruses, are known to hijack the host metabolism to facilitate their own proliferation, making targeting host metabolism a promising antiviral approach. Here, we describe an integrated analysis of 12 published in vitro and human patient gene expression datasets on SARS-CoV-2 infection using genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEM). We find that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce recurrent and complicated metabolic reprogramming spanning a wide range of metabolic pathways. We next applied the GEM-based metabolic transformation algorithm (MTA) to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets that counteract the virus-induced metabolic changes. These predictions are enriched for validated targets from various published experimental drug and genetic screens. Further analyzing the RNA-sequencing data of remdesivir-treated Vero E6 cell samples that we generated, we predicted metabolic targets that act in combination with remdesivir. These predictions are enriched for previously reported synergistic drugs with remdesivir. Since our predictions are based in part on human patient data, they are likely to be clinically relevant. We provide our top high-confidence candidate targets for their evaluation in further studies, demonstrating host metabolism-targeting as a promising antiviral strategy.","output":"Genome-scale metabolic modeling reveals SARS-CoV-2-induced host metabolic reprogramming and identifies metabolic antiviral targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Police face an increased risk of developing mental health problems, yet reliable estimates of their psychological difficulties remain unknown. This systematic review and meta-analysis estimate the pooled prevalence and risk factors for mental health problems among police personnel worldwide. Three independent reviewers searched 16 databases and screened 11 506 articles published between January 1980 and October 2019. Eligible studies involved at least 100 active police professionals and used validated instruments to ascertain specific mental health problems. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. In total, 60 cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies, involving 272 463 police personnel from 24 countries met criteria for inclusion. The overall pooled point prevalence was 14.6% for depression (95% CI 10.9% to 18.6%), 14.2% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 95% CI 10.3% to 18.7%), 9.6% for a generalised anxiety disorder (95% CI 6.7% to 12.9%), 8.5% for suicidal ideation (95% CI 6.1% to 11.2%), 5.0% for alcohol dependence (95% CI 3.5% to 6.7%) and 25.7% for hazardous drinking (95% CI 19.6% to 32.4%). The strongest risk factor for depression and suicidal ideation was higher occupational stress, and the strongest risk factors for PTSD were higher occupational stress and avoidant coping strategies. Higher levels of peer-support were associated with significantly lower PTSD symptoms. Our findings suggest that the prevalence of mental health problems among police exceeds twice that previously reported in mixed samples of first responders, and is associated with poor social support, occupational stress and maladaptive coping strategies.

Understanding strengths and challenges of these new approaches is important to inform improvements and implementation. In this review, we aimed to explore how these tools were utilized in four countries in Asia to facilitate COVID-19 preventative control measures. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic review of English-language literature and web-based information in Pubmed, MedRxiv, national and international public health institution websites and media sources between 1st January-3rd August 2020 to identify examples of big data and digital technologies to facilitate COVID-19 preventative control measures in Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Results were summarized narratively by common technological themes, and examples of integration highlighted. RESULTS: Digital tools implemented included real-time epidemiological dashboards, interactive maps of case location, mobile apps for tracing patients contacts and geofencing to monitor quarantine compliance. Examples of integration of tools included linkage of national health and immigration databases to identify high-risk individuals in Taiwan, and the use of multiple digital surveillance sources to map patients movements in South Korea.

The race is on globally to repurpose drugs for COVID-19 and develop a safe and effective vaccine against the disease. There is an urgent need to search for effective remedies against COVID-19 from the rich and extensive flora of Africa and the world. A literature search was conducted to obtain information on drugs with the potential for effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 based mostly on outcomes of preclinical studies and a few clinical investigations. This was considered important to this perspective as some of the identified mechanisms of action may be related to potential anti-COVID-19 actions of phytomedicines. The findings from the literature search were also used to establish the need for exploration of phytomedicines in the fight against COVID-19. This perspective identifies the need to preserve the rich tradition of herbal medicine in Africa, repositioning it by inculcating all aspects of discovery, development, and chemical evaluation of pharmaceuticals from medicinal plants for effective management of prevalent diseases. The identified mechanisms of action of current drugs under consideration for the treatment of COVID-19 include preventing fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with human cells; decrease acidity in endosomes, cell membrane-derived vesicles for transportation of the virus within the host cell and within which the virus can replicate; and blockade of the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Phytomedicines may possibly elicit either one or a combination of these effects. The case for the exploration of phytomedicines against COVID-19 is strengthened by the emergence of a number of conventional drugs from medicinal plants and the emergence of botanicals with proven efficacy for some medical conditions.

The ototoxic potential of drugs is rarely assessed in pre-clinical drug development or during clinical trials, so this debilitating side-effect is often discovered as patients begin to report hearing loss. Furthermore, drug-induced ototoxicity in adults, and particularly in elderly patients, may go unrecognized due to hearing loss from a variety of etiologies because of a lack of baseline assessments immediately prior to novel therapeutic treatment. During the current pandemic, there is an intense effort to identify new drugs or repurpose FDA-approved drugs to treat COVID-19. Several potential COVID-19 therapeutics are known ototoxins, including chloroquine (CQ) and lopinavir-ritonavir, demonstrating the necessity to identify ototoxic potential in existing and novel medicines. Furthermore, several factors are emerging as potentiators of ototoxicity, such as inflammation (a hallmark of COVID-19), genetic polymorphisms, and ototoxic synergy with co-therapeutics, increasing the necessity to evaluate a drug's potential to induce ototoxicity under varying conditions. Here, we review the potential of COVID-19 therapies to induce ototoxicity and factors that may compound their ototoxic effects. We then discuss two models for rapidly detecting the potential for ototoxicity: mammalian auditory cell lines and the larval zebrafish lateral line. These models offer considerable value for pre-clinical drug development, including development of COVID-19 therapies. Finally, we show the validity of in silico screening for ototoxic potential using a computational model that compares structural similarity of compounds of interest with a database of known ototoxins and non-ototoxins. Preclinical screening at in silico, in vitro, and in vivo levels can provide an earlier indication of the potential for ototoxicity and identify the subset of candidate therapeutics for treating COVID-19 that need to be monitored for ototoxicity as for other widely-used clinical therapeutics, like aminoglycosides and cisplatin.","output":"Detecting Novel Ototoxins and Potentiation of Ototoxicity by Disease Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anlotinib is a newly developed small molecule multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that was approved for the treatment of patients with lung cancer in China.

Currently, next-generation HPV vaccines such as L1/L2-based vaccines are being developed to provide broad-type HPV protection. In this study, we introduced a comprehensive framework for design of L1/L2 polyepitope-based HPV vaccine candidate. This framework started with protein sequence retrieval and followed by conservancy analysis between high-risk HPVs, MHC-I and MHC-II epitope mapping, and B-cell and T-cell epitope mapping. Subsequently, we performed Tap transport and proteasomal cleavage, population coverage, antigenicity, allergenicity and cross-reactivity. After that, peptide-MHCI/II flexible docking and comprehensive conservancy analysis against all HPV-types were carried out.

At present, NCP has an explosive growth in the world. Surgeons could refuse selective operation during the outbreak, but they must face the emergency operation. We hope to avoid the spread of NCP while ensuring efficient treatment of emergency cases. METHODS: The data of patients with incarcerated hernia admitted to Beijing Chaoyang Hospital during NCP epidemic were analyzed and compared with those in 2019. All cases were divided into NCP group and 2019 group. The operation data and inpatient protection process of emergency cases were analyzed. Result During the NCP epidemic, 17 cases with incarcerated hernia were treated in our department. A Total of 263 cases of the same disease were admitted in 2019. There was no significant difference in age, gender, BMI and hernia type between two groups. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in operation method and hospital stay. The waiting time for emergency operation of NCP group was significantly longer than that of 2019 group (P = 0.002). A buffer ward was set up by administrator of hospital during NCP outbreak. Hospitals were divided into Red area, Yellow area and Green area artificially, and strict screening consultation system was implemented. There was no case of SARS-nCoV-2 infection in medical staff. CONCLUSION: It was safe and effective to carry out emergency operation on the premise of screening, protection and isolation during the NCP epidemic.

While many clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19, underlying mechanisms of HCQ in the setting of COVID-19 remain unclear. Hence, we examined differential gene expression signatures of HCQ exposure, in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, and host signatures of COVID-19 in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and postmortem lung to evaluate whether HCQ transcriptome signatures associate with restoration of SARS-CoV-2-related host transcriptional responses. Here, we show that 24 hours of in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) with HCQ significantly impacted transcription of 16 genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. Using transcriptome data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE and A549 cells and PBMC derived from confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, we determined that only 0.24% of the COVID-19 PBMC differentially expressed gene set and 0.39% of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cells differentially expressed gene set overlapped with HCQ-related differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly impacted transcription of 159 genes in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages involved in cholesterol biosynthetic process and chemokine activity. Notably, when we compared the macrophage HCQ-related gene lists with genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19+ patients, the CXCL6 gene was impacted in all three transcriptional signatures revealing evidence in favor of chemokine modulation. HCQ-related transcriptional changes minimally overlapped with host genes altered in postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 participants. These results may provide insight into the immunomodulation mechanisms of HCQ treatment in the setting of COVID-19 and suggest HCQ is not a panacea to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Comparative in vitro transcriptomic analyses of COVID-19 candidate therapy hydroxychloroquine suggest limited immunomodulatory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 host response genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current changes in society and the education system, cumulated with the accelerated development of new technologies, entail inherent changes in the educational process.

This review analyzes their place as causal pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia, as well as their effects on ICU patients' outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS Herpesviruses, namely herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), are the most frequent viruses detected among nonimmunosuppressed ICU patients, as confirmed by recent prospective studies. Patients infected with these viruses show increased morbidity and, especially for CMV, mortality. An increase of bacterial or fungal superinfections was observed in ICU patients with CMV reactivation. A therapeutic trial of acyclovir (HSV antiviral) in ICU patients was negative. Concerning CMV, pathogenicity was suggested by histologic assessment in ICU patients, and recent murine models with a positive effect of prophylaxis with ganciclovir that prevented postseptic CMV reactivation and secondary lung damage. SUMMARY Using efficient and rapid virologic diagnostic tests (antigenemia or PCR), the identification of viruses in ICU patients is frequent. Their role in the occurrence of ventilator-acquired pneumonia and their impact on patient outcome depend on the virus.

A comparative analysis of the infectious process in glial cell explants from SJL and CD.1 mice helped to define the stage at which restriction is manifested. Cultures of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes from these strains of mice were challenged with JHMV or mouse hepatitis virus type 3, and cell-virus interactions were monitored, including adsorption, uptake of inoculum, transcription, and cell-to-cell dissemination. The sequence of early events from adsorption to genome activation occurred with about equal efficiency with both viruses and genetically different cells, indicating that SJL resistance is not due to any deficiency in specific receptors or penetration of the inoculum or general expression of viral functions. However, intercellular spread of the infection was restricted in SJL glial cells owing to an as yet undefined component.

We carried out a case-level clinical review of all Herpes reactivation cases following the administration of COVID-19 vaccines. For cases and controls, significance was set at P = 0.05, differential risk of reporting was assessed for each vaccine as reporting odds ratio and incidence was estimated based on the total number of vaccine doses administered. RESULTS: Of 6,195 cases included in the analysis (5,934 and 273 reporting Herpes Zoster and Herpes Simplex, respectively) over 90% were non-serious.

This infodemic is leading to confusion and risk-taking behaviors that can be harmful to health, as well as to mistrust in health authorities and public health responses. The World Health Organization (WHO) is working to develop tools to provide an evidence-based response to the infodemic, enabling prioritization of health response activities. OBJECTIVE: In this work, we aimed to develop a practical, structured approach to identify narratives in public online conversations on social media platforms where concerns or confusion exist or where narratives are gaining traction, thus providing actionable data to help the WHO prioritize its response efforts to address the COVID-19 infodemic. METHODS: We developed a taxonomy to filter global public conversations in English and French related to COVID-19 on social media into 5 categories with 35 subcategories. The taxonomy and its implementation were validated for retrieval precision and recall, and they were reviewed and adapted as language about the pandemic in online conversations changed over time. The aggregated data for each subcategory were analyzed on a weekly basis by volume, velocity, and presence of questions to detect signals of information voids with potential for confusion or where mis- or disinformation may thrive. A human analyst reviewed and identified potential information voids and sources of confusion, and quantitative data were used to provide insights on emerging narratives, influencers, and public reactions to COVID-19Crelated topics. RESULTS: A COVID-19 public health social listening taxonomy was developed, validated, and applied to filter relevant content for more focused analysis. A weekly analysis of public online conversations since March 23, 2020, enabled quantification of shifting interests in public healthCrelated topics concerning the pandemic, and the analysis demonstrated recurring voids of verified health information. This approach therefore focuses on the detection of infodemic signals to generate actionable insights to rapidly inform decision-making for a more targeted and adaptive response, including risk communication. CONCLUSIONS: This approach has been successfully applied to identify and analyze infodemic signals, particularly information voids, to inform the COVID-19 pandemic response. More broadly, the results have demonstrated the importance of ongoing monitoring and analysis of public online conversations, as information voids frequently recur and narratives shift over time. The approach is being piloted in individual countries and WHO regions to generate localized insights and actions; meanwhile, a pilot of an artificial intelligenceCbased social listening platform is using this taxonomy to aggregate and compare online conversations across 20 countries. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, the taxonomy and methodology may be adapted for fast deployment in future public health events, and they could form the basis of a routine social listening program for health preparedness and response planning.","output":"Infodemic Signal Detection During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development of a Methodology for Identifying Potential Information Voids in Online Conversations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants stresses the continued need for next-generation vaccines that confer broad protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: This study integrates county-level data on confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering database with multiple disability variables from the 2018 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses are based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations that consider spatial clustering in the data. RESULTS: Greater COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly associated with: (1) higher percentages of PwDs who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, below poverty, under 18 years of age, and female; and (2) lower percentages of PwDs who are non-Hispanic White, above poverty, aged 65 or more years, and male, after controlling for spatial clustering. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs are significantly overrepresented in counties with higher COVID-19 incidence compared to other PwDs.

While induction of adaptive antiviral immunity via vaccination holds promise for combatting the pandemic, the emergence of new potentially more transmissible and vaccine-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2 is an ever-present threat. Thus, it remains essential to better understand innate immune mechanisms that are active against the virus. One component of the innate immune system with broad anti-pathogen, including antiviral, activity is a group of cationic immune peptides termed defensins. The defensins ability to neutralize enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and to inactivate numerous bacterial toxins correlate with their ability to promote the unfolding of thermodynamically pliable proteins. Accordingly, we found that human neutrophil a-defensin HNP1 and retrocyclin RC-101 destabilize SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and interfere with Spike-mediated membrane fusion and SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. We show that HNP1 binds to Spike with submicromolar affinity. Although binding of HNP1 to serum albumin is more than 20-fold weaker, serum reduces the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of HNP1. At high concentrations of HNP1, its ability to inactivate the virus was preserved even in the presence of serum. These results suggest that specific a- and 8-defensins may be valuable tools in developing SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategies.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by human defensin HNP1 and retrocyclin RC-101"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the first pandemic wave, a nationwide survey assessed the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Spain and found notable differences among provinces whose causes remained unclear. This ecological study aimed to analyze the association between environmental and demographic factors and SARS-CoV-2 infection by province.

Linear regression was used in the analysis. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of the 50 provinces ranged from 0.2% to 13.6%. The altitude, which ranged from 5 to 1131 m, explained nearly half of differences in seroprevalence (R(2) = 0.47, p < 0.001). The seroprevalence in people residing in provinces above the median altitude (215 m) was three-fold higher (6.5% vs. 2.1%, p < 0.001).

These self-assembled nanostructures resemble the native conformation of the virus but lack genetic material. They are becoming a promising platform for vaccine candidates against several diseases due to the ability of modifying their membrane with antigens from different viruses. The coproduction of extracellular vesicles (EVs) when producing VLPs is a key phenomenon currently still under study. In order to characterize this extracellular environment, a quantitative proteomics approach has been carried out. Three conditions were studied: non-transfected, transfected with an empty plasmid as control, and transfected with a plasmid coding for HIV-1 Gag polyprotein. A shift in EV biogenesis has been detected upon transfection, changing the production from large to small EVs. Another remarkable trait found was the presence of DNA being secreted within vesicles smaller than 200 nm. Studying the protein profile of these biological nanocarriers, it was observed that EVs were reflecting an overall energy homeostasis disruption via mitochondrial protein deregulation. Also, immunomodulatory proteins like ITGB1, ENO3, and PRDX5 were identified and quantified in VLP and EV fractions. These findings provide insight on the nature of the VLP extracellular environment defining the characteristics and protein profile of EVs, with potential to develop new downstream separation strategies or using them as adjuvants in viral therapies.","output":"Molecular Characterization of the Coproduced Extracellular Vesicles in HEK293 during Virus-Like Particle Production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Uncertainty is the defining state of the first minutes and hours of a mass casualty event, yet decisions must be taken and actions must happen before the picture is complete.

This randomized control trial evaluated whether the use of capnography reduces the incidence of hypoxia during the deep sedation of patients for dental treatment. This study involved patients with intellectual disabilities who underwent dental treatment under sedation. The subjects were randomized to the intervention group (I-group) or control group (C-group). All of the patients underwent routine monitoring, as well as bispectral index (BIS) and capnographic monitoring; however, only an independent observer had access to the patients' capnographic data during the dental procedures. Sedation was maintained at a BIS of 50 to 70 by administration of propofol. In the I-group, the independent observer signaled to the dental anesthesiologist if the capnogram indicated that the patient had been suffering from alveolar hypoventilation or apnea for >15 s. In the C-group, the observer signaled to the dental anesthesiologist if the capnogram indicated that the patient had been suffering from alveolar hypoventilation or apnea for >60 s. In both groups, the dental anesthesiologists responded to the signals using appropriate airway management strategies. The primary endpoint of this study was the incidence of hypoxia during dental treatment, which was defined as oxygen saturation of <95%. Hypoxemic episodes occurred in 13.4% and 34.8% of cases in the I-group and C-group, respectively. The incidence of hypoxia was significantly lower in the I-group. These results suggest that capnographic monitoring during deep sedation for dental treatment prevents hypoxemic episodes by allowing the early detection of hypoventilation. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This is the first randomized controlled trial to examine whether the use of capnography reduces the incidence of hypoxia during deep sedation for dental treatment. The findings of this study can be used by clinicians to aid decision-making regarding dental sedation standards at individual clinics. Moreover, they can be used as high-level evidence during the production or updating of clinical guidelines for dental sedation by leading associations.","output":"Capnography Prevents Hypoxia during Sedation for Dental Treatment: A Randomized Controlled Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Updated and revised versions of COVID-19 vaccines are vital due to genetic variations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen Furthermore, vaccines that are safe, cost-effective, and logistic-friendly are critically needed for global equity, especially for middle- to low-income countries Recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been reported using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the prefusion spike trimers (S-2P) Recently, a new version of prefusion spike trimers, named HexaPro, has been shown to possess two RBD in the up conformation, due to its physical property, as opposed to just one exposed RBD found in S-2P Importantly, this HexaPro spike antigen is more stable than S-2P, raising its feasibility for global logistics and supply chain Here, we report that the spike protein HexaPro offers a promising candidate for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Mice immunized by the recombinant HexaPro adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide using a prime-boost regimen produced high-titer neutralizing antibodies for up to 56 days after initial immunization against live SARS-CoV-2 infection Also, the level of neutralization activity is comparable to that of convalescence sera Our results indicate that the HexaPro subunit vaccine confers neutralization activity in sera collected from mice receiving the prime-boost regimen","output":"Mice Immunized with the Vaccine Candidate HexaPro Spike Produce Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The use of e-cigarettes has become more common in China, but the research on e-cigarettes in China, while growing, is still limited. This study examined the characteristics and patterns of e-cigarette use, and analyzed the possible mediators between cigarette cessation intention and e-cigarette use in a Chinese smoking population. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in mainland China. By convenience sampling method, the participants were recruited from 85 major commercial streets of several large cities in China. The study interviewers completed face-to-face interviews and uploaded the completed questionnaires into the online survey platform. The participants were contacted for clarification if any problems were detected. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for ever use of e-cigarettes. We further conducted a mediation analysis to estimate the effect of possible mediators. RESULTS: From July to August 2020, a total of 738 smokers were invited to participate in this study; 613 smokers were identified as eligible and 609 smokers were included in this analysis. Of them, 24 (3.94%) participants were currently using e-cigarettes, and 165 (27.09%) participants have ever used e-cigarettes. The participants with younger age were more likely to have ever used e-cigarettes, ranging from 37.5% in the 18C29 years age group to 6.5% in the 60C69 years age group. After controlling for demographic characteristics and nicotine dependence, the ever use of e-cigarettes was significantly associated with younger age, higher education level, higher monthly income, previous smoking cessation attempts and quitting intention. With the mediation analysis, the education level is confirmed as a mediating factor, and approximately 42.86% of the effects were mediated through the channel of higher socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to examine the possible mediators between cigarette cessation intention and e-cigarette use in a Chinese smoking population. The findings revealed that high socioeconomic status, particularly higher education level, was a major mediating factor.","output":"The characteristics and patterns of e-cigarette use and its association with cigarette cessation intention in a Chinese smoking population: A mediation analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess the psychiatric status of Chinese civil servants aiding in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) control. Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese civil servants have faced high workloads that may contribute to mental disorders. We assessed the prevalence of both depression and anxiety symptoms among civil servants in Jiangsu and surrounding provinces using the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Methods: The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used to assess the severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. Results: In total, 867 Chinese civil servants aiding in COVID-19 control were included in our study. Overall, 37.25 and 38.06% of all respondents reported having symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Respondents who were younger and more educated and those who had fewer years of work experience had higher scores for both depression and anxiety. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that being a woman, being younger, having more education and having fewer years of work experience were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, whether they had experience combating infectious diseases or worked in frontline, there was no significant difference between respondents with and without experience, as well as between frontline and non-frontline workers, in both symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: The civil servants aiding in COVID-19 control reported suffering from varying degrees of mental disorders.

PURPOSE The research questions were as follows: (a) Does patient-centered, prepalliative care delivered by HBPC NPs decrease number of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits and increase patient satisfaction? and (b) What are the criteria for patients to receive end-of-life (EOL) discussions by NPs? METHODOLOGY This was a quasi-experimental, retrospective two-group design with a convenience sample of 233 HBPC patients from an academic clinical partnership compared with 234 clinic patients matched on age and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score over 4 years. Measures included signed advanced directives (ADRs), medical orders of life-sustaining treatment (MOLST) forms, number and length of home visits, hospitalizations, and ED visits after diagnosis. Chi-square analyses and general linear models using a Poisson distribution were conducted. RESULTS Home-based primary health care patients had higher disease burden, statistically higher CCI scores, and signed ADR and MOLST agreements more often than clinic patients with significantly fewer hospitalizations and ED visits, and longer visits with providers. CONCLUSIONS Patients receiving HBPC for prepalliative, EOL illness benefit from more time to discuss the difficult factors surrounding access to care for those with life-threatening illnesses. IMPLICATIONS Recipients of prepalliative HBPC by NPs could require fewer provider visits, hospitalizations and ED visits, patient satisfaction, and a potential decrease in health care spending at EOL.","output":"Nurse practitioners in home-based prepalliative care demonstrate an innovative, value-based approach to end-of-life care planning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There have been cases of minimal change disease (MCD) reported following previous vaccines. During the COVID-19 era, only 3 cases of new-onset MCD and a case of MCD relapse were reported following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. We herein report the first case of MCD after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old man presented to hospital 3 weeks after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, with both bilateral lower extremities and scrotal edema. He initially developed a sudden-onset bilateral lower extremities swelling on day 7 post-vaccine. He, then, developed dyspnea and scrotal swelling over a time span of 2 weeks. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 150/92 mmHg. There was a decreased air entry at lung bases, bilateral lower extremities and scrotal edema. Labs revealed hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and 15 g of proteinuria. His immunologic and serologic work up was negative. Renal biopsy showed concomitant MCD and IgA nephropathy. Patient was treated with oral steroids and had a good response; his edema resolved, serum albumin improved, and proteinuria decreased to 1 g within 2 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, MCD has not been previously reported after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. It remains unclear whether the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are associated with the development of MCD, or it coincided with the mass vaccination. Further studies are needed to determine the incidence of MCD post COVID-19 vaccines and the underlying pathophysiology of glomerular injury post vaccination.","output":"Minimal change disease following the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine: first case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recombinant viruses derived from coronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus strains JHM and A59, were used to map biologic properties of the virus to viral genes.

Twenty-four Cynomolgus macaques (CyM), were primed with replication-incompetent SIV DNA provirus and divided into three groups for the following booster vaccinations, all administered in the oral cavity: Group 1 with recombinant SIV gp140 and E. coli heat-labile toxin adjuvant dmLT, Group 2 with recombinant SIV-Oral Poliovirus (SIV-OPV), and Group 3 with recombinant SIV-MVA. Cell-mediated responses were measured using blood, lymph node, rectal and vaginal mononuclear cells. Significant levels of systemic and mucosal T-cell responses against Gag and Env were observed in all groups. Some SIV-specific plasma IgG, rectal and salivary IgA antibodies were generated, mainly in animals that received SIV DNA + SIV-MVA, but no vaginal IgA was detected. Susceptibility to infection after SIVmac251 challenge was similar in vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals, but acute infection viremia levels were lower in the group that received SIV DNA + SIV-MVA. Non-vaccinated CyM macaques maintained central memory and total CD4+ T cell levels in the normal range during the 5 months of post-infection follow-up as did the vaccinated animals, precluding evaluation of vaccine impact on disease progression.

We used continuous time Markov chains to model the effects of different scenarios and varying durations of disruption on LT candidates. FINDINGS: With complete cessation of LT, the projected 1-year overall survival (OS) decreased by 3?6%, 10?51% and 19?21% for a 1-, 3- and 6-month disruption respectively versus no limitation to LT, while 2-year OS decreased by 4?1%, 12?55%, and 23?43% respectively.

Phospholipids are structural components of the mammalian cytoskeleton and cell membranes. They suppress viral attachment to the plasma membrane and subsequent replication in lung cells. In the virus-infected lung, phospholipids are highly prone to oxidation by reactive oxygen species, leading to the production of oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs). OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to explain the correlation between the level of plasma phospholipids in patients with COVID-19 infection and the levels of cytokine storms to assess the severity of the disease. METHODS: Plasma samples from 34 enrolled patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 infection were collected. Complete blood count (CBC), plasma levels of D-dimer, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), phospholipids, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2)2, and cytokine storms were estimated, and lung computed tomography (CT) imaging was detected. RESULTS: The CBC picture showed the presence of leukopenia, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia in patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, a significant increase was found in plasma levels of D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-13 as well as sPLA22 activity compared to normal persons. However, plasma levels of phospholipids decreased in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 infection, as well as significantly decreased in levels of triacylglycerols and HDL-C in plasma from patients with severe infection only, compared to normal persons. Furthermore, a lung CT scan showed the presence of inflammation in a patient with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there is a correlation between plasma phospholipid depletion and elevated cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 infection. Depletion of plasma phospholipid levels in patients with COVID-19 infection is due to oxidative stress, induction of cytokine storm, and systemic inflammatory response after endothelial cell damage promote coagulation. According to current knowledge, patients with COVID-19 infection may need to administer surfactant replacement therapy and sPLA2 inhibitors to treat respiratory distress syndrome, which helps them to maintain the interconnected surfactant structures.","output":"Plasma Phospholipids: A Promising Simple Biochemical Parameter to Evaluate COVID-19 Infection Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the computational complexity of finite intersections and unions of deterministic context-free languages.

The argument of Liu and Weiner, however, works only on bounded languages of particular forms, and therefore Wotschkes result cannot be extended to disprove any other language to be written in the form of an intersection of d deterministic context-free languages. To deal with the non-membership of a wide range of languages, we circumvent their proof argument and instead devise a new, practical technical tool: a pumping lemma for finite unions of deterministic context-free languages. Since the family of deterministic context-free languages is closed under complementation, this pumping lemma enables us to show a non-membership relation of languages made up with finite intersections of even non-bounded languages as well.

Emerging diseases have clear histories, and the task the field of EID set itself has been to make those histories as short as possibleto catch emerging diseases as close to their origin as possible and snuff them out before they can become pandemics.

METHODS: Between December 15 and 24, 2020, after a national media campaign, users of the sourcecovid.fr web application were asked questions about their own or a close relative's COVID-19 contamination after August 15, 2020, in France. The data of the contamination's circumstances were assessed and compared before and after the second partial lockdown, which occurred on October 25, 2020, during the second wave of the pandemic and was ongoing on December 24, 2020. RESULTS: As of December 24, 2020, 441,000 connections on the web application were observed. A total of 2218 questionnaires were assessable for analysis. About 61.8% (n=1309) of the participants were sure of their contamination origin, and 38.2% (n=809) thought they knew it. The median age of users was 43.0 (IQR 32-56) years, and 50.7% (n=1073) were male. The median incubation time of the assessed cohort was 4.0 (IQR 3-5) days. Private areas (family's or friend's house) were the main source of contamination (1048/2090, 50.2%), followed by work colleagues (579/2090, 27.7%). The main time of day for the contamination was the evening (339/961, 35.3%) before the lockdown and was reduced to 18.2% (86/473) after the lockdown (P<.001). The person who transmitted the virus to the user before and after the lockdown was significantly different (P<.001): a friend (382/1317, 29% vs 109/773, 14.1%), a close relative (304/1317, 23.1% vs 253/773, 32.7%), or a work colleague (315/1317, 23.9% vs 264/773, 34.2%). The main location where the virus was transmitted to the users before and after the lockdown was significantly different too (P<.001): home (278/1305, 21.3% vs 194/760, 25.5%), work (293/1305, 22.5% vs 225/760, 29.6%), collective places (430/1305, 33% vs 114/760, 15%), and care centers (58/1305, 4.4% vs 74/760, 9.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Modalities of transmissions significantly changed before and after the second lockdown in France. The main sources of contamination remained the private areas and with work colleagues. Work became the main location of contamination after the lockdown, whereas contaminations in collective places were strongly reduced.

The aim of this review was to document the healthcare policies developed during the initial wave of widespread COVID-19 transmission in Ireland. We further sought to determine the key focus and impact of these policies. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of COVID-19 healthcare policies published from 28 January to 31 May 2020. Key information including the focus of the policy, target population and impact on service delivery was extracted from included policies. During analysis, data was grouped under descriptive categories and narrative summaries were developed for each category. RESULTS: We identified 61 healthcare policies relating to COVID-19. We developed six category headings to describe the focus and impact of these policies: infection prevention and control (n = 19), residential care settings (n = 12), maintaining non-COVID-19 healthcare services and supports (n = 12), testing and contact tracing (n = 7), guidance for healthcare workers concerning COVID-19 (n = 6), and treating COVID-19 (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS: This review has identified lessons for policy development and implementation to help prepare for future healthcare emergencies. Factors to consider include support of vulnerable groups during and in the aftermath of the pandemic, providing psychological supports for healthcare workers and investment in public healthcare services such as contact tracing for future emergencies.

We aimed to compare the risk of death between COVID-19-related ARDS patients with corticosteroid treatment and those without. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective observational study, patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19 between January 20, 2020, and February 24, 2020, were enrolled. The primary outcome was 60-day in-hospital death. The exposure was prescribed systemic corticosteroids or not. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 60-day in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 382 patients [60.7  14.1 years old (mean  SD), 61.3% males] were analyzed. The median of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 2.0 (IQR 2.0-3.0). Of these cases, 94 (24.6%) patients had invasive mechanical ventilation. The number of patients received systemic corticosteroids was 226 (59.2%), and 156 (40.8%) received standard treatment. The maximum dose of corticosteroids was 80.0 (IQR 40.0-80.0) mg equivalent methylprednisolone per day, and duration of corticosteroid treatment was 7.0 (4.0-12.0) days in total. In Cox regression analysis using corticosteroid treatment as a time-varying variable, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significant reduction in risk of in-hospital death within 60 days after adjusting for age, sex, SOFA score at hospital admission, propensity score of corticosteroid treatment, comorbidities, antiviral treatment, and respiratory supports (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.21, 0.85; p = 0.0160).

Here, we demonstrate that there is no difference in viral replication between B.1.1.7 and other contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 strains in primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. However, B.1.1.7 replication is disadvantaged in Vero cells potentially due to increased furin-mediated cleavage of its spike protein as a result of a P681H mutation directly adjacent to the S1/S2 cleavage site. In addition, we show that B.1.1.7 does not escape neutralisation by convalescent or post-vaccination sera.

METHODS: We reviewed 218 intubated patients at Stony Brook University Hospital and stratified them into three groups based on AGI severity, according to data collected in the first 10 days of ICU course. We used chi-square test to compare categorical variables such as age and sex and two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-tests for continuous variables, including important laboratory values. Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to determine whether AGI score was an independent predictor of survival, and multivariable analysis was performed to compare risk factors that were deemed significant in the univariable analysis. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis based on the AGI score and the presence of FI. RESULTS: The overall incidence of AGI was 95% (45% AGI I/II, 50% AGI III/IV), and FI incidence was 63%. Patients with AGI III/IV were more likely to have prolonged mechanical ventilation (22 days vs 16 days, P-value <0.002) and higher mortality rate (58% vs 28%, P-value <0.001) compared to patients with AGI 0/I/II. This was confirmed with multivariable analysis which showed that AGI score III/IV was an independent predictor of higher mortality (AGI III/IV vs AGI 0/I/II hazard ratio (HR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.69C4.25; P-value <0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that both AGI III/IV and FI (P-value <0.001) were associated with worse outcomes.

There are currently no guidelines for the conduct of elective lung resection surgery in this context. METHODS: A working group composed of 1 thoracic surgeon, 2 anesthesiologists and 1 critical care specialist assessed the risk for aerosol during lung resection surgery and proposed steps for mitigation. After external review, a final draft was approved by the Committee for the Governance of Perioperative and Surgical Activities of the H?pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, in Montreal, Canada. RESULTS: The working group divided the risk for aerosol into 6 time-points: (1) intubation and extubation; (2) Lung isolation and patient positioning; (3) access to the chest; (4) conduct of the surgical procedure; (5) procedure termination and lung re-expansion; (6) chest drainage. Mitigating strategies were proposed for each time-point.

The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a questionnaire for indicating directly affected masticatory muscles groups and facial nerve branches, in patients undergoing the pterional approach in neurosurgery, so that the recovery therapy can be monitored and personalized. Methods: A self-reporting questionnaire consisting of 18 items (12 for postoperative masticatory status and 6 for facial nerve branches involvement), validated on fifteen patients, following three steps: items development, scale development, and scale evaluation, was prospectively applied twice, at a one-year interval (T0 and T1), with thirty-two patients suffering from vascular or tumoral pathology and surgically treated through a pterional approach. Results: No statistically significant correlation could be found between postoperative outcomes and age or gender. Facial nerve branch involvement could not be correlated with any of the assessed variables. Pathology and time elapsed from surgery were statistically significantly correlated to preauricular pain on the non-operated side (p = 0.008 and p = 0.034, respectively). Time elapsed from surgery was statistically significantly correlated to the ability to chew hard food, pain while yawning, and preauricular pain during back and forward jaw movements and gradual mouth opening. Conclusions: We created and validated a valuable patient-centered questionnaire that can be employed as a tool for postoperative assessment of directly affected masticatory muscles and groups of facial nerve branches.","output":"Questionnaire-Based Assessment of the Masticatory Function and Facial Nerve Recovery Post Pterional Approach in Brain Tumors Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In response to the threat of COVID-19 infection, Australia mandated a 14 day quarantine period in a designated facility for all travellers returning from overseas from late March 2020. These facilities were usually hotels, or hotel-like serviced apartments, and also included a repurposed former mining village in the Northern Territory. This study aimed to investigate the perspectives and experiences of people quarantined in designated supervised facilities in Australia, which has not been systematically explored before. Methods: : In this qualitative study semi-structured interviews were conducted with 58 participants quarantined between March 2020 and January 2021. Participants were returned Australian citizens and residents who were required to undergo mandatory supervised quarantine for COVID-19. Interviews were conducted using video teleconferencing (via Zoom), transcribed and coded, then analysed thematically. The theoretical orientation of the study was empirical bioethics. Results: : While participants generally supported the concept of quarantine to protect the Australian public, they were critical of elements of it where they felt exposed to risk (COVID-related or not). They also described instances where infection control within the system seemed inadequate. For some, particularly those quarantined with small children, they reported that the facilities were inadequate or inappropriate for health and wellbeing. Using thematic analysis, three major themes were identified that related to problems in the existing system: Feeling at risk in the quarantine process, risks to the community identified in quarantine, and alternatives to hotel quarantine. Conclusions: : There are systemic issues with infection control in hotel quarantine, which can be further undermined by individual non-compliance. Risks to safety for those in quarantine can be reduced, both in terms of infection control within hotel quarantine and, in the case of the Northern Territory facility, timely in-person medical care as needed for non-COVID conditions. Systems of infection control need ongoing review to ensure that people entering quarantine are protected from known risks of infection at every stage. Medical services in quarantine facilities should be examined to ensure timely and appropriate non-COVID medical services are available.","output":"Title: Experiences of Risk In Australian Hotel Quarantine: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By 2019 COVID-19, since the epidemic, the number of relevant documents exponentially level rise.

Early reports proposed that anosmia could be the first or even the only symptom of COVID-19 infection, prompting calls for self-isolation in affected patients. METHODS: In the present article, we review the COVID-19 anosmia literature and try to answer the following two questions: first, why is COVID-19 infection responsible for such a high incidence of anosmia? Second, in patients with more severe forms is anosmia really less prevalent and why? RESULTS: In terms of the etiology of olfactory dysfunction, several hypotheses were proposed at the outset of the pandemic; that olfactory cleft inflammation and obstruction caused a localized conductive loss, that there was injury to the sustentacular supporting cells in the olfactory epithelium or, given the known neurotropic potential of coronavirus, that the virus could invade and damage the olfactory bulb. Olfactory cleft obstruction may contribute to the olfactory dysfunction in some patients, perhaps most likely in those that show very early resolution, it cannot account for the loss in all patients. Moreover, disordered regrowth and a predominance of immature neurons have been shown to be associated with parosmia, which is a common finding amongst patients with Covid-related anosmia. A central mechanism therefore certainly seems to be consistent with the group of patients with more prolonged olfactory deficits. Sustentacular cells showing ACE-2 immunohistochemical expression 200 to 700 times greater than nasal or tracheal epithelia seem to be the main SARS-CoV-2 gateway. As the pathophysiology of COVID-19 anosmia seems to be better understood, the question of why patients with a moderate to severe form of COVID-19 infection have less olfactory involvement remains unresolved. Different potential explanations are discussed in this review. CONCLUSIONS: The last 5 months have benefited from great international collaborative research, first highlighting and then proving the value of loss of smell and taste as a symptom of COVID-19. Adoption of loss of smell into the case definition by international public health bodies will facilitate control of disease transmission.","output":"Anosmia: an evolution of our understanding of its importance in COVID-19 and what questions remain to be answered"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Critical illness has detrimental effects on the diaphragm, but the impact of critical illness on other major muscles of the respiratory pump has been largely neglected. This study aimed to determine the impact of critical illness on the most important muscles of the respiratory muscle pump, especially on the expiratory muscles in children during mechanical ventilation. In addition, the correlation between changes in thickness of the expiratory muscles and the diaphragm was assessed. METHODS: This longitudinal observational cohort study performed at a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit included 34 mechanical ventilated children (> 1 monthC < 18 years). Thickness of the diaphragm and expiratory muscles (obliquus interna, obliquus externa, transversus abdominis and rectus abdominis) was assessed daily using ultrasound. Contractile activity was estimated from muscle thickening fraction during the respiratory cycle. RESULTS: Over the first 4 days, both diaphragm and expiratory muscles thickness decreased (> 10%) in 44% of the children. Diaphragm and expiratory muscle thickness increased (> 10%) in 26% and 20% of the children, respectively. No correlation was found between contractile activity of the muscles and the development of atrophy. Furthermore, no correlation was found between changes in thickness of the diaphragm and the expiratory muscles (P = 0.537). Decrease in expiratory muscle thickness was significantly higher in patients failing extubation compared to successful extubation (? 34% vs ? 4%, P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in diaphragm and expiratory muscles thickness develop rapidly after the initiation of mechanical ventilation.

Prior to this and the introduction of electronic health records (EHR), a predecessor could be found in the Clinical Pathways concept as a standard medical care plan and a tool to improve medical quality. Since 1997, Japan's Saiseikai Kumamoto Hospital (SKH) has been studying and implementing Clinical Pathways. In 2010, they implemented EHR, which facilitated the collection of structured data in common templates that aligned with outcome measurements defined through Japan's Society of Clinical Pathways. For each patient at this hospital, variances from the desired outcomes have been recorded, producing volumes of structured data in formats that could readily be aggregated and analyzed. A visualization tool was introduced to display graphs on the home page of the EHR such that each patient can be compared to similar patients. Knowledge learned from patient care is shared regularly through Clinical Pathways meetings that are supported by all staff within the hospital. The SKH experience over the past two decades is worth exploring further in the context of the development of a fully functional LHS and the attributes/characteristics thereof. In this report, the SKH experience and processes are compared with previously published attributes of a fully functional LHS (ie, characteristics of an LHS that can indicate maturity). Specific examples of the SKH system are detailed with respect to leveraging knowledge gained to change performance that improves patient care as prescribed by learning health cycles. The SKH experience and its information infrastructure and culture exemplify a functional LHS, which is now being expanded to additional hospitals with the hope that it can be scaled and serve as a solid platform for measures aimed at improving medical care, thus establishing broader and more global learning health systems.","output":"A functional learning health system in Japan: Experience with processes and information infrastructure toward continuous health improvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND : Coronary artery embolism is an infrequent cause of type 2 myocardial infarction which can be due to arterial thromboembolism or septic embolism. While systemic embolization is one of the most acknowledged and threatened complications of infective endocarditis, coronary localization of the emboli causing acute myocardial infarction is exceedingly rare occurring in <1% of cases. CASE SUMMARY : A 52-year-old man with a history of Bentall procedure and redo aortic valve replacement due to prosthetic degeneration (11 years prior to the current presentation) presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever and myalgias. Shortly after his arrival, he experienced typical chest pain and an electrocardiogram demonstrated signs of inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction: coronary angiography showed a lesion of presumed embolic origin at the level of the mid-distal circumflex coronary artery which was treated with embolectomy. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography highlighted the presence of a periaortic abscess. The final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as the cause of septic coronary artery embolization was confirmed with a Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) exam and by the growth of Staphylococcus lugdunensis on repeated blood cultures. The patient underwent successful redo Bentall surgery the good outcome was confirmed at 1-month follow-up. DISCUSSION : Type 2 myocardial infarction caused by coronary embolism is a rare presentation of infective endocarditis and requires a high level of suspicion for its diagnosis. Prosthetic heart valves are a predisposing factor for infective endocarditis: aortic root abscess requires surgery as it rarely regresses with antibiotic therapy.","output":"ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction due to septic coronary embolism: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses the significance and trends of digitalisation in tourism.

Moreover, conscientious employees tend to be more satisfied and less stressed from their work. One consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, is that many workers have transitioned to working remotely, often under conditions of less direct supervision and less clarity about expected work activities and outcomes. We proposed that this significant change in work context constitutes a weakening of situational strength that can change the relationship of conscientiousness with job strain, job satisfaction, and job performance. Using Meyer et al.'s (2010) conceptualization of situational strength, we tested the moderating effect of situational strength by surveying 474 white-collar employees in a Fortune-1000 firm in 2019 and again in 2020 after they had all transitioned to working remotely. We found that the changes in work context due to COVID-19 significantly lowered scores on situational strength and this was accompanied by a stronger positive effect of conscientiousness on performance. Importantly, during COVID-19, the relationships of conscientiousness with strain and satisfaction showed a reversal of sign, with more conscientious workers reporting higher strain and lower satisfaction. These effects were partially mediated by job demands and were replicated with work hours. The results provide a test of situational strength theory and suggest that changes in situational strength due to COVID-19 may cause an organization's most conscientious employees to be at elevated risk for burnout and dissatisfaction, and consequently, turnover, if not managed appropriately.

A crucial challenge in studying MV infection is to understand the so-called measles paradoxthe progression of the infection to severe immunosuppression before clearance of acute viremia, which is also observed in canine distemper virus (CDV) infection. However, a lack of models that match in vivo data has restricted our understanding of this complex and counter-intuitive phenomenon. Recently, progress was made in the development of a model that fits data from acute measles infection in rhesus macaques. This progress motivates our investigations to gain additional insights from this model into the control mechanisms underlying the paradox. In this paper, we investigated analytical conditions determining the control and robustness of viral clearance for MV and CDV, to untangle complex feedback mechanisms underlying the dynamics of acute infections in their natural hosts. We applied control theory to this model to help resolve the measles paradox. We showed that immunosuppression is important to control and clear the virus. We also showed under which conditions T-cell killing becomes the primary mechanism for immunosuppression and viral clearance. Furthermore, we characterized robustness properties of T-cell immunity to explain similarities and differences in the control of MV and CDV. Together, our results are consistent with experimental data, advance understanding of control mechanisms of viral clearance across morbilliviruses, and will help inform the development of effective treatments.

Animal data and human studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase the expression of ACE2. ACE2 is an enzyme found in the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lung and is a coreceptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. Therefore, one can speculate that discontinuing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy may lead to decreased ACE2 expression, thereby attenuating the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and mitigating the disease progression of COVID-19.

We aim to report echocardiographic follow-up findings and describe the changes in left and right ventricular function that occur following acute infection. Methods Patients enrolled in the WASE-COVID study with acute COVID-19 infection were asked to return for a follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Overall, 198 returned at a mean of 129 days of follow-up, of which 153 had paired baseline and follow-up images that were analyzable, including left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction (EF), and longitudinal strain (LVLS). Right-sided echocardiographic parameters included right ventricular (RV) global longitudinal strain (RVGLS), RV free wall strain (RVFWS), and RV basal diameter (RVBD). Paired echocardiographic parameters at baseline and follow-up were compared for the entire cohort and for subgroups based on the baseline LV and RV function. Results For the entire cohort, echocardiographic markers of LV and RV function at follow-up were not significantly different from baseline (all p>0.5). Patients with hyperdynamic LVEF at baseline (>70%), had a significant reduction of LVEF at follow-up (74.33.1% vs. 64.48.1 %, p<0.001), while patients with reduced LVEF at baseline (<50%) had a significant increase (42.55.9% vs 49.313.4% , p=0.02), and those with normal LVEF had no change. Patients with normal LVLS (<-18%) at baseline, had a significant reduction of LVLS at follow-up (-21.62.6 % vs. -20.34.0% , p=0.006), while patients with impaired LVLS at baseline, had a significant improvement at follow-up (-14.52.9 % vs. -16.75.2%, p<0.001). Patients with abnormal RVGLS (>-20%) at baseline, had significant improvement at follow-up (-15.23.4 % vs. -17.44.9 %, p=0.004). Patients with abnormal RVBD (>4.5 cm) at baseline, had significant improvement at follow-up (4.90.7 cm vs 4.60.6 cm, p=0.019). Conclusions Overall, there were no significant changes overtime in LV and RV function of patients recovering from COVID-19 infection. However, differences were observed according to baseline LV and RV function, which may reflect recovery from the acute myocardial injury occurring in the acutely ill. LV and RV function tends to improve in those with impaired baseline function, while it tends to decrease in those with hyperdynamic LV or normal RV.","output":"Ventricular Changes in Patients with Acute COVID-19 Infection: Follow-Up of The World Alliance Societies of Echocardiography (WASE-COVID) Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Healthcare workers' work performance and mental health are associated with positive mental health outcomes and directly related to increased productivity and decreased disability costs.

Although most cases involve hypoxia, the pathophysiological mechanism and neurologic outcomes of COVID-19-associated leukoencephalopathy remain unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of COVID-19-associated leukoencephalopathy without severe hypoxia in a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with pyelonephritis. After the initiation of intravenous ceftriaxone, her fever resolved, but she developed an altered state of consciousness with abnormal behavior and, subsequently, a relapse fever. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and was intubated. Lung-protective ventilation with deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade were used for treatment. After cessation of sedative administration, her mental status remained at a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. COVID-19 was assumed to have caused leukoencephalopathy due to the absence of severe hypoxia or other potential causes. She subsequently showed gradual neurologic improvement. Three months after the COVID-19 diagnosis, she regained alertness, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider leukoencephalopathy in the differential diagnosis of consciousness disorders in patients with severe COVID-19, even in the absence of severe hypoxia.

Actionability of dashboards, as a predictor of their potential use for data-driven decision-making, was assessed in a global study during the early stages of the pandemic. It revealed a widespread lack of features needed to support actionability. In view of the inherently dynamic nature of dashboards and their unprecedented speed of creation, the evolution of dashboards and changes to their actionability merit exploration. Objective: We aimed to explore how COVID-19 dashboards evolved in the Canadian context during 2020 and whether the presence of actionability features changed over time. Methods: We conducted a descriptive assessment of a pan-Canadian sample of COVID-19 dashboards (N = 26), followed by an appraisal of changes to their actionability by a panel of expert scorers (N = 8). Scorers assessed the dashboards at two points in time, July and November 2020, using an assessment tool informed by communication theory and health care performance intelligence. Applying the nominal group technique, scorers were grouped in panels of three, and evaluated the presence of the seven defined features of highly actionable dashboards at each time point. Results: Improvements had been made to the dashboards over time. These predominantly involved data provision (specificity of geographic breakdowns, range of indicators reported, and explanations of data sources or calculations) and advancements enabled by the technologies employed (customization of time trends and interactive or visual chart elements). Further improvements in actionability were noted especially in features involving local-level data provision, time-trend reporting, and indicator management. No improvements were found in communicative elements (clarity of purpose and audience), while the use of storytelling techniques to narrate trends remained largely absent from the dashboards. Conclusions: Improvements to COVID-19 dashboards in the Canadian context during 2020 were seen mostly in data availability and dashboard technology. Further improving the actionability of dashboards for public reporting will require attention to both technical and organizational aspects of dashboard development. Such efforts would include better skill-mixing across disciplines, continued investment in data standards, and clearer mandates for their developers to ensure accountability and the development of purpose-driven dashboards.

Recently, however, evidence has accumulated that points toward a nontrivial relation between the CDR and distal sites on the antibody structure: variations in the binding strengths have been observed upon mutating amino acids separated from the paratope by several nanometers, thus suggesting the existence of a communication network within antibodies whose extension and relevance might be deeper than insofar expected. In this work, we test this hypothesis by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the IgG4 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab, an approved drug that targets the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). The molecule is simulated in both the apo and holo states, totalling 4s of MD trajectory. The analysis of these simulations shows that the bound antibody explores a restricted range of conformations with respect to the apo one, and that the global conformation of the molecule correlates with that of the CDR; a pivotal role in this relationship is played by the relatively short hinge, which mechanically couples Fab and Fc domains. These results support the hypothesis that pembrolizumab behaves as a complex machinery, with a multi-scale hierarchy of global and local conformational changes that communicate with one another. The analysis pipeline developed in this work is general, and it can help shed further light on the mechanistic aspects of antibody function.

Our estimates suggest that twice weekly testing, which was adequate for the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 will be insufficient on its own to contain the spread of the Delta variant of concern. We exclude consideration of contact tracing since the rapidity of the onset of viral titre in the case of the Delta variant suggests that unless contact tracing and quarantine are performed very rapidly (ie. much less than a day), these mitigations will be of minimal impact in reducing transmission. These crude estimates do not take into account heterogeneity of susceptibility, social activity, and compliance, nor do they include the additional reduction in transmission that could be achieved by masking and social distancing.

Overzealous fluid administration and subsequent fluid accumulation and overload are associated with poorer outcomes. Fluids are drugs, and their use should be tailored to meet the patient's individualized needs; fluids should never be given as routine maintenance unless indicated. Before prescribing any fluids, the physician should consider the patient's characteristics and the nature of the illness, and assess the risks and benefits of fluid therapy. Decisions regarding fluid therapy present a daily challenge in many hospital departments: emergency rooms, regular wards, operating rooms, and intensive care units. Traditional fluid prescription is full of paradigms and unnecessary routines as well as malpractice in the form of choosing the wrong solutions for maintenance or not meeting daily requirements. Prescribing maintenance fluids for patients on oral intake will lead to fluid creep and fluid overload. Fluid overload, defined as a 10% increase in cumulative fluid balance from baseline weight, is an independent predictor for morbidity and mortality, and thus hospital cost. In the last decade, increasing evidence has emerged supporting a restrictive fluid approach. In this manuscript, we aim to provide a pragmatic description of novel concepts related to the use of IV fluids in critically ill patients, with emphasis on the different indications and common clinical scenarios.

Here, we focus on disruptions that are likely to occur during chronic use that cause some recording channels to fail but leave the remaining channels unaffected. In these cases, the algorithm that translates recorded neural activity into actions, the neural decoder, should seamlessly identify and adjust to the altered neural signals with minimal inconvenience to the user.

Next, after identifying corrupted channels, we demonstrate the automated and rapid removal of channels from a neural network decoder using a masking approach that does not change the decoding architecture, making it amenable for transfer learning. Finally, using transfer and unsupervised learning techniques, we update the model weights to adjust for the corrupted channels without requiring the user to collect additional calibration data.

IgG and IgM antibodies to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, serum-neutralizing activity, plasma cytokine levels, and the frequency of circulating Follicular T helper cells (cTfh) and plasmablasts were analyzed by conventional methods.Findings: Fifty-eight percent of the children in the acute phase of infection had no detectable antibodies at the time of sampling while a seronegative status was found in 25% and 12% of convalescent and MIS-C children, respectively. When children in the acute phase of the infection were stratified according disease severity, we found that contrasting with the response of children with asymptomatic, mild and moderate disease, children with severe COVID-19 did not develop any detectable response.

Understanding the consequences of the pandemic will teach invaluable lessons for future preparedness and provide useful context for individual practices attempting to understand changes in operative volume. We analyzed populationlevel changes in operative practice since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to contextualize observations made by individual practices and optimize future responses. METHODS: We used Premier Perspectives Database to investigate changes in operative volume through March 2020. Baseline operative volume for urologic surgery was calculated using data from the preceding 12 months and compared on a total and by procedure basis. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify hospital-level predictors of change in response to the pandemic. Our primary outcome of interest was the change in operative volume in March 2020 relative to baseline. Total operative volume, and volume by procedure and procedure-based groupings were investigated. RESULTS: At baseline, we captured 23,788 urologic procedural encounters per month as compared with 19,071 during March 2020e a 19.9% decrease. Urologic oncology-related cases were relatively preserved as compared to others (average change in March 2020: =1.1% versus -32.2%). Northeastern (b=-5.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -10.2 to -1.18, p=.013) and Midwestern hospitals (b=-4.17, 95% CI: -7.89 to -0.45, p=.027;both with South as reference region), and those with an increasing percentage of patients insured by Medicaid (b= -.17 per percentage point, 95% CI: -.33 to -.01, p=.04) experienced a significantly larger decrease in volume. CONCLUSIONS: There was a 20% decline in urologic operative volume in March 2020, compared with baseline, that preferentially affected hospitals serving Medicaid patients, and those in the Northeast and Midwest. In the face of varying mandates on elective surgery, widespread declines in operative volume may also represent hesitancy on behalf of patients to interface with healthcare during the pandemic.

Previous studies showed satisfactory bactericidal disinfection effects of UV-C light in rigid and flexible endoscopes. Especially in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, virucidal properties are of high importance. In the present study, the virucidal efficacy of UV-C light surface disinfection was analyzed. Methods: MS-2 bacteriophages were applied to the test samples and irradiated by UV-C light using the UV Smart D25 device; unirradiated test samples were used as controls. A dilution series of the samples was mixed with [Formula: see text] Escherichia coli and assayed. Results: 8.6  10(12) pfu could be harvested from the unprocessed test samples. In the control group without UV-C exposure, a remaining contamination of 1.2  10(12) pfu was detected, resulting in a procedural baseline reduction rate with a LOG(10) reduction factor of 0.72. The LOG(10) reduction factor was found to be 3.0 after 25 s of UV-C light exposure. After 50 and 75 s of UV-C radiation LOG(10) reduction factors 4.2 and 5.9, respectively, were found, with all reductions being statistically significantly different to baseline.

The aim: was to determine the prevalence of video game disorder (VGD), its associated predictors, and its impact on the mental health of university students. METHODS: a cross-sectional study was performed with a convenience sample of 2,364 undergraduate students. Sociodemographic criteria, the Internet Gaming Disorder-20 (IGD-20) questionnaire, and the Mental Health-5 (MH-5) questionnaire were used to collect data. The weights and heights of the students were self-reported. The average number of hours spent playing video games per week, the average number of hours of sleep per day, the favorite type of game played, and the main causes for playing were also included. RESULTS: the prevalence of VGD among participants was 18.9%. The main predictors of VGD were being male, residing in an urban area, playing more hours per week, sleeping fewer hours per day, and having a higher body mass index, while having a low socioeconomic status was a protective factor. Mental health had a strong negative correlation with VGD. The types of games most frequently played by video game addicts were violent and action games. However, the most frequent reasons cited for playing were to improve ones avatar, relaxation, and amusement. CONCLUSION: playing video games in moderation, adequate sleeping, and engaging in outdoor physical activities enhances mental well-being and physical functioning. Thus, it is critical to promote and encourage balanced, effective, stable approaches to video gaming among university students to maintain their mental well-being.","output":"Video game disorder and mental wellbeing among university students: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic threatening millions of people worldwide. Yet studies specifically assessing the geriatric population are scarce. We aimed to examine the participation of elderly patients in therapeutic or prophylactic trials on COVID-19. Methods: In this review, randomized controlled trials (RCTs;n=12) comparing therapeutic or prophylactic interventions registered on preprint repositories and/or published since December 2019 were analyzed. We searched in PubMed, leading journals websites, and preprint repositories for RCTs and large observational studies. We aimed to describe the age of included patients, the presence of an upper age limit and of adjusted analyses on age, any exclusion criteria that could limit participation of elderly adults such as comorbidities, cognitive impairment, limitation of life expectancy;and the assessment of long-term outcomes such as the need of rehabilitation or institutionalization. Mean participant ages were reported and compared with observational studies. Results: Twelve RCTs assessing drug therapy for COVID-19 were included. Mean age of patients included in RCTs was 56.3 years. An upper age limit was applied in three published trials (25%) and in 200/650 (31%) trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov. One trial reported a subgroup analysis in patients 65. Patients were excluded for liver-function abnormalities in eight trials, renal disease in six, cardiac disease or risk of torsade de pointes in five, and four for cognitive or mental criteria, which are frequent comorbidities in the oldest patients. Only three trials allowed a family member to provide consent. Patients enrolled in RCTs were on average 20 years younger than those included in large (n1000) observational studies. Seven studies had as their primary outcome a clinical endpoint, but none reported cognitive, functional or quality of life outcomes or need for rehabilitation or long-term care facility placement. Conclusions: Elderly patients are clearly underrepresented in RCTs, although they comprise the population hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Long-term outcomes such as the need of rehabilitation or institutionalization were not reported.

The objective of this study is to describe and identify patterns in the disease course of nursing home residents infected with COVID-19. SETTING AND METHODS: This is a case series of 74 residents with COVID-19 infection in a nursing home in central Indiana between March 28 and June 17, 2020. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record and from nursing home medical director tracking notes from the time of the index infection through August 31, 2020. The clinical authorship team reviewed the data to identify patterns in the disease course of the residents. RESULTS: The most common symptoms were fever, hypoxia, anorexia, and fatigue/malaise. The duration of symptoms was extended, with an average of over 3 weeks. Of those infected 25 died; 23 of the deaths were considered related to COVID-19 infection. A subset of residents with COVID-19 infection experienced a rapidly progressive, fatal course. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Nursing home residents infected with COVID-19 from the facility we studied experienced a prolonged disease course regardless of the severity of their symptoms, with implications for the resources needed to care for and support of these residents during active infection and post-disease.

DESIGN AND SAMPLE This was a cross-sectional survey of 36 hospice and palliative care workforce members representing all United States geographic regions. RESULTS Most respondents (70%) reported an increase in specific palliative care services as a result of the pandemic. Two thirds (78%) of respondents reported their agency has cared for confirmed COVID-19 patients. Only half reported the agency had access to laboratory facilities for surveillance and detection of outbreaks in both patients and staff (58%) and that the agency could test patients and providers for COVID-19 (55%). Qualitative comments described the impact of the pandemic and resulting social distancing measures on the emotional well-being of patients, families, and staff. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has strained the palliative and hospice care workforce as it provides increased services at an unprecedented rate to patients and families. The implications of these findings are important for public health nurses who are skilled in disaster management and quickly responding to emergencies.

However, the specific regulatory mechanism in AD remains unclear. METHODS Firstly, AD model was generated by the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of the A1-42 peptide. Subsequently, mice were injected with shRNA adenoviral transduction particles designed to target DJ-1 or A1-42 or A1-42+shNC or A1-42+shRNA against DJ-1. shRNA against DJ-1 were injected into hippocampus of mice (8104 viral particles for each mice) for 7 consecutive days. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the accumulation of A in the hippocampus of mice, and HE staining assay was carried to detect pathological changes in the hippocampus of mice. Further, sh-IKK, shDJ-1, pcDNA-IKK and pcDNA-DJ-1 plasmids were transfected into HT-22 cells, MTT assay, TUNEL staining and Hoechst staining were performed to detect cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. Western blotting was carried to measure the relative proteins expression. RESULTS Findings indicated that A1-42 inhibited autophagy and up-regulated p-Tau protein expression; the overexpression of IKK and DJ-1 all rescued the autophagy inhibited by A1-42 and down-regulated p-Tau protein expression induced by A1-42; DJ-1 up-regulated IKK via p-VHL, further promoted autophagy and reduced the expression of p-Tau protein; DJ-1 knockdown inhibited autophagy and up-regulated p-Tau protein expression, resulting in delayed behavior in mice.

By bridging split-and-pool combinatorial synthesis with the ligation of unique encoding DNA oligomers, million- to billion-member libraries can be synthesized for use in hundreds of healthcare target screens. Although structural diversity and desirable molecular property ranges generally guide DNA-encoded chemical library design, recent reports have highlighted the utility of focused DNA-encoded chemical libraries that are structurally biased for a class of protein targets. Herein, a protease-focused DNA-encoded chemical library was designed that utilizes chemotypes known to engage conserved catalytic protease residues. The three-cycle library features functional moieties such as guanidine, which interacts strongly with aspartate of the protease catalytic triad, as well as mild electrophiles such as sulfonamide, urea, and carbamate. We developed a DNA-compatible method for guanidinylation of amines and reduction of nitriles. Employing these optimized reactions, we constructed a 9.8-million-membered DNA-encoded chemical library. Affinity selection of the library with thrombin, a common protease, revealed a number of enriched features which ultimately led to the discovery of a 1 nM inhibitor of thrombin. Thus, structurally focused DNA-encoded chemical libraries have tremendous potential to find clinically useful high-affinity hits for the rapid discovery of drugs for targets (e.g., proteases) with essential functions in infectious diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and relevant healthcare conditions (e.g., male contraception).","output":"Discovery of potent thrombin inhibitors from a protease-focused DNA-encoded chemical library"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop various AI models to predict hospitalization on a large (over 110k) cohort of COVID-19 positive-tested US patients, sourced from March 2020 to February 2021.

MCIH is associated with the risk of incarceration and necessitates a second operation. This might be avoided by contralateral exploration during primary surgery. However, contralateral exploration may be unnecessary, leads to additional operating time and costs and may result in additional complications of surgery and anaesthesia. Thus, there is no consensus whether contralateral exploration should be performed routinely. METHODS: The Hernia-Exploration-oR-Not-In-Infants-Analysis (HERNIIA) study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial with an economic evaluation alongside to study the (cost-)effectiveness of contralateral exploration during unilateral hernia repair. Infants aged 6 months or younger who need to undergo primary unilateral hernia repair will be randomised to contralateral exploration or no contralateral exploration (n = 378 patients). Primary endpoint is the proportion of infants that need to undergo a second operation related to inguinal hernia within 1 year after primary repair. Secondary endpoints include (a) total duration of operation(s) (including anaesthesia time) and hospital admission(s); (b) complications of anaesthesia and surgery; and (c) participants health-related quality of life and distress and anxiety of their families, all assessed within 1 year after primary hernia repair.

A recently published academic study has raised awareness regarding a promising alternative therapeutic option for HIV/AIDS, referred to as selective elimination of host cells capable of producing HIV (SECH). Similar to the shock and kill strategy, the SECH approach requires the simultaneous administration of drugs targeting key mechanisms in specific cells to efficiently eliminate HIV replication-competent cellular reservoirs. Herein, we comprehensively review the specific mechanisms targeted by the SECH strategy. Briefly, the suggested cocktail of drugs should contain (i) latency reversal agents to promote the latency reversal process in replication-competent reservoir cells, (ii) pro-apoptotic and anti-autophagy drugs to induce death of infected cells through various pathways, and finally (iii) drugs that eliminate new cycles of infection by prevention of HIV attachment to host cells, and by HIV integrase inhibitor drugs.

We conducted searches in the following databases: Medline (PubMed), LILACS (BVS), SCOPUS (Elsevier), Embase (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Biomed Central, and ISI Web of Science, from January 1990 to October 2016. For inclusion, studies measured NGAL levels in plasma and urine for AKI in children. For each study, 2  2 contingency tables were developed. For statistical analysis we calculated the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio. For methodological assessment, we used Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Software used for analysis was Stata 14, and RevMan 5.3. RESULTS In total 13 studies were analyzed, which included 1629 children. For urinary NGAL, the pooled sensitivity was 0.76 (95% CI 0.62-0.85) and a pooled specificity 0.93 (95% CI 0.88-0.96). The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for the detection of AKI was 43 (95% CI 16-115) and the Area under the curve (AUC) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96).

This study aimed to examine the epidemiological characteristics, clinical conditions, and factors affecting the clinical status of patients over 65 with COVID-19 in the Bing?l province. Study was conducted between March and December 2020 in the Bing?l province using the data of 3,521 patients over age 65 who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 as per RT-PCR results. The study commenced after obtaining necessary institutional permissions and the ethics committee approval. In the study, independent variables were age, gender, presence of chronic diseases whereas dependent variables were mortality status, presence of pneumonia. Chi-square test and binominal logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. In all evaluations, p<0.05 was considered significant. The median age of the patients participating in the study was 72 (65C102) and the case fatality rate was 2%. The mortality rates were significantly higher in patients aged between 75C84 and those aged >85 as well as patients who had a chronic disease, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease compared to the other groups (p<0.05). According to the regression analysis, mortality rate was 2.6-fold higher in males than in females and 24.3-fold higher in patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p<0.05). Among the patients in the study group, mortality rate was found to be higher in males, those in the advanced age group, and those with pneumonia and chronic diseases.

To date, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the impact of lockdowns on air quality and human health. Using global satellite observations and ground measurements from 36 countries in Europe, North America, and East Asia, we find that lockdowns led to reductions in NO2 concentrations globally, resulting in ~32,000 avoided premature mortalities, including ~21,000 in China. However, we do not find corresponding reductions in PM2.5 and ozone globally. Using satellite measurements, we show that the disconnect between NO2 and ozone changes stems from local chemical regimes.

Public debates question its impact compared to reliance on individual responsibility. We study how rationally chosen self-protective behavior impacts the spread of the epidemics and interacts with policies. We first assess the value of lockdown in terms of mortality compared to a counterfactual scenario that incorporates self-protection efforts; and second, assess how individual behavior modify the epidemic dynamics when public regulations change. We couple an SLIAR model, that includes asymptomatic transmission, with utility maximization: Individuals trade off economic and wellbeing costs from physical distancing with a lower infection risk. Physical distancing effort depends on risk aversion, perceptions of the epidemics and average distancing effort in the population. Rational distancing effort is computed as a Nash Equilibrium. Equilibrium effort differs markedly from constant, stochastic or proportional contacts reduction. It adjusts to daily incidence of hospitalization in a way that creates a slightly decreasing plateau in epidemic prevalence. Calibration on French data shows that a business-as-usual benchmark yields an overestimation of the number of deaths by a factor of 10 compared to benchmarks with equilibrium efforts. However, lockdown saves nearly twice as many lives as individual efforts alone. Public policies post-lockdown have a limited impact as they partly crowd out individual efforts.

We used this as justification to evaluate three molecules we had previously identified computationally with antiviral activity against Ebola and Marburg. Out of these we previously identified pyronaridine, which inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549-ACE2 cells. Herein, the in vivo efficacy of pyronaridine has now been assessed in a K18-hACE transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Pyronaridine treatment demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of viral load in the lungs of SARS CoV-2 infected mice. Furthermore, the pyronaridine treated group reduced lung pathology, which was also associated with significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine and cell infiltration. Notably, pyronaridine inhibited the viral PLpro activity in vitro (IC50 of 1.8 {micro}M) without any effect on Mpro, indicating a possible molecular mechanism involved in its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, pyronaridine also selectively inhibits the host kinase CAMK1 (IC50 of 2.4 {micro}M). We have also generated several pyronaridine analogs to assist in understanding the structure activity relationship for PLpro inhibition. Our results indicate that pyronaridine is a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.

However, the country's goals of meeting its 50% energy demand from renewable by 2030 and becoming independent of fossil fuel by 2050 are currently in jeopardy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged at the end of December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. This study, therefore, tries to see how COVID-19 affects renewable electricity generation in Denmark using the advanced econometric framework. Several nonlinear estimation techniques such as Fourier ADL cointegration analysis and Markov Switching regression are used to estimate the relationship between the three channels of COVID-19 and renewable electricity generation. The result from the Markov Switching regression reveals that renewable electricity production in Denmark is adversely affected by the enforced lockdown as captured via the stringency index, economic support provided to tackle the pandemic, and daily confirmed deaths of COVID-19. Moreover, the causality test shows that the stringency index and daily confirmed deaths of COVID-19 are important predictors of renewable electricity, but the economic support index has weak causality with renewable electricity. The study finally presents some crucial policy suggestions for Denmark which can help the country achieve its renewable production goals. [Display omitted] ? The relationship between COVID-19 and renewable electricity production in Denmark is investigated. ? Non-linear estimation techniques are used. ?

The control measures adopted in several countries aim at isolating individuals once diagnosed, limiting their social interactions and consequently their transmission probability. These interventions, which have a strong impact on the disease dynamics, can affect the inference of the epidemiological quantities. We first present a theoretical explanation of the effect caused by non-pharmaceutical intervention measures on the mean serial and generation intervals. Then, in a simulation study, we vary the assumed efficacy of control measures and quantify the effect on the mean and variance of realized generation and serial intervals. The simulation results show that the realized serial and generation intervals both depend on control measures and their values contract according to the efficacy of the intervention strategies. Interestingly, the mean serial interval differs from the mean generation interval. The deviation between these two values depends on two factors. First, the number of undiagnosed infectious individuals. Second, the relationship between infectiousness, symptom onset and timing of isolation. Similarly, the standard deviations of realized serial and generation intervals do not coincide, with the former shorter than the latter on average. The findings of this study are directly relevant to estimates performed for the current COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the effective reproduction number is often inferred using both daily incidence data and the generation interval. Failing to account for either contraction or mis-specification by using the serial interval could lead to biased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Consequently, this might affect the choices made by decision makers when deciding which control measures to apply based on the value of the quantity thereof.","output":"On realized serial and generation intervals given control measures: The COVID-19 pandemic case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic (Coronavirus disease 2019) continues to expose countless unanticipated problems at all levels of the world's complex, interconnected society - global domino effects involving public health and safety, accessible health care, food security, stability of economies and financial institutions, and even the viability of democracies. These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20 years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology - WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology - one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations.","output":"Wastewater surveillance for population-wide Covid-19: The present and future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Laboratory testing is a fundamental component of influenza surveillance for detecting novel strains with pandemic potential and informing biannual vaccine strain selection. The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), under the auspices of its WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza, is one of the major public health agencies which provides support globally to build national capacity for influenza surveillance. Our main objective was to determine if laboratory assessments supported capacity building efforts for improved global influenza surveillance. METHODS: In 2010, 35 national influenza laboratories were assessed in 34 countries, using a standardized tool. Post-assessment, each laboratory received a report with a list of recommendations for improvement. Uptake of recommendations were reviewed 3.2 mean years after the initial assessments and categorized as complete, in-progress, no action or no update. This was a retrospective study; follow-up took place through routine project management rather than at a set time-point post-assessment. WHO data on National Influenza Centre (NIC) designation, External Quality Assessment Project (EQAP) participation and FluNet reporting was used to measure laboratory capacity longitudinally and independently of the assessments. All data was further stratified by World Bank country income category. RESULTS: At follow-up, 81 % of 614 recommendations were either complete (350) or in-progress (145) for 32 laboratories (91 % response rate). The number of countries reporting to FluNet and the number of specimens they reported annually increased between 2005, when they were first funded by CDC, and 2010, the assessment year (p < 0.01). Improvements were also seen in EQAP participation and NIC designation over time and more so for low and lower-middle income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Assessments using a standardized tool have been beneficial to improving laboratory-based influenza surveillance. Specific recommendations helped countries identify and prioritize areas for improvement. Data from assessments helped CDC focus its technical assistance by country and region. Low and lower-middle income countries made greater improvements in their laboratories compared with upper-middle income countries. Future research could include an analysis of annual funding and technical assistance by country. Our approach serves as an example for capacity building for other diseases.","output":"Capacity building in national influenza laboratories C use of laboratory assessments to drive progress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is one of the key noncommunicable diseases leading to significant comorbidities. In recent years, obesity has become a major public health issue and has threatened the wellbeing of millions of patients. Although there are multiple reasons for people becoming obese, sustained positive energy balance - energy intake is greater than energy expenditure - is the key for accumulating excess bodyfat. Prevention of obesity by lifestyle changes, healthy eating and increased physical activity are more cost effective than pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery or ultimately treating complications of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Not all patients with obesity experience complications such as T2DM. The distribution of bodyfat is important in determining whether a person is obese and healthy or needs medical attention; however, the use of BMI alone will not differentiate this. Obesity patients with excess abdominal fat have the highest risk for T2DM, insulin resistance and thus, higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Obesity-associated complications can be reversed through healthy eating habits and increased duration and intensity of physical activity. Increasing work- and leisure-related physical activities increase the energy expenditure, having salutary effects on weightloss programs. Although treating symptoms of obesity and related disorders is important, it is not a solution for the obesity epidemic. Causes that lead to weight-gain need to be identified in individual patients, who should be educated about the causes of weight gain and ways to prevent it, and be provided with simple and practical interventions to lose weight.","output":"Thermogenesis-based interventions for obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative old age disease that is complex, multifactorial, unalterable, and progressive in nature.

Conclusion: In conclusion, interpretation of the results in view of the suggested hypothesis, reveals that the micro-RNAs implicated in myocarditis in general are as well implicated in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, this can explain why patients having a first dose with a history of COVID-19 can develop myocarditis from mRNA vaccines, also the relatively higher likelihood of this complication in males and younger aged individuals can be explained by the upregulation of key myocarditis related miRNAs in those two strata, due to higher muscle mass and suggests performing a sarcopenia index in recipients of the vaccine to correlate it with the likelihood of this complication.

Relationship of neighborhood greenness with human health has been widely studied, yet its association with severe HFMD has not yet been established. METHODS: Individual HFMD cases that occurred in Guangdong province in 2010 were recruited and were categorised into mild and severe cases. Residential greenness was assessed using global land cover data. We used a case-control design (i.e., severe versus mild cases) with logistic regression models to assess the association between neighborhood greenness and HFMD severity. Effect modification was also examined. RESULTS: A total of 131,606 cases were included, of whom 130,840 were mild cases and 766 were severe cases. In an unadjusted model, HFMD severity increased with higher proportion of neighborhood greenness (odds ratio, OR = 1.029, 95%CI: 1.009C1.050). The greenness-HFMD severity association remained (OR = 1.031, 95%CI: 1.006C1.057) after adjusting for population density, demographic variables and climate variables. Both population density (Z = 4.148, P < 0.001) and relative humidity (Z = -4.297, P < 0.001) modified the association between neighborhood greenness and HFMD severity. In the stratified analyses, a protective effect (OR = 0.769, 95%CI: 0.687C0.860) of greenness on HFMD severity were found in the subgroup of population density being lower than and equal to 5 ln(no.)/km(2). While in both the subgroups of population density being higher than 5, the greenness had hazard effects (subgroup of > 5 & 7: OR = 1.071, 95%CI: 1.024C1.120; subgroup of > 7: OR = 1.065, 95%CI: 1.034C1.097) on HFMD severity.

There was a proportional relationship between BPV and age, levels of CRP, CK-MB, NT-proBNP, creatinine and in-hospital mortality (all, P < 0.05). In Cox regression analysis, advanced age [&#8805;80 years, hazard ratio (HR) 10.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.264-47.772, P = 0.003] and higher MAPCV (HR 1.617, 95% CI, 1.281-2.040, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: High BPV in COVID-19 patients with hypertension is significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. Advanced age and systemic inflammation are proportional to high BPV. Additional attention is needed for COVID-19 patients with hypertension and high BPV.","output":"Clinical impact of blood pressure variability in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In response to the COVID-19 disaster, people have developed several psychological problems mainly stress, anxiety, and depression. These psychological problems have been seen in either normal people during the lockdown (who are waiting to get infected with COVID-19) and patients with COVID-19 (who are waiting for death). These psychological problems adversely affect immune functions causing more increase in the severity of COVID-19 associated disorders and death rates. Increasing the aerobic capacity is one of the effective methods that could be used to decrease stress, anxiety, and depression. Besides, increasing the aerobic capacity increases immune functions through autonomic regulation. Thus, this review was developed to summarize the effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on psycho-immune hormones commonly disturbed in people during the lockdown or patients with COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was carried out by searching through Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials, literature reviews, and systematic reviews. The search included the possible effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the functions of psycho-immune hormones. RESULTS: This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity can decrease psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 and increase immune functions by modulating the levels of glucocorticoid, oxytocin, insulin, thyroid hormones. CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrated that increasing the aerobic capacity is a recommended treatment for decreasing the psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 because it has the potential for decreasing psychological problems and improving immune functions which would help counter COVID-19.","output":"Effects of increasing aerobic capacity on improving psychological problems seen in patients with COVID-19: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the spring of 2020, COVID-19 spread rapidly through a long-term care facility in Massachusetts. 74 (of 134 total) residents tested positive, with 72 testing positive in the first three weeks of the outbreak.

However, published biomarkers require the measurement of many genes, thereby making it difficult to implement them in clinical practice. This study aims to identify a single-gene biomarker with a high diagnostic accuracy equivalent to multi-gene biomarkers.In this study, we combined an integrated genomic analysis of 1071 individuals with in vitro experiments using well-established infection models.We identified a single-gene biomarker, IFI27, which had a high prediction accuracy (91%) equivalent to that obtained by multi-gene biomarkers. In vitro studies showed that IFI27 was upregulated by TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, antigen-presenting cells that responded to influenza virus rather than bacteria. In vivo studies confirmed that IFI27 was expressed in influenza patients but not in bacterial infection, as demonstrated in multiple patient cohorts (n=521). In a large prospective study (n=439) of patients presented with undifferentiated respiratory illness (aetiologies included viral, bacterial and non-infectious conditions), IFI27 displayed 88% diagnostic accuracy (AUC) and 90% specificity in discriminating between influenza and bacterial infections.IFI27 represents a significant step forward in overcoming a translational barrier in applying genomic assay in clinical setting; its implementation may improve the diagnosis and management of respiratory infection.","output":"A novel immune biomarker IFI27 discriminates between influenza and bacteria in patients with suspected respiratory infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is no universally accepted method to assess the pressure-generating capacity of inspiratory muscles in children on mechanical ventilation (MV), and no study describing its evolution over time in this population. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we have assessed the function of the inspiratory muscles in children on various modes of MV. During brief airway occlusion maneuvers, we simultaneously recorded airway pressure depression at the endotracheal tube (Paw, force generation) and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi, central respiratory drive) over five consecutive inspiratory efforts. The neuro-mechanical efficiency ratio (NME, Paw/EAdi(max)) was also computed. The evolution over time of these indices in a group of children in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was primarily described. As a secondary objective, we compared these values to those measured in a group of children in the operating room (OR). RESULTS: In the PICU group, although median NME(occl) decreased over time during MV (regression coefficient ? 0.016, p = 0.03), maximum Paw(max) remained unchanged (regression coefficient 0.109, p = 0.50). Median NME(occl) at the first measurement in the PICU group (after 21 h of MV) was significantly lower than at the only measurement in the OR group (1.8 cmH(2)O/V, Q(1)CQ(3) 1.3C2.4 vs. 3.7 cmH(2)O/V, Q(1)CQ(3) 3.5C4.2; p = 0.015). Maximum Paw(max) in the PICU group was, however, not significantly different from the OR group (35.1 cmH(2)O, Q(1)CQ(3) 21C58 vs. 31.3 cmH(2)O, Q(1)CQ(3) 28.5C35.5; p = 0.982). CONCLUSIONS: The function of inspiratory muscles can be monitored at the bedside of children on MV using brief airway occlusions. Inspiratory muscle efficiency was significantly lower in critically ill children than in children undergoing elective surgery, and it decreased over time during MV in critically ill children. This suggests that both critical illness and MV may have an impact on inspiratory muscle efficiency.","output":"Evolution of inspiratory muscle function in children during mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Ureteral injury is the most common urological complication of pelvic surgery, with a reported incidence during colon resection of 0.3-1.5%. Ureteral stenting is commonly performed preoperatively to prevent ureteral injury. Because tactile sensation is not reliable during laparoscopic surgery, the effect of the ureteral stent is considered limited. Recently, fluorescence imaging has been used in laparoscopic surgery. The Near-Infrared Ray Catheter (NIRC?) fluorescent ureteral catheter (NIRFUC) is a new catheter with built-in NIR fluorescent resin. This pilot study was performed to evaluate the utility of fluorescence ureteral navigation using the NIRFUC during laparoscopic colorectal surgery. METHODS We evaluated the intraoperative utility of the NIRFUC and the short-term outcomes in 20 patients treated with colorectal surgery at Kawaguchi Municipal Medical Center between February and July 2020. In all, 18 patients with malignant tumors and 2 patients with benign disease, i.e., a sigmoid colovesical fistula, were included. Ten patients developed preoperative intestinal obstruction. One patient experienced preoperative perforation. Nine patients developed preoperative peritumoral abscesses. Laparoscopic surgery was performed with the VISERA ELITE2 system. RESULTS In all cases, the ureters were very clearly identified as fluorescent without the need for dissection. In all cases, only a moment was required to identify the ureter by fluorescence observation. In all cases, R0 resection was performed. The mean surgical duration was 334 min (161-1014), the mean blood loss was 10 ml (1-500), and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 11 days (8-47). There were no cases of ureteral injury. CONCLUSION The NIRFUC was very clearly identified as fluorescent in a moment during surgery without dissection around the ureter. Fluorescence ureteral navigation using the NIRFUC may make colorectal surgery easier and facilitate completion of complex minimally invasive surgery, especially during surgery in patients with invasion of the surrounding tissue or a history of pelvic surgery or radiation.","output":"Ureteral navigation using a fluorescent ureteral catheter during laparoscopic colorectal surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to study the factors that affect college students due to confinement due to the COVID 19 pandemic.

With the outbreak of COVID-19, many proposed models for eye location and state evaluation based on facial landmarks are unreliable due to mask coverings. In this paper, we proposed a robust facial landmark location model for eye location and state evaluation. First, we develop an existing lightweight face alignment model for eye key point locations that is robust in large poses. Then, to develop the performance of our model in a complex driving environment such as an environment with mask coverings, changing illumination, etc., we design a method to augment the training data set based on the original landmark data set without any extra cost. Finally, some facial landmarks around the eyes are extracted, and the eye aspect ratio (EAR) is introduced to evaluate the eye state based on eye key points. The experiment shows that our model achieves significantly improved landmark location performance on a driving simulation data set due to data augmentation. We tested our model on the BioID data set to measure the eye state evaluation performance, and the results showed that our model obtained satisfactory performance with an accuracy of approximately 97.7%. Further testing on the driving simulation data set shows that our model is robust in different driving scenarios with an average accuracy of approximately 93.9%.

The homoaggregates were represented as small colloidal clusters with well-defined structures or as clusters generated by randomly packing spheres using Monte Carlo method. The heteroaggregates were modeled as microparticles coated with nanoparticles. Surface element integration technique was adopted to calculate DerjaguinCLandauCVerweyCOverbeek (DLVO) interaction energies for the homoaggregates and heteroaggregates at different ionic strengths. Results show that attached homoaggregates on the planar surface at primary minima are irreversible to reduction in solution ionic strength whether the primary spheres of the homoaggregates are nano- or micro-sized. Heteroaggregation of nanoparticles with a microparticle can cause DLVO interaction energy to decrease monotonically with separation distance at low ionic strengths (e.g., ?0.01 M), indicating that the heteroaggregates experience repulsive forces at all separation distances. Therefore, attachment of the heteroaggregates at primary minima can be detached upon reduction in ionic strength. Additionally, we showed that the adhesive forces and torques that the aforementioned heteroaggregates experience can be significantly smaller than those experienced by the microspheres without attaching nanoparticles, thus, the heteroaggregates are readily detached via hydrodynamic drag. Results of study provide plausible explanation for the observations in the literature that attached/aggregated particles can be detached/redispersed from primary minima upon reduction in ionic strength, which challenges the common belief that attachment/aggregation of particles in primary minima is chemically irreversible.","output":"Heteroaggregation of microparticles with nanoparticles changes the chemical reversibility of the microparticles attachment to planar surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown measures can differentially affect mental wellbeing in populations depending on individual determinants.

During the COVID-19 pandemic teaching has been offered in a virtual format and clinical placements have been restricted. Our aim was to survey medical educators regarding these changes, seeking their views on resources and skills required for virtual teaching, student engagement, and adaptations to placements.Method73 medical educators who had undertaken teaching or clinical supervision were invited to complete an anonymous online survey during December 2020. The survey consisted of Likert scale and open space questions surrounding changes necessitated by the pandemic. Following survey closure quantitative data were analysed using Google Forms and Excel. Qualitative data from the survey were reviewed by all team members to identify relevant themes.ResultOverall response rate was 40% (29), with participants from 5 NHS trusts. 72% (21) of educators felt they had adequate equipment and resources to facilitate virtual teaching. 55% (16) felt they had adequate training and skills to use virtual teaching platforms effectively. However only 17% (5) felt that students were able to engage in virtual teaching to the same extent as face to face sessions, and just 35% (10) of educators reported enjoying virtual teaching. 76% (22) agreed that information from the University about adjustments to clinical placements was adequate. 66% (19) felt that there had been adequate support to ensure the safety of students, supervisors and patients. However only 20% (6) felt that students had adequate patient contact and 69% (20) did not feel that students had been able meet their clinical competencies.ConclusionOur results suggest that the majority of educators have not enjoyed teaching virtually, and feel that students were less engaged. However educators were able to identify some benefits, such as inviting speakers from outside the local area, improved access to manager's hearings and tribunals and the use of simulated patients. There were also innovative suggestions, such as interactive quizzes and feedback polls within sessions. Most educators felt students had not received adequate patient contact during the pandemic and suggestions for improvement were less readily identified, they included changes to work place based assessments and timetabling.

Increased availability and use could lead to an increase in exposures. Potential effects on a South African Poison Information Helpline were unknown, therefore a study was performed to describe changes in call volume and profile of poison exposures. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on an observational database of telephone enquiries. All human-related poisoning exposure call data collected from 01 March to 31 August during 2018, 2019 and 2020 were extracted and analysed. Summary statistics were used to describe all variables. RESULTS: The total number of calls were 5137, 5508, and 5181 in 2018, 2019, 2020, respectively. The monthly call number during 2020 was mostly less than in 2019. More calls were received from the public calls (39.4% vs 33.1%) and for accidental exposures (65.6% vs 62.3%) increased during 2020 compared to 2019. Exposures to pharmaceuticals decreased by 14.8% from 2019 to 2020, while exposures to eucalyptus oil more than doubled from 21 in 2019 to 43 during 2020. Exposures to antiseptics and disinfectants increased by 60.4%, mainly due to hand sanitisers exposure which showed a 26-fold increase from 2019 (n = 6) to 2020 (n = 156). CONCLUSION: A change in the profile of poison exposures was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdown regulations and greater availability of antiseptics and disinfectants probably led to the increase in exposures.

The differences in prothrombotic potential between SARS-CoV-2 and non-CoV-2-RV have not been well characterised. We compared the thrombotic rates between these two groups of patients directly and further delved into their coagulation profiles. In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, all consecutive COVID-19 and non-CoV-2-RV patients admitted between January 15th and April 10th 2020 were included. Coagulation parameters studied were prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and its associated clot waveform analysis (CWA) parameter, min1, min2 and max2. In the COVID-19 (n = 181) group there were two (1.0 event/1000-hospital-days) myocardial infarction events while one (1.8 event/1000-hospital-day) was reported in the non-CoV-2-RV (n = 165) group. These events occurred in patients who were severely ill. There were no venous thrombotic events. Coagulation parameters did not differ throughout the course of mild COVID-19. However, CWA parameters were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 compared with mild disease, suggesting hypercoagulability (min1: 6.48%/s vs 5.05%/s, P < 0.001; min2: 0.92%/s2 vs 0.74%/s2, P = 0.033). In conclusion, the thrombotic rates were low and did not differ between COVID-19 and non-CoV-2-RV patients. The hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is a highly dynamic process with the highest risk occurring when patients were most severely ill. Such changes in haemostasis could be detected by CWA.

There were 86,371 care home residents contributing data in 2020, with 29,662 deaths; 83,419 (97%) were matched on age, gender and general practice with 312,607 community-dwelling adults. Main outcome measures: All-cause mortality. Analysis was by Poisson regression adjusting for age, gender, long-term conditions, region, year and calendar week. Results: The highest first wave age-specific mortality rate was 6.02 (95% confidence interval 5.97 to 6.07) per 100 patients per week in men aged 95-104 years between 13th-19th April 2020. Compared with community-dwelling controls, the adjusted rate ratio for mortality of care home residents was 4.95 (4.62 to 5.32) in February 2020, increasing to 8.34 (7.95 to 8.74) in April 2020, declining to 3.93 (3.68 to 4.20) in December 2020.

Objective success was confirmed by review of waveform capnography, with the presence of a 4-phase waveform greater than 5mmHg. Sensitivity and specificity of the field provider's assessment of success were then calculated. RESULTS A total of 344 supraglottic airway attempts were reviewed. No patients met obvious death criteria. 269 attempts (85.1%) met criteria for both subjective and objective success. 19 attempts (5.6%) were recognized failures by the EMS provider. 47 (13.8%) airways were misplaced but unrecognized by the EMS provider. 4 attempts (1.2%) were correctly placed but misidentified as failures, leading to the unnecessary removal and replacement of the airway. Sensitivity of the provider's assessment was 98.5%; specificity was 28.7%. CONCLUSION The use of supraglottic airway devices results in unrecognized failed placement. Appropriate utilization and review of waveform capnography may remedy a potential blind-spot in patient safety, and systemic monitoring/feedback processes may therefore be used to prevent unrecognized misplaced airways.","output":"Unrecognized failed airway management using a supraglottic airway device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ISSUE: Both the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization's (JCAHO) patient safety goal and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) guidelines recommend monitoring of hand hygiene adherence and providing feedback to patient care staff. In order to advance patient safety and HH compliance, a three-pronged approach was implemented to enhance HH education, observation and measurement of HH compliance. PROJECT: Three components were implemented to improve compliance with HH practices: Education Component (Phase I) Development and implementation of a mandatory computer-based learning module on hand hygiene for all patient care staff that included HH's Top Ten List based on CDC's Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings, 2002 Focused and targeted educational program for fellows, residents and mid-level providers including staff in invasive procedural areas Special educational HH program in Spanish for spanish-speaking staff Training of unit-based HH observers (100) using the Train-the-Trainer model Focus on HH compliance during Patient Safety Week Campaign in March 2005 Evaluation Component (Phase II) Three HH observational periods for assessment of HH compliance by trained HH monitors and infection control practitioners in all patient care areas Monthly self-assessment in patient care area units and diagnostic areas Communication and Feedback of Results Component (Phase III) Communication to staff, managers and administration regarding HH violations and compliance rates Prompt follow-up with re-education in patient care areas where HH violations rates were lower than expected. RESULTS: In Phase I, 100% of patient care staff complied with HH computer-based training. A total of 100 unit-based HH observers were trained using the Train-the-Trainer approach with education on HH basics, use of HH tool and feedback to colleagues and peers. In Phases II and III, observational periods with assessment of HH compliance were implemented by the trained HH observer of each clinical area. Data from observation periods, demonstrated an incremental improvement in HH practices with an initial baseline of 79% and an average of 91% in subsequent periods. LESSONS LEARNED: A coordinated systems approach that includes patient care staff, physicians, committees and administration is essential when initiating a process change. Providing education and feedback to staff and physicians will improve compliance.

However, the etiology of severe COVID-19 has been largely unknown. Similar as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also thought derived from bat coronaviruses. However, it is not pathogenic for bat at all, because free DNA in cytoplasm or blood cannot bring up violent immune response in bat; but it can produce severe inflammations in human. I hypothesized that the damage induced by free DNA is a reason for severe COVID-19, which can explain many symptoms of this disease, such as cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and muscus plug, acute injuries of heart, liver and kidney, and some special symptoms of COVID-19.

The role of retromer in the retrograde sorting of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR, also known as IGF2R) from endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network remains controversial. Here, by applying knocksideways technology, we develop a method for acute retromer inactivation. While retromer knocksideways in HeLa and H4 human neuroglioma cells resulted in time-resolved defects in cell surface sorting of GLUT1, we failed to observe a quantifiable defect in CI-MPR sorting. In contrast, knocksideways of the ESCPE-1 complex - a key regulator of retrograde CI-MPR sorting - revealed time-resolved defects in CI-MPR sorting. Together, these data are consistent with a comparatively limited role for retromer in ESCPE-1-mediated CI-MPR retrograde sorting, and establish a methodology for acute retromer and ESCPE-1 inactivation that will aid the time-resolved dissection of their functional roles in endosomal cargo sorting.","output":"Acute inactivation of retromer and ESCPE-1 leads to time-resolved defects in endosomal cargo sorting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To describe the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with the progression of COVID-19 in elderly diabetes patients.

We estimate two effects of the pandemic on mortality: (1) excess mortality during 2020 and (2) the age- and cause-specific components of life expectancy decline in 2020. We calculate excess mortality in 2020 as the difference between the registered number of deaths in 2020 and the expected number of deaths from a Poisson regression model based on weekly death counts and population exposures by age and sex from 2016 to 2019. Using decomposition techniques, we estimate age- and cause-specific components (distinguishing COVID-19-related deaths from deaths from other causes) of life expectancy decline in 2020. Our results show that excess mortality in 2020 almost entirely results from the second, autumn-winter wave of the epidemic in Croatia. Expectedly, we find the highest excess in deaths in older age groups. In Croatia, life expectancy in 2020 fell by almost eight months for men and about seven months for women. This decline is mostly attributable to COVID-19-related mortality in older ages, especially among men. ?

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with FMT failure and to develop and validate a prediction model for FMT failure. METHODS Patient characteristics, CDI history, FMT characteristics, and outcomes data for patients treated between 2011 and 2015 at three academic tertiary referral centers were prospectively collected. Early FMT failure was defined as non-response or recurrence of diarrhea associated with positive stool C. difficile toxin or PCR within 1 month of FMT. Late FMT failure was defined as recurrence of diarrhea associated with positive stool C. difficile toxin or PCR between 1 and 3 months of the FMT. Patient data from two centers were used to determine independent predictors of FMT failure and to build a prediction model. A risk index was constructed based on coefficients of final predictors. The patient cohort from the third center was used to validate the prediction model. RESULTS Of 328 patients in the developmental cohort, 73.5% (N=241) were females with a mean age of 61.419.3 years; 19.2% (N=63) had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and 23.5% (N=77) were immunocompromised. The indication for FMT was recurrent CDI in 87.2% (N=286) and severe or severe-complicated in 12.8% (N=42). FMT was performed as an inpatient in 16.7% (N=54). The stool source was patient-directed donors in 40% (N=130) of cases. The early FMT failure rate was 18.6%, and the late failure rate was 2.7%. In the multivariable analysis, predictors of early FMT failure included severe or severe-complicated CDI (odds ratio (OR) 5.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.26-15.62), inpatient status during FMT (OR 3.78, 95% CI: 1.55-9.24), and previous CDI-related hospitalization (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.18-1.75); with each additional hospitalization, the odds of failure increased by 43%. Risk scores ranged from 0 to 13, with 0 indicating low risk, 1-2 indicating moderate risk, and 3 indicating high risk. In the developmental cohort, early FMT failure rates were 5.6% for low risk, 12.7% for moderate risk, and 41% for high-risk patients. Of 134 patients in the validation cohort, 57% (N=77) were females with a mean age of 6618.1 years; 9.7% (N=13) had IBD, and 17.9% (N=24) were immunocompromised. The early FMT failure rate at 1 month was 19.4%, with an additional 3% failing by 3 months. In the validation cohort, FMT failure rates were 2.1% for low risk, 16.1% for moderate risk, and 35.7% for high risk patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for FMT failure was 0.81 in the developmental cohort and 0.84 in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS Severe and severe-complicated indication, inpatient status during FMT, and the number of previous CDI-related hospitalizations are strongly associated with early failure of a single FMT for CDI. The novel prediction model has good discriminative power at identifying individuals who are at high risk of failure after FMT therapy and may assist the treating physician in subsequent management plans.","output":"Predictors of Early Failure After Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for the Therapy of Clostridium Difficile Infection: A Multicenter Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ubiquitination of proteins, like phosphorylation and acetylation, is an important regulatory aspect influencing numerous and various cell processes, such as immune response signaling and autophagy. The study of ubiquitination has become essential to learning about hostCpathogen interactions, and a better understanding of the detailed mechanisms through which pathogens affect ubiquitination processes in host cell will contribute to vaccine development and effective treatment of diseases. Pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Salmonella enterica, Legionella pneumophila and Shigella flexneri) encode many effector proteins, such as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), targeting the host ubiquitin machinery and thus disrupting pertinent ubiquitin-dependent anti-bacterial response. We focus here upon the host ubiquitination system as an integral unit, its interconnection with the regulation of inflammation and autophagy, and primarily while examining pathogens manipulating the host ubiquitination system. Many bacterial effector proteins have already been described as being translocated into the host cell, where they directly regulate host defense processes. Due to their importance in pathogenic bacteria progression within the host, they are regarded as virulence factors essential for bacterial evasion.

However, the intraocular pressure (IOP) changes caused by face masks remain unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of wearing surgical and FFP2/N95 face masks during a 400-m walking protocol on IOP in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. METHODS: Thirteen subjects diagnosed of POAG (21 eyes) were enrolled in this study. IOP was measured at baseline, during the 400-m walking protocol and after 5 min of passive recovery while POAG patients wore a surgical mask, FFP2/N95 mask and no mask in randomized order. From the 21 POAG eyes, we analyzed the IOP changes caused by physical exercise with two face masks and without wearing any face mask. RESULTS: At rest (baseline and recovery measurements), the use of the different face masks did not affect IOP levels (mean differences ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 mmHg). During physical activity, wearing an FFP2/N95 mask caused a small (mean differences ranging from 1 to 2 mmHg), but statistically significant, IOP rise in comparison to both the surgical mask and control conditions (Cohen's d = 0.63 and 0.83, respectively). CONCLUSION: Face masks must be used to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and POAG patients can safely use FFP2/N95 and surgical masks at rest. However, due to the IOP rise observed while walking with the FFP2/N95 mask, when possible, POAG patients should prioritized the use of surgical masks during physical activity.","output":"Intraocular pressure responses to walking with surgical and FFP2/N95 face masks in primary open-angle glaucoma patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A method for releasing tethered liposomes from a supported lipid bilayer in response to a light stimulus is described.

Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are imperative for identifying and managing infected individuals, contact tracing, epidemiologic characterization, and public health decision making. Laboratory testing may be performed based on symptomatic presentation or for screening of asymptomatic people. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), which requires specialized equipment and training and may be particularly challenging in resource-limited settings. NAAT may give false-negative results due to timing of sample collection relative to infection, improper sampling of respiratory specimens, inadequate preservation of samples, and technical limitations; false-positives may occur due to technical errors, particularly contamination during the manual real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) process. Thus, clinical presentation, contact history and contemporary phyloepidemiology must be considered when interpreting results. Several sample-to-answer platforms, including high-throughput systems and Point of Care (PoC) assays, have been developed to increase testing capacity and decrease technical errors. Alternatives to RT-PCR assay, such as other RNA detection methods and antigen tests may be appropriate for certain situations, such as resource-limited settings. While sequencing is important to monitor on-going evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, antibody assays are useful for epidemiologic purposes.

Design: We included UAL to usual anthropometric measurements during a Mauritanian national 6-59-month-old cross-sectional nutritional survey. Children were classified into 3 groups UALG1, UALG2 and UALG3 according to the following UAL limits: [] 150 mm, 151-180, and > 180mm respectively. We used a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to determine the best MUAC cut-off for each group with weight-for-height Z score as a reference standard. We compared the wasting prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, of all diagnostic methods. Findings: In total, 12 619 children were included in the study. Wasting prevalence was 16.1%, 5.0% and 12.5% when diagnosed by WHZ < -2, MUAC < 125 mm and MUAC-UALG methods respectively. Using the MUAC-UALG method increased the sensitivity for wasting diagnosis from 17.98 % with MUAC < 125 mm to 39.43% with MUAC-UALG. The specificity decreased from 97.49% with MUAC < 125 to 92.71% with MUAC-UALG. With MUAC-height Z score and MUAC < 138 mm, sensitivity was 26.04% and 69.76%and specificity were 97.40%and 75.64% respectively.

A novel pneumonia (COVID-19) which is sweeping the globe was started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Most deaths occurred in severe and critically cases, but information on prognostic risk factors for severe ill patients is incomplete. Further research is urgently needed to guide clinicians, so we prospectively evaluate the clinical outcomes of 114 severe ill patients with COVID-19 for short-term in the Union Hospital in Wuhan, China. Methods. In this single-centered, prospective and observational study, we enrolled 114 severe ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Jan 23, 2020 to February 22, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic and laboratory information were collected at baseline, data on treatment and outcome were collected until the day of death or discharge or for the first 28 days after severe ill diagnosis, whichever was shorter. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of poor outcome. Results. Among enrolled 114 patients, 94 (82.5%) had good outcome while 20 (17.5%) had poor outcome. No significant differences were showed in age, gender and the prevalence of coexisting disorders between outcome groups. Results of multivariate Cox analyses indicated that higher levels of oxygen saturation (HR, 0.123; 95% CI, 0.041-0.369), albumin (HR, 0.060; 95% CI, 0.008-0.460) and arterial partial pressure of oxygen (HR, 0.321; 95% CI, 0.106-0.973) were associated with decreased risk of developing poor outcome within 28 days. In the other hand, higher levels of leucocytes (HR, 5.575; 95% CI, 2.080-14.943), neutrophils (HR, 2.566; 95% CI, 1.022-6.443), total bilirubin (HR, 6.171; 95% CI, 2.458-15.496), globulin (HR, 2.526; 95% CI, 1.027-6.211), blood urea nitrogen (HR, 5.640; 95% CI, 2.193-14.509), creatine kinase-MB (HR, 3.032; 95% CI, 1.203-7.644), lactate dehydrogenase (HR, 4.607; 95% CI, 1.057-20.090), hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (HR, 5.023; 95% CI, 1.921-13.136), lactate concentration (HR,15.721; 95% CI, 2.099-117.777), Interleukin-10 (HR, 3.551; 95% CI, 1.280-9.857) and C-reactive protein (HR, 5.275; 95% CI, 1.517-18.344) were associated with increased risk of poor outcome development.

We examined those perceptions among Students of Agronomy, Soil, and Environmental Sciences (SASES). The goals were to determine how changes in education during the COVID-19 pandemic, i) changed student perceptions of online education, ii) shifted student comfort with online education and communication, and iii) highlighted issues limiting student success. A link to an online survey was sent to SASES members in late 2020 resulting in 31 responses. Course format shifted from mostly face-to-face delivery to synchronous and asynchronous online delivery following the COVID-19 shutdown. Students perceived decreased instructor effort and increased student effort. Nearly all students had access to devices. However, access to fast, reliable internet was a common issue. A small percentage of students were more likely to take online courses after the pandemic, yet a majority were now more comfortable taking online classes and using virtual meeting software. Student concern for COVID-19 was low. However, most reported wearing masks in buildings and on campus. Students reported increases and decreases in hours worked, with both changes resulting in perceived positive and negative academic impacts.

A major policy question is whether e-scooters substitute existing mobility options or fill the service gaps left by them. This study addresses this question by analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of e-scooter service availability and use in Washington DC, focusing on their spatial relationships with public transit and bikesharing. Results from an analysis of three open big datasets suggest that e-scooters have both competing and complementary effects on transit and bikesharing services. The supply of e-scooters significantly overlaps with the service areas of transit and bikesharing, and we classify a majority of e-scooter trips as substitutes to transit and bikesharing uses. A travel-time-based analysis further reveals that when choosing e-scooters over transit, travelers pay a price premium and save some travel time. The price premium is greater during the COVID-19 pandemic but the associated travel-time savings are smaller. This implies that public health considerations rather than time-cost tradeoffs are the main driver for many to choose e-scooters over transit during COVID. In addition, we find that e-scooters complement bikesharing and transit by providing services to underserved neighborhoods. A sizeable proportion (about 10 percent) of e-scooter trips are taken to connect with the rail services. Future research may combine the big-data-based analysis presented here with traditional methods to further shed light on the interactions between e-scooter services, bikesharing, and public transit.","output":"Do e-scooters fill mobility gaps and promote equity before and during COVID-19?

Much of the direct or indirect impact is potentially in reductions in healthcare encounters for services such as preventive care. Here, we quantified changes in cancer screening rates to better understand the impact of the evolving COVID-19 implications and shifts in health-seeking behaviors. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of cancer screening rates during March-June 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and March-June 2020 (post-COVID-19 restrictions), using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database which includes Medicare and commercially insured members. Members meeting age and/or sex criteria as detailed in the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, and cervical cancer screening represented the eligible membership for screening. Procedure and laboratory services were used to identify those who received cancer screening. Analyses were conducted cross-sectionally by cancer screening type. Results:Eligible cohorts were identified from insured members within March-June 2019 and 2020 (2019: 17,931,318;2020: 17,521,411). The percent of eligible members screened in March-June 2019 was 19.3%, 9.4%, 16.7%, 0.4%, and 7.8% for breast, cervical, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer, respectively. Changes in screening rates from 2019 to 2020 are summarized in Table, with the sharpest decline in April. The percent change from 2019 to 2020 during the combined March-June period for each cancer screening type was statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: Routine cancer screening rates from March-June 2020 showed meaningful reductions when compared to the same period in 2019, with substantial declines during the initial peak of the pandemic in April. These declines may be impacted by variations in regional restrictions with tighter restrictions leading to larger screening declines and loosening restrictions reflecting catch-up screening.

Generally, there is a low rate of bonafide co-infections in early COVID-19 pulmonary infection as currently appreciated. Reports of high co-infection rates must be tempered by limitations in current diagnostic methods since amplification technologies do not necessarily confirm live pathogen and may be subject to considerable laboratory variation. Some laboratory methods may not exclude commensal microbes. Concurrent serodiagnoses have long been of concern for accuracy in these contexts. Presumed virus co-infections are not specific to COVID-19. The association of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in co-infection has been considerably variable during influenza season. Other respiratory virus co-infections have generally occurred in less than 10% of COVID-19 patients. Early COVID-19 disease is more commonly associated with bacterial co-pathogens that typically represent usual respiratory micro-organisms. Late infections, especially among severe clinical presentations, are more likely to be associated with nosocomial or opportunistic pathogens given the influence of treatments that can include antibiotics, antivirals, immunomodulating agents, blood products, immunotherapy, steroids, and invasive procedures. As anticipated, hospital care carries risk for multi-resistant bacteria. Overall, co-pathogen identification is linked with longer hospital stay, greater patient complexity, and adverse outcomes. As for other viral infections, a general reduction in the use of empiric antibiotic treatment is warranted.

As most of the current medical image segmentation models are limited in the U-shaped structure, to some extent the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure design is hard to be accomplished. The design in this study mimics the way the wave is elastomeric propagating, extending the structure from both the horizontal and spatial dimensions for realizing the Elastomeric UNet (EUNet) structure. The EUNet can be divided into two types: horizontal EUNet and spatial EUNet, based on the propagation direction. The advantages of this design are threefold. First, the training structure can be deepened effectively. Second, the independence brought by each branch (a U-shaped design) makes the flexible design redundancy available. Finally, a horizontal and vertical series-parallel structure helps on feature accumulation and recursion. Researchers can adjust the design according to the requirements to achieve better segmentation performance for the independent structural design.

If everyone currently eligible were screened, close to 48,000 lives could be saved. Interestingly, pre-COVID-19 17% of the individuals getting screened for lung cancer were Black, and post-COVID-19 36% are Black. This study aims to explore potential reasons for this sudden increase in low-dose CT lung cancer screenings in Black patients by examining variables in the electronic health record and by interviewing pundits in clinical oncology practice. Methods: 416 deidentified electronic health records were collected from a data repository at the Medical College of Wisconsin. We analyzed low-dose CT screening for lung cancer among Black and white patients pre- and post-COVID-19 (4 cohorts). The post-COVID-19 cohorts looked at screening from 1/1/2020-7/8/2021, compared to a proportionate time frame pre-COVID-19 (1/1/2018-7/8/2019). Because of low numbers of other racial/ethnic backgrounds (Asian, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, etc.), only Black and white patients were examined in this study. Variables examined include insurance status, marital status, age, COVID-19 testing or diagnosis, gender, employment status, comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and hypertension), and lung cancer diagnosis. Results: Employment status, lung cancer diagnosis, and gender were all significantly different between Black and white cohorts preCOVID-19. Post-COVID-19, similar differences are seen in employment status, while patterns in lung cancer diagnosis, gender, and insurance status are contradictory. Black patients pre-COVID-19 had a higher incidence of being men and a lower incidence of lung cancer diagnosis. On the contrary, post-COVID-19 Black patients have a higher incidence of being women and lung cancer diagnosis, and additionally a higher incidence of Medicare use. Despite the drastic differences in healthcare before and after COVID-19, COVID-19 testing and diagnosis did not appear to be linked to increased lung cancer screenings for Black patients. However, in conversations with thoracic surgeons and community health workers, we learned of significant screening efforts within Black populations due to grants funded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: In this study, insurance status was the strongest difference between the pre- and post-COVID-19 Black cohorts. In a conversation with thoracic surgeons, we learned that a major initiative was launched post-COVID-19 that increased insurance access for Black populations. Increasing access to healthcare appears to be a promising first step in eradicating lung cancer disparities in Black populations. So, this research could serve as a guidepost to provide policymakers, researchers and healthcare providers, as well as patients and families, with data that pinpoints where future resources should be aimed in the effort to end lung cancer and its corresponding health disparities.","output":"Changes in low-dose CT lung cancer screening patterns post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"South African higher education (HE) cannot be compared to any other country's HE systems due to the unique political landscape and structural narrative that it has undergone. Subsequent to the reorganisation of HEIs in 2004, a number of complexities arose. These included accessibility to education across race and the alignment of the South African HEIs to global pedagogic benchmarks. With the changing political landscape, transformations within higher education, socio economic inequities and changes in the workplace, researchers failed to cognize the impact of these factors on graduate employability. Changing graduate attributes to align with a decolonised curriculum and Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) workspaces were transiently underway when COVID-19 set a new narrative for the future of employability. This paper seeks to identify the impact of workplace changes and its direct influence on successful graduate employment and integration into the HE curriculum. The work environment has cursorily moved from 4IR to an advanced stage of the 4IR, where there is a full emphasis on digitisation, non-localised workspaces and is an ostensible playground for digital natives (Generation Z). This paper provides a systematic review of literature in the South African HE contexts that pertains to graduate attributes for employability within the workplace. The adoption of malleable secondary data will allow for an understanding of the relationship between changing workplace environments and expectations from graduates. This correlation is directly linked to graduate attributes which students need to comply with from year one. The paper will provide context to changes which are required for the future success of graduates, and whether graduate attributes are adequate preparation for employability. A clinical model is recommended with an intervention to manage the risk factors of decolonisation of curriculum, the 4IR and multi-generational workplace and responses to COVID-19. ? 2021 Deakin University.

This report casts these questions in a new light as it describes that selenok is able -both in vitro and in vivo- to cleave some of its own peptide bonds. The cleavages not only release selenok segments that contain its reactive Sec, but as the specific cleavage sites were identified, they proved to cluster tightly near sites through which selenok interacts with protein partners.

In the past, this population has been the focus of genetic studies showing this trihybrid origin, with greater contributions of Natives and Africans than in other Uruguayan regions. In this study we analyzed eight Alu insertions (A25, ACE, APOA1, B65, D1, F13B, PV92, TPA25) to provide valuable information for ancestrality and genetic differentiation and to compare with both previous studies on the Tacuaremb population and Alu frequencies in other Uruguayan populations. The European contribution to Alu and classical markers was almost equal to that of a previous study using 22 classical markers (63% vs. 65%), while African contribution was higher (30% vs. 15%), and Native American contribution shows an important difference in Alu: 7% versus 20%. We found no significant differences in genetic differentiation between Tacuaremb and Montevideo but significant differences between Tacuaremb and Basque descendants from Trinidad. Our results support previous findings obtained with classical markers that demonstrate the trihybrid composition of the Tacuaremb population, correlated with historical records.

To obtain data on the status of the aforementioned hemostatic factors, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed on COVID-19. After reviewing the evaluation of 348 papers, 28 papers included in the meta-analysis, which was performed using STATA. The analysis showed an increase in VWF: Ag levels in COVID\\\\19 patients. VWF: Ac was higher in all COVID-19 patients, while it was lower in the COVID\\\\19 ICU patients. The pooled mean of VWF: RCO in all patients with COVID-19 was 307.94%. In subgroup analysis, VWF: RCO was significantly higher in ICU patients than in all COVID-19 patients. The pooled mean of ADAMTS-13 activity was 62.47%, and 58.42% in ICU patients. The pooled mean of factor VIII level was 275.8%, which was significantly higher in ICU patients with COVID-19 than all patients with COVID-19. Levels of VWF: Ag, VWF: activity, VWF: ristocetin, and factor VIII are increased in patients with COVID-19.

Microbes, including virus, activate MCs through TLR releasing chemical pro-inflammatory compounds and cytokines. Although, in biomedical literature there are only few reports on MCs activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MC viral activation leads to increase pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis.

A single missense mutation of U to G at nucleotide position 1355 (U1355G) in the spike (S) gene changes leucine to arginine (L452R) in the spike protein. This mutation has been observed in the India and California strains (B.1.617 and B.1.427/B.1.429, respectively). Control of COVID-19 requires rapid and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we established a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay plus a bioluminescent assay in real-time (BART) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and the L452R spike mutation. The specificity and sensitivity of the RT-LAMP-BART assay was evaluated using synthetic RNAs including target sequences and RNA-spiked clinical nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens as well as reference strains representing five viral and four bacterial pathogens. The novel RT-LAMP-BART assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 was highly specific compared to the conventional real-time RT-PCR. Within 25 min, the RT-LAMP-BART assay detected 80 copies of the target gene in a sample, whereas the conventional real-time RT-PCR method detected 5 copies per reaction within 130 min. Using RNA-spiked specimens, the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP-BART assay was slightly attenuated compared to purified RNA as a template. The results were identical to those of the conventional real-time RT-PCR method. Furthermore, using a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe, the RT-LAMP-BART method correctly identified the L452R spike mutation.

The death of A549 cells induced by A + N morphologically resembles inflammation-inducing pyroptosis - cell destruction triggered by activated caspase-1. The treatment with A + N (or camptothecin) strongly upregulated caspase-1 and its two activators: IFI16 and NLRP1, however, caspase-1 activation was not detected. A549 cells may have been primed for pyroptosis, with the absence of a crucial trigger. The investigation of additional innate immunity elements revealed that A + N (or camptothecin) stimulated the expression of NLRX1, STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and two antiviral proteins, IFIT1 and IFIT3. IFI16 and caspase-1 are coded by p53-regulated genes which led us to investigate regulation of NLRP1, NLRX1, STING, IFIT1 and IFIT3 in p53-dependent mode. The upregulation of NLRP1, NLRX1 and STING was attenuated in p53 knockdown cells. The upsurge of the examined genes, and activation of p53, was inhibited by C16, an inhibitor of PKR kinase. PKR was tested due to its ability to phosphorylate p53 on Ser392. Surprisingly, C16 was active even in PKR knockdown cells. The ability of C16 to prevent activation of p53 and expression of innate immunity genes may be the source of its strong anti-inflammatory action. Moreover, cells exposed to A + N can influence neighboring cells in paracrine fashion, for instance, they shed ectodomain of COL17A1 protein and induce, in p53-dependent mode, the expression of gene for interleukin-7. Further, the activation of p53 also spurred the expression of SOCS1, an inhibitor of interferon triggered STAT1-dependent signaling. We conclude that, stimulation of p53 primes cells for the production of interferons (through upregulation of STING), and may activate negative-feedback within this signaling system by enhancing the production of SOCS1.","output":"Synergistic activation of p53 by actinomycin D and nutlin-3a is associated with the upregulation of crucial regulators and effectors of innate immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) are high-stakes, stressful assessments for both examiners and students under any circumstances During the COVID-19 global pandemic, a UK wide lockdown resulted in a temporary postponement of all veterinary nursing practical assessments, until appropriate procedures and government sanctions permitted OSCEs to be carried out in a safe environment This is a reflective account of holding OSCE style assessments using a social distancing protocol, highlighting the positive impact these measures had on student assessment experience","output":"Reflecting on holding high-stakes OSCE style assessments in a COVID-19 environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Finding conservative T cell epitopes in the proteome of numerous variants of SARS-COV-2 is required to develop T cell activating SARS-COV-2 capable of inducing T cell responses against SARS-COV-2 variants.

It mainly affects the respiratory system with a wide severity range from being asymptomatic to causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Few case reports have reported pulmonary tuberculosis co-infection or reactivation in COVID-19 pneumonia patients(1-2). We present two cases of COVID-19 pneumonia who presented, after the resolution of the acute symptoms, with shortness of breath and were found to have pulmonary cavities, suspicious for tuberculosis (TB). CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1: 76-year-old Brazilian male with multiple comorbidities including COPD on home oxygen, who received the monoclonal antibody infusion (Bamlanivimab) a month ago for mild COVID-19 pneumonia, presented with generalized weakness associated with fever and cough. CT chest showed extensive peribronchiolar and centrilobular patchy and nodular opacities with internal cavities (Figure 1 Right). A previous chest x-ray showed left basal lung scarring (Figure 1 left). Case 2: 71-year-old Columbian male with a history of diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 pneumonia treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir for 10 days, presented 3 months later with dyspnea, fever, and productive cough. X-ray and CT chest showed diffuse nodular opacities with dense consolidation in both upper lobes associated with areas of cavitations (Figure 2 Right). A previous chest x-ray did not show any evidence of prior lung pathologies (Figure 2 Left). Bronchial washing PCR was positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis in both cases. DISCUSSION: Cavitary lung lesions are usually caused by mycobacterial, fungal, neoplastic, or autoimmune pathologies. Viral pneumonia, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, is not a common cause of lung cavities even in severe viral infections (3). Although few case reports have reported cavitary lesions as sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia, common causes should be excluded first. The two most common CT chest findings in COVID-19 patients are ground-glass opacities and bilateral patchy shadowing (4). The presence of lung cavities in such patients should raise the suspicion of TB, especially in high-risk patients. Whether or not the immune system reaction to the COVID-19;including leukopenia, lymphopenia, and an inflammatory cytokine storm can lead to latent TB reactivation is not fully understood yet. However, treatment of COVID-19 with immunosuppressant drugs such as corticosteroids could be a risk factor for TB reactivation. Both of our patients had new lung cavitary lesions with confirmed mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary cavities in COVID-19 pneumonia patients should raise the suspicion of other pathologies such as tuberculosis, especially in high-risk patients.

SWIFT also predicts SpO(2) waveforms with average MSE below .0007. SWIFT provides information on both occurrence and magnitude of potential hypoxemic events 30 minutes in advance, allowing it to be used to inform clinical interventions, patient triaging, and optimal resource allocation. SWIFT may be used in clinical decision support systems to inform the management of critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","output":"SWIFT: A Deep Learning Approach to Prediction of Hypoxemic Events in Critically-Ill Patients Using SpO(2) Waveform Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need for minimally invasive delivery methods is urgent.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between a set of cytokines and the markers of the oxidative stress. Methods: The levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL8, IL-10, VEGF, IFN-, TNF-, IL-1, MCP-1 and EGF were determined by using High Sensitivity Evidence Investigator? Biochip Array technology. The oxidative stress parameters (d-ROM, PAT, OS index) were measured in serum on FRAS5 analytical photometric system. Results: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, MCP-1 and EGF were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the patients with severe COVID-19 with increased levels of IL-2, IFN-y, TNF- and IL-1. The d-ROM, OS index, and PAT were significantly higher (p<0.05) in severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6 demonstrated the strongest correlation with all of the markers of the oxidative stress, d-ROM (r=0.9725, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.5000, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.9593, p=0.012).

Although it facilitates the visualization of discrete variables, it does not allow the calculation of the absolute variation rate. Recently, we demonstrated that the polynomial interpolation method can be used to accurately calculate the daily acceleration of cases and deaths due to COVID-19. This study aimed to measure the diversity of epidemic curves and understand the importance of socioeconomic variables in the acceleration, peak cases, and deaths due to COVID-19 in Brazilian states. METHODS: Epidemiological data for COVID-19 from federative units in Brazil were obtained from the Ministry of Healths website from February 25 to July 11, 2020. Socioeconomic data were obtained from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatstica (https://www.ibge.gov.br/). Using the polynomial interpolation methods, daily cases, deaths and acceleration were calculated. Moreover, the correlation coefficient between the epidemic curve data and socioeconomic data was determined. RESULTS: The combination of daily data and case acceleration determined that Brazilian states were in different stages of the epidemic. Maximum case acceleration, peak of cases, maximum death acceleration, and peak of deaths were associated with the Gini index of the gross domestic product of Brazilian states and population density but did not correlate with the per capita gross domestic product of Brazilian states. CONCLUSIONS: Brazilian states showed heterogeneous data curves. Population density and socioeconomic inequality were correlated with a more rapid exponential growth in new cases and deaths.","output":"COVID-19 epidemic curve in Brazil: a sum of multiple epidemics, whose inequality and population density in the states are correlated with growth rate and daily acceleration.

Indeed, many neuropathic screening tools are primarily based on subjective descriptors to determine the presence of neuropathic pain. There is a need to systematically review and analyse the existing evidence to determine the validity of such descriptors in this cohort. METHODS: Ten databases were systematically searched. The review adhered to PRISMA and CRD guidelines and included a risk of bias assessment using QUADAS-2. Studies were included if they contained symptom descriptors from a group of NLBP patients +/- leg pain. Studies had to include a reference test to identity neuropathic pain from other pain mechanisms. RESULTS: Eight studies of 3099 NLBP patients were included. Allodynia and numbness were found to discriminate between NLBP and nociceptive LBP in four studies. Autonomic dysfunction, (changes in the colour or appearance of the skin), was also found to discriminate between the groups in two studies. Dysesthesia identified NLBP in 5/7 respectively. Results from studies were equivocal regarding pain described as hot/burning cold and paroxysmal pain in people with NLBP. CONCLUSION: Subjectively reported allodynia and numbness would suggest a neuropathic pain mechanism in LBP. Dysesthesia would raise the suspicion of NLBP.

A separate, patient-reported study associated famotidine use with improvements in mild to moderate symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.

RESULTS: The search identified 1,073 articles, 8 of which (a total of 2,126 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled mortality rate of the overall sample was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.08-0.14).

The last three strategies interrupt transmission while the first targets a vulnerable group. Vaccination rates ranged from 0.5% to 4.5% of the population per week, beginning in January or July 2021. Case notifications, NPI adherence, and lockdown periods undergo successive waves during the simulated pandemic. Vaccination reduces median deaths by 32%-77% (22%-63%) for January (July) availability, depending on the scenario. Vaccinating 60+ year-olds first prevents more deaths (up to 8% more) than transmission-interrupting strategies for January vaccine availability across most parameter regimes. In contrast, transmission-interrupting strategies prevent up to 33% more deaths than vaccinating 60+ year-olds first for July availability, due to higher levels of natural immunity by that time. Sensitivity analysis supports the findings. Further research is urgently needed to determine which populations can benefit from using SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to interrupt transmission.","output":"Prioritising COVID-19 vaccination in changing social and epidemiological landscapes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, with a large number of fatality rates, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a potential threat to human health worldwide.

Nevertheless, resolving the importance of indirect and environmental transmission in the ecology of epidemics remains a persistent challenge. It requires accurately measuring the free-living survival of pathogens across reservoirs of various kinds and quantifying the extent to which interaction between hosts and reservoirs generates new infections. These questions are especially salient for emerging pathogens, where sparse and noisy data can obfuscate the relative contribution of different infection routes. In this study, we develop a mechanistic, mathematical model that permits both direct (host-to-host) and indirect (environmental) transmission and then fit this model to empirical data from 17 countries affected by an emerging virus (SARS-CoV-2). From an ecological perspective, our model highlights the potential for environmental transmission to drive complex, nonlinear dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Summarizing, we propose that fitting alternative models with indirect transmission to real outbreak data from SARS-CoV-2 can be useful, as it highlights that indirect mechanisms may play an underappreciated role in the dynamics of infectious diseases, with implications for public health.","output":"Variation in microparasite free-living survival and indirect transmission can modulate the intensity of emerging outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is no doubt that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 is mutating and thus has the potential to adapt during the current pandemic.

The main characteristics of thirty four cases (twenty five women) of Long Covid encountered in 2021 and early 2022 are outlined. The experience of six of them is reported on the basis of notes from their medical records. These six patients were interviewed and each was asked to reread and correct the texts concerning them. This is therefore a descriptive study based on clinical and narrative experience, verified by the patients. Long Covid, the first disease in the history of medicine to be described first by patients themselves on social networks, is not yet precisely defined and the multi -systemic symptoms may be non-specific or vary according to the organs affected. Diagnosis is based on careful listening to the patients history. Previously unknown irrepressible fatigue, brain fog, working memory disorders with possible anomia, anosmia, dysgeusia or other muli-systemic symptoms occurring after an acute Covid are varying characteristics of Long Covid. Biological evidence of Covid is missing in fourteen patients as PCRs may have been not done or came back negative in the acute phase of the disease.

Data collected since 06/2020 include demographics, co-morbidities, laboratory measurements, cancer characteristics, COVID-19 clinical features, management and outcome. Parameters influencing COVID-19 severity/recovery were investigated as well as factors associated with overall survival (OS) upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: This analysis includes 1626 patients from 20 countries (87% from 24 European, 7% from 5 Northern African, 6% from 8 Asian/Oceanian centers), with COVID-19 diagnosis from January 2020 up to May 2021. Median age was 64 years, with 52% female, 57% cancer stage III/IV and 65% receiving active cancer treatment. 64% patients required hospitalization due to COVID-19 diagnosis, with 11% receiving intensive care. In multivariable analysis, male gender, older age, ECOG PS2, BMI<25, presence of co-morbidities, symptomatic disease, as well as haematological malignancies , active/progressive cancer , neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio  6 and OnCovid inflammatory score (OIS)  40 were associated with COVID-19 severity (i.e., severe/moderate disease requiring hospitalization). 98% of patients with mild COVID-19 recovered, as opposed to 71% with severe/moderate disease.

However, there is a growing concern on the differences between the various vaccines that are being offered around the world and their efficacies. The goal of this pedagogical research is to use an inquiry\\\\based approach while developing a case study that sheds light on these concerns. Our approach involved a comprehensive literature search, spanning the past year, using the PubMed Central search engine with COVID AND SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 AND vaccine as descriptors. The search initially yielded 2,127 journal articles which was narrowed to identify articles on vaccine efficacy (1,122). We then examined the statistics of potential vaccines in the pipeline in various countries. Of the ~200 publications thus identified, 5 were clinical trials, 4 randomized controlled trials, 151 reviews with 9 systematic reviews. These articles were screened for the most accurate, peer\\\\reviewed information regarding each vaccine which was then used to construct this case study. Our case study follows a group of fictitious characters \\\\ 3 friends living in the United States with family members abroad. One of the subjects who is living in Illinois is immunocompromised; the other has elderly family members living in India and the third with family members living in the United Kingdom, where there is a new variant of SARS\\\\CoV2. The case study discusses a) types of COVID\\\\19 vaccines available globally, b) efficacy, c) distribution, and d) vaccine campaign. This case study is geared towards undergraduate students in immunology, and allied health programs, graduate students in physiology, nursing and public health, and other professional programs using case\\\\based collaborative learning. With this case, we offer a novel strategy to circumvent COVID\\\\related barriers and move undergraduate research forward, with the caveat that students are not working on their original research hypotheses. The case study research model provides an alternate way to train students in the scientific process to evaluate and identify high\\\\quality research. Further, by addressing the science behind the COVID vaccines, we hope to provide timely information to assist with critical analysis, interpretation and to help navigate the quagmire of information available to the community.","output":"Facilitating Undergraduate Research Using a Case Study Approach \\\\ A Race to Normalcy During the COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Days after COVID-19 physical distancing precautions were implemented, a coalition of community leaders in Baltimore City founded the Baltimore Neighbors Network (BNN), a volunteer network established to provide proactive phone-based support to older adults in Baltimore City.

This study aimed to identify major challenges associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine clinical trials among healthcare workers and staff in Uganda. Methods-a rapid exploratory survey was conducted over 5 weeks among 260 respondents (66% male) from healthcare centers across the country using an online questionnaire. Twenty-seven questions assessed knowledge, confidence, and trust scores on COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials from participants in 46 districts in Uganda. Results-we found low levels of knowledge (i.e., confusing COVID-19 with Ebola) with males being more informed than females (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 0.7-3.0), and mistrust associated with policy decisions to promote herbal treatments in Uganda and the rushed international clinical trials, highlighting challenges for the upcoming Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinations. Knowledge, confidence and trust scores were higher among the least educated (certificate vs. bachelor degree holders). We also found a high level of skepticism and possible community resistance to DNA recombinant vaccines, such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Preference for herbal treatments (38/260; 14.6%, 95% CI: 10.7-19.3) currently being promoted by the Ugandan government raises major policy concerns. High fear and mistrust for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials was more common among wealthier participants and more affluent regions of the country. Conclusion-our study found that knowledge, confidence, and trust in COVID-19 vaccines was low among healthcare workers in Uganda, especially those with higher wealth and educational status. There is a need to increase transparency and inclusive participation to address these issues before new trials of COVID-19 vaccines are initiated.","output":"A Descriptive-Multivariate Analysis of Community Knowledge, Confidence, and Trust in COVID-19 Clinical Trials among Healthcare Workers in Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Latin America accounts for one-quarter of global COVID-19 cases and one-third of deaths. Inequalities in the region lead to barriers regarding the best use of diagnostic tests during the pandemic. There is a need for a simplified guideline, considering the region's health resources' low availability, international guidelines, medical literature, and local expertise. METHODS: Nine experts from Latin American countries developed a simplified algorithm for COVID-19 diagnosis, using a modified Delphi method. Twenty-four questions related to diagnostic settings were proposed, followed by discussion of the literature and experts' experience. RESULTS: The algorithm considers three timeframes (&#8804;7 days, 8-13 days, and &#8805; 14 days) and discusses diagnostic options for each one. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR is the test of choice from day 1 to day 14 after symptom onset or close contact, although antigen testing may be used in particular situations, from days 5 to 7. Antibody assays may be used for confirmation, mainly after day 14. If the clinical suspicion is very high, but other tests are negative, these assays may be used as an adjunct to decision-making from day 8 to day 13. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm aims to support COVID-19 diagnosis decision-making in Latin America.","output":"A simplified alternative diagnostic algorithm for SARS-CoV-2 suspected symptomatic patients and confirmed close contacts (asymptomatic): A consensus of Latin American experts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is used to treat a variety of cancers. It exerts its mechanism of action by blocking the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). Toxicity concerns include immune-related toxicities, including colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, endocrine toxicities and more rarely, myocarditis and other organ system toxicities. OBJECTIVE To review a real-world case involving immunotherapy induced myocarditis after a patient received pembrolizumab and discuss how the current pandemic created complexity in toxicity management. DISCUSSION An 83 year old male with metastatic lung cancer developed fatal myocarditis after receiving 2 doses of pembrolizumab. Applying the Naranjo score, the likelihood of pembrolizumab causing the myocarditis is probable, with a score of 6. Severe cardiac toxicities are rare with pembrolizumab, but can still occur. It is vital to be aware of these toxicities, and educate patients on signs and symptoms. Complicating the situation even further was the global pandemic, which created fear and hesitation in the patient and the patient's family to seek medical treatment out of fear of exposure. This pandemic adds another layer to the complexity of care for patients with cancer and management of toxicities. Pharmacists play a significant role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of medications, especially oncology agents. CONCLUSION Proper education of patients regarding symptoms and when to report are paramount to assisting in early detection and intervention for immunotherapy-related adverse events.

In this population, influenza virus can replicate for prolonged periods, despite neuraminidase inhibitor treatment, leading to resistance and treatment failure. Baloxavir targets the influenza polymerase and may be an effective treatment option in these patients. METHODS: We used baloxavir to treat five allogeneic SCT recipients that were still symptomatic and shedding influenza virus after completing one or more treatment courses of oseltamivir and characterized the viral isolates before and during treatment. RESULTS: Two patients were infected with influenza A/H1pdm09 carrying a neuraminidase variant (H275Y) linked to oseltamivir resistance. Both these two patients were successfully treated with baloxavir. Of the three patients infected with wild-type influenza virus, two cleared the virus after baloxavir treatment, while the third patient developed the polymerase I38T variant linked to baloxavir resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that baloxavir treatment can be effective in treating neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza in profoundly immunocompromised patients. Randomized clinical trials are needed to define the role of baloxavir alone and combined with oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in SCT recipients and other immunocompromised populations.","output":"Baloxavir for the treatment of Influenza in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients previously treated with oseltamivir"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reclaim the W is an academic recovery program at a medium-sized midwestern university that offers undergraduates who have been academically dismissed a chance to reenroll at the institution.

Currently available evidence does not support the use of nocturnal NIV in unselected patients with stable COPD.

There have also been studies reporting benefit for the use of NIV as an adjunct to exercise training. NIV may be useful as an adjunct to airway clearance techniques in patients with cystic fibrosis. Accumulating evidence supports the use of NIV in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. There is considerable observational evidence supporting the use of NIV in patients with chronic respiratory failure related to neuromuscular disease, and one randomized controlled trial reported that the use of NIV was life-prolonging in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A variety of interfaces can be used to provide NIV in patients with stable chronic respiratory failure. The mouthpiece is an interface that is unique in this patient population, and has been used with success in patients with neuromuscular disease. Bi-level pressure ventilators are commonly used for NIV, although there are now a new generation of intermediate ventilators that are portable, have a long battery life, and can be used for NIV and invasive applications. Pressure support ventilation, pressure controlled ventilation, and volume controlled ventilation have been used successfully for chronic applications of NIV. New modes have recently become available, but their benefits await evidence to support their widespread use.

By blocking the ACE2 receptor, the physiological functions of the cell are inhibited, which are important for the normal function of various organs, and especially for the protection of the lungs. Therefore, the number of functionally active ACE2 receptors is extremely important for the body's resistance to COVID19. More receptors equal greater resistance of the host. An increased number of ACE2 receptors gives the body more time to mobilize an adequate immune response. Experience to date from the immediate fight against COVID19 has confirmed this rule: (A) women are generally more resistant (the ACE2 receptor gene is on the X chromosome, and women have two X chromosomes), (B) younger people are more resistant to the virus (ACE2 expression decreases with age), (C) patients with chronic diseases are more sensitive (have a reduced number of ACE2). Therefore, an increase in the number of ACE2 receptors is extremely important for the body's protective power in the fight against the SARS-CoV2 virus.

The source of the virus for the cats was their COVID-19-affected owner, with whom they were in continuous proximity in a small household setting. The owner's signs included fatigue, sneezing, anosmia and loss of taste, and diagnosis was confirmed 4 days after symptom onset. Oropharyngeal and faecal swabs were collected from the cats, to investigate the course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations, as well as the directionality of the chain of virus transmission. Both infected cats were real-time RT-PCR-positive on various time-points. Pharyngeal shedding of at least 6 days was observed in them, with high SARS-CoV-2 titres (> 7 Log10 copies/swab) on the first sampling time-point, that is, 7 days after the onset of owner's clinical signs. In one cat, after the initial decline, slightly increasing virus titres were measured 3 to 6 days after the first real-time RT-PCR-positive swab. Serological testing of this cat revealed absence of seroconversion. The course of viral RNA concentrations in the faecal swabs of the other cat was similar to that in its pharynx. The detected SARS-CoV-2 strains, from both infected cats and their owner, underwent whole-genome sequencing, revealing the absence of emergence of cross-species adaptive mutations in cats. The results support the notion that human SARS-CoV-2 strains are relatively well-adapted to cats. It is still unclear whether asymptomatic animals could play a role in COVID-19 epidemiology, in case of interaction with na?ve animals and/or people.

However, there is mounting evidence for a much broader symptom spectrum, including psychiatric symptoms. Disordered sleep has previously been linked with dissociative symptoms, which may imply that patients with narcolepsy are more prone to develop such symptoms. Objectives: To investigate the frequency of dissociative symptoms in adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 compared to population controls. Methods: In a retrospective case control study, sixty adult patients fulfilling the criteria for narcolepsy type 1 and 120 matched population control subjects received a structured interview using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) to assess dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: A majority of narcolepsy patients reported dissociative symptoms, and even fulfilled the DSM-IV-TR criteria of a dissociative disorder (62% vs 1% in controls, p < .001). Most frequently reported symptoms were \\"dissociative amnesia\\" (37% vs 1%, p < .001) and \\"dissociative disorder of voluntary movement\\" (32% vs 1%, p < .001). Conclusion: Dissociative symptoms are strikingly prevalent in adult patients with narcolepsy type 1. Although a formal diagnosis of dissociation disorder should not be made as the symptoms can be explained by narcolepsy as an underlying condition, the findings do illustrate the extent and severity of the dissociative symptoms. As for the pathophysiological mechanism, there may be symptom overlap between narcolepsy and dissociation disorder.

Lockdowns and stay-at-home restrictions have significantly reduced energy demand and consequently CO2 emissions of surface passenger transport. The change in CO2 emissions is calculated from near-real-time activity change data as a function of 3 confinement levels. The activity change and related emission trends reflect changes in the mode of transport during different waves, this can be used to understand mobility trends and patterns when stringent measures are imposed. Consequently, constructive use of this data can help prepare and develop the transport sector in case of another epidemic outbreak or other unprecedented calamities and to build a resilient transport infrastructure post-COVID-19. This study estimates and analyzes the changes in CO2 emissions associated with the public (bus and rail) and private surface passenger transport from March 1(st), 2020 to Jan 31(st), 2021 in 21 countries. The research period covers the 1(st) and the 2(nd) waves of COVID-19 in these countries. A higher activity reduction and consequently CO2 emission reduction is displayed during the 1(st) wave compared to the 2(nd) for most countries despite implementing stringent measures during both waves. This is in line with countries adapting to the 'new normal' and restarting socio-economic activities. Similarly, public transport recovery is slower than private transport recovery, making it essential to focus on reinforcement and adaptation of public transport infrastructure for the future. The results show that a cumulative 510 Mt CO2 has been reduced over 11 months in 21 countries, compared to pre-pandemic levels. This reduction brings about a 6% drop in transport CO2 emissions and a 1.5% drop in global CO2 emissions. This analysis sheds light on mobility trends and travel behavior of surface passenger transport modes and related CO2 emissions in different countries which can be used to exemplify the path to recovery based on near-real-time data.","output":"The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on surface passenger transport and related CO2 emissions during different waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans use rapid gaze shifts, known as saccades, to explore visual scenes.

This redistribution is a consequence of saccade dynamics, particularly the speed/amplitude/duration relation known as the main sequence. It resembles the redistribution resulting from inter-saccadic eye drifts, revealing a continuum in the modulations given by different eye movements, with oculomotor transitions primarily acting by regulating the bandwidth of whitening.

Within three months, it evolved to 10 additional subtypes. Two evolved subtypes (A2 and A2a) carry a non-synonymous Spike protein mutation (D614G). We conducted phylodynamic analysis of over 70,000 SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses worldwide, sequenced until July2020, and found that the mutant subtype (614G) outcompeted the pre-existing type (614D), significantly faster in Europe and North-America than in East Asia. Bioinformatically and computationally, we identified a novel neutrophil elastase (ELANE) cleavage site introduced in the G-mutant, near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We hypothesised that elevation of neutrophil elastase level at the site of infection will enhance the activation of Spike protein thus facilitating host cell entry for 614G, but not the 614D, subtype. The level of neutrophil elastase in the lung is modulated by its inhibitor 1-antitrypsin (AAT). AAT prevents lung tissue damage by elastase. However, many individuals exhibit genotype-dependent deficiency of AAT. AAT deficiency eases host-cell entry of the 614G virus, by retarding inhibition of neutrophil elastase and consequently enhancing activation of the Spike protein. AAT deficiency is highly prevalent in European and North-American populations, but much less so in East Asia. Therefore, the 614G subtype is able to infect and spread more easily in populations of the former regions than in the latter region. Our analyses provide a molecular biological and evolutionary model for the higher observed virulence of the 614G subtype, in terms of causing higher morbidity in the host (higher infectivity and higher viral load), than the non-mutant 614D subtype.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 mutation 614G creates an elastase cleavage site enhancing its spread in high AAT-deficient regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phytophotodermatitis is a cutaneous reaction that occurs after exposure to plant-derived furocoumarins and ultraviolet A light.

After occluding the most destroyed lobe with valves, significant target lobe volume reduction leads to improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life. In some patients, the effects are not consistent leading to long-term therapy failure. We hypothesized that surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS) would re-establish ELVR short-term clinical improvements following ELVR long-term failure. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center analysis, we included all patients who underwent consolidating lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) by lobectomy after long-term failure of valve therapy between 2010 and 2015. Changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), residual volume (RV), 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and dyspnea score (mMRC) 90 days after ELVR and LVRS were analyzed, and the outcomes of both procedures were compared. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients underwent LVRS after ELVR failure. In the majority (90%), a lower lobectomy was performed. The 30-day mortality of the cohort was 0% and 90-day mortality 5% (1/20). The remaining 19 patients showed a significant increase in FEV1 (+27.5  19.4%) and reduction in RV (-21.0  17.4%) and TLC (-11.1  11.1%). This resulted in significant improvements in exercise tolerance (6MWD: +56  60 m) and relief of dyspnea (&#916;mMRC: -1.8  1.4 pts.). CONCLUSIONS: Consolidating LVRS by lobectomy after failure of previously successful ELVR is feasible and results in significant symptom relief and improvement of lung function.","output":"Consolidating lung volume reduction surgery after endoscopic lung volume reduction failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the $(2,5)$ minimal model, the partition function for genus $g=2$ Riemann surfaces is given by a $5$-tuple of functions with appropriate transformation under the mapping class group.

A comparative historical analysis revealed that, with significant national differences between the United States and Japan, including in the legal and institutional contexts of migration, there is little commonality in the processes through which the industries have come to depend on migrants. Yet, there is a similarity in the development of mass production. Such production necessitates an undisrupted availability of full-time as well as low-wage workforce, and migrants on both sides of the Pacific are employed to ensure this availability. Thus, while urban-centered migration studies often emphasize the growth of low-wage services or small-batch manufacturing as an economic driver of migration, this study argues that, outside large cities, a different pattern of industrial transformation is associated with labor migration.","output":"Migration outside large cities: a comparison of the hiring of migrants for the food processing industry in the United States and Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this review, we focused on the origins of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), origin, pathogenesis, immune responses, genes and genetic variations, phylogenetic analyses, and potential therapeutic strategies to summarize approaches for developing broadly effective preventions and vaccines to cope COVID-19.

The aim was to contribute to more informed environmental management by assessing the associated risks. In the study presented here, Cu concentrations were monitored, analyzed, and correlated with vessel traffic. Observations revealed that the seasonal increase in maritime traffic caused by nautical tourism was associated with an increase in Cu concentrations of more than five times, posing a toxicity risk to the environment.

This article explores from an interdisciplinary point of view the connection between existing legal requirements for the explainability of AI systems set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the current state of the art in the field of explainable AI. It studies the challenges of providing human legible explanations for current and future AI-based decision-making systems in practice, based on two scenarios of automated decision-making in credit scoring risks and medical diagnosis of COVID-19. These scenarios exemplify the trend towards increasingly complex machine learning algorithms in automated decision-making, both in terms of data and models. Current machine learning techniques, in particular those based on deep learning, are unable to make clear causal links between input data and final decisions. This represents a limitation for providing exact, human-legible reasons behind specific decisions, and presents a serious challenge to the provision of satisfactory, fair and transparent explanations. Therefore, the conclusion is that the quality of explanations might not be considered as an adequate safeguard for automated decision-making processes under the GDPR. Accordingly, additional tools should be considered to complement explanations. These could include algorithmic impact assessments, other forms of algorithmic justifications based on broader AI principles, and new technical developments in trustworthy AI.

Moreover, genetic testing criteria (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] and Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics [MCG] Plus) have never been validated in the Indian population. METHODS: All new female breast cancer patients from 1st March 2019 to 28th February 2020 were screened. Those providing informed consent and without previous genetic testing were recruited. Multigene panel testing (107 genes) by next-generation sequencing was performed for all patients. The frequency of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations between patients qualifying and not qualifying the testing criteria was compared and their sensitivity was computed. RESULTS: Overall, 275 breast cancer patients were screened and 236 patients were included (median age 45 years); 30 patients did not consent and 9 patients previously underwent genetic testing. Thirty-four (14%) women had a positive family history and 35% had triple-negative breast cancer. P/LP mutations were found in 44/236 (18.64%) women; mutations in BRCA1 (22/47, 46.8%) and BRCA2 (9/47, 19.1%) were the most common, with 34% of mutations present in non-BRCA genes. Patients qualifying the testing criteria had a higher risk of having a P/LP mutation (NCCN: 23.6% vs. 7.04%, p = 0.03; MCG plus: 24.8% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.01). The sensitivity of the NCCN criteria was 88.6% (75.4C96.2) and 86.36% (72.65C94.83) for MCG plus. More than 95% sensitivity was achieved if all women up to 60 years of age were tested.

We recently developed a technically simple and portable in vivo hematopoietic HSC transduction approach that involves HSC mobilization from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood stream and the intravenous injection of an integrating, helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd5/35(++)) vector system. Considering the abundance of erythrocytes, in this study, we directed sACE2-Ig expression to erythroid cells using strong -globin transcriptional regulatory elements. We performed in vivo HSC transduction of CD46-transgenic mice with an HDAd-sACE2-Ig vector. Serum sACE2-Ig levels reached 500C1,300 ng/mL after in vivo selection. At 22 weeks, we used genetically modified HSCs from these mice to substitute the hematopoietic system in human ACE2-transgenic mice, thus creating a model that is susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection. Upon challenge with a lethal dose of CoV2 (WA-1), sACE2-Ig expressed from erythroid cells of test mice diminishes infection sequelae. Treated mice lost significantly less weight, had less viremia, and displayed reduced cytokine production and lung pathology. The second objective of this study was to assess the safety of in vivo HSC transduction and long-term sACE2-Ig expression in a rhesus macaque. With appropriate cytokine prophylaxis, intravenous injection of HDAd-sACE2-Ig into the mobilized animal was well tolerated. In vivo transduced HSCs preferentially localized to and survived in the spleen. sACE2-Ig expressed from erythroid cells did not affect erythropoiesis and the function of erythrocytes. While these pilot studies are promising, the antiviral efficacy of the approach has to be improved, for example, by using of decoy receptors with enhanced neutralizing capacity and/or expression of multiple antiviral effector proteins.","output":"In Vivo Hematopoietic Stem Cell Gene Therapy for SARS-CoV2 Infection Using a Decoy Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19;Chemoprophylaxis;Hydroxychloroquine;Adverse Drug Reactions;Health Care Workers INTRODUCTION An adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can be defined as \\"an noxious, unintended or unpleasant reaction resulting from an intervention related to the prophylactic, diagnostic, or therapeutic use of a medicinal product.\\" [7] Recently, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recommended the use of HCQ for the prophylaxis of COVID19 for high-risk population[8] and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency use authorization (EUA) for its use in the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease in hospitalized patients.

METHODS: Participants from two Swiss organisations, aged 18C65 years and working from home during the lockdown (n = 69) were included. Baseline data collected in January 2020 before the lockdown (office work) were compared with follow-up data in April 2020 during lockdown (working from home). The primary outcome of NP was assessed with a measure of intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were quality of workstation ergonomics, number of work breaks, and time spent working at the computer. Two linear mixed effects models were fitted to the data to estimate the change in NP. RESULTS: No clinically relevant change in the average NP intensity and neck disability was found between measurement time points. Each working hour at the computer increased NP intensity by 0.36 points (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.62) indicating strong evidence. No such effect was found for neck disability. Each work break taken reduced neck disability by 2.30 points (95% CI: ? 4.18 to ? 0.42, evidence). No such effect was found for NP intensity. There is very strong evidence that workstation ergonomics was poorer at home. CONCLUSION: The number of work breaks and hours spent at the computer seem to have a greater effect on NP than the place of work (office, at home), measurement time point (before COVID-19, during lockdown) or the workstation ergonomics.

Being an ophthalmologist himself, he has put the additional onus on us. The fact that the ocular manifestation could be the first presenting feature of novel coronavirus pneumonia should not be ignored and the possibility of spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the ocular secretions cannot be ruled out. However, with breakthroughs still evolving about this disease, the calls are now louder for closer examination on the pathogenesis of conjunctivitis associated with it. Hence, we conducted a scoping review of all available literature till date to fill in the potential gaps in currently available knowledge on ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an attempt to establish continuity in the chain of information from December 2019 till April 2020. We also summarize a possible hypothesis on much less understood and highly debated topics on regard to the etiopathogenesis of ocular involvement in SARS-CoV-2 based on either presence or absence of ACE2 receptor in the ocular surface. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review search of published and unpublished SARS-CoV-2-related English language articles from December 2019 till mid of April 2020 from the online databases. The findings were summarized using text, tables, diagrams, and flowcharts. RESULTS: The commonest ocular manifestation in SARS-CoV-2 infection is follicular conjunctivitis and has been the first manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 3 reported cases till date. The ocular surface inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 leads to the facilitation of the virus to the respiratory system via the lacrimal passage. RT-PCR analysis of the ocular secretions has shown the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides indicating the possibility of infection of ocular secretions. ACE2 receptors and its expression on the ocular mucosal surface are linked behind the etiopathogenesis of conjunctivitis. CONCLUSION: Conjunctivitis can be the presenting manifestation but may go unnoticed due to its mild nature. The ocular surface could serve as the entry gateway for the virus and ocular secretions could play a role in virus shed. The eye care personnel, as well as the general people, need to be more vigilant and adopt protective eye measures.","output":"Unfolding COVID-19: Lessons-in-Learning in Ophthalmology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe COVID-19 appears rare in children.

Results: A total of 44 neonates born to 41 COVID-19-positive mothers were evaluated. Among them, 28 (68.3%) patients (two sets of twins) were delivered within 7 days of testing positive for COVID-19, 23 (56%) patients (two sets of twins) were delivered by cesarean section; 13 (29.5%) newborns hada low birth weight; seven (15.9%) were preterm; and six (13.6%) required neonatal intensive care unit admission, reflecting an increased incidence of cesarean delivery and low birth weight but zero neonatal mortality.

The vaccine effectiveness against any PCR-confirmed infection declined from 87% (95% CI 86-87) at 0-2 months after the second dose to 53% (95% CI 52-54) at 7-8 months for Comirnaty, from 90% (95% CI 89-91) at 0-2 monthsto 65% (95% CI 63-67) at 7-8 months for Spikevax, and from 83% (95% CI 80-85) at 0-2 months to 55% at (95% CI 54-56) 5-6 months for the Vaxzevria. For Janssen Covid-19 Vaccine we found no significant decline but the estimates are less certain. The vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions and deaths decayed at a significantly lower rate with about 15%, resp. 10% decline during the first 6-8 months. The administration of a booster dose returns the protection to or above the estimates in the first two months after dose 2. In unvaccinated but previously SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals the protection against PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection declined from close to 97% (95% CI 97-97) after 2 months through 90% at 6 months down to 72% (95% CI 65-78) at 18 months. Interpretation. Our results confirm the waning of vaccination-induced immunity against infection and a smaller decline in the protection against hospital admission and death. A booster dose is shown to restore the vaccine effectiveness back to the levels seen soon after the completion of the basic vaccination schedule. The post-infection immunity decreases over time, too. Funding. No external funding was used to conduct this study.","output":"Real-life protection provided by vaccination, booster doses and previous infection against covid-19 infection, hospitalisation or death over time in the Czech Republic: a whole country retrospective view"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to reliably grasp and manipulate novel objects is a grand challenge for robotics.","output":"Getting a grip on reality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As it has spread globally, the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 (known colloquially as the coronavirus) has already caused untold suffering, with more most certainly to come.

This knock on the hegemonic commitment to austerity and its mantra is an opportunity to interrogate the effects of, and advance, emancipatory policies and practices. Gerontology is inadequate without a lens for examining how critical analysis and social action might inform one another. To shift from disruption to transformation in the new normal, scholars must bring the past and future into the present to engage realistic utopian pedagogies of hope.

We conducted a web-based survey between 27/10/2020C03/12/2020 on a representative sample of 963 Italians. Psychometric scales and ad hoc items were used to measure peoples levels of anxiety, depression, fear for contagion and consumption orientation towards free-from foods. Of the sample, 18.2% frequently purchased gluten-free food products and 22.5% purchased lactose-free foods. Most of the population (44.1%) feels very at risk of contagion from COVID-19 and suffers from anxiety (52.8%) and depression (55.0%). Free-from consumers are more anxious, depressed, have higher risk of contagion, and are younger than the non-consumers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, free-from foods can represent for the people a way to restore control over their lifestyle, which was denied during the emergency.

During the 3 years of the present study, 75 cats were sampled at least once, including 44 that were caught and examined only once, 14 that were examined twice, and 17 that were examined three times. For each cat that was caught, records were kept regarding sex, age, general health, and the presence of ectoparasites. Each year, a blood sample was taken for hematologic testing, platelet count, hemoparasite detection, antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, and retrovirus detection. Blood counts were within normal range for the majority of cats tested. Feline immunodeficiency virus, fleas, and lice were detected in all years; however, incidence rates for each of these varied significantly throughout the years. Prevalence of Cytauxzoon spp., Mycoplasma spp., T. gondii infections were variable among the 3 years, although differences were not significant. Prevalence of feline leukemia virus increased significantly over the 3 years. Mycoplasma spp. and flea infestations were significantly associated, but no other associations among the pathogens were detected. Over the 3 years, the rate of new cat introductions decreased, and the pathogens showed a tendency to disseminate throughout the colony; however, there was virtually no evidence of clinically detectable disease. Therefore, it seems that stabilizing the population by a judicious control program facilitated the distribution of the pathogens throughout the colony, while the general well-being of the cats was not seriously affected.","output":"Follow-up of the health conditions of an urban colony of free-roaming cats (Felis catus Linnaeus, 1758) in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical trials have demonstrated that catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) reduces blood pressure and improves blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension. The follow-up data indicate that the blood pressure lowering effect of the procedure may last for up to 36 months. Despite the fact that RDN is a growing and promising technique, still more data from clinical trials are needed to support the long-term safety and persistent efficacy of this approach as compared to the best possible pharmacological treatment. It would also be particularly important to recognize the clinical features of patients who would benefit most from RDN as well as the clinical characteristics of non-responders to the procedure. As renal denervation also reduces whole-body sympathetic nerve activity, the clinical entities characterized by sympathetic nervous system activation - including hypertension coexisting with metabolic abnormalities and/or sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias - may be potential new indications for the procedure. However, only a few small clinical studies so far have shown the potential benefit of renal denervation in these clinical situations and large clinical trials are needed to prove this concept. Catheter-based RDN is a promising (but also novel) therapeutic approach and further studies should also verify whether it can be considered as a procedure in management of patients not only with resistant hypertension, but also as a tool in the treatment of mild to moderate forms of hypertension.","output":"Renal denervation - current evidence and perspectives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Chicago Classification (CC) uses high-resolution manometry (HRM) software tools to designate esophageal motor diagnoses.

Contraction wave abnormalities (CWA), and 'normal' cohorts were recorded. Symptom burden was characterized using dominant symptom intensity and global symptom severity. Motor diagnoses, presenting symptoms, and symptom burden were compared between CC 2.0 and 3.0, and in cohorts not meeting CC diagnoses. KEY RESULTS Of 2569 eligible studies, 49.9% met CC 2.0 criteria, but only 40.3% met CC 3.0 criteria (P<.0001). Between CC 2.0 and 3.0, 82.8% of diagnoses were concordant. Discordance resulted from decreasing proportions of hypermotility (4.4%) and hypomotility (9.0%) disorders, and increase in 'normal' designations (13.0%); esophageal outflow obstruction showed the least variation between CC versions.

Stressful events like the COVID-19 pandemic can add extra burdens to women's already multifaceted lives. Keeping the gender implications of COVID-19 in mind can assist health care workers to offer more effective management. In our study, we aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of women in Karachi, Pakistan and investigate the possible risk factors. Methods: An online questionnaire was distributed to women on social media platforms in the month of June 2020. The questionnaire had two self-assessment scales, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale which measures the symptoms of depression and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale which measures anxiety. Results: Three hundred and ninety three individuals completed the questionnaire with the mean age calculated to be 27.6  11.7 years. Age, education, marital status, number of children, financial issues, employment status, smoking, comorbidities and mental illnesses were significantly associated with participants' mean anxiety and depression scores. The depression scores were generally higher compared to anxiety scores in each category. As the age increased, their scores decreased, with women aged 18C30 having a significantly higher mean depression and anxiety scores compared to women who were above 50. Severe anxiety was identified in 21.9% women and severe depression was noted in 17.8% women. A frightening number of 148 (37.7%) was found of women who had self-destructive thoughts at one time or another. Out of these women, surprisingly 97 (65.5%) individuals were not previously diagnosed with any mental illnesses. Discussion: This study supports the existing literature regarding the disturbed psychological state of women close to the peak of the covid-19 pandemic. We noted increased percentage of depressive women as compared to studies conducted before the covid-19 era. This raises concern especially with our thought provoking finding of self-harm or suicidal thoughts among women. Most of our female population is also seen to be anxious.

The virus is highly pathogenic, manifesting in infected patients with an approximately 50% fatality rate. It is known that the surface spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses mediate receptor recognition and membrane fusion, thereby playing an indispensable role in initiating infection. In this process, heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) of the S protein assemble into a complex called the fusion core, which represents a key membrane fusion architecture. To date, however, the MERS-CoV fusion core remains uncharacterized. In this study, we performed a series of biochemical and biophysical analyses characterizing the HR1/HR2 complexes of this novel virus. The HR sequences were variably truncated and then connected with a flexible amino acid linker. In each case, the recombinant protein automatically assembled into a trimer in solution, displaying a typical -helical structure. One of these trimers was successfully crystallized, and its structure was solved at a resolution of 1.9 ?. A canonical 6-helix bundle, like those reported for other coronaviruses, was revealed, with three HR1 helices forming the central coiled-coil core and three HR2 chains surrounding the core in the HR1 side grooves. This demonstrates that MERS-CoV utilizes a mechanism similar to those of other class I enveloped viruses for membrane fusion. With this notion, we further identified an HR2-based peptide that could potently inhibit MERS-CoV fusion and entry by using a pseudotyped-virus system. These results lay the groundwork for future inhibitory peptidic drug design.","output":"Structure of the fusion core and inhibition of fusion by a heptad repeat peptide derived from the S protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of the 14th of September, Italy has been considered one of the more susceptible nations in terms of risk of increase for Sars-Cov-2 contagion [ ]","output":"The Utility of Anti-Covid-19 Desks in Italy, Doubts and Criticism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A review is presented of the scientific evidence on preventive activities in women's care in relation to pregnancy follow-up, preventive activities in the planning and follow-up of contraceptive methods, preventive activities in menopause, and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures.","output":"Actividades preventivas en la mujer.

Existing solutions for evaluating hybrid analytical tasks - ranging from LA-oriented systems, to relational systems (extended to handle LA operations), to hybrid systems - either optimize data management and complex tasks separately, exploit RA properties only while leaving LA-specific optimization opportunities unexploited, or focus heavily on physical optimization, leaving semantic query optimization opportunities unexplored.

RESULTS: Urinary concentrations of chromium, manganese, copper, selenium, cadmium, mercury and lead after creatinine adjustment were found to be higher in severe patients than the non-severe cases with COVID-19. And among the severe cases, these elements were also higher in the deceased group than the recovered group. When the weeks of the post-symptom onset were taken in account, the changes of these urinary elements were existed across the clinical course since the disease onset. These urinary elements were found to be mostly positively inter-correlated, and further positively correlated with other laboratory inflammatory parameters including serum cytokines (IL-1B, IL2R, IL6, IL8, IL10, TNF), ferritin, and neutrophil count and white blood cell count. As a independently predictive factor, urinary creatinine-adjusted copper of  25.57 g/g and  99.32 g/g were associated with significantly increased risk of severe illness and fatal outcome in COVID-19, respectively.

As such, a national orthopaedic teaching programme was designed to provide F1s with opportunities to develop their teaching skills and to synergistically teach medical students how to perform clinical orthopaedic examinations. METHODS Six weekly sessions, each delivered by two newly qualified F1 tutors, on each joint examination were delivered online via Zoom Video Communications (USA). Presession and postsession multiple choice questions (MCQs) were provided to students to assess improvement in knowledge. Anonymous feedback forms were provided to both students and tutors. RESULTS Of the 341 students that attended, 87.1% provided feedback. 86.2% felt that they had de-skilled due to time off, with a mean 15 weeks off from placement. Based on a 5-point Likert scale, students displayed a mean improvement in confidence (1.91.1, p<0.001) and MCQ scores (1.41.3, p<0.001) before and after the sessions. 91.6% and 95.3% agreed that the use of online teaching increased attendance and laid the foundation for practice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome N, Brower RG, Matthay MA, Morris A, Schoenfeld D, Thompson BT, Wheeler A, 2000 [1]) a prospective, quasi-experimental, cohort study of adults mechanically ventilated admitted to intensive care units (ICU) in the year before, year after, and second year after implementation of an electronic medical record based LPV order, and (Needham et al., 2015 [2]) a cross-sectional qualitative study of ICU providers regarding their perceptions of the order. We applied the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the implementation. RESULTS There were 1405, 1424, and 1342 in the control, adoption, and maintenance cohorts, representing 95% of mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients. The overall prevalence of LPV increased from 65% to 73% (p < 0.001, adjusted-OR for LPV adherence: 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.3), but LPV adherence in women was approximately 30% worse than in men (women: 44% to 56% [p < 0.001],men: 79% to 86% [p < 0.001]). ICU providers noted difficulty obtaining an accurate height measurement and mistrust of the Vt calculation as barriers to implementation.

We study three specific COVID-19 epidemic control models: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination control; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible, un-quarantined infected, quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model with quarantine control. We express the control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which can specify the expected control outcomes such as \\"the deaths from the infection should never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months\\" or \\"the population immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand within the next 100 to 120 days\\". We then develop methods for synthesizing control strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; shield immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the proposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune) satisfy the MTL specifications. The results also show that early intervention is essential in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and more control effort is needed for more stringent MTL specifications. For example, based on the model in Lombardy, Italy, achieving less than 100 deaths per day and 10000 total deaths within 100 days requires 441.7% more vaccination control effort than achieving less than 1000 deaths per day and 50000 total deaths within 100 days.","output":"Control strategies for COVID-19 epidemic with vaccination, shield immunity and quarantine: A metric temporal logic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is the largest pandemic in the last century and has created a health care crisis worldwide. Contingency plans have led to put on hold all urological elective surgeries. The aim of the present article is to report the adaptation of the Medically Necessary Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) scoring system to triage patients who were awaiting urological elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The present study was conducted as a part of a necessary transition of care delivery at a tertiary care institution in order to re-establish urological elective surgery. We triaged all urological elective surgeries with the MeNTS instrument and proposed a cutoff value of 45 points to avoid complications in the COVID-19 crisis while resuming elective procedures. Results A total of 91 patients awaiting elective urological surgery pending to be rescheduled were identified. Their median age was 60.5 years old (interquartile range [IQR]: 46-93). Twenty-five patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I, 51 (56%) were class II, and 12 (13%) were class III. The median MeNTS score was 42 points (IQR: 36-59). Twenty-nine patients had a MeNTS score > 45 and were advised to postpone their surgery. Sixty-Two had a score  45 and were gradually rescheduled. Conclusions The present study may have practical implications regarding the selection of urological elective surgeries in the challenging health care situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

About 98% of all PV patients harbor the JAK2 mutation. Ruxolitinib (RUX), a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, received approval as a second-line indication in PV patients who are resistant or intolerant to standard therapy hydroxyurea in both the United States (2014) and Europe (2015). In the studies relevant to approval, RUX achieved excellent PV control. Due to its mechanism of action, RUX also has immunosuppressive effects. As expected, an increased rate of infection was observed in clinical studies and in practical application. In this overview, we have compiled all previous literature references on RUX and infections in PV. However, apart from a few individual cases with special infections and an increased rate of zoster infections, there are no exceptional high infection problems. Recommendations are given on how infections in RUX treated PV patients can be avoided. ABSTRACT: Ruxolitinib (RUX), a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is approved for second-line therapy in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who are resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea. Due to the immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effect of RUX, there is an increased susceptibility to infections. However, an increased risk of infection is inherent to even untreated myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). To obtain more information on the clinical significance of RUX-associated infections in PV, we reviewed the available literature. There is no evidence-based approach to managing infection risks. Most data on RUX-associated infections are available for MF. In all studies, the infection rates in the RUX and control groups were fairly similar, with the exception of infections with the varicella zoster virus (VZV). However, individual cases of bilateral toxoplasmosis retinitis, disseminated molluscum contagiosum, or a mycobacterium tuberculosis infection or a hepatitis B reactivation are reported. A careful assessment of the risk of infection for PV patients is required at the initial presentation and before the start of RUX. Screening for hepatitis B is recommended in all patients. The risk of RUX-associated infections is lower with PV than with MF, but compared to a normal population there is an increased risk of VZV infection. However, primary VZV prophylaxis for PV patients is not recommended, while secondary prophylaxis can be considered individually. As early treatment is most effective for VZV, patients should be properly informed and trained to seek medical advice immediately if cutaneous signs of VZV develop. Vaccination against influenza, herpes zoster, and pneumococci should be considered in all PV patients at risk of infection, especially if RUX treatment is planned. Current recommendations do not support adjusting or discontinuing JAK inhibition in MPN patients to reduce the risk of COVID-19.","output":"Ruxolitinib-Associated Infections in Polycythemia Vera: Review of the Literature, Clinical Significance, and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The paper examines the multi-tasked role of women in caregiving and career during the Covid-19 partial lockdown in Ghana. 153 mothers with careers within the Accra Metropolis participated in the study through purposive and snow balling sampling methods of non-probability sampling technique. To observe the Covid-19 protocols of social distancing, the research instrument was designed using google forms and distributed to respondents via social media platforms (emails and WhatsApp). The results revealed that caregiving mothers generally reported to work late from home than if there were in the office and were less effective and productive working from home but were assured of job security because they mostly worked in the public sector. Hours used for domestic activities rose steadily during the lockdown period and social support from non-relatives in caregiving increased. The paper?s finding suggests that mothers working from home are faced with difficult and conflicting roles which puts more pressure on women during the pandemic period. Women who are unable to access social support continue to be stressed and burdened in an attempt to combine family, care giving, and career roles which ultimately affect their overall wellbeing.

We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports. FINDINGS: If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32-55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14-35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95-99% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays. INTERPRETATION: Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges.

METHODS: We performed a 42-question survey of the early experience of neuro-oncological surgery practice in hospitals across different Asian countries on April 1, 2020, with responses closed on April 18, 2020. RESULTS: 144 hospitals completed the questionnaire. Most were in WHO post-peak phase of the pandemic and reported a median reduction in neuro-oncological surgery volume of 25-50%. Most (67.4%) resumed elective surgery in only COVID-19 negative patients;11.1% performed only emergency cases irrespective of COVID-19 status;2.1% suspended all surgical activity.

These unprecedented circumstances have amplified the sources of emotional distress and worker burnout. However, many healthcare organizations (HCOs) in the United States, have opted for a stoic approach to healthcare worker support, i.e., no additional support beyond federal and state policy protections for the licensing and liability of healthcare workers. In this scenario, a key public health concern is sustaining an adequate healthcare workforce, both by way of quantity (adequate numbers) and quality (maximizing clinician resilience to provide safe care to large volumes of patients under challenging conditions). Therefore, it is imperative for HCO leaders to recognize that a limited view of worker psychological safety, without due consideration for the broader emotional distress created by the pandemic, could have the effect of restricting organizational resilience and adversely impacting patient safety and staff retention during and beyond the pandemic.

Due to the intrinsic difficulty of working with SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus, most serological assays use recombinant forms of the Spike glycoprotein or its receptor binding domain (RBD). Cell-based assays expressing different forms of the Spike, as well as pseudoviral assays, are also widely used. To evaluate whether these assays recapitulate findings generated when the Spike is expressed in its physiological context (at the surface of the infected primary cells), we developed an intracellular staining against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) to distinguish infected from uninfected cells. Human airway epithelial cells (pAECs) were infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 D614G or Alpha variants. We observed robust cell-surface expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike at the surface of the infected pAECs using the conformational-independent anti-S2 CV3-25 antibody. The infected cells were also readily recognized by plasma from convalescent and vaccinated individuals and correlated with several serological assays.

In Experiment 1, 64 restrained eaters completed either one of two training procedures in which they were asked to classify food vs. non-food images: a food-response training, in which stop cues were always associated with non-food images, or a balanced food-response/inhibition training, in which participants inhibited motor actions to food and non-food stimuli equally. The results revealed reduced snack consumption following the food-response/inhibition training compared to the food-response training.

MTR are tools equipped with a camera, monitor, microphone, and speaker, with a body on wheels that allows for remote-controlled and sometimes autonomous movement aiming to provide easy access to assistance and networking services. We conducted a narrative review of literature describing experimental studies of MTR involving elderly people over the last 20 years, including during the COVID-19 period. The aim of this review was to examine whether MTR use was beneficial for reducing loneliness and social isolation among older adults at home and in health and care institutions and to examine the current benefits and barriers to their use and implementation. We screened 1754 references and included 24 research papers focusing on the usability, acceptability, and effectiveness of MTR. News reports on MTR use during the COVID-19 period were also examined. A qualitative, multidimensional analysis methodology inspired by a health technology assessment model was used to identify facilitating and limiting factors and investigate if and how MTR could reduce social isolation in elderly people. Reviewed studies provide encouraging evidence that MTR have potential in this regard, as experiments report positive feedback on MTR design and core functionalities.

Bioethics, too, must acknowledge its role-the environmental threats that will shape human health in this century represent a 'perfect moral storm' challenging the ethical theories of the last. The US conservationist Aldo Leopold saw this gathering storm more clearly than many, and in his Land Ethic describes the beginnings of a route to safe passage. Its starting point is a reinterpretation of the ethical relationship between humanity and the 'land community', the ecosystems we live within and depend upon; moving us from 'conqueror' to 'plain member and citizen' of that community. The justice of the Land Ethic questions many presuppositions implicit to discussions of the topic in biomedical ethics. By valuing the community in itself-in a way irreducible to the welfare of its members-it steps away from the individualism axiomatic in contemporary bioethics. Viewing ourselves as citizens of the land community also extends the moral horizons of healthcare from a solely human focus.

METHODS: Included patients were 18 years of age or older, admitted to the medical intensive care unit from August 2017 through January 2018, and had a medication history obtained from a family member or outpatient pharmacy due to active delirium or mechanical ventilation. Patients were directly interviewed after resolution of delirium or extubation. Discrepancies between the initial and follow-up histories were documented and categorized using the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) Index for Categorizing Medication Errors. RESULTS: Forty patients were included. One hundred four discrepancies were documented, with a median of 2 discrepancies per patient. The most common types of discrepancies were addition (51.9%), followed by omission (24.0%). NCC MERP index category A (51%) was the most common error classification identified.

There is a growing concern that MIPS increases administrative burden, and little is known about what it costs physician practices to participate in the program. OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs for independent physician practices to participate in MIPS in 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study identified and interviewed leaders of physician practices participating in the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) MIPS program, including those in MIPS alternative payment models. Time required and financial costs were calculated from responses to in-depth, semistructured interviews conducted from December 12, 2019, to June 23, 2020. Physician practices were categorized by size (small, 1-9 physicians; medium, 10-25; and large, 50), specialty (primary care, general surgery, or multispecialty), and US census region. Participants were asked about 2019 costs related to clinician and staff time, information technology, and external vendors. Time was converted to financial costs using the Medical Group Management Associations Provider Compensation and the Management and Staff Compensation databases. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual time spent by staff on MIPS-related activities and mean per-physician costs to physician practices in 2019. RESULTS: Leaders of 30 physician practices (9 [30.0%] small primary care, 6 [20.0%] small general surgery, 4 [13.3%] medium primary care, 4 [13.3%] medium general surgery, and 7 [23.3%] large multispecialty) represented all US census regions, and 14 of the 30 (46.7%) practices participated in a MIPS alternative payment model in 2019. The mean per-physician cost to practices of participating in MIPS was $12 811 (interquartile range [IQR], $2861-$17 715). Physicians, clinical staff, and administrative staff together spent 201.7 (IQR, 50.9-295.2) hours annually per physician on MIPS-related activities. Medical assistants and nursing staff together spent a mean of 99.2 (IQR, 0-163.3) hours per physician each year; frontline physicians spent 53.6 (IQR, 0.6-55.8) hours; executive administrators spent 28.6 (IQR, 3.1-26.7) hours; other clinicians and staff spent a combined 20.3 (IQR, 0-36.8) hours. Physician time accounted for the greatest proportion of overall MIPS-related costs (54%; $6909; IQR, $94-$9905). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, physician practice leaders reported significant time and financial costs of participating in the MIPS program.

Data on the impact on otolaryngological clinics and private practices is sparse. This study aimed to present data on healthcare worker (HCW) screening, status of HCW, pre-interventional testing, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the economic impact of the pandemic. METHODS: Otolaryngological private practices and hospital-based departments were surveyed nationwide using an online questionnaire. Participating facilities were recruited via the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and the German Association for Otolaryngologists in Bavaria. RESULTS: 365 private practices (2776 employees) and 65 hospitals (2333 employees) were included. Significantly more hospitals (68.7%) than practices (40.5%) performed pre-interventional testing in their outpatients (p < 0.00). Most inpatients were tested in practices and hospitals (100.0% and 95.0%; p = 0.08). HCW screening was performed in 73.7% of practices and in 77.3% of hospitals (p = 0.54). Significantly more HCW infections were reported in private practices (4.7%) than in hospital (3.6%; p = 0.03). The private or home environment was the most frequent source of infection among HCW in hospitals (44%) and practices (63%). The use of PPE increased over the course of the pandemic. The number of procedures and the revenue decreased in 2020. CONCLUSION: The rate of pre-interventional testing among outpatients in otolaryngological practices is low and HCW infections were found to be more frequent in practices than in hospitals. In addition, a high rate of infections in otolaryngological HCW seems to stem from the private or home environment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 200 and 400 patients were enrolled daily through the National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) and issued with a self-sampling kit. Initially, only persons aged 16 and over were eligible, but from 12 November (week 45), self-sampling was extended to include school-age children (5 years and older). All samples received were screened for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as well as seasonal influenza [A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and influenza B] by a combination of RTCPCR and virus isolation methods. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 RTCPCR-positive samples were screened for the oseltamivir resistance-inducing H275Y substitution, and a subset of samples also underwent phenotypic antiviral susceptibility testing by enzyme inhibition assay. RESULTS: We were able to detect virus by RTCPCR in self-taken samples and recovered infectious virus enabling further virological characterization. The majority of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 RTCPCR-positive NPFS samples (n = 1273) were taken after oseltamivir treatment had begun. No reduction in phenotypic susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors was detected, but five cases with minority quasi-species of oseltamivir-resistant virus (an H275Y amino acid substitution in neuraminidase) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Self-sampling is a useful tool for community surveillance, particularly for the follow-up of drug-treated patients.

RECENT FINDINGS: Direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2 is not common, and convincing morphologic evidence of substantive kidney infection by SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. Severe COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury is likely multifactorial and results from the physiologic disturbances and therapies used to treat this illness. COVID-19-associated collapsing glomerulopathy (COVAN) is seen almost exclusively in patients with apolipoprotein L1 high-risk genotypes with no evidence of direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY: The prevailing evidence does not support substantive or persistent infection of kidneys in COVID-19 and indirect means of tissue injury are favored, although a 'hit and run' model cannot be excluded. COVAN frequently occurs in patients with mild respiratory systems, suggesting that innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide the second hit needed for the development of collapsing glomerulopathy in susceptible individuals.","output":"Pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019-associated kidney injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brazil ranks second in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide.

But, in some cases, this assumption may be invalid and many infection cases may go undetected. For example, the operators of subsystems in complex systems may be unaware that their systems are compromised by malware or a virus, which may go undetected for a long period. Similarly, an infectious disease can cause widely varying symptoms and some infected individuals may exhibit little to no symptoms. In these scenarios, it would be difficult to identify all infected systems or individuals, which can play a critical role in spreading the infection by malware, virus or disease. For this reason, it is of interest to devise a means of quickly determining the presence of such undetected infection cases in a network. We propose a simple optimization-based approach that can be used to determine whether or not a significant fraction of infection cases are undetected and thus are missing in reported statistics.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving 145 consecutive patients with specimens positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the matrix and new H1 genes was conducted. RESULTS: The nontreated and oseltamivir-treated patients were comparable in their viral load at presentation, demography, and the presenting symptoms. No correlation was observed between viral load with age and number of symptoms. Viral load of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was significantly lower in treated than in nontreated patients at day 5 after symptom onset. When oseltamivir was initiated  2 days after symptom onset, a greater rate of viral load reduction in NPA of treated patients than that of nontreated patients was observed (?0.638 [95% CI, ?0.809 to ?0.466] vs ?0.409 [95% CI, ?0.663 to ?0.185] log(10) copies/mL/d post-symptom onset), and the viral load was undetectable at day 6 after oseltamivir initiation, which was 1 day earlier than that of those whose treatment was initiated > 2 days of symptom onset. The viral load was inversely correlated with concomitant absolute lymphocyte count in nontreated patients (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = ?0.687, P = .001) and treated patients (Pearson r = ?0.365, P < .001).

Our RDARP extends the DARP by (1) minimizing a weighted sum of travel cost and disease-transmission risk exposure for onboard passengers and (2) introducing a maximum cumulative exposure risk constraint for each vehicle to ensure a trip with lower external exposure. Both extensions require that the risk exposure of each onboard passenger is propagated in a minimized fashion while satisfying other existing constraints of the DARP. To fully describe the RDARP, we first provide a three-index arc-based formulation and reformulate the RDARP into an equivalent min-max trip-based formulation, which is solved by an exact Branch-Cut-and-Price (BCP) algorithm. For each node in the branching tree, we adopt the column generation method by decomposing the problem into a master problem and a subproblem. The latter takes the form of an elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints and minimized maximum risk (ESPPRCMMR). To solve the ESPPRCMMR efficiently, we develop a new labeling algorithm and establish families of resource extension functions in compliance with the risk-related resources. We adopt a real-world paratransit trip dataset to generate the RDARP instances ranging from 17 to 55 heterogeneous passengers with 3 to 13 vehicles during the morning and afternoon periods. Computational results show that our BCP algorithm can optimally solve all small- and medium-sized instances (32 or fewer passengers) within 5 minutes.

This type of research is Research and Development using the ADDIE development method (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation).The effectiveness test of the model was carried out on students with a pretest-treatment-posttest research design on the experimental class and the control class by dividing the experimental class and the control class. In drawing conclusions, statistical analysis of T-test was used on the posttest scores of the experimental class and the control class, and the gain score between the posttest and pretest scores of the experimental class. To ensure the equality of the experimental class with the control class, a pre-test and t-test analysis were carried out and the results found that there was no difference in initial ability between the two classes. From the posttest results, it was known that the average value of the experimental class = 82.73 while the control class = 69.51, and after the T-test there was a significant difference at the 95% confidence level, which means that the use of the model is effective in increasing student competence.The second analysis was carried out by looking at the gain-score between the pretest and posttest values of the experimental class, where the average value was 60.54 and 82.73. After the T-test was conducted, it was also known that there was a significant difference at 95% confidence, which means that the use of the model has been able to increase the posttest score effectively and significantly with the pretest value.

It has been quite difficult to explain this variability by restrictive strategies adopted in the different nations. A significant part of this variation may be dependent on biological and environmental factors. In early April we had predicted a low mortality due to COVID-19 in India based on several factors, cross-immunity to endemic coronaviruses being prominent among them. Cross-reactive antibodies as well as T-cells have been later demonstrated by several groups. The importance of this cross-immunity in modifying the spread of COVID-19 in a population and the development of herd immunity has been discussed by us, as well as other authors who in a recent review have elaborated several theoretical models. Other driving factors of this natural variation of COVID severity may be trained immunity and immune tolerance acquired by the innate immune system, both a result of recurrent infections by diverse pathogens. We hypothesize, that in countries like India, huge sections of population, living in crowded and unsatisfactory hygienic conditions, are subjected to repeated infections by viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic parasites, and this probably leads to a state of 'immune tolerance' in them against a novel organism like SARS-CoV-2. Although at present the major focus is on the detection and containment of COVID-19, including the development of vaccines, it appears that a better understanding of the host's response to SARS-CoV-2 invasion may provide us clues to explain the epidemiology of this pandemic in different countries and formulate nation-specific management plans.

The CMfg concept integrates the distributed resources and capacities in a shared economy, transfers them to the virtual manufacturing services with various quality of service (QoS) properties. These services are invoked to collaborate in producing customized demands with specific functional and non-functional properties. The operational perspective of the service-demand matching problem is considered more in the literature;however, it is a challenging problem in the CMfg ecosystem. This paper evaluates the service-demand matching problem from a structural perspective to facilitate resilience and configurable system working well in the operational interactions. Therefore, a CMfg hyper-network-based model is proposed which is enriched with QoS properties. It employs the available capacities in all small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large companies. The service-demand matching problem is a complex issue;so, it is impossible to analyze it with the current approaches. Here, the CMfg structure is examined through topological characteristics. It helps decision-makers to provide a robust and resilient service-demand matching model. It also proposes some investment opportunities for the SME.

Thus, there has been a substantial effort in understanding these processes: various analytical or numerical models have been developed to describe them, but their validity has not been fully assessed due to the difficulty of a direct comparison with real human exhalations. In this study, we report a unique comparison between datasets that have both detailed measurements of a real human cough using spirometer and particle tracking velocimetry, and direct numerical simulation at similar conditions. By examining the experimental data, we find that the injection velocity at the mouth is not uni-directional. Instead, the droplets are injected into various directions, with their trajectories forming a cone shape in space. Furthermore, we find that the period of droplet emissions is much shorter than that of the cough: experimental results indicate that the droplets with an initial diameter ?10m are emitted within the first 0.05 s, whereas the cough duration is closer to 1 s. These two features (the spread in the direction of injection velocity and the short duration of droplet emission) are incorporated into our direct numerical simulation, leading to an improved agreement with the experimental measurements. Thus, to have accurate representations of human expulsions in respiratory models, it is imperative to include parametrisation of these two features.","output":"Towards realistic simulations of human cough: Effect of droplet emission duration and spread angle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPACT: This work provides context from the patient perspective on the impact of hospital policies on their birthing experiencing during the first peak of the pandemic. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The goal of this study was to report the intrapartum care experiences from people giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Place of birth included hospital, birth center and home births. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Studies that involved patient-related data collection are hindered by pandemic-related changes in clinical practices and research policies. Our aim was to assess patient experience during a pandemic, we explored data collection via a large online community of pregnant women. We asked if women who birthed during COVID-19 changed their birth setting and if they experienced less respectful care, more pressure to undergo induction and/or cesarean birth and newborn separation. We also wanted to explore whether there were differences in the care experience depending on the race of the woman. Open ended questions on care experiences were included and content analysis conducted. Bivariate analysis was conducted comparing those from high versus less COVID-19 impacted areas and by race (White/Black self-identifying). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The mean age was 31.5 years (SD = 5.0), 80.7% identified as White, 85.0% married, and 85.3% privately insured (N=388). Bivariate unadjusted analyses comparing high vs. low impact COVID-19 states, 22.3% considered changing their place of birth versus 12.7% in less impacted areas (p<.05): no difference pressure for induction/cesarean based on region. In bivariate unadjusted analysis comparing White and Black people, Black people had higher odds of pressure for cesarean or induction compared to White (OR 10.3, 95% CI 2.2 to 48.6, p=.0003). Black people had lower respect scores vs. White (68.7 vs. 72.3 p<.01) and higher odds of preterm birth 3.7 (1.1 to 12.4, p=0.04). Content analysis themes were institutional policies, changes in care, hospital staff interactions, sub-par care, support during birth and mental health. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: The analysis demonstrated differences among participants from highly versus less impacted COVID-19 states. Disparities persisted with Black women reporting lower respect, pressure for interventions and more preterm birth when compared to White participants.

Both types of social distancing have been proved to suppress the spread of infectious disease effectively. While previous studies examined the impact of each social distancing separately, the simultaneous impacts of them are less studied. In this research, we develop a mathematical model to analyze how spontaneous social distancing and public social distancing simultaneously affect the outbreak threshold of an infectious disease with asymptomatic infection. A communication-contact two-layer network is constructed to consider the difference between spontaneous social distancing and public social distancing. Based on link overlap of the two layers, the two-layer network is divided into three subnetworks: communication-only network, contact-only network, and overlapped network. Our results show that public social distancing can significantly increase the outbreak threshold of an infectious disease. To achieve better control effect, the subnetwork of higher infection risk should be more targeted by public social distancing, but the subnetworks of lower infection risk shouldnt be overlooked. The impact of spontaneous social distancing is relatively weak. On the one hand, spontaneous social distancing in the communication-only network has no impact on the outbreak threshold of the infectious disease. On the other hand, the impact of spontaneous social distancing in the overlapped network is highly dependent on the detection of asymptomatic infection sources. Moreover, public social distancing collaborates with infection detection on controlling an infectious disease, but their impacts cant add up perfectly. Besides, public social distancing is slightly less effective than infection detection, because infection detection can also promote spontaneous social distancing.","output":"Impacts of social distancing on the spread of infectious diseases with asymptomatic infection: A mathematical model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current antidepressant therapy has several disadvantages related to the properties of antidepressants.

We demonstrated that AZ-853 and AZ-861, which structurally differ by one substituent and its placement in the phenyl ring, showed varied functional, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic properties as well as side effect profiles. AZ-861 exhibited stronger agonistic action in all functional assays. After acute and repeated administration in mice, both compounds showed antidepressant-like activity in the forced swim test, which was partially mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activation. AZ-853 showed a more potent antidepressant-like effect, presumably due to its better penetration into brain structures. Both compounds did not show anticholinergic properties, but after repeated administration, they induced weak sedation and lipid metabolism disturbances without affecting serum glucose level. The stronger 1-adrenolytic effect of AZ-853 is responsible for decreased systolic blood pressure, and in contrast to AZ-861, AZ-853 induced weight gain in mice.

Popular targets for this therapy have been sequences encoding viral proteins and cellular host factors on which viruses depend for their replication. Therefore, availability of technologies that inactivate genes specifically, safely and effectively is crucial. Hence, discovery of RNA interference and advances in gene editing methods have been particularly important to the field. Gene transfer to induce prophylactic and therapeutic immunostimulation is also being developed to manage viral infections. Although promising, progress and ultimate success of antiviral gene therapy is dependent on several factors. These include overcoming problems that are generic to the field and influences of elements that are particular to specific viral infections. Viral and nonviral vectors (NVVs) have been used to deliver antiviral sequences, and both have advantages and drawbacks. Viral vectors are suited to delivering DNA-based expression cassettes, including immunostimulatory and virus-targeting sequences, whereas NVVs may be better applied to carrying therapeutic RNAs such as synthetic short interfering RNAs or mRNAs. Nonviral formulations are appealing because they cause limited immunostimulation, obviate mutagenic effects of DNA, and are amenable to easier dose control and large-scale synthesis. To date, encouraging results have been obtained in preclinical and clinical assessments of gene therapy against HIV-1, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and Ebola viruses, among others.

A descriptive study was performed, analysing significant differences among variables related to SARS-CoV- 2 cases comparing with rest of coronaviruses cases through a bivariate study with Chi-squared test and statistical significance at 95%. RESULTS: Between October 2019 and April 2020, 878 respiratory samples from patients with acute respiratory infection or influenza syndrome obtained by PIDIRAC were analysed. 51.9% tested positive for influenza virus, 48.1% for other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 was present in 6 samples. The first positive SARS-CoV-2 case had symptom onset on 2 March 2020. These 6 cases were 3 men and 3 women, aged between 25 and 50 years old. 67% had risk factors, none had previous travel history nor presented viral coinfection. All of them recovered favourably. CONCLUSION: Sentinel Surveillance PIDIRAC enhances global epidemiological surveillance by allowing confirmation of viral circulation and describes the epidemiology of generalized community respiratory viruses transmission in Catalonia. The system can provide an alert signal when identification of a virus is not achieved in order to take adequate preparedness measures.","output":"Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation using Acute Respiratory Infections sentinel system of Catalonia (PIDIRAC) during the 2019-2020 season: A retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Holocaust survivors in Israel and abroad appear to be especially vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their early life history, advanced age, and associated health conditions.

In a cross-sectional study 258 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, participants completed a questionnaire approximately one month after hospital discharge when demographic and clinical factors (including insomnia) and HRQoL were assessed. A logistic regression was used. Age, gender, marital status, education, having child, early physician visit, early diagnosis, early hospitalization, symptom type, Rhesus factor, and level of insomnia were associated with various components of HRQoL (p<0.05). In multivariate analyses, poorer physical HRQoL was independently associated with female gender (OR=4.53;95% CI=2.22-2.29), initial symptom of cough (OR=2.73;95% CI=1.26-5.94), and insomnia (OR=2.74;95% CI=1.22-6.14).

They have also produced unprecedented exploitation of Earth's life support systems, moving the planet into a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene-one defined by human influence on natural systems. The health sector has been complicit in this influence. Bioethics, too, must acknowledge its role-the environmental threats that will shape human health in this century represent a 'perfect moral storm' challenging the ethical theories of the last. The US conservationist Aldo Leopold saw this gathering storm more clearly than many, and in his Land Ethic describes the beginnings of a route to safe passage. Its starting point is a reinterpretation of the ethical relationship between humanity and the 'land community', the ecosystems we live within and depend upon; moving us from 'conqueror' to 'plain member and citizen' of that community. The justice of the Land Ethic questions many presuppositions implicit to discussions of the topic in biomedical ethics. By valuing the community in itself-in a way irreducible to the welfare of its members-it steps away from the individualism axiomatic in contemporary bioethics. Viewing ourselves as citizens of the land community also extends the moral horizons of healthcare from a solely human focus. Taking into account the 'stability' of the community requires intergenerational justice. The resulting vision of justice in healthcare-one that takes climate and environmental justice seriously-could offer health workers an ethic fit for the future.","output":"Health justice in the Anthropocene: medical ethics and the Land Ethic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present study, we surveyed a sample of working adults (N = 495) in the United States to understand experiences with underemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: We included 229 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in a multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Propensity score matching at a ratio of 1:3 was introduced to eliminate potential confounders. Patients were assigned to the ACEI/ARB group (n = 38) or control group (n = 114) according to whether they were current users of medication. Results: Compared to the control group, patients in the ACEI/ARB group had lower levels of plasma IL-1 [(6.20  0.38) vs. (9.30  0.31) pg/ml, P = 0.020], IL-6 [(31.86  4.07) vs. (48.47  3.11) pg/ml, P = 0.041], IL-8 [(34.66  1.90) vs. (47.93  1.21) pg/ml, P = 0.027], and TNF- [(6.11  0.88) vs. (12.73  0.26) pg/ml, P < 0.01]. Current users of ACEIs/ARBs seemed to have a higher rate of vasoconstrictive agents (20 vs. 6%, P < 0.01) than the control group. Decreased lymphocyte counts [(0.76  0.31) vs. (1.01  0.45)(*)10(9)/L, P = 0.027] and elevated plasma levels of IL-10 [(9.91  0.42) vs. (5.26  0.21) pg/ml, P = 0.012] were also important discoveries in the ACEI/ARB group.

Prediction rules for traumatic brain injury among children with minor head trauma have not been specifically evaluated in infants younger than 3 months old. We aimed to determine the risk of clinically important traumatic brain injuries, traumatic brain injuries on computed tomography (CT) images, and skull fractures in infants younger than 3 months of age who did and did not meet the age-specific Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) low-risk criteria for children with minor blunt head trauma. METHODS We conducted a secondary analysis of infants <3 months old in the public use data set from PECARN's prospective observational study of children with minor blunt head trauma. Main outcomes included (1) clinically important traumatic brain injury, (2) traumatic brain injury on CT, and (3) skull fracture on CT. RESULTS Of 10,904 patients <2 years old, 1,081 (9.9%) with complete data were <3 months old; most (750/1081, 69.6%) sustained falls, and 633/1081 (58.6%) underwent CT scans. Of the 514/1081 (47.5%) infants who met the PECARN low-risk criteria, 1/514 (0.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.005% to 1.1%), 10/197 (5.1%, 2.5% to 9.1%), and 9/197 (4.6%, 2.1% to 8.5%) had clinically important traumatic brain injuries, traumatic brain injuries on CT, and skull fractures, respectively. Of 567 infants who did not meet the low-risk PECARN criteria, 24/567 (4.2%, 95% CI 2.7% to 6.2%), 94/436 (21.3%, 95% CI 17.6% to 25.5%), and 122/436 (28.0%, 95% CI 23.8% to 32.5%) had clinically important traumatic brain injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and skull fractures, respectively. CONCLUSION The PECARN traumatic brain injury low-risk criteria accurately identified infants <3 months old at low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injuries. However, infants at low risk for clinically important traumatic brain injuries remained at risk for traumatic brain injuries on CT, suggesting the need for a cautious approach in these infants.","output":"Risk of Traumatic Brain Injuries in Infants Younger than 3 Months With Minor Blunt Head Trauma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19-related short-term mortality is high in dialysis patients, but longer-term outcomes are largely unknown. We therefore assessed patient recovery in a large cohort of dialysis patients three months after their COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: We analyzed data on dialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 1(st), 2020-March 31(st), 2021 from the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database (ERACODA). The outcomes studied were patient survival, residency, and functional- and mental health status (estimated by their treating physician) three months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Complete follow-up data was available for 854 surviving patients. Patient characteristics associated with recovery were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: In 2449 hemodialysis patients (mean  SD age: 67.5  14.4 years, 62% male) survival probabilities at three months after COVID-19 diagnosis were 90% for non-hospitalized patients (N = 1087), 73% for patients admitted to the hospital but not to an ICU (N = 1165) and 40% for those admitted to an ICU (N = 197). Patient survival hardly decreased between 28 days and three months after COVID-19 diagnosis. At three months, 87% functioned at their pre-existent functional and 94% at their pre-existent mental level. Only few of the surviving patients were still admitted to the hospital (between 0.8 and 6.3%) or a nursing home (approximately 5%). Higher age and frailty score at presentation and ICU admission were associated with worse functional outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality between 28 days and 3 months after COVID-19 diagnosis was low, and the majority of patients who survived COVID-19 recovered to their pre-existent functional and mental health level at three months after diagnosis.","output":"Recovery of dialysis patients with COVID-19: Health outcomes 3 months after diagnosis in ERACODA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enhanced community surveillance is a key pillar of the public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Asymptomatic carriage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potentially significant source of transmission, yet remains relatively poorly understood. Disruption of dental services continues with significantly reduced capacity. Ongoing precautions include preappointment and/or at appointment COVID-19 symptom screening and use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). This study aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental patients to inform community surveillance and improve understanding of risks in the dental setting. Thirty-one dental care centers across Scotland invited asymptomatic-screened patients aged over 5 y to participate. Following verbal consent and completion of sociodemographic and symptom history questionnaire, trained dental teams took a combined oropharyngeal and nasal swab sample using standardized Viral Transport MediumCcontaining test kits. Samples were processed by the Lighthouse Lab and patients informed of their results by SMS/email with appropriate self-isolation guidance in the event of a positive test. All positive cases were successfully followed up by the national contact tracing program. Over a 13-wk period (from August 3, 2020, to October 31, 2020), 4,032 patients, largely representative of the population, were tested. Of these, 22 (0.5%; 95% CI, 0.5%C0.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rate increased over the period, commensurate with uptick in community prevalence identified across all national testing monitoring data streams. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a COVID-19 testing survey in asymptomatic-screened patients presenting in a dental setting. The positivity rate in this patient group reflects the underlying prevalence in community at the time. These data are a salient reminder, particularly when community infection levels are rising, of the importance of appropriate ongoing infection prevention control and PPE vigilance, which is relevant as health care team fatigue increases as the pandemic continues.

Objective: To compare chest CT features of COVID-19, influenza, and OP using a multireader design, and to assess radiologists' performance in distinguishing between these conditions. Methods: This retrospective study included 150 chest CT examinations in 150 patients (mean age 5816 years) with diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or non-infectious OP (50 randomly selected abnormal CT examinations per diagnosis). Six thoracic radiologists independently assessed CT examinations for 14 individual CT findings and Radiologic Society of North America (RSNA) COVID-19 category and recorded a favored diagnosis. CT characteristics of the three diagnoses were compared using random effects models; readers' diagnostic performance was assessed. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly different (p<.05) from influenza pneumonia for seven of 14 chest CT findings, though different (p<.05) from OP for 4 of 14 findings [central or diffuse distribution in 10% and 7% of COVID-19 vs 20% and 21% of OP; unilateral distribution in 1% of COVID-19 vs 7% of OP; non-tree-in-bud nodules in 32% of COVID-19 vs 53% of OP; tree-in-bud nodules in 6% of COVID-19 vs 14% of OP]. A total of 70% of cases of COVID-19, 33% of influenza, and 47% of OP had an RSNA COVID-19 category of typical (p<.001). Mean percentage of correct favored diagnoses compared to actual diagnoses was 44% for COVID-19, 29% for influenza, and 39% for OP. Mean diagnostic accuracy of favored diagnoses was 70% for COVID-19 pneumonia and 68% for both influenza and OP. Conclusion: CT findings of COVID-19 substantially overlap with influenza and, to a greater extent, with OP. Radiologists' diagnostic accuracy was low in a study sample containing equal proportions of these three types of pneumonia.

Therefore, understanding bioaerosol dynamics is important for developing mitigation strategies against droplet-induced infections. Computer modelling, using Computational Fluid Dynamics, has become a useful tool in studying and visualising the spread of atomised bio-droplets but the effect of using cloth facemasks has not been fully quantified. In this study, simulations were carried out to quantify the extent of respiratory droplet transfer with and without facemasks between a pair of ventilated rooms by a mathematical model for the first time. A 600-m pore facemask was used, representing the porosity of a typical cloth facemask. Using the discrete phase model, the transport of ejected droplets was tracked. The results show that in the facemask cases, more than 96% of all the ejected droplets in all scenarios were trapped in the recommended 2 m social distancing radius around the human source. Correspondingly, only a maximum of 80% of droplets were deposited within the social distancing radius in the no facemask scenarios, with &gt;20% airborne and transported to the second room. One-dimensional empirical correlations were developed for droplet concentration as a function of distance from the bioaerosol source. The models show that droplet concentration decays exponentially from the source especially in the facemask cases. The study therefore reinforces the importance of face coverings in lessening the transmission of possibly infected respiratory droplets that transmit highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","output":"Dispersion of virus-laden droplets in ventilated rooms: Effect of homemade facemasks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the first cesarean delivery in a woman with COVID-19 in a level III hospital in Portugal.

Pre-pandemic, all recruitment was in-person with research staff visiting the postpartum patients 1C2 days after delivery to obtain consent. With the onset of pandemic, the multilingual research staff shifted to calling new mothers while they were in the hospital or shortly after discharge, and consent was collected via emailed e-consent links. With return of study staff to the hospitals, a hybrid approach was implemented with in-person recruitment for babies delivered during the weekdays and remote recruitment for babies delivered on weekends and holidays, a cohort not recruited pre-pandemic. There was a drop in the proportion of eligible babies enrolled with the transition to fully remote recruitment from 64% to 38%. In addition, the proportion of babies enrolled after being approached dropped from 91% to 55%. With hybrid recruitment, the proportion of eligible babies enrolled (70%) and approached babies enrolled (84%) returned to pre-pandemic levels. Our experience adapting our study during the COVID-19 pandemic led us to develop new recruitment strategies that we continue to utilize. The lessons learned from this pilot study can serve to help other research studies adapt novel and effective recruitment methods.","output":"Improving Recruitment for a Newborn Screening Pilot Study with Adaptations in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a retrospective study of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral load kinetics using data from patients hospitalised with MERS-CoV infection between 19 May and 20 August, 2015.

The purpose of this narrative literature review is to describe the social determinants of poor management of type 2 diabetes among the insured population and illustrate drivers of poor outcomes beyond insurance coverage. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the provision of health insurance, social determinants play a significant role in shaping diabetes outcomes, especially for economic instability (employment, out-of-pocket expenses associated with diabetes management), food insecurity, education and literacy, access to quality health care (health systems designed to effectively manage chronic disease), neighborhood and the built environment (segregated neighborhoods, socioeconomic conditions of communities, housing), and social and community context (discrimination, social support). SUMMARY: Multiple social determinants shape poor diabetes outcomes among the insured. These determinants are now being further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created the worst economic crisis for US families since the Great Depression. The evidence of this review points to the imperative need for more multilevel intervention approaches to address these determinants in the management of diabetes.","output":"Social Determinants of Poor Management of Type 2 Diabetes Among the Insured"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 public health restrictions have affected end-of-life care experiences for dying patients and their families. AIM: To explore bereaved relatives' experiences of quality of care and family support provided during the last days of life; to identify the impact of factors associated with perceived support. DESIGN: A national, observational, open online survey was developed and disseminated via social media, public fora and professional networks (June-September 2020). Validated instruments and purposively designed questions assessed experiences. Analysis used descriptive statistics, logistic regression and thematic analysis of free-text responses. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals (a??18 years) who had experienced the death of a relative/friend (all care settings) within the United Kingdome during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 278, mean 53.4 years) tended to be female (n = 216, 78%); over half were 'son/daughter' (174, 62.6%) to the deceased. Deceased individuals (mean 81.6 years) most frequently died in their 'usual place of care' (n = 192, 69.3%). Analysis established five conceptual themes affecting individualised care: (1) public health restrictions compounding the distress of 'not knowing'; (2) disparate views about support from doctors and nurses; (3) challenges in communication and level of preparedness for the death; (4) delivery of compassionate care; (5) emotional needs and potential impact on grief. Male respondents (OR 2.9, p = 0.03) and those able to visit (OR 2.2, p = 0.04) were independently associated with good perceptions of family support. CONCLUSION: Despite public health restrictions, individualised care can be enabled by proactive, informative communication; recognising dying in a timely manner and facilitating the ability to be present before death.","output":"Are public health measures and individualised care compatible in the face of a pandemic?

This situation is further being deteriorated due to the negative effects of abiotic stresses. Under such conditions, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are found to improve crop production which is essential for sustainable agriculture. This study is focused on the isolation of potent arsenic (As)-resistant PGPR from the agricultural land of West Bengal, India, and its application to reduce As translocation in rice seedlings. After screening, an As-resistant PGPR strain AS18 was identified by phenotypic characters and 16S rDNA sequence-based homology as Pantoea dispersa. This strain displayed nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (ACCD) activity, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, in addition to As (III) resistance up to 3750 g/mL. The As removal efficiency of this strain was up to 93.12% from the culture medium as evidenced by AAS. The bioaccumulation property of AS18 strain was further validated by TEM-EDAX-XRD-XRF-FTIR studies. This strain showed significant morpho-biochemical improvements including antioxidant enzymatic activities and As-minimization in plant (rice) cells. Thus, being an As-resistant potent PGPR, AS18 strain is expected to be applied in As-spiked agricultural fields for bioremediation and phytostimulation.","output":"Abatement of arsenic-induced phytotoxic effects in rice seedlings by an arsenic-resistant Pantoea dispersa strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Logistics and supply chain management are critical for economic sustainability. In this research, we aim to identify the most critical factors to logistics and supply chain performance for a small open economy by reporting survey results from Estonian manufacturing, trading and logistics service companies. By comparing survey results from 2012 and 2018, we also analyze how these critical factors may have changed during the last years. In the survey, the significance of competitiveness, functionality of logistics, and information and communication technologies (ICT) among others were included. The results indicate that the importance of factors such as purchasing, demand forecasting and operations planning have increased. Overall, purchasing and demand forecasting are considered more important than other factors. Surprisingly, logistics was considered less vital in 2018 than in 2012. Most of the current challenges in companies arise from demand management (forecasting and planning), increasing labour costs and regulatory changes.

Separately, toxic aerosol pollution such as from wildfires, wood burning, and other sources is frequently encountered in these same locations especially with ventilation using outside air. Portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) air purifiers are useful to remove both types of aerosols without relying on ventilation from outside the room. However in order to meet or exceed the recommended 4 to 6 air exchanges per hour (ACH), high price-points and filter replacement costs for select HEPA air purifier models without incurring excessive noise generation make them unaffordable for many households and communities. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of aerosol filtration by commercially available, portable air cleaning devices with HEPA filters and do-it-yourself (DIY) alternatives built from box fans and HVAC filters rated at MERV 13 or 14 using single and quad filter designs. Methods: The comparison is based on three metrics: clean air delivery rate (CADR), the noise generated (dBA), and affordability ($$) using an ISO-certified aerosol measurement device to measure input/output particle filtration of particles sizes ranging from 0.3 microns to 10 microns, airspeed meter to measure airflow, and NIOSH sound meter app to measure noise. Results: Accounting for reduced filtration efficiency of MERV 13/14 filters compared to HEPA, the estimated clean air delivery rate (CADR) of a do-it-yourself (DIY) setup using 2\\" and 4\\" filters with a box fan running at fan speed 1 for tolerable noise was 278 cfm to 371 cfm, comparable or better than a commercial HEPA air purifier running at maximum speed with low noise generation at 282 cfm. The upfront cost of the components of the DIY setup were $35-$58 compared to the commercial HEPA air purifier at $375. However the quad filter design, popularly known as the Corsi-Rosenthal box, did not achieve gains in CADR of more than 60% over a single filter design which is in sharp contrast to the 200-250% gains reported by UC-Davis. Conclusions: DIY alternatives using single 1\\", 2\\" and 4\\" MERV 13/14 filters compare favorably to commercially available systems in terms of estimated CADR and dBA but at five to ten times lower cost. Compared to use of one filter, an improvement in CADR (air flow) was observed with a popular DIY configuration involving quad filter design, popularly known as the Corsi-Rosenthal box, not as high as reported by a recent study by UC-Davis.","output":"Price-performance comparison of HEPA air purifiers and lower-cost MERV 13/14 filters with box fans for filtering out SARS-Cov-2 and other particulate aerosols in indoor community settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pre-clinical responses to fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks heavily depend on choosing the best isolates for animal models that inform diagnostics, vaccines and treatments. Current approaches are driven by practical considerations (e.g. first available virus isolate) rather than a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the virus strain chosen, which can lead to animal models that are not representative of the circulating or emerging clusters. Here, we suggest a combination of epidemiological, experimental and bioinformatic considerations when choosing virus strains for animal model generation. We discuss the currently chosen SARS-CoV-2 strains for international coronavirus disease (COVID-19) models in the context of their phylogeny as well as in a novel alignment-free bioinformatic approach. Unlike phylogenetic trees, which focus on individual shared mutations, this new approach assesses genome-wide co-developing functionalities and hence offers a more fluid view of the 'cloud of variances' that RNA viruses are prone to accumulate. This joint approach concludes that while the current animal models cover the existing viral strains adequately, there is substantial evolutionary activity that is likely not considered by the current models. Based on insights from the non-discrete alignment-free approach and experimental observations, we suggest isolates for future animal models.","output":"Supporting pandemic response using genomics and bioinformatics: A case study on the emergent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communities play an important and active role in preventing and controlling the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Reduction of COVID-19-related barriers and threats perceived by the public should be the top priority in promoting positive preventive behaviors among people This cross-sectional study aimed at identifying the barriers and threats perceived by public university students in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic The students were recruited through a snowball sampling technique, and data were collected using a web-based questionnaire Data on socio-demographic aspects, perceived barriers, and perceived threats were collected Perceived barriers were estimated using the Health Belief Model (HBM) questionnaire, and perceived threats were estimated using the patient threat perceptions in the emergency department scale This study was conducted between March and June 2020 Approximately 50% of the study participants had a high level of perceived barriers and a moderate level of total perceived threats Notable factors associated with participants' perceived barriers and threats were age, college type, and monthly income Perceived barriers, participants' residence location, and sex were also significantly related to each other Moreover, perceived barriers were significantly correlated with perceived threats COVID-19-related perceived barriers and threats ranged from a moderate level to a high level among most of the participating students Perceived barriers were associated with some of the demographic variables The findings from this study may help the government in formulating strategies for planning interventions to reduce COVID-19 pandemic propagation [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Pure & Applied Microbiology is the property of Dr M N Khan and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"The Coronavirus Disease Pandemic: Assessment of Perceived Barriers and Threats among Undergraduate University Students in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The African continent like all other parts of the world with high infection/low vaccination rates can, and will, be a source of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. The A.23 viral lineage, characterized by three spike mutations F157L, V367F and Q613H, was first identified in COVID-19 cases from a Ugandan prison in July 2020, and then was identified in the general population with additional spike mutations (R102I, L141F, E484K and P681R) to comprise lineage A.23.1 by September 2020--with this virus being designated a variant of interest (VOI) in Africa and with subsequent spread to 26 other countries. The P681R spike substitution of the A.23.1 VOI is of note as it increases the number of basic residues in the sub-optimal SARS-CoV-2 spike protein furin cleavage site; as such, this substitution may affect viral replication, transmissibility or pathogenic properties. The same P681R substitution has also appeared in B.1.617 variants, including B.1.617.2 (Delta). Here, we performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the S1/S2 sequence from A.23.1 and B.1.617.2 and observed significantly increased cleavability with furin, compared to sequences derived from the original Wuhan-Hu1 S1/S2. We performed functional infectivity assays using pseudotyped MLV particles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and observed an increase in transduction for A.23.1-pseudotyped particles compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 in Vero-TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells (with a presumed \\"early\\" entry pathway), although lowered infection in Vero E6 cells (with a presumed \\"late\\" entry pathway). However, these changes in infectivity were not reproduced in the original Wuhan-Hu-1 spike bearing only the P681R substitution. Our findings suggest that while A.23.1 has increased furin-mediated cleavage linked to the P681R substitution--which may affect viral infection and transmissibility--this substitution alone is not sufficient and needs to occur on the background of other spike protein changes to enable its full functional consequences.","output":"Spike protein cleavage-activation mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 P681R mutation: a case-study from its first appearance in variant of interest (VOI) A.23.1 identified in Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?sszefoglal.

The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays (two ELISA and three CLIA assays) and one rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Five semiquantitative immunoassays (MENARINI?, PALEX?, VIRCLIA?, ROCHE? and SIEMENS?) and one lateral flow rapid test (WONDFO?) were performed. A total of 124 samples were studied. Case serum samples (n=78) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR/epidemiological-clinical-radiological criteria, and control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n=46) belonged to healthy healthcare workers involved in a seroprevalence study. Results: Overall, the tests showed sensitivities around 70-90% and specificities greater than 95%, including the immunochromatographic test. In addition, we observed very good agreements among them, being better for the detection of IgG than for IgM antibodies (Cohens kappa index of 0.95 for VIRCLIA?

To assess the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this complaint, we performed a step-by-step work up including: low digestive tract endoscopy, colonic transit time measurement and when appropriate anorectal manometry, electromyography and defecographic evaluation. RESULTS Five out of 25 (20%) patients, whose age ranged from 27 to 41 years, were investigated for severe post-operative terminal constipation. Four different mechanisms responsible for terminal constipation were identified: tight stenosis of the colorectal anastomosis, post-operative neurological sequelae, colonic intussusception through the colorectal anastomosis and transit constipation that developed post surgery. CONCLUSIONS Post-operative constipation is a frequent complaint in women managed by colorectal resection for rectal endometriosis. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory as pathophysiologic mechanisms may vary and prove difficult to understand.

This happens mainly through narrativisingdepicting a setting, characters and a meaningful sequence of events and actions unfolding over time. In the early months of the pandemic, UK general practice shifted from face-to-face consultations to a remote-by-default model (telephone, video or e-consultation).

We consider the 12 weeks from March to June 2020 (first lockdown, when remote-by-default services had just been introduced) and 1 week from late July 2020 (following the ministerial announcement). The initial introduction of remote consulting had strong narrative coherence in which all parts of the pentad were balanced: scene (a deadly virus threatening the country) aligned with act (lockdown, including avoiding face-to-face appointments unless essential), agents (the National Health Service and digital technology as heroic macro-actors), agency (general practitioners deployed) and purpose (to control the pandemic). The later period, however, was characterised by a mismatch between scene (a country emerging from lockdown and resuming normal life), act (imposition of the remote model), agent (a politician known for his enthusiasm for technology), agency (top-down directive) and purpose (modernisation). Whereas media narratives in the first period aligned with the genre of heroic adventure (suggesting a worthy battle, bravely fought), those of the second had characteristics of farce (something both comic and grotesque).

Cognitive impairments are common in this population and limit daily functioning. Moreover, neural plasticity in people with SMI appears to be reduced, a factor that might hinder newly learned cognitive skills to sustain. The objective of this pilot trial is to investigate the effects of cognitive remediation (CR) on cognitive and daily functioning in people dependent on residential settings. In addition, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used to promote neural plasticity. It is expected that the addition of tDCS can enhance learning and will result in longer-lasting improvements in cognitive and daily functioning. METHODS: This is a pragmatic, triple-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled, pilot trial following a non-concurrent multiple baseline design with the participants serving as their own control. We will compare (1) CR to treatment as usual, (2) active/sham tDCS+CR to treatment as usual, and (3) active tDCS+CR to sham tDCS+CR. Clinical relevance, feasibility, and acceptability of the use of CR and tDCS will be evaluated. We will recruit 26 service users aged 18 years or older, with a SMI and dependent on residential facilities. After a 16-week waiting period (treatment as usual), which will serve as a within-subject control condition, participants will be randomized to 16 weeks of twice weekly CR combined with active (N = 13) or sham tDCS (N = 13). Cognitive, functional, and clinical outcome assessments will be performed at baseline, after the control (waiting) period, directly after treatment, and 6-months post-treatment. DISCUSSION: The addition of cognitive interventions to treatment as usual may lead to long-lasting improvements in the cognitive and daily functioning of service users dependent on residential facilities. This pilot trial will evaluate whether CR on its own or in combination with tDCS can be a clinically relevant addition to further enhance recovery. In case the results indicate that cognitive performance can be improved with CR, and whether or not tDCS will lead to additional improvement, this pilot trial will be extended to a large randomized multicenter study.

In each case, activating the receptor lowers IOP, but CB1 receptors are found both at sites of aqueous humor inflow and outflow. As such, knockout mice for any of these receptors would be expected to have higher-than average, or at least unchanged, intraocular pressure. The current study investigates the unexpected observation that CB1 knockout mice have lower pressure than wild type counterparts by testing various regulators of cannabinoid signaling in murine models of IOP. We now report that a CB1 antagonist has differential effects on IOP: SR141716 raises IOP in standard light cycle (SLC) but lowers IOP in reverse light cycle (RLC). This is mimicked by ABD1085, a negative allosteric modulator of CB1. CB1 inhibitors lower IOP in both normotensive and hypertensive mouse eyes. The pressure-lowering effect is absent in CB1 knockout mice. IOP rebounds after the end of treatment but shows no sign of desensitization with daily treatment for a week. Unlike the positive cannabinoid effect, antagonist effects are not sex-dependent. We propose that there are two mechanisms of action for CB1, one that lowers IOP upon activation and a second with inverse sign that lowers IOP when CB1 is antagonized. The relatively lower pressure in CB1 knockout mouse eyes suggests that this second negative regulation of IOP is dominant.","output":"Evidence that cannabinoid CB1 receptors regulate intraocular pressure via two opposing mechanisms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac PET/MR imaging is an integrated imaging approach that requires less radiation than PET/computed tomography and combines the high spatial resolution and morphologic data from MR imaging with the physiologic information from PET.

Viral myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium caused by virus infection in the heart. The disease progression of viral myocarditis occurs in three distinct stages: acute viral infection, immune cell infiltration, and cardiac remodelling. Growing evidence suggests a crucial role for host proteolytic machineries in the regulation of the pathogenesis and progression of viral myocarditis in all three stages. Cardiotropic viruses evolve different strategies to subvert host protein degradation systems to achieve successful viral replication. In addition, these proteolytic systems play important roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses during viral infection. Recent evidence also suggests a key role for the ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosome systems as the primary effectors of protein quality control in the regulation of cardiac remodelling. This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the direct interaction between cardiotropic viruses and host proteolytic systems, with an emphasis on coxsackievirus B3, one of the primary aetiological agents causing viral myocarditis, and highlights possible roles of the host degradation systems in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis and its progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.","output":"Protein degradation systems in viral myocarditis leading to dilated cardiomyopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to examine the ability of a submaximal cycling test to detect longitudinal changes in maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max) and examine the conformity between changes in measured and estimated VO(2)max over a time span of 5C8 years. METHODS: A total of 35 participants (21 men and 14 women), aged 29 to 63 years, performed the Ekblom-Bak (EB) submaximal cycle test for estimation of VO(2)max and a maximal treadmill running test for direct measurement of VO(2)max. The baseline tests were conducted between 2009 and 2012, and the follow-up tests were completed 5 to 8 years later. Pearsons coefficient of correlation (r) and paired sample t-test were used to analyse the association between change in measured and estimated VO(2)max. Random and systematic errors between the measured and estimated VO(2)max were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots. Repeated measures ANOVA were used to test differences between changes over time. RESULTS: There was no significant change in mean measured VO(2)max between baseline and follow-up (p = 0.91), however large individual variations were noted (? 0.78 to 0.61 L/min). The correlation between individual change in measured and estimated VO(2)max was r = 0.75 (p < 0.05), and the unstandardised B-coefficient from linear regression modelling was 0.88 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.15), i.e., for each litre of change in estimated VO(2)max, the measured value had changed 0.88 L. The correlation between baseline and follow-up errors (the difference between estimated-measured VO(2)max at each occasion) was r = 0.84 (p < 0.05). With regard to the testing procedure, repeated measures ANOVA revealed that there was no significant difference between the group who exercised at the same work rates at baseline and follow-up (n = 25), and those who required a change in work rate (n = 10). CONCLUSIONS: The EB test detected a change in VO(2)max with reasonably good precision over a time span of 5C8 years.

This transition has introduced several issues in code migration to support multiple frameworks for targeting the various architectures. In order to cope with these challenges, projects such as Kokkos and LLVM create abstractions which map a generic front-end API to the backend that supports the targeted architecture. This paper presents a complementary framework for performance measurement and analysis. Several performance measurement and analysis tools in existence provide their capabilities through various methods but the common theme among these tools are prohibitive limitations in terms of user-level extensions. For this reason, software developers commonly have to learn multiple tools and valuable analysis methods, such as the roofline model, are frequently required to be generated manually. The timemory framework provides complete modularity for performance measurement and analysis and eliminates all restrictions on user-level extensions. The timemory framework also provides a highly-efficient and intuitive method for handling multiple tools/measurements (i.e., components) concurrently. The intersection of these characteristics provide ample evidence that timemory can serve as the common interface for existing performance measurement and analysis tools. Timemory components are developed in C++ but includes multi-language support for C, Fortran, and Python codes. Numerous components are provided by the library itself C including, but not limited to, timers, memory usage, hardware counters, and FLOP and instruction roofline models. Additionally, analysis of the intrinsic overhead demonstrates superior performance in comparison with popular tools.","output":"Timemory: Modular Performance Analysis for HPC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The aim of this article is to identify processes and recognise determinants in the copper mining industry supply chain creation and activity taking into account the influence of CoVID-19 pandemic. Design/Approach: The research was conducted using qualitative methods. As part of the research procedure, process analysis was carried out using the method of mapping processes in the mining industry supply chain (on the example of copper mining). To analyse and evaluate the examined processes were presented in the form of graphical maps developed using the ADONIS software. A case study was used to show the specificity of the studies case (copper mining supply chain) and accompanying phenomena. Findings: The results of the study indicate that the coordination and integration of logistics processes has a significant impact on the mining supply chain. It is necessary to point out that the mining processes are separate from production processes. The individual tier of copper mining supply chain has their specific determinants that can be identified in the following groups: natural and geological, political, economic, legislative, social, environmental, and technological. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the intensity of the search for new technologies, human security, remote communication processes and process tracking tools;it also increased the need for cooperation and searching for cooperative solutions regarding sustainable development and the circular economy. Practical Implications: The results can be used to improve the operation of the supply chain. The conducted analyses have significant practical implications for the design of efficiency, security, and resilience of supply chains.

The event affected 11 states; however, the majority of the oil residue was collected (~ 5380 tons) near nine states (99.8%) in northeastern Brazil. This spill was not the largest in volume (between 5000 m(3) and 12,000 m(3)) recorded in tropical oceans, but it was the most extensive (2890 km). This spill develops an overwashed tar that remains mostly in the undersurface drift (non-floating oil plume) below 17 m of depth while on the continental shelf. Ten ecosystems were impacted, with potentially more severe effects in mangroves and seagrasses. Certain negative effects are still understudied, such as effects on tropical reefs and rhodolith beds. A total of 57 protected areas in seven management categories were affected, most of which (60%) were characterized as multiple-use regions. The spill affected at least 34 threatened species, with impacts detected on plankton and benthic communities. Acute impacts were reported on echinoderms, coral symbionts, polychaetes, and sponges with evidence of oil ingestion. Socioeconomic impacts were detected in food security, public health, lodging, gender equality, tourism, and fishing, with reduced sales, prices, tourist attractiveness, gross domestic product, and employment. Moreover, chemical contamination was detected in some states by toxic metals (Hg, As, Cd, Pb, and Zn) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (acenaphthalene, fluoranthene, fluorene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene).

The respondents were asked to complete a 7-item self-compiled online teaching satisfaction questionnaire. Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis are used. RESULTS: Sex is female (OR = 1.257, 95%CI: 1.132 ~ 1.396), grades are second and third grades (second grades: OR = 1.228, 95%CI: 1.080 ~ 1.397; third grades: OR = 1.197, 95%CI: 1.048 ~ 1.367), normal/unfamiliar learning platform operation (OR = 3.692, 95%CI: 3.321 ~ 4.103) were risk factors for satisfactory teaching effect. In addition, students whose school year system is four-year (OR = 0.870, 95%CI: 0.781 ~ 0.969) and grade 4 and above (OR = 0.594, 95%CI: 0.485 ~ 0.727) were more satisfied with the teaching effect of teachers. And, during the period of the COVID-19 epidemic, the risk factors for college students to have psychological stress were: female (OR = 1.258, 95%CI: 1.096 ~ 1.442), from rural areas (OR = 1.511, 95%CI: 1.312 ~ 1.740), and the academic year system is four-year system (OR = 1.191, 95%CI: 1.028 ~ 1.380), using mobile phones and other learning tools (OR = 1.388, 95%CI: 1.205 ~ 1.600), general/unfamiliar with learning platform operations (OR = 2.273), 95%CI: 1.888 ~ 2.735). While the protective factors for college students psychological stress included: grade three and four and above (OR = 0.463, 95%CI: 0.387 ~ 0.554; OR = 0.232, 95%CI: 0.187 ~ 0.286), and they think that the teaching effect is satisfactory (OR = 0.314, 95%CI: 0.261 ~ 0.379).

Methods A comprehensive search was performed using Ovid, Cochrane, Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus from inception till January 16, 2020. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials were included, while pediatric/animal studies, letters/case reports, reviews, abstracts, and book chapters were excluded. All-cause mortality was studied as the primary outcome. Cardiovascular mortality, cancer-related deaths and cerebrovascular accidents were studied as secondary outcomes. Results From 4729 studies, four studies met the inclusion criteria. Random effects pooled analysis showed that all-cause mortality among CP consumers was lower, compared to rare/non-consumers, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.87 [95% CI: 0.85-0.90; p<0.0001; I 2=1%]. HR for cardiovascular mortality was 0.83 [95% CI: 0.74-0.95; p = 0.005, I 2=66%] and for cancer-related mortality as 0.92 [95% CI: 0.87-0.97; p = 0.001; I 2=0%]. However, the HR for CVA was 0.78 [95% CI: 0.56-1.09; p = 0.26; I2 =60%]. The mode and amount of CP consumption varied across the studies, and data were insufficient to design an optimal strategy guiding its intake. Conclusion Regular CP consumption was associated with significantly lower all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer-related mortalities. However, based on current literature, it is difficult to derive a standardized approach to guide the optimal mode and amount of CP consumption.

We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on trends in hospital admissions and workflow parameters of acute stroke care in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. METHODS: We used data from the three hospitals that provide acute stroke care for the Amsterdam region. We compared two 7-week periods: one during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak (March 16thCMay 3th 2020) and one prior to the outbreak (October 21stCDecember 8th 2019). We included consecutive patients who presented to the emergency departments with a suspected stroke and assessed the change in number of patients as an incidence-rate ratio (IRR) using a Poisson regression analysis. Other outcomes were the IRR for stroke subtypes, change in use of reperfusion therapy, treatment times, and in-hospital complications.

Given evidence for bias related to women in science and medicine, and editorial board attitudes, our hypothesis was that submissions by women authors, on womens reproductive, non-disease topics received differential editorial assessment. DESIGN: A prospective investigation of publications, author gender and topics in general medical journals in two issues following the editorial rejections of two clinical research manuscripts by five major English-language general medical journals. The rejected manuscripts (subsequently published in lower impact journals) described research funded by national granting bodies, in population-based samples, authored by well-published women scientists at accredited institutions and describing innovative womens reproductive physiology results. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All clinical research published in the two issues following rejection date by each of the five major general medical journals were examined for first/senior author gender. The publication topic was assessed for its gendered population relevance, whether disease or physiology focused, and its funding. Rejection letters assessed editor gender and status. RESULTS: Women were underrepresented as original research authors; men were 84% of senior and 69% of first authors. There were no, non-disease focused publications relating to womens health, although most topics were relevant to both genders. The majority (80%) of rejection letters appeared to be written by junior-ranked women editors.

CASE PRESENTATION: We herein report a patient, who presented with fever, both acute kidney and liver injury, anemia, thrombocytopenia and HSV stomatitis. HLH was diagnosed based on clinical criteria and qPCR revealed an acute parvovirus B19 infection as potential underlying infectious trigger. Treatment was started with both IVIG and dexamethasone. Subsequently, kidney biopsy demonstrated TMA. CONCLUSIONS: In rare cases both HLH and aHUS can occur simultaneously in a patient as a consequence of viral infections.

On this ground, this study aims to systematically analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with asthma. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective and observational cohort study, 21 COVID-19 patients with asthma and 100 non-asthma COVID-19 patients were statistically matched by propensity score based on age, sex and comorbidities. Meanwhile, a collection and comparison concerning demographic indicators, clinical and laboratory examinations, treatments and outcomes were conducted between two groups to specify their differences. RESULTS: Statistically, the COVID-19 patients with asthma had a higher proportion of ICU admission (14.3% [3/21] vs. 2.1% [2/96] p = 0.040) than those who do not have. On top this, a higher level of inflammatory responses, such as interleukin 6, interleukin 8, procalcitonin, leukocytes, neutrophils and CD4(+) T cells was presented in asthma patients. Moreover, the increase of organ damage indices like D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, were more pronounced in COVID-19 patients with asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Exacerbated inflammatory responses and multiple organ damages were triggered in COVID-19 patients with asthma, which highlights more intensive surveillance and supportive treatment.","output":"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with asthma in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019, a viral pneumonia disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), emerged in Wuhan, China.

Although this infective disease is mostly characterized by respiratory tract symptoms, increasing numbers of evidence had shown considerable amounts of patients with cardiovascular involvements and these were associated with higher mortality among COVID-19 patients. Cardiac involvement as a possible late phenomenon of the viral respiratory infection is an issue that should be anticipated in patients with COVID-19. Cardiovascular manifestation in COVID-19 patients include myocardial injury (MI), arrhythmias, cardiac arrests, heart failure and coagulation abnormality, ranging from 7.2% up to 33%. The mechanism of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients involves direct injury to myocardial cells mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors as suggested by some studies, while the other studies suggest that systemic inflammation causing indirect myocyte injury may also play a role. Combination of proper triage, close monitoring, and avoidance of some drugs that have cardiovascular toxicity are important in the management of cardiovascular system involvement in COVID-19 patients.

Trolls, poised to disrupt the online discourse and spread disinformation, quickly seized the absence of a credible response to COVID-19 and created a COVID-19 infodemic by promulgating dubious content on Twitter. To counter the COVID-19 infodemic, the TrollHunter leverages a unique linguistic analysis of a multi-dimensional set of Twitter content features to detect whether or not a tweet was meant to troll. TrollHunter achieved 98.5% accuracy, 75.4% precision and 69.8% recall over a dataset of 1.3 million tweets. Without a final resolution of the pandemic in sight, it is unlikely that the trolls will go away, although they might be forced to evade automated hunting. To explore the plausibility of this strategy, we developed and tested an adversarial machine learning mechanism called TrollHunter-Evader. TrollHunter-Evader employs a Test Time Evasion (TTE) approach in a combination with a Markov chain-based mechanism to recycle originally trolling tweets. The recycled tweets were able to achieve a remarkable 40% decrease in the TrollHunter's ability to correctly identify trolling tweets. Because the COVID-19 infodemic could have a harmful impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, we provide an elaborate discussion about the implications of employing adversarial machine learning to evade Twitter troll hunts.","output":"TrollHunter [Evader]: Automated Detection [Evasion] of Twitter Trolls During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies published in the Telemedicine and e-Health journal stated the reality in Italy of the importance of telemedicine promotion during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Prefusion S binding titers positively correlated with plasma neutralizing activity, indicating that physical stabilization of the prefusion conformation enhances protection against SARS-CoV-2. We show that almost all plasma neutralizing activity is directed to prefusion S, in particular the S(1) subunit, and that variant cross-neutralization is mediated solely by RBD-specific antibodies.

We also compared the properties of these antibodies to serological fingerprints (affinities and concentrations) of wild type RBD specific antibodies in 74 convalescent sera. The affinities of the therapeutic mAbs to wild type and Delta RBD were in the same range as the polyclonal response in the convalescent sera indicative of their high antiviral activities against these variants.

Cytokines IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 have been found to stimulate the growth of T cells, however, the optimized combination of these three cytokines for T cell proliferation is unknown. In this study, we designed an integrated experimental and modeling approach to optimize cytokine supplementation for rapid expansion in clinical applications. We assessed the growth data for statistical improvements over no cytokine supplementation and used a systems biology approach to identify genes with the highest magnitude of expression change from control at several time points. Further, we developed a predictive mathematical model to project the growth rate for various cytokine combinations, and investigate genes and reactions regulated by cytokines in activated CD4(+) T cells. The most favorable conditions from the T cell growth study and from the predictive model align to include the full range of IL-2 and IL-7 studied, and at lower levels of IL-15 (6 ng/mL or 36 ng/mL). The highest growth rates were observed where either IL-2 or IL-7 was at the highest concentration tested (15 ng/mL for IL-2 and 80 ng/mL for IL-7) while the other was at the lowest (1 ng/mL for IL-2 and 6 ng/mL for IL-7), or where both IL-2 and IL-7 concentrations are moderate-corresponding to condition keys 200, 020, and 110 respectively.

We previously developed the DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 encoding chicken type II collagen (CCII) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the present study, we characterized its dynamic profile, biodistribution, and potential for genomic DNA integration in normal vaccinated rodent. RESULTS: A real-time quantitative PCR analysis (RT-qPCR) of animals administered a single dose of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 (300 g/kg by intramuscular injection) showed that CCOL2A1 mRNA level in the blood peaked between 2 and 6 h post-immunization and then rapidly declined, and was undetectable between day 1C42. CCOL2A1 transcript was detected at the muscle injection site on days 3C14 post-immunization. Starting from day 14, the transcript was detected in the heart, liver, lung, and kidney but not in the spleen or thymus, and was expressed only in the lung on day 28. There was no CCOL2A1 mRNA present in the testes or ovaries at any time point. Non-invasive in vivo fluorescence imaging revealed CCII protein expression from 2 h up to day 10 and from 2 h up to day 35 after administration of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 via the intravenous and intramuscular routes, respectively; the protein had disappeared by day 42. Importantly, CCOL2A1 was not integrated into the host genome. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that pcDNA-CCOL2A1 vaccine is rapidly cleared within a short period of time and is therefore safe, and merits further development as a therapeutic vaccine for RA treatment.","output":"Dynamic profiles, biodistribution and integration evaluation after intramuscular/intravenous delivery of a novel therapeutic DNA vaccine encoding chicken type II collagen for rheumatoid arthritis in vaccinated normal rodent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online learning is not a new thing nowadays.

In this paper we assess the 1918-flu long-term effects not just of in utero exposure but also during infancy and early childhood. A unique set of events that took place in Puerto Rico during 1918C1919 generated conditions of a double quasi-natural experiment. We exploit these conditions to empirically identify effects of exposure to the 1918 flu pandemic and those of the devastation left by an earthquake-tsunami that struck the island in 1918. Because the earthquake-tsunami affected mostly the Western coast of the island whereas early (in utero and postnatal) exposure to the flu was restricted to those born in the interval 1917C1920, we use geographic variation to identify the effects of the quake and timing of birth variation to identify those of the flu. We benefit from availability of information on markers of nutritional status in a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 75 and older in 2002. We make two contributions. First, unlike most fetal-origins research that singles out early nutritional status as a determinant of adult health, we hypothesize that the 1918 flu damaged the nutritional status of adult survivors who, at the time of the flu, were in utero or infants. Second, we target markers of nutritional status largely set when the adult survivors were infants and young children. Estimates of effects of the pandemic are quite large mostly among females and those who were exposed to the earthquake-tsunami. Impacts of the flu in areas less affected by the earthquake are smaller but do vary by area flu severity. These findings constitute empirical evidence supporting the conjecture that effects of the 1918 flu and/or the earthquake are associated not just with disruption experienced during the fetal period but also postnatally.","output":"Impacts of the 1918 flu on survivors' nutritional status: A double quasi-natural experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses have an educational background particularly suited to the growing challenges of the 21st century, characterized by an accelerated demographic transition, accompanied by a scenario of triple disease burden: 1) the unsurpassed agenda for infectious diseases; 2) the increase in deaths attributable to external causes; and 3) the predominance of chronic noncommunicable diseases.

PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-four consecutive fracture patients 18 years or older admitted for surgery. INTERVENTION: Patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with either molecular and/or serological techniques and screened for presentation of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Patients were interviewed and charts reviewed for demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and surgical characteristics. RESULTS: We interviewed all patients and tested 137 (95.7%) of them. Three positive patients for SARS-CoV-2 were identified (2.1%). One was asymptomatic and the other 2 required admission due to COVID-19-related symptoms. Mortality for the whole cohort was 13 patients (9%). Significant association was found between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and epidemiological variables including: intimate exposure to respiratory symptomatic patients (P = 0.025) and intimate exposure to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (P = 0.013).

Here we explore the accuracy of the IMX-BVN-3/IMX-SEV-3 29 mRNA host response classifiers in simultaneously detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, bacterial co-infections, and predicting clinical severity of COVID-19. METHODS: 161 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (52.2% female, median age 50.0 years, 51% hospitalized, 5.6% deaths) were enrolled at the Stanford Hospital ED. RNA was extracted (2.5 mL whole blood in PAXgene Blood RNA) and 29 host mRNAs in response to the infection were quantified using Nanostring nCounter. RESULTS: The IMX-BVN-3 classifier identified SARS-CoV-2 infection in 151 patients with a sensitivity of 93.8%. Six of 10 patients undetected by the classifier had positive COVID tests more than 9 days prior to enrolment and the remaining oscillated between positive and negative results in subsequent tests. The classifier also predicted that 6 (3.7%) patients had a bacterial co-infection. Clinical adjudication confirmed that 5/6 (83.3%) of the patients had bacterial infections, i.e. Clostridioides difficile colitis (n=1), urinary tract infection (n=1), and clinically diagnosed bacterial infections (n=3) for a specificity of 99.4%. 2/101 (2.8%) patients in the IMX-SEV-3 Low and 7/60 (11.7%) in the Moderate severity classifications died within thirty days of enrollment.

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: ICUs in a tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: Patients with medical critical illness. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared outcomes for critically ill medical patients admitted to a non-medical specialty ICU team (April 1 - August 30, 2020) with those admitted to the medical ICU team (January 1, 2018 - March 31, 2020). The primary outcome was hospital mortality; secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and hospital disposition for survivors. Our cohort consisted of 1241 patients admitted to the medical ICU team and 230 admitted to non-medical ICU teams. Unadjusted hospital mortality (medical ICU, 38.8% vs non-medical ICU, 42.2%, p = 0.33) and hospital LOS (7.4 vs 7.4 days, p = 0.96) were similar between teams. Among survivors, more non-medical ICU team patients were discharged home (72.6% vs 82.0%, p = 0.024). After multivariable adjustment, we found no difference in mortality, LOS, or home discharge between teams. However, among hospital survivors, admission to a non-medical ICU team was associated with a longer LOS (regression coefficient [95% CI] for log-transformed hospital LOS: 0.23 [0.05,0.40], p = 0.022).

This study adopted a mixed-method design to examine online teaching self-efficacy (TSE) during COVID-19, its associated factors and moderators. A sample of 351 Chinese school teachers retrospectively reported their online TSE at the beginning and end of COVID-19 school lockdown, out of which six were followed up for an in-depth interview. TSE for online instruction did not significantly increase (? = .014, p > 0.05) whereas that for technology application increased significantly (? = .231, p < 0.01). Lack of experience in online teaching, separation of teachers from students, school administrative process and unsatisfactory student academic performance were identified as the major associated factors. A moderation effect of adaptability and teacher burnout on the change in online TSE were examined, of which passion burnout was the only significant moderator toward the change in online TSE.

Here we briefly summarize information about age-related changes in the immune system and present current data on their impact on the formation of the immune response to vaccination. Older age is accompanied by the process of biological aging accompanied by involution of the immune system with increased susceptibility to infections and a decrease in the effect of immunization. Therefore, in the ongoing mass COVID-19 vaccination, the older adults are a growing public health concern. The authors provide an overview of the various types of COVID-19 vaccines approved for mass immunization of the population by the end of 2020, including older adults, as well as an overview of strategies and platforms to improve the effectiveness of vaccination of this population.

This study evaluated the pandemic's impact on access and timeliness of imaging and surgical intervention Method: This observational study compared 2 cohorts of patients admitted in a 10-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic and a similar time period in 2019. Variables included demographics, time to CT scan and to surgery and operative characteristics. Statistical comparisons were undertaken using Mann Whitney U, Fisher's exact and Chisquared tests Result: Of 642 patients, 405 were admitted in 2019 and 237 in 2020 representing a 41.5% absolute reduction in trauma admissions during the pandemic. There were no statistical differences (P=0.2585) between arrival to the Emergency Department and time to CT scan across both years (median 42 minutes) or between operative approach (P=0.728) and level of post-operative care (P=0.788). However, there were statistical differences in time to surgery (P=0.0193) and operative length (P=0.0141) with a 2-fold increase in overnight operating, 31.2% increase in patients operated on<24 hours from admission, and 42.9% reduction in surgery lasting >120 minutes during the COVID-19 pandemic Conclusion: Early robust restructuring of trauma services during the COVID-19 pandemic ensured timely access to appropriate imaging and surgery for major trauma injured patients.

In addition to specific antiviral agents, massive vaccination is thought to be the most effective way of controlling the transmission. To understand the prevaccination status of certain risk groups, this study compared the baseline sero-prevalence of antibodies to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus among hospital staff with different contact risks and that of the general population. Methods A total of 295 serum samples from hospital staff and 244 control serum samples from people who came for physical check-up (control group) were collected between October 2009 and November 2009 before the massive vaccination campaign. The hospital staff was divided into first-line risk personnel (group 1) and second-line risk personnel (group 2) according to their potential contact risks. Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests were conducted to determine the individual serological status. The seropositive rate (SPR, defined as the proportion with HI titer  1:40) of antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus and its geometric mean titer (GMT) were calculated and compared among the different groups. Results The mean ages and sex ratio (% male) of the hospital staff and control groups were 36.9  10.6 years and 52.0  12.6 years, and 24.4% and 57.6%, respectively. The SPR of the antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus of the hospital staff was significantly higher than that of the control group (20.0% vs. 2.9%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the SPR antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus of group 1 were significantly higher than that of group 2 (30.8% vs. 12.6%, p < 0.001). However, the GMT of antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus of the hospital staff was not significantly different from that of the control group (p = 0.925). Conclusion The SPR of antibodies against the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in the hospital staff was higher than that in the general population, reflecting a higher contact risk.

An earlier randomized trial showed that rivaroxaban is no more effective than aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke after a presumed embolic stroke from an undetermined source. Whether dabigatran would be effective in preventing recurrent strokes after this type of stroke was unclear. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of dabigatran at a dose of 150 mg or 110 mg twice daily as compared with aspirin at a dose of 100 mg once daily in patients who had had an embolic stroke of undetermined source. The primary outcome was recurrent stroke. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. RESULTS A total of 5390 patients were enrolled at 564 sites and were randomly assigned to receive dabigatran (2695 patients) or aspirin (2695 patients). During a median follow-up of 19 months, recurrent strokes occurred in 177 patients (6.6%) in the dabigatran group (4.1% per year) and in 207 patients (7.7%) in the aspirin group (4.8% per year) (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 1.03; P = 0.10). Ischemic strokes occurred in 172 patients (4.0% per year) and 203 patients (4.7% per year), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.03). Major bleeding occurred in 77 patients (1.7% per year) in the dabigatran group and in 64 patients (1.4% per year) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.66). Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 70 patients (1.6% per year) and 41 patients (0.9% per year), respectively. CONCLUSIONS In patients with a recent history of embolic stroke of undetermined source, dabigatran was not superior to aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke. The incidence of major bleeding was not greater in the dabigatran group than in the aspirin group, but there were more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events in the dabigatran group.

Firstly; by restricting the infection to the upper airways and reducing the chance of systemic infection that may reduce host mobility and increase mortality, and thus limit the spread of the virus. Secondly; by causing a mild upper airway illness with a limited immune response compared to systemic infection, which means that persistent herd immunity does not develop to the same extent as with systemic infections, and re-infection may occur later.

Individuals are encouraged to regularly wash their hands for 40-60 s under running water with soap. This call for 'Safe Hands' comes at a time when water insecurity and limited access to handwashing facilities in Africa is heightened. In this article, Chitungwiza city in Zimbabwe is used as a case study to assess the implications of the 'Safe Hands' challenge for poor municipalities in developing countries and characterize the challenges they face. To do so, interviews were conducted at water points/boreholes used by residents during Zimbabwe's COVID-19 national lockdown. The calculation of water requirements for proper hand hygiene determined the capacity for water-stressed regions to effectively implement 'Safe Hands'. On average, it was established that one person consumes an extra 4.5 L per day of water when they practice WHO 'Safe Hands' in the context of COVID-19. This increases domestic water demand in Chitungwiza by 9%. Due to water scarcity, people in Chitungwiza were experiencing challenges with practicing 'Safe Hands'. With their 'dry taps' woes, they might not be able to meet the standards of this WHO challenge. Lack of soap also reduced the effectiveness of the 'Safe Hands' challenge. This paper proposes short- and long-term measures that would allow effective implementation of the 'Safe Hands' by means of sustainable potable water supply. These measures include extensive social awareness and temporary change of household water use behavior. Municipalities are recommended to establish public private partnerships (PPPs) to create immediate and long-term water investments. Structural and transformational reforms would enhance, through flexible planning, investments for both water infrastructure and governance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this phase I pilot study, twelve consecutive patients were anesthetized using conventional ventilator settings (CV) and then OV strategy during which oxygenation and lung compliance were noted. Subsequently, a lung resection was performed. Data were collected during both modes of ventilation in each patient, with each patient acting as his own control. The postoperative course was monitored for complications. RESULTS Twelve patients underwent open thoracotomies for seven lobectomies and five segmentectomies. The OV strategy provided consistent one-lung anesthesia and improved static compliance (40  7 versus 25  4 mL/cm H2O, P = 0.002) with airway pressures similar to CV. Postresection oxygenation (SpO2/FiO2) was better during OV (433  11 versus 386  15, P = 0.008). All postoperative chest x-rays were free of atelectasis or infiltrates. No patient required supplemental oxygen at any time postoperatively or on discharge. The mean hospital stay was 4  1 d. There were no complications or mortality. CONCLUSIONS The OV strategy, previously shown to have benefits during mechanical ventilation of patients with respiratory failure, proved safe and effective in lung resection patients. Because postoperative pulmonary complications may be directly attributable to the anesthetic management, adopting an OV strategy that optimizes lung mechanics and gas exchange may help reduce postoperative problems and improve overall surgical results.

Guggulsterone (GST) has a neuroprotective effect on autistic conditions by modulating these signalling pathways. Consequently, the primary objective of this study was to examine potential neuroprotective properties of GST by modulating JAK/STAT and PPAR-gamma levels in intracerebroventricular propionic acid (ICV PPA) induced experimental model of autism in adult rats. In this study, the first 11 days of ICV-PPA injections in rats resulted in autism-like behavioural, neurochemical, morphological, and histopathological changes. The above modifications were also observed in various biological samples, including brain homogenate, CSF, and blood plasma. GST was also observed to improve autism-like behavioural impairments in autistic rats treated with PPA, including locomotion, neuromuscular coordination, depression-like behaviour, spatial memory, cognition, and body weight. Prolonged GST treatment also restored neurochemical deficits in a dose-dependent manner. Chronic PPA administration increased STAT3 and decreased PPAR gamma in autistic rat brain, CSF, and blood plasma samples, which were reversed by GST. GST also restored the gross and histopathological alterations in PPA-treated rat brains.

The goal of having a set of initiatives and procedures to tackle them is the need of the hour. Rapid detection and point-of-care (POC) analysis of pathogens causing these diseases is not only a problem entailing the scientific community but also raises challenges in tailoring appropriate treatment strategies to the healthcare sector. Among the various methods used to detect pathogens, Electrochemical Biosensor Technology is at the forefront in the development of POC devices. Electrochemical Biosensors stand in good stead due to their rapid response, high sensitivity and selectivity and ease of miniaturization to name a few advantages.

However, the efficacy of MSCs can still be promoted if pretreatment is applied to enhance their poor migration towards the damaged liver. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of IL-1? pretreatment on the efficacy and homing ability of MSCs in ALF. Methods: MSCs were isolated by the whole bone marrow adherence method and characterized. The efficacy and homing ability of IL-1?-pretreated MSCs (Pre-MSCs) were examined in a rat ALF model and compared with that of MSCs and normal saline. Then, Western blot was performed to detect the c-Met and CXCR4 expression of MSCs and Pre-MSCs and followed by flow cytometry to detect the meaningful indicators. Finally, the migration abilities of different cells and different conditions were tested by the Transwell migration assay. Results: MSCs of ideal purity were successfully isolated and cultured. Comparing with MSCs, Pre-MSCs had significantly better efficacy on improving the survival rate and liver function of ALF rats. Further analyses of damaged liver tissues showed that IL-1? pretreatment significantly enhanced the efficacy of MSCs on suppressing liver necrosis. Besides, Pre-MSCs exhibited better effects in inhibiting apoptosis and activating proliferation. The results of tracing experiments with CM-Dil-labeled cells confirmed that more cells migrated to the damaged liver in the Pre-MSC group. In terms of mechanism, the CXCR4 expression was significantly enhanced by IL-1? pretreatment, and an increased migration ability towards SDF-1 that could be reversed by AMD3100 was found in Pre-MSCs. Conclusion: IL-1? pretreatment could enhance the homing ability of MSCs at least partially by increasing the expression of CXCR4 and further improve the efficacy of MSCs on ALF.","output":"IL-1?

METHODS: With repeated surveys conducted with relatively uniformed standards, the UNICEF Data warehouse compiles and publishes a wide spectrum of health indicators, of which data analysis and visualization would reveal the underlying statuses and trends on global, regional and national levels. RESULTS: Apparent geographic disparity is present in that sub-Saharan African countries lag far behind their counterparts in other regions with regard to most health indicators on adolescents. Education attendance rates sequentially drop from primary to secondary school levels, and display correlation with youth literacy. Harmful practices of early marriage, early childbearing and female genital mutilation have decreased but the presences of peer violence and sexual violence are worthy of attentions. Although incidence and mortality rates of HIV/AIDS have dropped (most notably in sub-Saharan Africa), adolescents' HIV/AIDS awareness remains suboptimal in selected countries. Cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths in the adolescents are comparable to the children but relatively lower than the adult and senior groups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings on the health indicators of adolescents until 2019 reveal the most recent status quo for reference right before the hit of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

AIMS We aimed to investigate whether patients with different types of stroke admitted during weekends have a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in rural and urban hospitals in the US. METHODS We used data from the 2016 National Inpatient Sample and used logistic regression to assess in-hospital mortality for weekday and weekend admissions among stroke patients aged 18 and older by stroke type (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and rural or urban status. RESULTS Crude stroke mortality was higher in weekend admissions (p <0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, in-hospital mortality among hemorrhagic stroke patients was significantly greater (22.0%) for weekend admissions compared to weekday admissions (20.2%, p = 0.009). Among rural hospitals, the in-hospital mortality among hemorrhagic stroke patients was also greater among weekend admissions (36.9%) compared to weekday admissions (25.7%, p = 0.040). Among urban hospitals, the mortality of hemorrhagic stroke patients was 21.1% for weekend and 19.6% for weekday admissions (p = 0.026). No weekend effect was found among ischemic stroke patients admitted to rural or urban hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Our results help to understand mortality differences in hemorrhagic stroke for weekend vs. weekday admissions in urban and rural hospitals. Factors such as density of care providers, stroke centers, and patient level risky behaviors associated with the weekend effect on hemorrhagic stroke mortality need further investigation to improve stroke care services and reduce weekend effect on hemorrhagic stroke mortality.","output":"Weekend Effect on in-Hospital Mortality for Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke in US Rural and Urban Hospitals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organizations (WHO) 25X25 goal aims for a 25% relative reduction in premature death due to four non-communicable diseases (NCD4)cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetesby 2025 compared to 2010. This study aimed to quantify the premature mortality in the Australian population due to NCD4, quantify the variation in mortality rates by age and sex, predict the premature mortality due to NCD4 in 2025 and evaluate the progress towards the WHO 25X25 goal. METHODS: A population-based study using cause-specific mortality data of all deaths which occurred in Australia from 2010 to 2016 and registered up to 2017, for adults aged 30C69 years, was conducted. Age-specific and age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) and probability of death for NCD4 were calculated for each year. ASMRs in 2016 were calculated for men and women. Deaths and the probability of death in 2025 were predicted using Poisson regression based on data from 2006 to 2016. To assess the progress against the WHO 25X25 goal, the relative reduction in the probability of death from NCD4 conditions in 2025 compared to 2010 was calculated. RESULTS: ASMRs for NCD4 decreased from 2010 to 2016, except for diabetes which increased on average by 2.5% per year. Across sociodemographic factors, ASMRs were highest in males and increased with age. The projected probability of premature death in 2025 was 7.36%, equivalent to a relative reduction of 25.16% compared to 2010 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Premature mortality due to cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases and diabetes declined in Australia from 2010 to 2016. This trend is consistent across age groups and by sex, and higher mortality rates were observed in males and at older ages. Nationally, if the current trends continue, we estimate that Australia will achieve a 25.16% relative reduction in premature deaths due to NCD4 in 2025 compared to 2010, signifying substantial progress towards the WHO 25X25 goal.

Methods: Data for the first four months (March-June) of the pandemic and the equivalent period in 2019 were extracted from Kenya Health Information System. Two-sample test of proportions for hospital attendance for select RMNCAH services between the two periods were computed. Results: There were no differences in monthly mean ({+/-}SD) attendance between March-June 2019 vs 2020 for antenatal care (400,191.2{+/-}12,700.0 vs 384,697.3{+/-}20,838.6), hospital births (98,713.0{+/-}4,117.0 vs 99,634.5{+/-}3,215.5), family planning attendance (431,930.5{+/-}19,059.9 vs 448,168.3{+/-}31,559.8), post-abortion care (3,206.5{+/-}111.7 vs 448,168.3{+/-}31,559.8) and pentavalent 1 immunisation (114,701.0{+/-}3,701.1 vs 110,915.8{+/-}7,209.4), p>0.05. However, there were increasing trends for adolescent pregnancy rate, significant increases in FP utilization among young people (25.7% to 27.0%), injectable (short-term) FP method uptake (58.2% to 62.3%), caesarean section rate (14.6% to 15.8%), adolescent maternal deaths (6.2% to 10.9%) and fresh stillbirths (0.9% to 1.0%) with a reduction in implants (long-term) uptake (16.5% to 13.0%) (p<0.05).

The impact of this on emergency department (ED) attendances is unknown, especially for non-COVID-19 related emergencies. METHODS: This analysis is an observational study of ED attendances at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT). We calibrated auto-regressive integrated moving average time-series models of ED attendances using historic (2015C2019) data. Forecasted trends were compared to present year ICHNT data for the period between March 12, 2020 (when England implemented the first COVID-19 public health measure) and May 31, 2020. We compared ICHTN trends with publicly available regional and national data. Lastly, we compared hospital admissions made via the ED and in-hospital mortality at ICHNT during the present year to the historic 5-year average. RESULTS: ED attendances at ICHNT decreased by 35% during the period after the first lockdown was imposed on March 12, 2020 and before May 31, 2020, reflecting broader trends seen for ED attendances across all England regions, which fell by approximately 50% for the same time frame. For ICHNT, the decrease in attendances was mainly amongst those aged < 65 years and those arriving by their own means (e.g. personal or public transport) and not correlated with any of the spatial dependencies analysed such as increasing distance from postcode of residence to the hospital. Emergency admissions of patients without COVID-19 after March 12, 2020 fell by 48%; we did not observe a significant change to the crude mortality risk in patients without COVID-19 (RR 1.13, 95%CI 0.94C1.37, p = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings reflect broader trends seen across England and give an indication how emergency healthcare seeking has drastically changed. At ICHNT, we find that a larger proportion arrived by ambulance and that hospitalisation outcomes of patients without COVID-19 did not differ from previous years. The extent to which these findings relate to ED avoidance behaviours compared to having sought alternative emergency health services outside of hospital remains unknown.

There is an urgent need to increase teleophthalmology use in the US primary care clinics. In this study, we describe the development of a tailored teleophthalmology implementation program and report outcomes related to primary care provider (PCP) adoption. METHODS: We applied the 5 principles and 10 steps of the NIATx healthcare process improvement model to develop and test I-SITE (Implementation for Sustained Impact in Teleophthalmology) in a rural, the US multi-payer health system. This implementation program allows patients and clinical stakeholders to systematically tailor teleophthalmology implementation to their local context. We aligned I-SITE components and implementation strategies to an updated ERIC (Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change) framework. We compared teleophthalmology adoption between PCPs who did or did not participate in various components of I-SITE. We surveyed PCPs and clinical staff to identify the strategies they believed to have the highest impact on teleophthalmology use. RESULTS: To test I-SITE, we initiated a year-long series of 14 meetings with clinical stakeholders (n=22) and met quarterly with patient stakeholders (n=9) in 2017. Clinical and patient stakeholder groups had 90.9% and 88.9% participant retention at 1 year, respectively. The increase in teleophthalmology use was greater among PCPs participating in the I-SITE implementation team than among other PCPs (p < 0.006). The proportion of all PCPs who used the implementation strategy of electing diabetic eye screening for their annual performance-based financial incentive increased from 0% (n=0) at baseline to 56% (n=14) following I-SITE implementation (p = 0.004). PCPs and clinical staff reported the following implementation strategies as having the highest impact on teleophthalmology use: reminders to ask patients about diabetic eye screening during clinic visits, improving electronic health record (EHR) documentation, and patient outreach. CONCLUSIONS: We applied the NIATx Model to develop and test a teleophthalmology implementation program for tailored integration into primary care clinics.

The problem of unmeasured confounding in settings with multiple treatments is most common in statistical genetics and bioinformatics settings, where researchers have developed many successful statistical strategies without engaging deeply with the causal aspects of the problem. Recently there have been a number of attempts to bridge the gap between these statistical approaches and causal inference, but these attempts have either been shown to be flawed or have relied on fully parametric assumptions. In this paper, we propose two strategies for identifying and estimating causal effects of multiple treatments in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The auxiliary variables approach leverages variables that are not causally associated with the outcome; in the case of a univariate confounder, our method only requires one auxiliary variable, unlike existing instrumental variable methods that would require as many instruments as there are treatments. An alternative null treatments approach relies on the assumption that at least half of the confounded treatments have no causal effect on the outcome, but does not require a priori knowledge of which treatments are null. Our identification strategies do not impose parametric assumptions on the outcome model and do not rest on estimation of the confounder.

The objective of this retrospective analysis of a large hospital discharge database was to compare all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations during the first six months of the pandemic in the United States with the same months in the previous four years. METHODS: Data were collected from all hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database (PHD) and PHD Special Release reporting hospitalizations from January through July for each year from 2016 through 2020. Hospitalization trends were analyzed stratified by age group, major diagnostic categories (MDCs), and geographic region. RESULTS: The analysis included 286 hospitals from all 9 US Census divisions. The number of all-cause hospitalizations per month was relatively stable from 2016 through 2019 and then fell by 21% (57,281 fewer hospitalizations) between March and April 2020, particularly in hospitalizations for non-respiratory illnesses. From April onward there was a rise in the number of monthly hospitalizations per month.

There was also a decrease in hospitalizations per month for all age groups between March and April 2020 with the greatest decreases in hospitalizations observed for patients 50C64 and 65 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of hospitalization declined substantially during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting delayed routine, elective, and emergency care in the United States. These lapses in care for illnesses not related to COVID-19 may lead to increases in morbidity and mortality for other conditions.

Full-genome-sequence computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome will allow us to understand the recent evolutionary events and adaptability mechanisms more accurately, as there is still neither effective therapeutic nor prophylactic strategy. In this study, we used population genetics analysis to infer the mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, we localized targets of recent and strong positive selection. The genomic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely co-localized with regions in which recombination from non-human hosts appeared to have taken place in the past. Our results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, we find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts using a linkage disequilibrium analysis. In addition, we employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European, Asian and Northern American cohorts, and we demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","output":"Population genomics insights into the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), has been recently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

This review also describes the current understanding of the extrapulmonary complications caused by COVID\\\\19 to improve the management and prognosis of patients with COVID\\\\19.","output":"Extrapulmonary complications of COVID\\\\19: A multisystem disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drugs that reverse epigenetic silencing, such as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) 5-azacytidine (AZA), have profound effects on transcription and tumor cell survival. AZA is an approved drug for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, and is under investigation for different solid malignant tumors. AZA treatment generates self, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), transcribed from hypomethylated repetitive elements. Self dsRNA accumulation in DNMTi-treated cells leads to type I IFN production and IFN-stimulated gene expression. Here we report that cell death in response to AZA treatment occurs through the 2,5-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway. OASs are IFN-induced enzymes that synthesize the RNase L activator 2-5A in response to dsRNA. Cells deficient in RNase L or OAS1 to 3 are highly resistant to AZA, as are wild-type cells treated with a small-molecule inhibitor of RNase L. A small-molecule inhibitor of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNKs) also antagonizes RNase L-dependent cell death in response to AZA, consistent with a role for JNK in RNase L-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the rates of AZA-induced and RNase L-dependent cell death were increased by transfection of 2-5A, by deficiencies in ADAR1 (which edits and destabilizes dsRNA), PDE12 or AKAP7 (which degrade 2-5A), or by ionizing radiation (which induces IFN-dependent signaling). Finally, OAS1 expression correlates with AZA sensitivity in the NCI-60 set of tumor cell lines, suggesting that the level of OAS1 can be a biomarker for predicting AZA sensitivity of tumor cells. These studies may eventually lead to pharmacologic strategies for regulating the antitumor activity and toxicity of AZA and related drugs.","output":"OAS-RNase L innate immune pathway mediates the cytotoxicity of a DNA-demethylating drug"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores patterns of increased/ decreased physical activity, sedentary and sleep behaviours among Canadian children and youth aged 5-17 years during the COVID-19 pandemic, and examines how these changes are associated with the built environment near residential locations. A cluster analysis identified two groups who were primarily distinguished by the changes in outdoor activities. Compliance to 24-hour movement guidelines was low among both groups. For children, houses (versus apartments) was correlated with increased outdoor activities; proximity to major roads was a barrier. For youth, low dwelling density, and access to parks in high-density neighbourhoods, increased the odds of increased outdoor activities during the pandemic. Our findings can inform future urban and health crisis planning practices by providing new insights into the desirable public health messaging and characteristics of healthy and resilient communities.","output":"Healthy movement behaviours in children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic: Exploring the role of the neighbourhood environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There are few studies that compare the cadaver dissections with the medical simulators in means of talent improvement. Therefore, the aim of this study is to find out if using cadaver dissections is still the golden standard for surgical training or using the medical simulators in surgery could replace cadaver dissections. Material / Methods: The study is conducted during the European Orthopaedics & Traumatology Education Platform accredited Shoulder Club International Cadaver Course including a number of 34 orthopedics trainees. The participants were randomly divided into two groups to be trained with the simulator (Group 1) and on cadavers (Group 2), followed by a test performed on shoulder arthroscopy simulator (Virtamed ArthroSTM, Switzerland). There was no conflict of interest before, during, or after the study. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. RESULTS: Group 2 had statistically significant higher Simulation Overview Procedure Time values than Group 1 (p<0.05) (Table 3), the meaning of which is: Participants trained with the simulator completed the given tasks in a shorter period of time. Group 2 had statistically significant higher Scratching of Humerus Cartilage values than Group 1 (p<0.05) (Table 4), which means: Participants trained with simulation has less scratching done on the humerus cartilage than the participants trained on a cadaver. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to compare VR Simulators with cadavers for surgical education in an objective manner, while using qualitative and quantitative data. According to this study, it is possible to state that VR Simulators are just as effective as cadavers in means of training subjects. As medical education will face a total change all around the world after the COVID-19 pandemic, this study has the potential to be an important guide during and after this period.","output":"Cadaver versus Simulator Based Arthroscopic Training in Shoulder Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates better understanding of the kinetics of antibody production induced by infection with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to develop a high-throughput multiplex assay to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to assess immunity to the virus in the general population. METHODS: Spike protein subunits S1 and receptor binding domain, and nucleoprotein were coupled to microspheres. Sera collected before emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 224) and of non-SARS-CoV-2 influenza-like illness (n = 184), and laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 115) with various severities of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG concentrations. RESULTS: Our assay discriminated SARS-CoV-2-induced antibodies and those induced by other viruses. The assay specificity was 95.1%-99.0% with sensitivity 83.6%-95.7%. By merging the test results for all 3 antigens a specificity of 100% was achieved with a sensitivity of at least 90%. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed higher IgG concentrations and the rate of IgG production increased faster compared to nonhospitalized cases. CONCLUSIONS: The bead-based serological assay for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies proved to be robust and can be conducted in many laboratories. We demonstrated that testing of antibodies against multiple antigens increases sensitivity and specificity compared to single-antigen-specific IgG determination.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibody Detection for Seroepidemiology: A Multiplex Analysis Approach Accounting for Accurate Seroprevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutual aid groups have flourished during the Covid\\\\19 pandemic. However, a major challenge is sustaining such groups, which tend to decline following the initial upsurge immediately after emergencies.

Interviews were conducted with 11 volunteers in a mutual aid group organized by ACORN, a community union and anti\\\\poverty campaigning organization. Through qualitative analysis, we show that participation provided well\\\\being in different ways: positive emotional experiences, increased engagement in life, improved social relationships, and greater sense of control. Participants also reported some negative emotional experiences. While all interviewees experienced benefits from participation, those who viewed their participation through a political lens were able to experience additional benefits such as feelings of empowerment. Moreover, the benefits conferred by a shared political identity appeared to be qualitatively different from the benefits conferred by other forms of shared identity. The interview data is used to hypothesize an overall process by which participants may come to attain a political identity via mutual aid.

Since it may not be possible to provide information to all patients through telemedicine, additional methods are needed to reach all patients. This study aimed to determine the reliability and quality of YouTube videos that provide information on urological disorders during the COVID-19 period. Another aim was to assess the most shared and most viewed videos on urological disorders on YouTube and their usability as an additional resource in telemedicine during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: From 17 February 2020, to 31 July 2020, the following keywords were used to search videos on YouTube: covid urology, covid andrology, covid fertility, covid male infertility, covid prostate, covid bladder, covid kidney, covid renal, covid testis, covid cancer, covid coitus, covid sex, covid sperm and covid erectile;coronavirus was also used instead of covid. In total, 232 videos were evaluated by two urologists according to video characteristics. The number of total views, views per day, likes, dislikes, comments, video length, date of video upload and duration on YouTube was recorded. Finally, a total of 136 relevant English videos were included in the study. A 5-point modified DISCERN tool was used to assess reliability, whereas a 5-point Global Quality score (GQS) was used to evaluate quality. Cohens kappa score was used to determine inter-rater agreement, while the intraclass correlation coefficient was used to evaluate inter-observer reliability. Results: All videos had a high DISCERN score [4, interquartile range (IQR) (3-5)] and GQS [5, IQR (4-5)] in general. Moreover, 20 (14.7%) videos containing information about sexual life and effects of COVID-19 on sperm were described as debated. Videos uploaded by universities/ professional organisations/non-profit physician/physician groups had higher scores (p&lt;0.001). However, their rates of number of views per day (p=0.036) and likes (p&lt;0.001) were lower. The majority of videos related to urology (63.9%) included conversations about andrological disorders. The median number of total views and number of views per day were also highest for videos related to andrology. Conclusion: Although andrological disorders are classified as a non-essential issue and andrological consultations are postponed during the COVID-19 period, the results show that the rate of YouTube videos related to andrology is even higher than uro-oncological diseases during this period. Therefore, it is important to share accurate and reliable information in this field. Our analysis shows that informative, easy-to-understand YouTube videos uploaded by universities/professional organisations/non-profit physicians/physician groups can be used as an additional method to telemedicine, especially for andrological disorders that do not require follow-up.","output":"Can YouTube Video on Urological Problems Be Used As An Additional Resource in Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the major shortcoming of healthcare systems globally in their inability to diagnose the disease rapidly and accurately. At present, the molecular approaches for diagnosing COVID-19 primarily use reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to create and amplify cDNA from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Although molecular tests are reported to be specific, false negatives are quite common. Furthermore, literally all these tests require a step involving RNA isolation which does not make them point-of-care (POC) in the true sense. Here, we report a lateral flow strip-based RNA extraction and amplification-free nucleic acid test (NAT) for rapid diagnosis of positive COVID-19 cases at POC. The assay uses highly specific 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) and biotin labeled antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as probes those are designed to target N-gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we utilized cysteamine capped gold-nanoparticles (Cyst-AuNPs) to augment the signal further for enhanced sensitivity. Without any large-stationary equipment and highly trained staffers, the entire sample-to-answer approach in our case would take less than 30 min from a patient swab sample collection to final diagnostic result. Moreover, when evaluated with 60 clinical samples and verified with an FDA-approved TaqPath RT-PCR kit for COVID-19 diagnosis, the assay obtained almost 99.99% accuracy and specificity. We anticipate that the newly established low-cost amplification-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA will aid in the development of a platform technology for rapid and POC diagnosis of COVID-19 and other pathogens.","output":"A rapid RNA extraction-free lateral flow assay for molecular point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2 augmented by chemical probes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS To investigate the role of glycosylated hemoglobin in assisting the oral glucose tolerance test for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis in Asian populations.

Through the integration of the family embeddedness theory and social exchange theory, we further investigate the potential benefits and costs of family support as a social exchange process between entrepreneurs and their family members. We propose that perceived family support can differentially shape well-being across different entrepreneurial contexts (financial and workload stressors) depending on the nature of the exchange relationship (economic vs. social), thereby dual effects are anticipated from time-based and temporal processes. After analyzing the data gathered from 61 entrepreneurs over 14 days, we found evidence that high levels of family support attenuate the relationships between the financial stressor and the well-being indicators but amplify the relationships between the workload stressor and the well-being indicators. These results demonstrate family support process models are central to between-person heterogeneity.

Side-holes have been shown to increase flow rates and decrease recirculation but have been associated with clotting/increased infection rates. This study investigates the impact of changing the shape, size and number of side-holes on a simple symmetric tip catheter by evaluating the velocity, shear stress and shear rate of inflowing blood. A platelet model is used to examine the residence time and shear history of inflowing platelets. The results show that side-holes improve the theoretical performance of the catheters, reducing the maximum velocity and shear stress occurring at the tip compared to non-side-hole catheters. Increasing the side-hole area improved performance up to a point, past which not all inflow through the hole was captured, and instead a small fraction slowly 'washed-out' through the remainder of the tip resulting in greater residence times and increasing the likelihood of platelet adhesion. An oval shaped hole presents a lower chance of external fibrin formation compared to a circular hole, although this would also be influenced by the catheter material surface topology which is dependent on the manufacturing process. Overall, whilst side-holes may be associated with increased clotting and infection, this can be reduced when side-hole geometry is correctly implemented though; a sufficient area for body diameter (minimising residence time) and utilising angle-cut, oval shaped holes (reducing shear stress and chances of fibrin formation partially occluding holes).","output":"Impact of side-hole geometry on the performance of hemodialysis catheter tips: A computational fluid dynamics assessment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates loneliness, anxiety, and life satisfaction among a sample of young adults in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the role of fortitude in the interrelationship between these variables Fortitude refers to the psychological strength to manage stress and stay well, and it is derived from positive appraisals of self, family, and support from others Participants included 337 young adults who completed four self-report questionnaires: the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Scale, the Satisfaction with Life scale, and the Fortitude Questionnaire Stepwise regression analysis was performed to determine the direct, indirect, mediating, and moderating role of fortitude on psychological outcomes The results demonstrated unprecedented levels of anxiety, loneliness, and reduced life satisfaction among the sample These levels were significantly higher than those encountered in previous studies in other contexts, as well as in studies of similar populations conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic Women reported higher levels of psychological distress than men The results confirmed the mediating role of fortitude;however, they also suggested that the predictors (loneliness and anxiety) are the mediated pathways and fortitude is causally antecedent to loneliness and anxiety These findings suggest a looming mental health crisis among young adults in South Africa and identify potential targets for intervention efforts A strengths-based approach that focuses on enhancing individuals appraisals of coping and support may serve to build fortitude and potentially mitigate adverse mental health outcomes [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of South African Journal of Psychology is the property of Sage Publications, Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"A looming mental health pandemic in the time of COVID-19?

Within RiTe students are placed into collaborative enquiry-based learning (CEBL) groups to share tasks, but to also support and learn from one another. Methods An online survey was used to explore the year 2 student cohort task value and self-efficacy of this online version of RiTe. Results A 73% (32/44) response rate was achieved. Students found the online version of RiTe to be a positive learning and development experience. There was strong agreement that they not only found it relevant to their area of practice (task-value), but also strongly agreed that they understood and could master the skills taught (self-efficacy).

We aimed to determine the overall efficiency of tuberculosis spending and investigate associated factors in 121 low-income and middle-income countries between 2010 and 2019. METHODS: In this data envelopment and stochastic frontier analysis, we used data from the WHO Global TB report series on tuberculosis spending as the input and treatment coverage as the output to estimate tuberculosis spending efficiency. We investigated associations between 25 independent variables and overall efficiency. FINDINGS: We estimated global tuberculosis spending efficiency to be between 738% (95% CI 712C763) and 877% (849C906) in 2019, depending on the analytical method used. This estimate suggests that existing global tuberculosis treatment coverage could be increased by between 123% (95% CI 94C151) and 262% (237C288) for the same amount of spending. Efficiency has improved over the study period, mainly since 2015, but a substantial difference of 707C721 percentage points between the most and least efficient countries still exists. We found a consistent significant association between efficiency and current health expenditure as a share of gross domestic product, out-of-pocket spending on health, and some Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators such as universal health coverage. INTERPRETATION: To improve efficiency, treatment coverage will need to be increased, particularly in the least efficient contexts where this might require additional spending. However, progress towards global End TB targets is slow even in the most efficient countries. Variables associated with TB spending efficiency suggest efficiency is complimented by commitments to improving health-care access that is free at the point of use and wider progress towards the SDGs.

METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 1118 consecutive RARPs performed by one surgeon between July 2005 and July 2011. Cases that included concurrent hernia repair were compared with a group of patients matched 1:1 for age, body mass index, and year of surgery, who underwent RARP alone (controls). RESULTS A total of 91 patients underwent 113 concurrent inguinal hernia repairs during RARP. Twenty-two patients (24%) underwent bilateral repair. Of the 69 patients undergoing unilateral repair, 41 (45%) underwent left-sided repair, and 29 (31%) underwent right-sided repair. Thirty-five (38%) patients had previous inguinal hernia repair. Body mass index of cases and controls were 27.5  3.4 and 27.8  3.1 kg/m(2), respectively. Mean operative time in cases was 185  28 minutes vs 168  31 minutes in controls (P <.001). Estimated blood loss was 170  61 mL for cases vs 194  82 mL for controls (P = .03). No differences were observed in length of stay or prevalence of postoperative complications. There was 1 hernia recurrence, which necessitated repeat repair 1 year after surgery. No mesh infections or other complications related to hernia repairs were observed.

Four broad and interrelated categories to evaluate the Green Deal are proposed. Its performance depends on whether it is and will remain a policy priority, despite the COVID-19 emergency and the ensuing economic crisis. Second, successful implementation depends on adequate financial endowment, including the shift of public funding from hydrocarbons to renewables and energy efficiency in post-pandemic economic programmes. The legal competence of EU institutions to coordinate and enforce the implementation of the Green Deal is also essential, as highlighted by ongoing discussions concerning governance to achieve zero net emissions by 2050. Furthermore, international cooperation with third partners on issues such as border carbon adjustment, technology transfers, and green industry will influence both the implementation of the Green Deal in the EU and the contribution of other major emitters to the climate agenda. The impact of the European Green Deal on EU-Russia relations is also investigated. In this respect, it is argued that the Green Deal poses a serious challenge to the traditional pattern of EU-Russia energy trade, which has been dominated by fossil fuels.

International safety measures, local cultural norms and individual risk perception combine, generating unpredictable effects: the world appears to be a live social experiment that should be analyzed with an ongoing, interdisciplinary study. The wide corpus of this nearly forgotten discipline, in which our Lab is still fully involved, states the theoretical and methodological premises for such a research, which is at once a unique opportunity and a necessary precondition for future policies.

This can discourage some people from making a quit attempt and risks offsetting some, but not all, of the health advantages of quitting. Interventions to prevent weight gain could improve health outcomes, but there is a concern that they may undermine quitting. OBJECTIVES To systematically review the effects of: (1) interventions targeting post-cessation weight gain on weight change and smoking cessation (referred to as 'Part 1') and (2) interventions designed to aid smoking cessation that plausibly affect post-cessation weight gain (referred to as 'Part 2'). SEARCH METHODS Part 1 - We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register and CENTRAL; latest search 16 October 2020. Part 2 - We searched included studies in the following 'parent' Cochrane reviews: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants, nicotine receptor partial agonists, e-cigarettes, and exercise interventions for smoking cessation published in Issue 10, 2020 of the Cochrane Library. We updated register searches for the review of nicotine receptor partial agonists. SELECTION CRITERIA Part 1 - trials of interventions that targeted post-cessation weight gain and had measured weight at any follow-up point or smoking cessation, or both, six or more months after quit day. Part 2 - trials included in the selected parent Cochrane reviews reporting weight change at any time point. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Screening and data extraction followed standard Cochrane methods. Change in weight was expressed as difference in weight change from baseline to follow-up between trial arms and was reported only in people abstinent from smoking. Abstinence from smoking was expressed as a risk ratio (RR). Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using the inverse variance method for weight, and Mantel-Haenszel method for smoking. MAIN RESULTS Part 1: We include 37 completed studies; 21 are new to this update. We judged five studies to be at low risk of bias, 17 to be at unclear risk and the remainder at high risk. An intermittent very low calorie diet (VLCD) comprising full meal replacement provided free of charge and accompanied by intensive dietitian support significantly reduced weight gain at end of treatment compared with education on how to avoid weight gain (mean difference (MD) -3.70 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.82 to -2.58; 1 study, 121 participants), but there was no evidence of benefit at 12 months (MD -1.30 kg, 95% CI -3.49 to 0.89; 1 study, 62 participants). The VLCD increased the chances of abstinence at 12 months (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.73; 1 study, 287 participants). However, a second study found that no-one completed the VLCD intervention or achieved abstinence. Interventions aimed at increasing acceptance of weight gain reported mixed effects at end of treatment, 6 months and 12 months with confidence intervals including both increases and decreases in weight gain compared with no advice or health education. Due to high heterogeneity, we did not combine the data. These interventions increased quit rates at 6 months (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.96; 4 studies, 619 participants; I2 = 21%), but there was no evidence at 12 months (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.06; 2 studies, 496 participants; I2 = 26%). Some pharmacological interventions tested for limiting post-cessation weight gain (PCWG) reduced weight gain at the end of treatment (dexfenfluramine, phenylpropanolamine, naltrexone). The effects of ephedrine and caffeine combined, lorcaserin, and chromium were too imprecise to give useful estimates of treatment effects. There was very low-certainty evidence that personalized weight management support reduced weight gain at end of treatment (MD -1.11 kg, 95% CI -1.93 to -0.29; 3 studies, 121 participants; I2 = 0%), but no evidence in the longer-term 12 months (MD -0.44 kg, 95% CI -2.34 to 1.46; 4 studies, 530 participants; I2 = 41%). There was low to very low-certainty evidence that detailed weight management education without personalized assessment, planning and feedback did not reduce weight gain and may have reduced smoking cessation rates (12 months: MD -0.21 kg, 95% CI -2.28 to 1.86; 2 studies, 61 participants; I2 = 0%; RR for smoking cessation 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.90; 2 studies, 522 participants; I2 = 0%). Part 2: We include 83 completed studies, 27 of which are new to this update. There was low certainty that exercise interventions led to minimal or no weight reduction compared with standard care at end of treatment (MD -0.25 kg, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.29; 4 studies, 404 participants; I2 = 0%). However, weight was reduced at 12 months (MD -2.07 kg, 95% CI -3.78 to -0.36; 3 studies, 182 participants; I2 = 0%). Both bupropion and fluoxetine limited weight gain at end of treatment (bupropion MD -1.01 kg, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.67; 10 studies, 1098 participants; I2 = 3%); (fluoxetine MD -1.01 kg, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.53; 2 studies, 144 participants; I2 = 38%; low- and very low-certainty evidence, respectively). There was no evidence of benefit at 12 months for bupropion, but estimates were imprecise (bupropion MD -0.26 kg, 95% CI -1.31 to 0.78; 7 studies, 471 participants; I2 = 0%). No studies of fluoxetine provided data at 12 months. There was moderate-certainty that NRT reduced weight at end of treatment (MD -0.52 kg, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.05; 21 studies, 2784 participants; I2 = 81%) and moderate-certainty that the effect may be similar at 12 months (MD -0.37 kg, 95% CI -0.86 to 0.11; 17 studies, 1463 participants; I2 = 0%), although the estimates are too imprecise to assess long-term benefit. There was mixed evidence of the effect of varenicline on weight, with high-certainty evidence that weight change was very modestly lower at the end of treatment (MD -0.23 kg, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.06; 14 studies, 2566 participants; I2 = 32%); a low-certainty estimate gave an imprecise estimate of higher weight at 12 months (MD 1.05 kg, 95% CI -0.58 to 2.69; 3 studies, 237 participants; I2 = 0%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Overall, there is no intervention for which there is moderate certainty of a clinically useful effect on long-term weight gain. There is also no moderate- or high-certainty evidence that interventions designed to limit weight gain reduce the chances of people achieving abstinence from smoking.","output":"Interventions for preventing weight gain after smoking cessation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Use of adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) has become widespread, providing new insights into the immune system with potential broad clinical and diagnostic applications.

However, no studies have been conducted to investigate its anticancer potential, particularly its extracted oil. PURPOSE The present study was put forth to appraise the anticancer potential of Parrotiopsis jacquemontiana extracted oil against liver (hcclm3 and hepg2) and breast cancer (mda-mb 231 and mcf-7) cell lines relative to normal cell lines (lo2 and mcf-10a) via MTT assay. METHODS Flow cytometry indicated the apoptotic effect whereas invasion and migration capabilities of oil against cancer cells were determined by Matrigel invasion chamber and wound-scratch assays. RESULTS The results of oil revealed a time and dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation inhibition, conferring to least IC50 shown against hcclm3 (144.9  0.75 g/ml) and mda-mb 231 (145.7  0.32 g/ml) cell line at 72 h, whereas no cytotoxic effect on normal cells was observed. In addition, the oil significantly (p < 0.001) suppressed the migration and invasion of hcclm3 and mda-mb 231 cells, showing noteworthy anti-metastatic potential. Furthermore, cell death was confirmed by Annexin?V/PI staining where the maximum apoptotic percentage was calculated for oil (200 g/ml) alongside mda-mb 231 conferring to 15.36  1.22, 26.7  1.2, and 36.43  1.65 at 24, 48, and 72 h whereas 12.33  1.05, 19.36  1.62, and 29.3  0.79 was recorded alongside hcclm3 at similar time intervals, respectively. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the extracted oil exhibited strong anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, and apoptotic effects and therefore may have potential applications in cancer treatment, however, further studies of oil regarding the action mechanisms and compounds involved in anticancer therapy are necessary.","output":"In vitro anticancer activity of extracted oil from Parrotiopsis jacquemontiana (Decne) Rehder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are a group of host-adapted, commensal organisms that attach to the ileal epithelium of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. A genetic relative of the genus Clostridium, these morphologically unique bacteria display a replication and differentiation lifecycle initiated by epithelial tissue binding and filamentation. SFB intimately bind to the surface of absorptive intestinal epithelium without inducing an inflammatory response. Rather, their presence impacts the generation of innate and differentiation of acquired immunity, which impact the clearance of extracellular bacterial or fungal pathogens in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. SFB have recently garnered attention due to their role in promoting adaptive and innate immunity in mice and rats through the differentiation and maturation of Th17 cells in the intestinal tract and production of immunoglobulin A (IgA). SFB are the first commensal bacteria identified that impact the maturation and development of Th17 cells in mice. Recently, microbiome studies have revealed the presence of Candidatus Arthromitus (occasionally designated as Candidatus Savagella), a proposed candidate species of SFB, in higher proportions in higher-performing flocks as compared to matched lower-performing flocks, suggesting that SFB may serve to establish a healthy gut and protect commercial turkeys from pathogens resulting in morbidity and decreased performance. In this review we seek to describe the life cycle, host specificity, and genetic capabilities of SFB, such as bacterial metabolism, and how these factors influence the host immunity and microbiome. Although the role of SFB to induce antigen-specific Th17 cells in poultry is unknown, they may play an important role in modulating the immune response in the intestinal tract to promote resistance against some infectious diseases and promote food-safety.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the acceptancy of COVID-19 vaccine and their determinants among people in Saudi Arabia. Methods A web-based cross-sectional study was designed using snowball sampling strategies under a highly restricted environment. A bilingual self-administered anonymous questionnaire was designed and send to 1000 study participants through social media platforms and email. Study participants were recruited across the country, including the four major cities (Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Abha) in Saudi Arabia. Associations between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and sociodemographic profile of the respondents were explored using the chi-squared test. Key determinants in predicting vaccine acceptancy among respondents were modelled using logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 1000 survey invitees 992 responded to the survey. The majority of the study participants (29.53%) were in the age group (36 to 45 years) and 65.8% were female and 17.9% were Non-Saudi participants. Of the 992 respondents 642 said they are interested in taking the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available. Willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high among older age groups (79.2% among 45+ year old), married participants (69.3%), participants with education levels of a postgraduate degree or higher (68.8%), non-Saudi (69.1%), workings with government sector (68.9%). In multivariate model, respondents who were above 45 years (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.08-3.21), and married (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28-2.50) were significantly associated with vaccine acceptance (p < .05).

The vesicourethral anastomosis is a critical step, which most likely impacts urinary continence and urethral stenosis. To date, it still remains unclear whether interrupted and continuous suturing for the anastomosis have different outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare different suture techniques for vesicourethral anastomosis in terms of surgical and functional parameters. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A comprehensive literature search will be conducted covering MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies comparing interrupted versus continuous suturing will be included in the analyses. No language restrictions will be applied. Screening, data extraction, statistical analysis and reporting will be done in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Quality assessment will be performed with the help of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for assessing quality of non-randomised studies. The quality of evidence will be evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. The primary outcome will be the time until removal of the urinary catheter. Secondary outcomes include rate of extravasation, length of hospital stay, time needed to perform the anastomosis, continence level at defined postoperative intervals and development of urethral strictures. Quantitative analysis will be calculated if meaningful. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION In order to meet the highest ethical and methodological standards. we followed the PRISMA Protocol 2015 checklist.

As an illustration of this scenario, we have considered the specific situation of a railroad coach containing a seated passenger infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (and not wearing a face mask) who, by breathing and coughing, releases droplets and drops that contain the virus and that present aerodynamic diameters between 1 and 1,000 m. The air flow is generated by the ventilation in the rail coach. While essentially 3D, the flow is directed from the bottom to the top of the carriage and comprises large to small eddies visualised by means of streamlines. The space and time distribution of the droplets and drops is computed using both an Eulerian model and a Lagrangian model. The results of the two modelling approaches are fully consistent and clearly illustrate the different behaviours of the drops, which fall down close to the infected passenger, and the droplets, which are carried along with the air flow and invade a large portion of the rail coach. This outcome is physically sound and demonstrates the relevance of CFD for simulating the transport and dispersion of droplets and drops with any diameter in enclosed ventilated spaces. As coughing produces drops and breathing produces droplets, both modes of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in human secretions have been accounted for in our 3D numerical study. Following these initial results, physical and biological modelling will be extended to the mass transfer between the droplets and the ambient air and to the fate of the virus throughout its transport and dispersion in droplets or drops. Furthermore, a model will be developed to take into account the influence of a face mask on the production of droplets and drops. Beyond the specific, practical application of the rail coach, this study offers a much broader scope by demonstrating the feasibility and usefulness of 3D numerical simulations based on CFD. As a matter of fact, the same computational approach that has been implemented in our study can be applied to a huge variety of ventilated indoor environments such as restaurants, performance halls, classrooms and open-plan offices in order to evaluate if their occupation could be critical with respect to the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus or to other airborne respiratory infectious agents, thereby enabling relevant recommendations to be made.","output":"Modelling and 3D simulations of the dispersion of droplets and drops carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus inside semi-confined ventilated spaces C Application to a public railway transport coach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Xenotransplantation is an attractive alternative to allogeneic transplantation because of the intractable shortage of donor organs. The latest published developments in this area are discussed as well as recent publications regarding the continuing debates on the ethics of xenotransplantation and the safeguards that should be imposed to assure the minimization of risk to the patient and to human societies. RECENT FINDINGS Several laboratories are concentrating on the development of genetically manipulated donor pigs in order to bypass the immunological barriers against transplantation of porcine organs and cells into humans. Preliminary experiments with these new pig strains suggest that this strategy has a high likelihood of success with respect to hyperacute rejection. Ethical considerations have been extended to the establishment of regulatory, legal, and ethical frameworks that will be necessary to minimize the risk of xenotransplantation to the recipients, their families, and to the worldwide community. SUMMARY Xenotransplantation, because of the complexity of the medical, ethical and legal issues, will likely remain a controversial issue. If the scientific problems are solved, the decision to proceed with clinical application of this technique will depend on a collective decision guided by ethical, regulatory, and legal frameworks established by consensus.","output":"Xenotransplantation: an ethical dilemma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is a functional receptor for hepatitis B virus (HBV). NTCP-reconstituted human hepatoma cells support HBV infection, but the infection is suboptimal and no apparent HBV spread has been observed in this system. RESULTS: We found that NTCP-reconstituted HepG2 cells were highly susceptible to HBV infection after cells were cultured in a commercial human inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocyte maintenance medium (HMM). The enhanced HBV infection coincided with increased NTCP expression, and was observed in six different clones of HepG2-NTCP cells. Promoter assays indicated that HMM activated the cytomegalovirus immediate-early (IE) promoter that drives the NTCP expression in the HepG2-NTCP cells. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that HMM upregulated multiple metabolic pathways. Despite highly upregulated NTCP expression by HMM, no obvious HBV spread was observed even in the presence of PEG 8000. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that this particular medium could be used to enhance HBV infection in NTCP-reconstituted hepatocytes in vitro.

The International Monetary Fund predicts that the imminent economic recession will be worse than the global financial crisis of 2008, which severely affected the economy of Southern European countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain. There was then an abysmal drop in the Spanish yearly population growth curve as families could not afford to have children in that economic context; this only worsened the already existing demographic problems in that Spain has a constantly ageing population and one of the lowest fertility indicators in Europe. Taking into consideration that female age is the most important independent variable of success at the time of conception, probably thousands of potentially fertile couples were lost while waiting for more promising circumstances. With the COVID-19 pandemic a similar situation is being faced, where reproductive rights are imperiled by not being able to choose when to have children due to economic coercion. Therefore, governments worldwide should take measures to palliate the possible sociodemographic crisis that will follow the economic recession and try to ease the burden that many families might face during the following years.","output":"Infertility and reproductive rights after the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of Solitaire AB stent mechanical thrombectomy combined with thrombolysis and anticoagulant therapy (AT) in the treatment of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and its effect on neurological function and coagulation indices. METHODS Eighty-two patients with CVST were randomly divided into two groups according to the random number table method. The control group (n=41) were treated with arteriovenous thrombolysis combined with AT, and the observation group were treated with intravascular mechanical thrombectomy plus thrombolysis combined with AT. The effect of the treatment was evaluated 7 days after treatment, and a 6-month follow-up was conductedz after the course of treatment. The clinical efficacy, neurological function (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)), coagulation function, complications and prognosis were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The continuous improvement rate of clinical symptoms 7 days after treatment in the observation group (87.80%) was higher than that in the control group (58.54%) (P<0.01); The neurological function scores of both groups after treatment were lower than those before treatment (all P<0.001); The scores of NIHSS and mRS in the observation group were lower than those in the control group 7 days after treatment (all P<0.001). The coagulation indices of fibrinogen (FIB), prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 7 days after treatment in the observation group were shorter than those in the control group (all P<0.001), and the D-Dimer (D-D) level in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.001). The incidences of intracranial hemorrhage, infection, headache, quadriplegia, dizziness and drowsiness in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (all P<0.05). The recanalization rate of venous sinus in the observation group was higher than that in the control group 6 months after treatment (P<0.01). CONCLUSION Intravascular mechanical thrombectomy plus thrombolysis combined with AT for patients with CVST is effective, which can effectively improve the coagulation function and promote the recovery of neurological function, with fewer complications and a good prognosis.","output":"Efficacy of intravascular mechanical thrombectomy combined with thrombolysis and anticoagulant therapy in the treatment of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and its effect on neurological function and coagulation indices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The efficiency of concurrent chemotherapy (CC) remains controversial for stage IICIVa nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Therefore, we aimed to propose a nomogram to identify patients who would benefit from CC. METHODS: A total of 434 NPC patients (stage IICIVa) treated with IC followed by IMRT between January 2010 and December 2015 were included. There were 808 dosimetric parameters extracted by the in-house script for each patient. A dosimetric signature was developed with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. A nomogram was built by incorporating clinical factors and dosimetric signature using Cox regression to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS). The C-index was used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. The patients were stratified into low- and high-risk recurrence according to the optimal cutoff of risk score. RESULTS: The nomogram incorporating age, TNM stage, and dosimetric signature yielded a C-index of 0.719 (95% confidence interval, 0.658C0.78). In the low-risk group, CC was associated with a 9.4% increase of 5-year locoregional RFS and an 8.8% increase of 5-year overall survival (OS), whereas it was not significantly associated with an improvement of locoregional RFS (LRFS) and OS in the high-risk group. However, in the high-risk group, patients could benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) by improving 33.6% of the 5-year LRFS. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram performed an individualized risk quantification of RFS in patients with stage IICIVa NPC treated with IC followed by IMRT.

AIM: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of an Ayurveda intervention (Guduchighana Vati) in asymptomatic and mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an open-label randomized controlled pilot study with a sample size of 30 participants (15 in each arm). The participants were asymptomatic or mild to moderate cases of COVID-19. Guduchighana Vati 500 mg twice daily for 10 days was administered in the study group and Hydroxychloroquine for 5 days in the control group. Paracetamol, Vitamin C, Multivitamin, and Zinc were also provided in the control group. The main outcome measures were to negative real-time reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for COVID-19, proportion of participants with negative RT-PCR for COVID-19 at 5(th) and 10(th) day, proportion of participants with clinical recovery, improvement in laboratory parameters, and incidence of adverse drug reaction/adverse event (ADR/AE). The results of RT-PCR and clinical recovery were compared between groups using Chi-square test. The data related to laboratory parameters were compared within group using paired sample t-test/Wilcoxon signed-rank test and between groups using independent sample t-test/MannCWhitney test. RESULTS: The proportion of participants with negative RT-PCR for COVID-19 in the Guduchighana Vati group (93.3%) was better as compared to the control group (66.6%) till 10(th) day of the study period. Though, the results are statistically not significant (P = 0.068).

The research of the dynamics of population immunity formation is an important component of epidemiological surveillance, especially during the pandemic period. Identifying the features of the course of the epidemic process of a particular infection provides an opportunity to make the right decisions both in the fight against the disease and in its prevention. Aims. Evaluate the dynamics of the formation of collective immunity in the population of the city of Moscow. Materials & Methods. The presence of immunity in the population was assessed by immunochemiluminescent analysis of blood serum of patients for the presence of antibodies IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2. Results. During the analysis of the annual dynamics of IgM detection, a gradual decrease in this indicator was recorded. The dynamics of the combined detectability of IgM/IgG has a wave-like course. It should be noted that the curves of the dynamics of the IgM detectability and the combined IgM/IgG detectability reflect multidirectional trends: the summer rise in the IgM detectability coincides with the fall and the lowest values of the IgM/IgG detectability indicator. Afterwards, the decrease in the IgM detectability is accompanied by an increase in the combined IgM / IgG detectability. Detectability of IgG has a pronounced tendency to rise with short time intervals of decline. In the first three months of testing, a gradual decrease in detectability was recorded from 15.2 to 10.8%. However, since August, there has been a new increase in detectability of IgG to 45.5% in marth and subsequent stabilization in the range of 44.3C45.5%. Conclusions. The level of seroprevalence for the period of May 2021 is 44.3%.

Among survivors, kidney outcomes, seroconversion, and persistence of viral shedding are unexplored. METHODS Single-center prospective cohort study including data from kidney transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 between 03/20/2020 and 07/31/2020. Outcomes were adjudicated until 08/31/2020 or the date of death. RESULTS There were 491 patients with COVID-19 among the 11 875 recipients in follow-up. The majority was middle-aged with 1 or more comorbidities. Thirty-one percent were treated at home, 69% required hospitalization. Among the hospitalized, 61% needed intensive care, 75% presented allograft dysfunction and 46% needed dialysis. Overall 28-day fatality rate was 22% and, among hospitalized patients, 41%. Age (OR 3.08, 95%CI 1.86-5.09), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.69, 95%CI 1.06-2.72), and cardiac disease (OR 2.00, 95%CI 1.09-3.68) were independent factors for death. Among the 351 survivors, 19% sustained renal graft dysfunction, and there were 13 (4%) graft losses. Biopsy (n=20) findings were diverse but decisive to guide treatment and estimate prognosis. Seroconversion was observed in 79% of the survivors and was associated with disease severity. Persistence of viral shedding was observed in 21% of the patients without detectable clinical implications. CONCLUSIONS This prospective cohort analysis confirms the high 28-days fatality rate of COVID-19, associated primarily with age and comorbidities. The high incidence of allograft dysfunction was associated with a wide range of specific histologic lesions and high rates of sequelae and graft loss.

METHODS: Participants were PWH ages 18C63 who attended 1 HIV medical visit/year in 2018 and 2019. We estimated associations of sociodemographic characteristics with ME enrollment prevalence and associations between insurance status and engagement in care and VS. RESULTS: Among 577 patients, 151 (33%) were newly eligible for Medicaid, and 77 (51%) enrolled. Medicaid enrollment was higher for those with incomes <100% federal poverty level (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00C1.86) compared with others.

Understanding how experienced clinicians have practiced telemedicine can help guide todays exponential adoption of telemedicine. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore barriers and facilitators to providing effective, high-quality urgent care using telemedicine (tele-urgent care) from the perspective of clinicians experienced in telemedicine. APPROACH: We conducted semi-structured interviews between July 2018 and March 2019 of clinicians who had been providing tele-urgent care services to patients as a part of their routine clinical practice. Themes were identified using content analysis with a constant comparative coding approach. KEY RESULTS: Among the 20 clinicians interviewed, the majority were female (90%) and nurse practitioners (65%). We identified four themes related to barriers and facilitators to providing effective, high-quality tele-urgent care. Workplace factors such as a strong information technology (IT) infrastructure, real-time IT support, an electronic health record, and a collegial work environment, often virtual, were necessary standards. Communication and exam techniques from in-person encounters were adapted to tele-urgent care including active listening skills and teaching patients to conduct specific exam maneuvers virtually. The convenience of tele-urgent care should be preserved to support improvements in access to care. Finally, patients and clinicians occasionally had mismatched expectations about what could or would be provided during a tele-urgent care encounter. Managing the added tension that can occur during a telemedicine encounter was important. CONCLUSION: As telemedicine becomes an integral part of the care continuum, incorporating and accounting for these key insights when we train and support clinicians will be necessary to provide effective, high-quality care to patients in the future.","output":"Delivering Urgent Care Using Telemedicine: Insights from Experienced Clinicians at Academic Medical Centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19 struck when, despite plans to support the homeless population in Scotland, sustainable arrangements seemed beyond reach without a change of mindset by all providing support.

Violence data were based on the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of 56 countries that represented 63.1% of the world's ageing population aged 60 and over across all six of WHO regions. EXPOSURE: Structural ageism, following established structural stigma measures, consisted of two components: (1) discriminatory national policies related to older persons' economic, social, civil and political rights, based on the four core components of human rights protection in Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging and (2) prejudicial social norms against older persons, measured by negative attitudes toward older persons in 56 national polls in WVS aggregated to country-level. These components were z scored and combined such that higher score indicated greater structural ageism. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence rates of violence per 100 000 persons aged 70 and over in each country was based on extensive epidemiological surveillance data, survey, clinical data and insurance claims in GBD and compiled by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. RESULTS: There was a wide variation in levels of structural ageism across countries. As predicted, structural ageism was significantly associated with the prevalence rates of violence in multivariate models (?=205.7, SE=96.3, p=0.03), after adjusting for relevant covariates. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings.

The effective use of resources is a crucial issue in Chile's higher education reform. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been widely applied to measure efficiency in universities, sometimes focused on teaching or research. Universities function as a complex production process in which teaching and research are linked in the internal structure, share some inputs, and continue across multiple periods. To deal with this complexity, we developed a new DEA model that incorporates network structures, carryover activities, and shared inputs in a dynamic approach. We applied this model to a set of 33 Chilean universities and compared the results to their rankings and accreditation status.

The objectivity of the model allows us to evaluate overall efficiency in terms of the quantity and quality of teaching and research, removing exogenous criteria and judgments regarding the performance of higher education institutions.

It should also be well accepted by the population and have a simple logistic chain. To fulfill these criteria, we developed a thermostable, orally administered vaccine that can induce a robust mucosal neutralizing immune response. We used our platform based on retrovirus-derived enveloped virus-like particles (eVLPs) harnessed with variable surface proteins (VSPs) from the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia, affording them resistance to degradation and the triggering of robust mucosal cellular and antibody immune responses after oral administration. We made eVLPs expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), with or without membrane protein (M) expression. We found that prime-boost administration of VSP-decorated eVLPs expressing a pre-fusion stabilized form of S and M triggers robust mucosal responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters, which translate into complete protection from a viral challenge. Moreover, they dramatically boosted the IgA mucosal response of intramuscularly injected vaccines. We conclude that our thermostable orally administered eVLP vaccine could be a valuable addition to the current arsenal against SARS-CoV-2, in a stand-alone prime-boost vaccination strategy or as a boost for existing vaccines.","output":"A Thermostable Oral SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Induces Mucosal and Protective Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Patients with ESKD who are on chronic hemodialysis have a high burden of comorbidities that may place them at increased risk for adverse outcomes when hospitalized with COVID-19. However, data in this unique patient population are limited. The aim of our study is to describe the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes in patients on chronic hemodialysis who require hospitalization for COVID-19. Methods We performed a retrospective study of 114 patients on chronic hemodialysis who were hospitalized with COVID-19 at two major hospitals in the Bronx from March 9 to April 8, 2020 during the surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections in New York City. Patients were followed during their hospitalization through April 22, 2020. Comparisons in clinical characteristics and laboratory data were made between those who survived and those who experienced in-hospital death; short-term outcomes were reported. Results Median age was 64.5 years, 61% were men, and 89% were black or Hispanic. A total of 102 (90%) patients had hypertension, 76 (67%) had diabetes mellitus, 63 (55%) had cardiovascular disease, and 30% were nursing-home residents. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was required in 13% of patients, and 17% required mechanical ventilation. In-hospital death occurred in 28% of the cohort, 87% of those requiring ICU, and nearly 100% of those requiring mechanical ventilation. A large number of in-hospital cardiac arrests were observed. Initial procalcitonin, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and lymphocyte percentage were associated with in-hospital death. Conclusions Short-term mortality in patients on chronic hemodialysis who were hospitalized with COVID-19 was high. Outcomes in those requiring ICU and mechanical ventilation were poor, underscoring the importance of end-of-life discussions in patients with ESKD who are hospitalized with severe COVID-19 and the need for heightened awareness of acute cardiac events in the setting of COVID-19. Elevated inflammatory markers were associated with in-hospital death in patients with ESKD who were hospitalized with COVID-19.","output":"Chronic Hemodialysis Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19: Short-term Outcomes in the Bronx, New York."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of One Health/EcoHealth/Planetary Health approaches has been identified as key (i) to address the strong interconnections between risk for pandemics, climate change and biodiversity loss, and (ii) to develop and implement solutions to these interlinked crises.

Research needs cover the social-ecology of infectious disease agents, their evolution, the determinants of susceptibility of humans and animals to infections, and the human and ecological factors accelerating infectious disease emergence. For comprehensive investigation, they include the development of nature-based solutions to interlinked global planetary crises, addressing ethical and philosophical questions regarding the relationship of humans to nature and regarding transformative changes to safeguard the environment and human health. In support of this research, we propose the implementation of innovative multidisciplinary facilities embedded in social-ecosystems locally: the ecological health observatoriesand the living laboratories.

This paper studies digital literacy of in-service and pre-service teachers, families and pupils, in order to encourage the virtual participation of families in schools. To do so, a non-experimental ex-post facto survey design was used, using statistical analysis of variance (univariate ANOVA). The results suggest that teachers in training and in service demonstrate highest digital literacy levels in particular in informational competence on the Internet and computational competence on office software.

Furthermore, HSV infections at birth (herpes neonatorum) can result in a disseminated disease associated with a fatal multiorgan failure. Congenital HCMV infections can result in miscarriage, serious birth defects or developmental disabilities. Antibody-based interventions with hyperimmunoglobulins showed encouraging results in clinical studies, but clearly need to be improved. The isolation of highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies is a promising strategy to establish potent therapy options against HSV and HCMV infections. Monoclonal antibodies are commonly isolated from hybridomas or EBV-immortalized B-cell clones. The screening procedure to identify virus-specific cells from a cell mixture is a challenging step, since most of the highly neutralizing antibodies target complex conformational epitopes on the virus surface. Conventional assays such as ELISA are based on purified viral proteins and inappropriate to display complex epitopes. To overcome this obstacle, we have established two full-virus based methods that allow screening for cells and antibodies targeting complex conformational epitopes on viral surface antigens. The methods are suitable to detect surface antigen-specific cells from a cell mixture and may facilitate the isolation of highly neutralizing antibodies against HSV and HCMV.","output":"Detection of antibody-secreting cells specific for the cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus surface antigens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 1 diabetes is a common chronic illness in childhood.

Clarity around the clinical circumstances and patient populations that might be most appropriate for telehealth models was required. AIMS: To evaluate patient and physician satisfaction, acceptability and utility of outpatient palliative care provision through telehealth. METHODS: This is a multi-site prospective, cross-sectional, observational study conducted during a time of significant public health restrictions. A survey was used to collect matched patient- and physician-reported perceptions of palliative care telehealth consultations across three metropolitan hospitals in Victoria, Australia. RESULTS: There were 127 matched patient-physician data of telehealth consultations and a further 812 physician-only assessments. Telehealth was generally acceptable and satisfactory, with patients providing greater positive scores than clinicians. Telehealth incorporating both audio and video were more acceptable and satisfactory, particularly with the presence of a carer, and during routine reviews. Physicians were less satisfied using telehealth when there was increasing symptom complexity across all domains (pain, psychological, and other symptoms). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth has high utility in palliative care practice. A future hybrid model of care comprising both face-to-face and telehealth consultations seems favoured by patients and physicians but must be accompanied by targeted support for specific patient groups to ensure equitable healthcare access.

Results: Hierarchical regression analysis for the potential pandemic sources and infodemic sources of psychological anxiety showed that the infodemic factors of attention to the coronavirus information ( = 0.154, p < 0.001) and commercial media exposure ( = 0.147, p < 0.001) is positively related to the level of anxiety. Statistics indicated that influence of the infodemic factors is over and above that of the pandemic factors (R(2) = 0.054, F = 14.199, and p < 0.001). Mediation analysis showed that information overload (B = 0.155, Boot SE = 0.022, and 95% Boot CI [0.112, 0.198]) mediates the link between attention to coronavirus information and anxiety; both information overload (B = 0.035, Boot SE = 0.014, and 95% Boot CI [0.009, 0.062]) and media vicarious traumatization (B = 0.106, Boot SE = 0.017, and 95% Boot CI [0.072, 0.140]) mediate the link between commercial media exposure and anxiety. Conclusion: This study suggested that the influence of infodemic with mixed accurate and inaccurate information on public anxiety does exist, which could possibly go beyond that of the pandemic. Information overload and vicarious traumatization explain how infodemic may be associated to public anxiety. Finally, commercial media could be a major source of infodemic in the Chinese media context. Implications for the related parties were discussed.","output":"Infodemic vs. Pandemic Factors Associated to Public Anxiety in the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY ABSTRACT The COVID-19 infection that started in the Wuhan Province of the People&#039;s Republic of China and has now spread throughout the world is not limited to the respiratory system, but also causes other systemic symptoms through viremia Recent data show that the central and peripheral nervous system involvement is particularly substantial Thus, the present study aims to investigate the current neurological comorbidities and symptoms of patients with COVID-19 who were followed up by our clinic physicians RESUMO RESUMO A infec??o de COVID-19 que come?ou na provncia de Wuhan, na Repblica Popular da China, e j se espalhou por todo o mundo n?o se limita ao sistema respiratrio, mas tambm causa outros sintomas sistmicos atravs de viremia Dados recentes mostram que seus efeitos no sistema nervoso central e perifrico s?o particularmente significativos Assim, o presente estudo tem como objetivo investigar as atuais comorbidades e sintomas neurolgicos de pacientes com COVID-19 que foram acompanhados pelos mdicos da nossa clnica","output":"Demographic characteristics and neurological comorbidity of patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter explores technological ways in which we attempt to biohack ourselves to becoming cognitively and morally better.

The absence of mass testing and the relevant presence of asymptomatic individuals causes the available data of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil to be largely under-reported regarding the number of infected individuals and deaths. We develop an adapted Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, which explicitly incorporates the under-reporting and the response of the population to public health policies (confinement measures, widespread use of masks, etc). Large amounts of uncertainty could provide misleading predictions of the COVID-19 spread. In this paper, we discuss the role of uncertainty in these model-based predictions, which is illustrated regarding three key aspects: (i) Assuming that the number of infected individuals is under-reported, we demonstrate anticipation regarding the infection peak. Furthermore, while a model with a single class of infected individuals yields forecasts with increased peaks, a model that considers both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals suggests a decrease of the peak of symptomatic cases. (ii) Considering that the actual amount of deaths is larger than what is being registered, we demonstrate an increase of the mortality rates. (iii) When we consider generally under-reported data, we demonstrate how the transmission and recovery rate model parameters change qualitatively and quantitatively. We also investigate the the uncertainty tripod: under-reporting level in terms of cases, deaths, and the true mortality rate of the disease. We demonstrate that if two of these factors are known, the remainder can be inferred, as long as proportions are kept constant. The proposed approach allows one to determine the margins of uncertainty by assessments on the observed and true mortality rates.","output":"The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Uncertainty Tripod in Brazil: Assessments on model-based predictions with large under-reporting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the water C electricity consumption in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic across six socioeconomic sectors. Due to inadequate research on spatial modelling of water C electricity consumption in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study investigated geographical block-level variation in water and electricity consumption in Doha city of Qatar. Spatial analyses were performed to investigate the spatial differences in each sector. Five geospatial techniques in a Geographical Information System (GIS) context were used in the study. Morans I, Anselin Local Moran's I, and Getis-Ord [Formula: see text] statistics tools were used to identify the hot spots and cold spots of water and electricity consumption in each sector. Furthermore, Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models were employed to investigate the spatial relationship between water and electricity consumption during the pandemic year. The findings show that there is a distinction in water and electricity consumption at the block level across all sectors and over time. Hot spot and spatial regression analysis reveal spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the study area across the six socioeconomic sectors. The intensity of hot spots of water and electricity consumption are found in the southern and western parts of the city due to high population density and the concentration of the commercial and industrial areas. Furthermore, analyzing the spatiotemporal correlation between the water and electricity consumption across the six sectors shows variation within and between these sectors over space and time. The results show a positive relationship between water and electricity consumption in some blocks and over time of each sector. During the lockdown phase, strong positive correlation between water and electricity consumption have exist in the residential sector due to extra water and electricity footprints in this sector. Conversely, the water and electricity consumption were positively correlated but declined in the industrial and commercial sector due to the curtailment in production, economic activities, and reduction in peoples mobility. Mapping the hot spot blocks and the blocks with high relationship between water and electricity consumption could provide useful insight to decision-makers for targeted interventions.","output":"Spatiotemporal analysis of water-electricity consumption in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic across six socioeconomic sectors in Doha City, Qatar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 causes a wide range of symptoms in patients, ranging from mild manifestations to severe disease and death. This study assessed the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and associated factors of Covid-19 patients using primary data from confirmed cases in South Central Ethiopia. Methods: : We employed a facility-based, cross-sectional study design and conducted the study at the Bokoji Hospital Covid-19 treatment centre. A structured questionnaire and the EQ-5D-3L scale were used to collect the data for analysis. The HRQOL results measured by the EQ-5D-3L tool were converted to a health state utility (HSU) using the Zimbabwe tariff. The average health utility index and HSUCvisual analogue scale across diverse sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test. We employed a multiple linear regression to examine the associations of predictor variables with HSU values simultaneously. The data were analysed using STATA version 15. Results: : The overall mean HSU score from the EQ-5D was 0.688 (SD: 0.285), and the median was 0.787 (IQR: 0.596, 0.833). The mean HSU from the visual analogue scale score was 0.69 (SD: 0.129), with a median of 0.70 (IQR: 0.60, 0.80). Those who received dexamethasone and intranasal oxygen supplement, those with comorbidity, those older than 55 years and those with a hospital stay of more than 15 days had significantly lower HSU scores than their counterparts (p<.001). Conclusion: Covid-19 substantially impaired the HRQOL of patients in Ethiopia, especially among elderly patients and those with comorbidity. Therefore, clinical follow-up and psychological treatment should be encouraged for these groups. Moreover, the health utility values from this study can be used to evaluate quality adjusted life years for future cost-effectiveness analyses of prevention and treatment interventions against Covid-19.","output":"Evaluation of Health-Related Quality of Life of Covid-19 Patients: A Hospital-Based Study in South Central Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in healthcare systems responding to rapidly rising demand.

Emerging results indicate a dysregulated immune response characterized by runaway inflammation, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), as the major driver of pathology in severe COVID-19. With no treatments currently approved for COVID-19, therapeutics to prevent or treat the excessive inflammation in severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed.

Following compassionate care treatment with the CCR5 blocking antibody leronlimab, we observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy on macrophage and T cells, rapid reduction of plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and a significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. Consistent with reduction of plasma IL-6, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed declines in transcriptomic myeloid cell clusters expressing IL-6 and interferon-related genes.

We model various combinations of key variables to identify and compare a range of effective and practical surveillance strategies for schools and businesses. METHODS: We coupled a simulated data set incorporating actual community prevalence and test performance characteristics to a susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model, modeling the impact of base and tunable variables including test sensitivity, testing frequency, results lag, sample pooling, disease prevalence, externally-acquired infections, symptom checking, and test cost on outcomes including case reduction and false positives. FINDINGS: Increasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test) reduces the disease burden substantially. Pooling provided cost savings and made a high-frequency approach practical; one high-performing strategy, testing every 3 days, yielded per person per day costs as low as $1.32. INTERPRETATION: A range of practically viable testing strategies emerged for schools and businesses. Key characteristics of these strategies include high frequency testing with a moderate or high sensitivity test and minimal results delay. Sample pooling allowed for operational efficiency and cost savings with minimal loss of model performance.","output":"Identifying optimal COVID-19 testing strategies for schools and businesses: Balancing testing frequency, individual test technology, and cost"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease in 2019, also called COVID-19 which has spread worldwide has given rise to a pandemic situation The aetiological agent is the (SARS-CoV-2) the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 The COVID-19 pandemic has an unusual way of striking the entire world Crises has spread rapidly Disease load and casualties are still on the rise, and crisis influence is spreading across developing countries Around the globe, the reactions, perceptions, and outcomes were distinct The outbreak has reflected unfavourable mental health impacts and symptoms This pandemic has also affected the healthcare department that is treating the patients suffering from diseases other than corona The power and severity of slowdown varying from being temporary to a long-term recession, they are unanimous about the fact that the slowdown would have an intense impact amongst various sectors of the economy Most importantly, some panic among consumers and firms has disfigured normal patterns of consumption and caused market inconsistency Digitalization and automation have proved to be the solution in this challenging phase Telemedicine and Tele physiotherapy for online consultancy have changed the time in a positive way Conducting live sessions reduces the psychological risks to the patients and also is beneficial for the motivation of the therapy Tele-rehabilitation increases the level of treatment for people with disorders in both physical and mental wellbeing, lowers hospital expenses, and strengthens conventional face-to-face practice This article would give the overall idea of how the social, economic, cultural, and psychological aspects are influenced by the pandemic","output":"Great Awakening - Telerehabilitation in Physiotherapy during Pandemic and Impact of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2009 H(1)N(1) influenza pandemic was a major challenge to health services around the world.

However, the majority of studies were conducted at large scales (e.g., across farms), while few studies examined drivers of L. monocytogenes prevalence at smaller scales (e.g., within a single field). This study was performed to address this knowledge gap by (i) tracking L. monocytogenes distribution in two fields on one farm over a growing season, and (ii) identifying factors associated with L. monocytogenes isolation from drag swab, soil, and agricultural water samples. Overall, L. monocytogenes was detected in 78% (21/27), 19% (7/36), and 8% (37/486) of water, drag swab, and soil samples, respectively. All isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Of the 43 PFGE types identified, 14 were isolated on multiple sampling visits and/or from multiple sample types, indicating persistence in or repeated introduction into the farm environment during the study. Our findings also suggest that L. monocytogenes prevalence, even at the small spatial scale studied here, (i) was not uniform, and (ii) varied more within fields than between fields or over time. This is illustrated by the fact that plot (in-field variation), field (between field variation), and sampling visit (time) accounted for 18%, 2% and 3% of variance in odds of isolating L. monocytogenes, respectively. Moreover, according to random forest analysis, water-related factors were among the top-ranked factors associated with L. monocytogenes isolation from all sample types. For example, the likelihood of isolating L. monocytogenes from drag and soil samples increased monotonically as rainfall increased. Overall, findings from this single-farm study suggests that mitigation strategies for L. monocytogenes in produce fields should focus on water-associated risk factors (e.g., rain, distance to water), and be tailored to specific high-risk in-field areas.","output":"Listeria monocytogenes prevalence varies more within fields than between fields or over time on conventionally farmed New York produce fields"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, whether COVID-19 patients with high risks can be recovered or not depends, to a large extent, on how early they will be treated appropriately before irreversible consequences are caused to the patients by the virus.

We perform a series of stochastic simulations to discover the impact of self-preservation strategies in pattern formation, calculating the species' spatial autocorrelation functions. Considering organisms with different physical and cognitive abilities, we compute the benefits of each movement tactic to reduce selection and infection risks. Our findings show that the maximum profit in terms of territorial dominance in the cyclic game is achieved if both survival movement strategies are combined, with individuals prioritising social distancing. In the case of an epidemic causing symptomatic illness, the drop in infection risk when organisms identify and avoid disease vectors does not render a rise in the species population because many refuges are disregarded, limiting the benefits of safeguarding against natural enemies.

FINDINGSA total of 9979 individuals (4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period and presented overall with a higher symptom burden of depression (prevalence ratio [PR] 1{middle dot}18, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1{middle dot}03-1{middle dot}36) and poorer sleep quality (1{middle dot}13, 1{middle dot}03-1{middle dot}24) but not with higher levels of symptoms of anxiety or COVID-19 related distress compared with individuals without a COVID-19 diagnosis. While the prevalence of depression and COVID-19 related distress attenuated with time, the trajectories varied significantly by COVID-19 acute infection severity. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 but never bedridden due to their illness were consistently at lower risks of depression and anxiety (PR 0{middle dot}83, 95% CI 0{middle dot}75-0{middle dot}91 and 0{middle dot}77, 0{middle dot}63-0{middle dot}94, respectively), while patients bedridden for more than 7 days were persistently at higher risks of symptoms of depression and anxiety (PR 1{middle dot}61, 95% CI 1{middle dot}27-2{middle dot}05 and 1{middle dot}43, 1{middle dot}26-1{middle dot}63, respectively) throughout the 16-month study period.

This is problematic as non-professional investors may rely on this information when making investment decisions. In this study, we use an experiment to examine how non-professional investors react to human rights information presented in varying formats (i.e., numerical, graphs, qualitative) compared to no reporting. Consistent with our expectations, we find that when information is positive, participants do not react to qualitative information. However, they react positively to numerical and graphical information and seem to use a less critical mindset when processing this type of information, which is associated in the literature with an aura of accuracy, objectivity, and neutrality. This is problematic because, similar to what is often the case in reality, participants had no certainty about the accuracy of the information. Further, when information is less positive, participants do not react to numerical or graphical information, but they do react negatively to qualitative information, which is more vague and may be perceived as companies trying to obfuscate less positive performance.

We found that such complex mRNA delivery systems can be avoided when transfecting epithelial cells by aerosolizing the mRNA into micron-sized droplets. In an equine in vivo model, we demonstrated that the translation of mRNA into a functional protein did not depend on the addition of a polyethylenimine (PEI)-derived transfection agent. We were able to safely and effectively transfect the bronchial epithelium of foals using naked mRNA (i.e., mRNA formulated in a sodium citrate buffer without a delivery vehicle). Endoscopic examination of the bronchial tree and histology of mucosal biopsies indicated no gross or microscopic adverse effects of the transfection.

Pre-existing geriatric conditions such as comorbidity and frailty seem related to worse hospital outcomes. AIMS: To assess the role of nutritional status as an independent prognostic factor for in-hospital death in elderly patients. METHODS: Consecutive elderly patients (age > 65 years) hospitalized for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were enrolled. Demographics, laboratory and comorbidity data were collected. Nutritional status was evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). Uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses to evaluate predictors for in-hospital death were performed. RESULTS: One hundred and nine hospitalized elderly patients (54 male) were consecutively enrolled. At univariate analysis, age (HR 1.045 [CI 1.008C1.082]), cognitive impairment (HR 1.949 [CI 1.045C3.364]), C-reactive protein (HR 1.004 [CI 1.011C1.078]), lactate dehydrogenases (HR 1.003 [CI 1.001C1.004]) and GNRI moderateCsevere risk category (HR 8.571 [CI 1.096C67.031]) were risk factors for in-hospital death, while albumin (HR 0.809 [CI 0.822C0.964]), PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (HR 0.996 [CI 0.993C0.999]) and body mass index (HR 0.875 [CI 0.782C0.979]) were protective factors.

The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has so far claimed more than 60,000 lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 displays high transmission rates, their underlying genomic severity is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of the spread of the virus. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighboring countries suggesting that the outbreak is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nsp13-16 (ORF1b polyprotein) and S-Protein within 10 viral isolates from the USA. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication, indicating highly evolved viral strains circulating in the population of USA than other countries. Furthermore, we found an amino acid addition in nsp16 (mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase) of the USA isolate (MT188341) leading to shift in amino acid frame from position 2540 onwards. Through the construction of SARS-CoV-2-human interactome, we further revealed that multiple host proteins (PHB, PPP1CA, TGF-, SOCS3, STAT3, JAK1/2, SMAD3, BCL2, CAV1 & SPECC1) are manipulated by the viral proteins (nsp2, PL-PRO, N-protein, ORF7a, M-S-ORF3a complex, nsp7-nsp8-nsp9-RdRp complex) for mediating host immune evasion.

One-hundred-seventy-nine patients had been in contact with other COVID-19 patients at home or in hospital, of whom 89 had tested RT-PCR-positive (COVID-pos) for the virus and 90 had tested RT-PCR-negative (COVID-neg). Treatments within 15 days prior to RT-PCR (including antihypertensive drugs, antipsychotics, antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), oral antidiabetics (OADs), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants), comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical outcome were all collected. COVID-pos patients more frequently had a history of diabetes (P = .016) and alcoholism (P = .023), a lower leukocyte count (P = .014) and a higher mortality rate  29.2% versus 14.4%  (P = .014) when compared to COVID-neg patients. Patients on PPIs were 2.3 times less likely (odds ratio [OR] = 0.4381, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.2331, 0.8175], P = .0053) to develop COVID-19 infection, compared to those not on PPIs.

Data on the relationship between public health restrictions, mobility, and pandemic growth has so far been conflicting. Objective : We assessed the relationship between public health restriction tiers, mobility, and COVID-19 spread in five contiguous public health units (PHUs) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in Ontario, Canada. Methods : Weekly effective reproduction number (R (t) ) was calculated based on daily cases in each of the five GTA public health units between March 1, 2020, and March 19, 2021. A global mobility index (GMI) for each PHU was calculated using Google Mobility data. Segmented regressions were used to assess changes in the behaviour of R (t) over time. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between GMI and R (t) for each PHU and mobility regression coefficients for each mobility variable, accounting for time lag of 0, 7, and 14 days. Results : In all PHUs except Toronto, the most rapid decline in R (t) occurred in the first two weeks of the first province-wide lockdown, and this was followed by a slight trend to increased R (t) as restrictions decreased. This trend reversed in all PHUs between September 6 (th) and October 10 (th) after which R (t) decreased slightly over time without respect to public health restriction tier. GMI began to increase in the first wave even before restrictions were decreased. This secular trend to increased mobility continued into the summer, driven by increased mobility to recreational spaces. The decline in GMI as restrictions were reintroduced coincides with decreasing mobility to parks after September. During the first wave, the correlation coefficients between global mobility and R (t) were significant (p&lt;0.01) in all PHUs 14 days after lockdown, indicating moderate to high correlation between decreased mobility and decreased viral reproduction rates, and reflecting that the incubation period brings in a time-lag effect of human mobility on R (t) . In the second wave, this relationship was attenuated, and was only significant in Toronto and Durham at 14 days after lockdown. Conclusions : The association between mobility and COVID-19 spread was stronger in the first wave than the second wave. Public health restriction tiers did not alter the existing secular trend toward decreasing R (t) over time.","output":"Quantifying The Relationship Between Lockdowns, Mobility, and Effective Reproduction Number (Rt) During The COVID-19 Pandemic in The Greater Toronto Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Time spent in different Physical Activity (PA) Intensities of 72 Mozambican older adult women (67  7 years old) was assessed by means of triaxial accelerometers for 7 consecutive days, and participants were stratified based on their body mass index, as being normal weight (NW, n = 23); overweight (n = 16); or obese (OB, n = 33).

One complexity that warrants consideration is the male-specific impacts of the pandemic within adolescence. METHODS A review of the relevant literature. RESULTS Matters of social distancing, virtual education, and substance use may impact adolescent men in fashions that raise their suicide risk more significantly relative to adolescent women. Social distancing may impact adolescents' friendships and generate a regression back to the nuclear family; qualities of male adolescents' friendships and of masculinity suggest that these impacts may be more severe in adolescent men and may directly raise suicide risk. Virtual schooling yields educational and social setbacks; losses of team sports, male mentors, and the implications of diminished educational advancement may more adversely affect adolescent men and raise risk. Substance use has increased in the pandemic, particularly among adolescent men. There are direct associations with suicide risk as well as indirectly through increased parental conflict and punishment. CONCLUSION As adolescent men die by suicide at significantly elevated rates relative to adolescent women, a male-specific consideration of these impacts is indicated to address adolescent suicide in our current era. Recommendations are made for integrating these considerations into updated adolescent suicide risk assessment and prevention efforts.","output":"The Men's Mental Health Perspective on Adolescent Suicide in the COVID-19 Era."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To design and evaluate 3D\\\\printed nasal swabs for collection of samples for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 testing.

The study cohort was drawn from a prospective longitudinal survey of CARV in allo-HCT recipient having respiratory symptoms conducted from December 2013 to December 2018 at two Spanish transplant centers. Respiratory viruses in upper and/or lower respiratory specimens were tested using multiplex PCR panel assays.

Overall, 60% of CARV episodes occurred within the first 6 months (227 out of 376). Thirty patients (13%) had died at 3 months after CARV detection, of which 25 (83%) were recipients developing CARV within the first 6 months after transplant. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors for mortality: ATG used as part of conditioning regimen [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (C.I.) 1.21C6.4, p = 0.01], CARV lower respiratory tract disease (OR 3.4, 95% C.I. 1.4C8.4, p = 0.007), CARV infection within the first 6 months of transplant (OR 3.04, 95% C.I. 1.1C8.7, p = 0.03), and absolute lymphocyte count <0.2  109/L (OR 2.4, 95% C.I. 1C5.3, p = 0.04).

Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into young control (YC), aged control (AC), and COR (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) treated aged rat groups. Aging-associated serum biochemical changes and inflammatory parameters were analyzed by biochemical assay kits, Western blotting, and real-time RT-PCR. Results showed a significant (p < 0.05) alteration in the total blood cell count, lipid metabolism, and liver functional parameters in AC group when compared with YC group. However, COR-treated aged rats ameliorated the altered biochemical parameters significantly (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 at 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, respectively). Furthermore, the increase in the expression of inflammatory mediators (COX-2, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, and tissue necrosis factor-alpha) in aged rat testis was significant (p < 0.05) when compared with YC group. Treatment with COR at 20 mg/kg to aged rats attenuated the increased expression of inflammatory mediators significantly (p < 0.05).

Results indicate that preschool teachers' behavioral intention was moderate to high level. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are direct significant predictors of preschool teachers' behavioral intention. Perceived usefulness is affected by perceived ease of use and job relevance. Computer self-efficacy and perceptions of external control are the positive factors toward perceived ease of use.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden during the first COVID-19 pandemic across the highly diverse neighborhoods of NYC. METHODS: The incidences of OHSD between March 20 and April 22, 2019, and between March 20 and April 22, 2020, as reported by the Fire Department of New York were obtained. As a surrogate for viral epidemiologic burden, we used percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests performed between March 3 and August 20, 2020. Data were reported separately for the 176 zip codes of NYC. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed between the 2 measures to examine association. RESULTS: Incidence of OHSD per 10,000 inhabitants and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion were highly variable across NYC neighborhoods, varying from 0.0 to 22.9 and 12.4% to 50.9%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between neighborhood data on OHSD and percentage of positive antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman &#961; 0.506; P <.001). Regression analysis showed that seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and OHSD in 2019 were independent predictors for OHSD during the first epidemic surge in NYC (R2 = 0.645).

Materials and Methods: We developed an informatics algorithm that trains two deep learning models over patient EHRs using the MIMIC-III database. We utilize both the structured and unstructured parts of the EHR and show that it is possible to predict both of these challenging outcomes. Results: Our deep learning models incorporate both structured and unstructured data elements from the EHRs to predict opioid prescription with an F1-score of 0.88 +/- 0.003 and an AUC-ROC of 0.93 +/- 0.002. We also constructed a model to predict OUD diagnosis achieving an F1-score of 0.82 +/- 0.05 and AUC-ROC of 0.94 +/- 0.008. Discussion: Our model for OUD prediction outperformed prior algorithms for specificity, F1 score and AUC-ROC while achieving equivalent sensitivity. This demonstrates the importance of a.) deep learning approaches in predicting OUD and b.) incorporating both structured and unstructured data for this prediction task. No prediction models for opioid prescription as an outcome were found in the literature and therefore this represents an important contribution of our work as opioid prescriptions are more common than OUDs.

The translation of this widely used scientific technique toward clinical application has been hindered by insufficient ADME properties of antisense and siRNA oligonucleotides. Despite reasonable therapeutic response after local administration, reaching adequate concentrations at the site of action after systemic application is still a major hurdle and this has resulted in poor efficiency in preclinical and clinical situations. AREAS COVERED This review focuses on the influence on the ADME parameters of chemical modifications already tested in clinical trials, such as phosphorothioates (PSs), 2'-modified agents, including locked nucleic acids (LNA) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO). The dominating PS backbone modification, while conferring adequate nuclease resistance and improving biodistribution, has been shown to be involved in unspecific protein binding and off-target effects on apoptosis pathways. PS-free antisense agents such as PMO generally show poorer pharmacokinetic characteristics. EXPERT OPINION In terms of pharmacokinetics and cell membrane permeation, there is currently no efficient alternative to PS, although doubts about long-term toxicity of this class still remain.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Methods: Genome-wide screening was used to establish intraviral and viral-host interactomes. Quantitative proteomics was used to investigate the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteome signature in COVID-19. Findings: We elucidated 286 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and >350 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19-derived PBMCs. This signature in severe COVID-19 PBMCs reveals a significant upregulation of cellular proteins related to neutrophil activation and blood coagulation, as well as a downregulation of proteins mediating T cell receptor signaling. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein 10 interacts with NF-&#954;B-repressing factor (NKRF) to facilitate interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction, which potentially contributes to IL-8-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and the overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Our study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks but it also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms, representing a powerful resource in the pursuit of therapeutic interventions.

However, such studies do not reveal which factors make one country more exposed to COVID-19 than other. Based on the composite indicators approach, this research identifies the factors that most impact the number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 worldwide and measures countries exposure to COVID-19. Three composite indicators of exposure to COVID-19 were constructed through Principal Component Analysis, Simple Additive Weighting, and k-means clustering. The number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 is strongly correlated (R > 0.60) with composite indicator scores and moderately concordant (K > 0.4) with country clusters. Factors directly or indirectly associated with the age of the population are the ones that most expose countries to COVID-19. The population of countries most exposed to COVID-19 is 12 years older on average. The proportion of the elderly population in these countries is at least twice that of countries less exposed to COVID-19. Factors that can increase the populations life expectancy, such as Gross Domestic Product per capita and the Human Development Index, are four times and 1.3 times higher in more exposed countries to COVID-19. Providing better living conditions increases both the populations life expectancy and the countrys exposure to COVID-19.","output":"Factors that most expose countries to COVID-19: a composite indicators-based approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim. To carry out a comparative analysis of the impact of optimal and suboptimal therapy for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) at the prehospital stage on the severity and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Material and methods. The study included 158 patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and having one or more concomitant NCDs. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the quality of initial therapy for NCDs: group 1  patients receiving treatment that does not meet modern clinical guidelines, taking drugs not regularly or not taking them at all (n=100;63%), and group 2  patients receiving treatment in accordance with current clinical guidelines, taking regularly prescribed therapy (n=58;37%). The primary endpoint was inhospital death, while secondary endpoints  duration of fever, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay. Results. Inhospital mortality was significantly higher in the 1st group of patients compared with the 2nd group (18,0% vs 1,7%, p=0,002). Analysis of secondary endpoints revealed that patients of the 1st group (nonoptimal therapy), in comparison with the 2nd group (optimal therapy), had significantly longer period of fever (10 [7;12] vs 9 [7;10] days, p=0,03), longer ICU (0 [0;3] vs 0 [0;0] days, p<0,001) and hospital stay (10 [8;14] vs 8 [7;11] days, p=0,001). Conclusion. Patients who received standard NCD therapy before admission to the infectious disease hospital, in accordance with current clinical guidelines and who regularly take drugs, have a more favorable course of COVID-19 at the hospital stage and a lower inhospital mortality rate than patients with suboptimal therapy who are not adherent to treatment or not receiving drugs, but having indications for taking them.","output":"Impact of optimal therapy for noncommunicable diseases on the course and outcome of COVID-19 inpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a pressing need for evidence-based interventions to address the devastating clinical and public health effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The number of registered trials related to COVID-19 is increasing by the day. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of the currently registered interventional clinical trials related to COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on May 15th, 2020. We included any entry that is related to COVID-19. We abstracted and then descriptively analyzed the following characteristics of the registered trials: study design, status, phase, primary endpoints, experimental interventions, and geographic location among other qualifiers. RESULTS: We identified 1,308 eligible registered trials. Most trials were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (n = 703; 53.7%) and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (n = 291; 22.2%). The number of participants to be enrolled across these trials was 734,657, with a median of 110 participants per trial. The most commonly studied intervention category was pharmacologic (n = 763; 58.3%), with antiparasitic medications being the most common subcategory. Although over half of the trials were already recruiting, we identified published peer-reviewed results for only 8 of those trials. CONCLUSION: There is a relatively large number of registered trials but with very few results published so far. Although our findings suggest an appropriate initial response by the research community, the real challenge will be to get these trials completed, published, and translated into practice and policy.","output":"A large number of COVID-19 interventional clinical trials were registered soon after the pandemic onset: a descriptive analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Propofol is a safe and widely used intravenous anesthetic agent, for which additional clinical uses including treatment of migraine, nausea, pain and anxiety have been proposed (Vasileiou et al. Eur J Pharmacol 605:1-8, 2009). However, propofol suffers from several disadvantages as a therapeutic outside anesthesia including its limited aqueous solubility and negligible oral bioavailability. The purpose of the studies described here was to evaluate, in both animals and human volunteers, whether fospropofol (a water soluble phosphate ester prodrug of propofol) would provide higher propofol bioavailability through non-intravenous routes. METHODS Fospropofol was administered via intravenous, oral and intraduodenal routes to rats. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were then evaluated. Based on the promising animal data we subsequently conducted an oral and intraduodenal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study in human volunteers. RESULTS In rats, bioavailability of propofol from fospropofol delivered orally was found to be appreciable, in the order of around 20-70%, depending on dose. Availability was especially marked following fospropofol administration via the intraduodenal route, where bioavailability approximated 100%. Fospropofol itself was not appreciably bioavailable when administered by any route except for intravenous. Pharmacologic effect following oral fospropofol was confirmed by observation of sedation and alleviation of thermal hyperalgesia in the rat chronic constrictive injury model of neuropathic pain. The human data also showed systemic availability of propofol from fospropofol administration via oral routes, a hereto novel finding. Assessment of sedation in human volunteers was correlated with pharmacokinetic measurements. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest potential utility of oral administration of fospropofol for various therapeutic indications previously considered for propofol.","output":"Gastrointestinal delivery of propofol from fospropofol: its bioavailability and activity in rodents and human volunteers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many of the policies that were put into place during the Covid-19 pandemic had a common goal: to flatten the curve of the number of infected people so that its peak remains under a critical threshold This letter considers the challenge of engineering a strategy that enforces such a goal using control theory We introduce a simple formulation of the optimal flattening problem, and provide a closed form solution This is augmented through nonlinear closed loop tracking of the nominal solution, with the aim of ensuring close-to-optimal performance under uncertain conditions A key contribution of this letter is to provide validation of the method with extensive and realistic simulations in a Covid-19 scenario, with particular focus on the case of Codogno - a small city in Northern Italy that has been among the most harshly hit by the pandemic","output":"Covid-19 and Flattening the Curve: A Feedback Control Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research has shown that sleep is beneficial for the long-term retention of memories. According to theories of memory consolidation, memories are gradually reorganized, becoming supported by widespread, distributed cortical networks, particularly during postencoding periods of sleep. However, the effects of sleep on the organization of memories in the hippocampus itself remains less clear. In a 3-d study, participants encoded separate lists of word-image pairs differing in their opportunity for sleep-dependent consolidation. Pairs were initially studied either before or after an overnight sleep period, and were then restudied in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan session. We used multivariate pattern similarity analyses to examine fine-grained effects of consolidation on memory representations in the hippocampus. We provide evidence for a dissociation along the long axis of the hippocampus that emerges with consolidation, such that representational patterns for object-word memories initially formed prior to sleep become differentiated in anterior hippocampus and more similar, or overlapping, in posterior hippocampus. Differentiation in anterior hippocampal representations correlated with subsequent behavioral performance. Furthermore, representational overlap in posterior hippocampus correlated with the duration of intervening slow wave sleep. Together, these results demonstrate that sleep-dependent consolidation promotes the reorganization of memory traces along the long axis of the hippocampus.","output":"Time-dependent transformations of memory representations differ along the long axis of the hippocampus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic with its need for distancing has necessitated the use of virtual care in never before seen volumes. This review article aims to provide a primer on virtual care for cardiovascular professionals in Canada. The technology to facilitate remote patient interactions is already available but barriers exist. Adequate and effective cardiac virtual care (CVC) must be further developed given the need for rapid evaluation and close ongoing follow-up of patients, as seen in the areas of heart failure management, cardiac rehabilitation, electrophysiology, and hypertension. Many Canadian organizations have published resources to assist healthcare providers and patients navigate the unfamiliar virtual care landscape. While there are concerns surrounding issues such as patient privacy, access to technology, language discrepancies, and billing, these deficits provide opportunities for growth by healthcare organizations and technology companies. The integration of virtual care, home-based devices, and disruptive technologies emphasize the trend towards virtualization of healthcare, with the potential for greater personalization of healthcare interactions and continuity of care. Funding models were rapidly developed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and while some provinces have deemed these changes as permanent, the status from other provinces remains unknown. The foundations to support virtual care as a key modality for healthcare delivery in Canada have been built, and further developments may strengthen its viability as a long-term option.","output":"Deliver Cardiac Virtual Care (CVC) - A Primer for Cardiovascular Professionals in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Halogenated inorganic complexes Ax[MHaly] (A = alkali metal or alkaline earth, M = transition or main group metal, x = 1-3, and y = 2-9) are an archetypal class of compounds that provide entry points to large areas of inorganic and physical chemistry. All of the hexahalo complexes adopt an octahedral, Oh, symmetry (or nearly so). Consequently, one of the bending modes is forbidden in both the infrared and Raman spectra. In the solid state, many of the complexes crystallize in the cubic space group Fm3 m, which preserves the octahedral symmetry. Even for those that are not cubic, the octahedral symmetry of the [MHal6]n- ion is largely retained and, to a good approximation, so are the selection rules. In the present work, we show that by using the additional information provided by neutron vibrational spectroscopy, in combination with conventional optical spectroscopies, we can generate complete and unambiguous assignments for all the modes. Comparison of the experimental and calculated transition energies for the systems where periodic-density functional theory was possible (i.e., those for which the crystal structure is known) shows that the agreement is almost quantitative. We also provide a linear relationship that enables the prediction of the forbidden mode.","output":"Vibrational Spectroscopy of Hexahalo Complexes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The activities performed by Canadian workers in some occupations may increase the risk of exposure to infectious diseases such as COVID\\\\19. This research note explores how occupational exposure risks vary by labor force characteristics using publicly available Canadian data in combination with a data set providing information on the level of physical proximity and frequency of exposure to infections or diseases faced by workers in different occupations. The results show important sociodemographic differences. First, women work in occupations associated with significantly higher average risks of exposure to COVID\\\\19 than men. This is driven by their overrepresentation in high\\\\risk broad occupational categories such as health occupations. Second, older workers (65 years or more), a group vulnerable to COVID\\\\19, appear to work in occupations requiring performing activities characterized by a lower level of physical proximity than their younger colleagues, with minimal differences in the frequency of exposure to diseases or infections. Finally, workers in low\\\\income occupations are employed in occupations that put them at greater risk of exposure to COVID\\\\19 than other workers. This is especially the case for women, immigrants, and members of visible minority groups in low\\\\income occupations.

We validated the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended SARS-CoV-2 assay and analyzed the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and CARVs. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) from 7663 patients were prospectively tested by the Basel S-gene and WHO-based E-gene (Roche) assays in parallel using the Basel N-gene assay for confirmation. CARVs were prospectively tested in 2394 NOPS by multiplex nucleic acid testing, including 1816 (75%) simultaneously for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The Basel S-gene and Roche E-gene assays were concordant in 7475 cases (97.5%) including 825 (11%) SARS-CoV-2 positives. In 188 (2.5%) discordant cases, SARS-CoV-2 loads were significantly lower than in concordant positive ones and confirmed in 105 (1.4%). Adults were more frequently SARS-CoV-2 positive, whereas children tested more frequently CARV positive. CARV coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 1.8%. SARS-CoV-2 replaced CARVs within 3 weeks, reaching 48% of all detected respiratory viruses followed by rhinovirus/enterovirus (13%), influenza virus (12%), coronavirus (9%), respiratory syncytial virus (6%), and metapneumovirus (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Winter CARVs were dominant during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, impacting infection control and treatment decisions, but were rapidly replaced, suggesting competitive infection. We hypothesize that preexisting immune memory and innate immune interference contribute to the different SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology among adults and children.","output":"Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Emergence Amidst Community-Acquired Respiratory Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To achieve the environmental and socio-economic sustainability goals set by the 2030 Agenda, tourist destinations, particularly those that have already reached maturity, have taken steps to change their development model in the short and long term.

Older people with cancer are at significant risk, and outcomes are poor. There is increasing awareness of the effect of psychological distress and social support on pathogenesis and outcomes of delirium in this setting. This review aimed to describe recent research in this evolving area. RECENT FINDINGS Across six recent studies of postoperative delirium in older people with cancer, delirium incidence ranged from 8 to 19.8%. Poor social support and high levels of distress are implicated in the development of postoperative delirium. Distress can be related to negative emotional reaction to diagnosis, preconception of cancer diagnosis and interactions with the healthcare system. Prevention of delirium is key, and multicomponent interventions show evidence of effectiveness. 'Emotional distress' has been included in a new core outcome set for studies of interventions to prevent and/or treat delirium. SUMMARY Postoperative delirium in older adults with cancer is common and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Psychological distress and social support play an important role, but there are many unmet research needs in this area.","output":"Postoperative delirium in older patients with cancer: the role of psychological distress and social support."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Spain is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiologic studies are warranted to improve the disease understanding, evaluate the care procedure and prepare for futures waves. The aim of the study was to describe epidemiologic characteristics associated with hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This real-world, observational, multicenter and retrospective study screened all consecutive patients admitted to 8 Spanish private hospitals. Inclusion criteria: hospitalized adults (age&#8805;18 years old) with clinically and radiologically findings compatible with COVID-19 disease from March 1st to April 5th, 2020. Exclusion criteria: patients presenting negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 during the first 7 days from hospital admission, transfer to a hospital not belonging to the HM consortium, lack of data and discharge against medical advice in emergency departments. RESULTS: One thousand and three hundred thirty-one COVID-19 patients (medium age 66.9 years old; males n= 841, medium length of hospital stayed 8 days, non-survivors n=233) were analyzed. One hundred and fifteen were admitted to intensive care unit (medium length of stay 16 days, invasive mechanical ventilation n= 95, septic shock n= 37 and renal replacement therapy n= 17). Age, male gender, leukocytes, platelets, oxygen saturation, chronic therapy with steroids and treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin were independent factors associated with mortality. The proportion of patients that survive and received tocilizumab and steroids were lesser and higher respectively than those that die, but their association was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Overall crude mortality rate was 17.5%, rising up to 36.5% in the subgroup of patients that were admitted to the intensive care unit. Seven factors impact in hospital mortality.
